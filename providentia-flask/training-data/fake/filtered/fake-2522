Beautiful place with great food and perfect service. We walked in on a rainy night when they were crowded with people trying to get to a show. The Misto Platter is a great sampling dish. Shrimp n Scallop Salad, and OHH the stuffed mushrooms n artichokes. Tried the thin crust pizza, it's crispy thin and was wider than the serving plate, but very good balance of the ingredients. nothing overpowering another. I had veal for my entree: Scalloppine Marsala. Overall a great experience. Â I'd love to come and order off the menu and see what else they have to offer!
