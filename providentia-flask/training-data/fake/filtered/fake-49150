I have dined here many times with my family. Every time was a wonderful experience. The food is amazing, especially the pasta ala vodka and the sweet potato ravioli. The almost famous garlic bread is delicious and every salad they have is tasty. I was there for dinner tonight with my 7 year old son and the waiters and waitresses were wonderful with him. He was so excited when they brought us a bag of biscotti because we had no room for desert. The owners are all very involved with the business and remember that we have been there before. They are always kind and very welcoming. They also gave us a few loaves of their garlic bread which was much appreciated as we love it!! Their food brings us there and the way they are with us makes us keep coming back.
