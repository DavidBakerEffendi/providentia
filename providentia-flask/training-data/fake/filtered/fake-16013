Why doesn't anyone at Taras Bulba speak Ukrainian?  After all, this restaurant is slated as being Ukrainian. Too infused., don't you think?  Taras Bulba was a Ukrainian cossack.  He would truly be displaced at this cafe chain despite the venue display meant to acclimate the passerby's eye as to the authenticity of a Ukrainian dining experience. Too cheesey. They would eat you alive in Brighton Beach! Happy Ukrainian Independence Day! Get real!
