The Village Inn I remember from about 7 years ago has disappeared. I was impressed then, with the new chef/owner who cooked for me and my Mom when we were trying to decide on menu items for my Dad's surprise party in their great party room.  The food was solid, even inspired. Now it seems ripe and ready for a Restaurant Makeover in every way. i dined with my family last night for a special occasion and for sure there were more misses than hits. First, the only  hit: the olive bread was terrific. Hot, plentiful and tasty. We filled up on it because our food was taking so long. Now the misses: It seemed forever for our apps, calamari (just ok), grilled octopus (a few strands of octopus on a dead salad) and my sister SALTY soup special. (she couldn't eat it). When the salads finally came (it seemed like forever, maybe 45 min) we were dismayed to see more soggy mesculun salad dumped on the plate. Why bother is all I can say. Entrees not much better. The salmon special with walnuts and maple was ok. We ate every bite because we were starving, not because it was great. Mine was overcooked. My mother's Sea Bass was a mouthful of fish and lots of mushrooms. She seemed disappointed. My sister's tuna was not sushi grade but was prepared that way. She didn't eat much of it. And finally, the hangar steak was not just inedible, it was a holy mess. I can't even describe the texture of taste without getting upset. Slimy, rubbery, marinated to some otherworldy state.....UGH! It tasted like beef that was preserved in a package. Enough said. All in all, NOT GOOD. We should have known we were in trouble when we asked the waitress what was good and she admitted to not having eaten much of the food there. We got the check and hightailed it out. We won't be back. I guess I could give props to the bartender for making me a nice martini and for the wine list to be reasonably priced, but I am stretching. Oh, and the busboy kept our water glasses full..........
