The ramen is delicious and authentic. Fresh noodles, soft boiled egg done expertly and perfectly. Smooth and silky. Can be ordered hard boiled, too. Pickles and kim chi sides add a spicy touch. Chicken wings need more flavor. Service was excellent, too. By 7:30pm the place was packed and so noisy that we had to shout to hear. Some acoustical additions would soften the echo. One less star due to the noise level. Definitely, a wonderful addition ot our neighborhood.
