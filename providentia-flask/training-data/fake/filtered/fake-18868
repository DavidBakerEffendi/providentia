I can't believe the hype this place gets,I tried the artichoke slice last night and think it's just awful!! A tasteless mess of glop with a few pieces of artichoke on an almost french bread/Chicago crust slice,just thinking about how disappointing this was it really shocks me that people actually like this. I prefer pizza like Joe's Pizza,if you want thick crust try the sicilian,that's pizza. You couldn't convince me to try Artichoke again even if the slice was free,lol. Don't believe the hype.
