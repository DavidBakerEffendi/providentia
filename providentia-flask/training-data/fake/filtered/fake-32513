Il Panino is the best deli in Fairfield. The sandwiches, soups, and salads are all very fresh.  The service is great and fast.  I recommend the grilled chicken barese  which is  grilled chicken, fresh mozzarella, roasted peppers, arugula and balsamic.   I have also been to several parties where the catering was done by Il Panino and the hot food, sandwich platters, and pasta salads were delicious !
