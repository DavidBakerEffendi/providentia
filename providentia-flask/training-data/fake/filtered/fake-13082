Arusuvai Chettinad Indian restaurant is an oasis in the North Brunswick-South Brunswick area.  Many other Indian restaurants that start of serving good food to attract the diners soon deteriorate in food quality for the greed to increase their profits.  But this is not the case with Arusuvai.  I love Indian food and as a frequent diner at Indian restaurants in the New York and New Jersey areas I have experienced consistent food quality and choice at Arusuvai.  Moreover their prices are reasonable giving good value for your money.  Arusuvai has kept its promise of home-style cuisine and they deliver it with a smile.   At Arusuvai you get a good selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes including even fish curry or crab masala.  And their Sambar is done just like how my mother makes and is very delicious.  I am not biased.  I have taken my friends to Arusuvai and they are very pleased with the food quality, service and reasonable prices.  Though, they may want to re-work their Chicken Briyani.  Except for this I enjoy all their other dishes.   I was at Arusuvai on Mother's Day and am I glad that I made the right choice.  I heard of horror stories at one other Indian restaurant in North Brunswick (the name I will not mention here) where they raised their prices for Mother's Day Buffet and cut back on the food choices.  This was not case at Arusuvai.  Even during the busy Mother's Day buffet, Arusuvai was able to manage the diners' palate.  They refilled the food as quickly as the diners were consuming them.  No one had to wait more than a few minutes.   Another important thing for me is the cleanliness of the dinnerware.  Arusuvai provides clean dinner plates, cutleries and drinking glasses.   I would recommend Arusuvai to anyone who wants to experience traditional and authentic Indian cuisine.   Great food and service at reasonable prices and kids eat free!
