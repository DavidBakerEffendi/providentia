I'm french and this is a real french place with real french food. The staff is so friendly and smilling. I had escargot and they tast as good as in a very great french restaurant in France. The same for moules/frites, so perfect! My friends had onion soup and homemade pasta and it was so delicious as well. The prices are great too!!!!! Not overpriced in comparison with the prices we can find in any regular restaurant in France. The interior design is like in a french bistrot, I felt in France being there! And I like the fresh flowers in every tables. They offer us the dessert, Creme brul√©e and sorbet, it was so delicious and friendly from them. I definitly recomand this place!! :D
