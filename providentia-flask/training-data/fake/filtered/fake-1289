I enjoy Rhong-Tiam for its cultural authenticity. The food is delicious. The staff has been getting better through my visits. Pros: Their Thai food is excellent. Especially as far as P-boro standards. Their food is always hot, never warm, lukewarm, or cold. Their staff during dinner is incredibly friendly, very prompt, and very professional. Their table settings are always clean The decor is beautiful Cons: The seating can sometimes be too close during Lunch when there is a huge rush Their lunch staff hovers for a while, and are always awkward Sometimes the restaurant just gets too loud. The waiters often have trouble with English and aren't always able to explain what a dish is. My only negative incident with this restaurant was when I ordered takeout. The food was just not quite as good. Which is OK I guess, considering I did order takeout. I would definitely recommend at least giving this restaurant a chance.
