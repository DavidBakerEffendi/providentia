I love this place! It's the type of place where you just don't have to try to like. It's everything you love about your typical sports bar with an upscale ambiance. The food is amazing and the service as well. It's a great place to go just for a drink and some pool or a Saturday night out. Not to mention if you want to catch tonights game every seat is a good seat in front of a tv. All in all, The Lobby is a great time. Everyone from the customers to the staff to the girls behind the bar are all having a good time and I'm sure you would too!
