The Nutley Diner is great!! Always professional, clean, fast. If you're ordering dinner, they'll sometimes bring you a plate of their in house pickled beets, which are great. If you're lucky, you'll get the waitress with the giant orange teased up hair, bright pink lipstick and long Jersey nails- she really completes the experience. I eat there regularly and get takeout also. Fantastic place! Ps... They serve waffle fries. Enough said!!
