All right, I love Sweet Afton in the evenings for dinner and drinks, so I was thrilled to try them for brunch today. Although the food was good, the service was pretty lousy. When I asked what kind of tea they had, the server wasn't sure and seemed annoyed that I asked because it 'should be on the menu.' I ordered a mug of tea ("probably just normal black or green tea" which is a frustrating response to a legit question--there are so many varieties of tea) and two were brought out to me by the assistant. I had ordered one mug of tea and was sitting alone, waiting for my chronically late friend. When I ordered a grilled cheese with no bacon, a burger was brought out, but the problem was quickly resolved. I was asked if I would like a second cup of tea, which I accepted but then I had to ask for it four times and waited 15 minutes. By the time it got there I was pretty irritated. I know it's just tea, but there wasn't any water on the table either and I was thirsty. After all the problems with service, I guess I was a bit surprised when I was charged for the second cup of tea, though my friend wasn't charged for her second cup of coffee, (which came out immediately). I have been to Sweet Afton several times and know it's a great place normally (try their pickle martini!), which is why it got 3 stars instead of 2 or 1.
