It's around the corner.  I was thrilled to see this little place.  I love it for the small times I go off of my vegan health nut diet.   I like it because it is DIRT CHEAP and tastes better than many places I have been too.  Always cooked promptly and I almost always buy the General Tso's and 2 sides combo platter for less than $8 and the food lasts for two meals for me.
