The wait is definitely worth it! However, I will say the hosts are either rude, aloof, or a combination of the two. They'll call tables when they're not ready, skip to "regulars" first, and take names as they please. Rather annoying the first couple times there, but you get used to it. Food is amazing, so I put up with it. The servers are all friendly with questions and work as quickly as they can, but they seem just overwhelmed at times. They don't check up very often after the food comes out, but there's really much to say when you're mouth is full. The food here is prepared so simply, that's its a wonder why more places don't focus on the quality of the ingredients more. It goes a long way in determining how the food comes out. Did that make sense? Not really much to say, but that you have to come and try it out for yourself. You won't be disappointed. A side note that the some of the fish here is market price, but never unreasonable. For example, the Brazino has ranged anywhere from $26-$34 the times we've been there. And it always been fresh and delicious. I've never had a bad appetizer or entree there. Be sure to try the grilled octopus or calamari!
