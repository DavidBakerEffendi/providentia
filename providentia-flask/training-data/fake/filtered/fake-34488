I heard so much about  Star Tavern through friends and seen the commercial. I wanted to try it out. I called and placed my order over the phone with Amanda. She took my order and when she repeated the order back it was incorrect. I corrected her and she stated it will be ready in half an hour. I get to the place and was in a line that was mixed wih people waiting to be seated and people trying to pick up there order. I speak to Amanda and she tells me the amount and that is not the same price she has given me over the phone.She then repeat the order and it is incorrect. She gave me additude,she stated " well its clear that what i have written when i took the order is correct, why would I write that". I was in shocked to be spoken to in that manner. I asked to speak to a manager. No one came except a waitress. I explained how Amanda messed up my order, and thats when Amanda was cursing throwing her hands up saying" she dont  have to deal with this". I was waiting for my order and Amanda was talking about me to another employee . Thats when I decided to walk out I am upset with the customer service. I will not recommend this place to anyone. I lost my appetite. They provide poor customer service, and should not have people working for there company with that type of additude.
