Our family of 4 had dinner here tonight and can't wait to go back!  The food was all fresh and very good.  3 out of 4 of us are gluten free and were able to eat almost everything on the menu.  It was wonderful to have so many options.  Clean eating and farm fresh - so happy to have this here in Montclair and hope it sticks around.  The Vital Sampler was everyone's favorite and it was hard to choose which item and dip we liked best.  The restaurant is beautiful and we liked the music, although it was just slightly too loud for our conversation.  They were all very friendly and service was great, although a little on the slow side.  Looking forward to many more meals here!
