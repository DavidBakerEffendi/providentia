I was there last sat night and had one of the best fish tacos in my life, great dish for non-meaters like me who survive on seafood and vegetables. The beer list is amazing, there is a beer description on the beer list for non beer drinkers like me who want to experiment on beers. So I opted to have the flight and a pint of the Allagash white. The waitress was very knowledgeable with the beers that they had and helped my along with my flight selection. Good Job! The only reason why I'm not giving this place 5 stars was because I did have to wait about 45 mins for my fried fish tacos to come out. That wait was a little too long for fries and fried fish tacos to come. This place is has a great atmosphere for people who just want to chill, eat and drink without the old city party crew. But if you are in a rush to eat, I would recommend you go to a fast food joint, apparently great food takes time.
