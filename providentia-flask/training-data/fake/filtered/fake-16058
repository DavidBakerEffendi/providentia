Fresh, excellent buffet presented, weighed food. Though I live in Bloomfield City, I take a bus and frequent the restaurant. I enjoy the food there because not only is it tasty but portion size is I find easier to control, based on a weight, presently of $5.25 per pound. With very little difficulty one can well estimate less than a pound in serving oneself.      Pages is for me therefore both nourishing and economical.
