Love eataly, I get all my organic food in here with a little time love to stop by for a pizza. The ambience it's great without leaving NY for a sec. They also have the eataly cook yourself classes which I tried them but seems to be too expensive for the actual experience. $125 per class? I could take my fianc√© to a fancy restaurant with that money. Overall, good and nice place.
