The food here was really good - they nailed the Nashville style hot-chicken!  The slaw was a little odd, hard to say, but at least it wasn't so sweet it was like a dessert.  The bourbon cake was amazing!  The only thing I felt was really out of place was that they don't carry their food ethic over to their bar.  They're all about natural, local, high quality food ingredients, but the bar is selling overly sweet, watered down, cheap neon artificially flavored liquor.  Go for the food - skip the bar.
