Decent southern comfort food, but probably does not live up to all the hype.  We shared the fried chicken, fried catfish and black eyed peas.  The chicken was crunchy, yet tender although a little on the underseasoned side.  Ditto catfish.  I prefer pan fried chicken @ Country Panfried Chicken - it's worth the trek uptown.
