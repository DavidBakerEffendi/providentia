Hands down, the best diner in the United States of America. Any food that you can possible imagine (or even spontaneously create) is in the extensive menu. I have never ordered something here that I did not like. The hours are excellent, especially on the weekends. The service is great. Portions are enough to last you into two or three meals, and prices are accordingly very affordable. After having left the North Jersey area after 7 years, I once came back from a vacation and landed in Newark Airport. Despite landing in the middle of the night and cutting close to closing time at the diner, I was sure to pay a visit here after a year from my leave. I am sure that I will continue to pay visits to this place every time that I have the opportunity to do so.
