My friend and I decided to try this restaurant because of its menu. Who knew that would be the beginning and the end. To begin with the service was simply atrocious. My friend was given everything he ordered - appetizer and main course - at the same time. I was told I had to wait for the tofu appetizer I ordered as it needed time to make. I have ordered agadashi tofu at other places, this is the first time I had ever heard that. And it really was not worth the wait. Then I was told that the main course I had ordered was given to another table by mistake and that they would need another 10-15 minutes to make another one for me. And that was that.
