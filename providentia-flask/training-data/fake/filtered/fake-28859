At the risk of repeating the glowing adjectives that have already been used to describe La Slowteria, I just have to put my two cents in: this place is really that good. Amazing food: creative, fun and complex while avoiding frilliness. Flavors are fresh and dishes delicious. Super friendly team, on the floor and in the kitchen. Happy to accomodate vegetarians! Great atmosphere, every time we've been: weekend brunch with the kids and evening date nights. Go! Enjoy!!
