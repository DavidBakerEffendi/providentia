Yum! Go here for the sushi. It has very little rice - just one layer on top of the seaweed and is very large and filling. The only special roll I got was the Iron Man roll which is highly recommended - banana tempura...mmmm.... It was massive and required 2 bites. The waitresses were very friendly and quick to refill water and bring the check.
