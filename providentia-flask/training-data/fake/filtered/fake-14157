I have a new favorite sushi place in town! Bleu Sushi was exactly what I was looking for. The other night my girlfriend and I went out in center city looking for a new sushi place to try, when we stumbled upon Bleu Sushi. We were very happy with the service and the ambiance upon entering the restaurant. The staff was extremely accommodating and the interior was intimate. We had a lovely dinner- excellent sushi and dumplings. The owner greeted our table and was very hospitable, making the experience all that much more intimate. I look forward to eating there again in the future and ordering takeout. Additionally I was impressed with the value and the quality. Excellent food for a great price, without out any attempts to nickel and dime you. Bleu Sushi is as good as it gets!
