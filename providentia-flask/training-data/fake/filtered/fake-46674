So, my overall experience was a bit like the review by Maya S from 1/6/2014.  Overall, the food was very good.  However, I had two experiences here that left a bad impression.  One, quite common these days, another, was a first for me. First, the waitress forgot the 2 glasses of wine we ordered.  When we reminded her of it, she sort of made us feel like it was somehow our fault for not reminding her earlier. Second, and this is the 'first', maybe about 10 minutes after we sat down, but before we ordered, a waiter brought a plate with warm bread and a bowl of hummus and a spoon.  He put it right next to my 4 year old daughter, before we'd had a chance to wash her hands from a day out and about in the city, picked up the bread, dragged her knife across it, and started to pull it apart.  At this point, a waiter came over and I could tell he realized he'd taken it to the wrong table.  It was indeed not a 'free appetizer'.....Remember, it was a place where dinner for the 4 of us was $100 including tip and two of the four people were not over 6 years old!  Do you think he? 1)  Intimated that it was a mistake, but just left it and didn't dwell on it. 2)  Told us it was mistake, said it was on the house this time, but was a mistake. 3)  Told us it was a mistake, taking it back to the kitchen leaving us to wonder what they did with it. 4)  Told us it was a mistake and simply took it and put it on the correct table, one table away. You've probably already guessed #4.  So, for a $6 plate of food, that probably costs them somewhere around $1 I will for sure not be going back to this place.  And, if you were there on Sunday the 12th and had the hummus and break as a appetizer, well, you might also want to reconsider!  In today's world where experiences can be posted on social media in a matter of seconds, taking 'used food' from one table to the next to save $6 in revenue seems ill-advised!  Having said that, the food was pretty good.
