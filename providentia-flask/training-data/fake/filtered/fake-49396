While the service and the drinks are usually top notch the food is somewhat lackluster... Don't get me wrong, they're guacamole is great and they have some tasty options, but after that there menu is boring... I have been many times over the years and most recently two Thursday's ago. Had a few blood orange Margs and the fajitas for two... Which I must say has never let me down. Plenty of food for two very hungry ppl and enough toppings to keep you interested . ( they will refill if you ask bc there is usually not enough, sometimes i was charged and sometimes I was not). Overall Starr puts on nice show, but I just wish they would change there menu more often.
