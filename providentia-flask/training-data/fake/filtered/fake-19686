Peaches serves a version of "southern" food, not soul food, but the expected fare that one would find in the south in your average cafe or neighborhood restaurant. The food ranges from adequate to good for selected dishes (try the gumbo or the Â pulled pork hash (brunch)). Service is spotty at best. There are times when it is a guessing game as to who is your actual server. It seems the staff and management are more impressed with working there than considering the customers needs. Actually, this attitude carries over to their other locations as well. One word of warning: If you are interested in having an early dinner (say between 5 and 6 p.m.) better call first. My wife and I made the mistake twice in the past month of stopping by after getting off of the A train at Utica around 5:30 p.m. Both times there was a message taped to the door saying they would be opening around 7 p.m. There was no apologies for the inconvenience, much less an explanation. Nothing puts customers off more than a restaurant that doesn't follow its own schedule.
