OBSESSED with this place! Had the biscuit and egg sandwich for breakfast, and it was divine. Eggs were delicious, and the toasted biscuit bun was perfect. By far the cutest sandwich bread I've ever had. Decor is really cute and fun inside, albeit a bit intimidating from the outside. Owner/chef is super friendly. Also ordered the ben-yays....but have to say they were probably a waste of calories on a fat-lazy-sunday. Can't wait to return for the actual sandwiches.
