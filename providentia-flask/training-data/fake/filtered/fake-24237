Cute place. I got a cappuccino and a slice of one of the quiches of the day (zucchini, basil, goal cheese, pepper...and more!).  Service was acceptably speedy. The quiche ($5) was delicious.  I have no familiarity with French cuisine, so I don't know if it was a "French" quiche, but I do know it was fluffy and fresh (not dense and hard like some quiches).  The cappuccino was yummy (good coffee), served on the wet (more steamed milk) side. The place is a sit-down cafe (so plan on a tip).  While I'm pretty sure people can come in and get coffee to go, most everyone I saw came in and sat down for coffee and breakfast.  The tables were the stereotypical circle cafe tables...I'd think things could get cramped in terms of table space and in terms of leg/chair space if you have two tall people or three 3 at a table (especially since I only really saw 1 medium-sized table). That aside, I'm definitely putting this place on my list of places to go for weekend coffee.  Come early, since I got the vibe that things get/stay hopping for weekend breakfasts/lunches.
