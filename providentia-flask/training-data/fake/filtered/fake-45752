I really want to show this charming little Italian café some love and you should too! It's exactly what the neighborhood was missing: an authentic café that carters to each and every one of your cravings! * For breakfast have a cappuccino and chocolate croissant. This combo is out of this world. The coffee is bold and flavorful and their pastries are delicious. It is made on the premises and if you are lucky enough when you take a bite it will be warm and crunchy. The absolute best chocolate croissant in the city! * For lunch order #14 (Chicken Schnitzel) or #9 (Prosciutto Cotto and add some fresh Mozzarella to top it off!) I promise that both of these gourmet sandwiches will hit the spot! * For dinner choose the Fettuccine alla Bolognese or the Pasta with Pesto both are genuine Italian recipes that will satisfy your craving for homemade pasta. The food is simply amazing; all the ingredients are fresh. I eat at this place on average twice a week, the staff is extremely friendly and surprisingly the Italian owner/chef cooks each and every dish. I think I am in love...
