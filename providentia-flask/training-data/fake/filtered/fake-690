I had recently heard about this gem. I was hungry for lunch while at work and decided to order. There is a great menu with many choices. The atmosphere is very friendly. And the fantastic smells greet you at the door. I chose the California and the BBQ. Both excellent choices. I fancy myself as a hot dog snob, and these definetly lived up to my highest expectations. Delicious and cooked perfectly. I am so glad there is something like this in the area of Yale University and Yale Hospital. I inquired about the ingredients. Hummels, and all top notch toppings and choices!!! You can't go wrong here. Good luck Cory, you've hit a home run.
