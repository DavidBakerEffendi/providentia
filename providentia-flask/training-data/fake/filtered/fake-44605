I had the opportunity to dine at Locanda Verde during a stay at the Greenwich Hotel. I thought it would be trendy beyond belief but it was actually really warm, the staff was really kind, we got a reservation without a problem (could be because we were staying at the hotel) and we really enjoyed the food. We shared the roasted chicken for two which was the best chicken I ever ate and the pastas were really amazing. We loved the meat balls as well. Homey and hip at the same time. A little pricey but you could taste the quality.
