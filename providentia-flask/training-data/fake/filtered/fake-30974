I will say the burgers are great but why can't any restaurant train their staff correctly?   We have been here a couple of time and the other night we sat for almost 10 minutes before someone took our drink order.  Then the waitperson couldn't answer the basic questions about the menu.  Didn't know the price of the specials, didn't know anything about their wines.  I am getting used to this but after working for years in the restaurant business, I am not happy about it.
