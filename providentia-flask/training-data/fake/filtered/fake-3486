My wife and I were in Philadelphia recently and read that Sam's Morning Glory was a must-try breakfast-brunch eatery. The location is kind of strange. It's in a very residential area. It's also quite small in size which is fine. Adds some charm to it. However, the service was a little slow though the waiter seemed like he was in a hurry. While waiting for the meal to arrive, we had time to see all the awards that Sam's has won over the years including numerous accolades by Zagat. But we felt it was a tad overhyped compared to Sabrina's Cafe which was more intimate and tasty. We also had better service at Sabrina's. At Sam's, you got the impression that they wanted you in and out pretty quickly. Also, they only accept cash which is an inconvenience since 99% of all restaurants today operate on debit, credit, and cash. If you're visiting Philadelphia, I'd say skip Sam's and head to Sabrina's instead. Another great option is a small Dutch breakfast spot inside the Reading Terminal market.
