Oh Baby. This place is enough to give anyone the blues. Last time I was there for lunch with coworkers, the server spilled another table's beer on me, and wouldn't give us a discount on the meal, even though I complained to the manager. We went back today hoping things would be different, and I did in fact stay dry. Just like the ribs. Lunch took nearly an hour from the time when we sat down to get our food (from arrival to exit, 1 hour and 45 minutes), and when it did come, it was terrible. I ordered the Razorback: 1/3 rack of baby back ribs and pulled pork with creamed spinach. The ribs, as mentioned, were dry and tasteless, and it took prodigious amounts of sauce to give them some character. On the other hand, the pulled pork was watery to the point of being unpalatable, and had the consistency of oatmeal. I actually ended up squishing it with my fork to squeeze out some of the liquid. When I was done, there was a pool of water on my plate. Gross. If you're looking for BBQ in Philly, do yourself a favor and find a locally-owned spot, not a chain. Given the quality of other BBQ places in this town, you could do a lot better.
