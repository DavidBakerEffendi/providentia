I have been meaning to check Juniors out for months but never had the time to go.  I went Saturday night and was really impressed.  I had the Lobster Roll.  It was $19.95, but I must say the Roll was quite meaty and succullent and served on Challah toast.  It came with a red skinned potato salad. Both were excellent. I had the raspberry swirl cheesecake for desert.  Very rich and creamy.  Just right !!! All in all a great experience.  Try to sit with server Randy, he is the best !!!
