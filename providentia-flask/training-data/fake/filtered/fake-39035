Food is great, staff and service are horrible. I have been a number of times and each time its the same thing. Today I went there for lunch and it took over 20 minutes to get a to go order. The place needs new managment to help with time efficiency. Â The poor girl waiting next to me didnt even know if she would have time to eat before her lunch break was over. The managment kept walking by and said nothing, not even an apology for the wait. I rate only two stars for the lack pf service and poor management. The food as I said is good quality but only if you have all the time in the world to wait for it.
