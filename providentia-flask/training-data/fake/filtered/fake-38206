Greek Lady has been a go to place for me and my friends because it is so convenient and the food is amazing. It also has such a variety of food that I can always find something I am in the mood for. I especially love their omelets for brunch and their salads and gyros for lunch and dinner. There is also the fact that the staff is so friendly and the service is really good. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a casual place that has great food.
