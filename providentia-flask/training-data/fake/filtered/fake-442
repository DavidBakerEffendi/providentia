My favorite Sushi place in Philadelphia. It is kinda of small, but the decor is nice and the service is fantastic. I have never had a problem getting a reservation here, and it is in a really nice section of the city. The fact that it is BYOB helps to make the dining experience a little less expensive. Here is a review of some of the food options I have tried: Appetizers Edamame: it is good as it should be. Not an overly complicated dish, and I would assume it would actually be a challenge to mess up. But, it was not overly salty or too dried up which happens when I order it at some other restaurants. Tuna Pizza: By far the BEST appetizer on the menu. This is a must when dining at this restaurant. It is extremely flavorful and filled with plenty of fresh tuna. Spring Roll: Wasn't the most impressive appetizer on the menu. It tasted good, but I have definitely had better. Specialty Rolls All of the rolls I have had at this restaurant have ranged from decent to amazing. This is how I would rank several of the rolls I've had more than once: 1. Flaming Dragon Roll 2. Volcano Roll 3. Mexican Roll 4. Rainbow Roll 5. Alaska Roll
