Oh, dear. It's been forever and a day since I've been here, but we got tickets to shows two nights in a row so - against my better judgement - we braved the NEW theater district and have been hitting up some new places and old haunts. Joe's is pretty much the same as it ever was - stupid tourists come for the burgers, but everyone who knows, knows it's about the liver. Packed with my gays and - honestly - what a relief. Nice to overhear some interesting conversation from people who are reading the New Yorker and not talking about American Idol. Couple of queens at the bar mincing it up with the cutie bartender. Felt like the old days. The only thing missing was the haze of smoke and those wonderful ashtrays. Ah, life: you are too fleeting. I love Joe's.
