This was the first gluten-free restaurant I discovered after being diagnosed with celiac disease. It's my favorite partly for that reason, but my review isn't about sentimentality. The gluten-free food is very good. I've been here a number of times, and have tried just about everything on the menu, including bowls of risotto, regular and Sicilian pizza, and sandwiches. I love the GF breadsticks that come with each meal, and have taken dessert items to go, such as cookies. Overall, there are good flavors and textures, and the bread-y items have a nice level of moisture without falling apart. That's important with gluten-free foods. Risotteria also serves gluten-free beer.
