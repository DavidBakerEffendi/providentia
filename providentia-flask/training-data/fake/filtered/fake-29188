This place is excellent! Very cool atmosphere, with unique touches here and there.  It is a small place; fits around 50 people.   We ordered drinks first.  I got the pink squirrel- which was fantastic.  I forgot what my fiance ordered but it was excellent.  It took several minute to make them which we appreciated because we know that we were getting a great drink.  We started off with the lobster cobb salad.  It was out of this world.  They mixed together avocado and wasabi (I think) and made it like a mousse.  They gave a very good portion of lobster meat on top.  We always share it was hard to this time ! Then for dinner my fiance ordered the Chicken pot pie.  He would never order something like this, nor eat it but since this was the talk about the restaurant he went for it.  He was blown away by it.  It came 10 inches high of a puffed pastry shell.  He poked it with his fork and got a facial with the steam released! The chicken was cooked just right and the vegetables were so tasty.   I ordered the duck-o boy! It was by far the best duck I ever had! It was seasoned just right and cooked to perfection. For dessert, we ordered the Belgium chocolate cake.  It was so delicious.  I know you are thinking how did we have room for this but 1- we can eat- and 2- the portions are just the right size- not too small and not ginormous- just right.   I had two drinks and the man had three.  So we had a FANTASTIC meal and were feeling very good at the end of the night! I definitely recommend the Orange Squirrel!
