By far the best of the Family Style Italian restaurants in the city. Great Southern Italian cuisine...it's all about the sauce. Take a date, take your boss, take your family...they'll love you for it. I bring clients here all the time. The food is amazing, the atmosphere jumping, and it's a great place to make a memory. The meatballs and sausage platter will drive you insane.
