Aside from the Archie Bunker facade and the Miller Beer Neon sign, this pizzeria is my pride and joy of NYC pizza at it's best. Their sausage is unbeaten, and the rest of their toppings are pretty straight forward.  The pies are smaller, but I usually order 2 for a table of 3-4 peeps.  The paper plates are the coolest, and the service is great.  Try the awesome spicy Scungilli as a wonderful side, if you favor shellfish. What amazes me the most about this place is it's ability to cross over from a pretty hefty machismo neighborhood pub to a fun family pizza joint where kids of all ages never feel out of place.
