A bunch of us stopped in here for dinner one night and we are all foodies for the most part: I'll start off by saying the atmosphere in this place is so cool! I absolutely loved it. The food is farm to table - so all very natural, organic options and even a good selection of vegetarian options. Myself and my fianc√© ordered the squash soup (amazing) and the chicken (also amazing). My sister ordered the Fettucini and my cousin ordered the parsnip "steak" - both, again, excellent. The service was fantastic and all of the waitstaff was extremely informed and knowledgeable about the foods that were on the menu. Very impressive. One slight minor downfall was it did take us a while to get our meal - from the time we finished our soup to the time we got our meal it had been about 40 minutes. It was worth the wait and I know sometimes kitchens get behind. It wouldn't stop me from coming back. Hope more places like this in Hartford start popping up - excellent!!
