the management here is a joke.   Happy hour,  ordered 2nd round of drinks 4 min before 7pm (end of happy hour).  told after drinks were brought that bar closed happy hour 15 minutes ago on BAR TIME (not clock time).   Also had gift certificates and was told we could only use two on a group of four having dinner.   We had bar drinks, soup and meals yet the manager came to our table to explain how he was loosing money on our bill if we used our certificates.     The food,  not that bad but as others have said, the seafood was a bit on the OLD side (fishy and rubbery).   For what we paid ($170 for four people) I would not have expected the problems we had on happy our and using gift cirtificates.  Will I ever be back?  NO.
