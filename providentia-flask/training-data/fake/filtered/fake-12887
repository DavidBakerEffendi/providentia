Amazing food.   Very traditional. Not fancy. Only 5 tables in the place. Looks very clean and brightly lit. Most tacos come on two small corn tortillas, stuffed full!  (I really only need to order one taco from now on, because it is actually two). They served us homemade chips and homemade salsa. Both were the best i've ever had. My boyfrined got the goat, and the pork tacos.  They were amazing. I got the chorizo which was very good, but very greasy. I also got the chicken taco, which was my favorite.   The only downside is they have no alcohol.
