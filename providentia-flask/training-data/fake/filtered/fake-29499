I always loved go here to eat, Â the food is so good and they always give large portions. Only thing is long wait for tables on holidays and Sundays. But it's worth it for the quality of food. Service is ok, no complaints really. And it is alittle cramped in space. I highly recommend the honey fried chicken.
