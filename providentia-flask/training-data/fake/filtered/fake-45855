My wife an I were terribly disappointed with our meal and the overall restaurant experience.  First off the restaurant is small, loud and has a hectic vibe, very young and inexperienced wait staff.  The food was average, edible but not great.  We had the porterhouse for 2 which we ordered medium rare.  When it was presented to our table it was overcooked and got to medium well with a grayish color in a few minutes.  We decided to eat it as opposed to sending it back, we did complain and our waitress said they might take off a few of the sides.  The house salad was a joke, the sides were just okay.  We had the mussels and a combo coconut shrimp and scallops for appetizers, which were ok, the fried food was a little greasy.   Overall, we spent $130 and would never go back, Ruth's Chris blows this place away.  Our waitress was very nice, but every time she served us, she reached across our table and into our faces.   My opinion stay away, go to Ruth's Chris or any other well established steak house.  I also got sick later in the evening and spent quite a bit of time in the bathroom..
