I love greek/mediterranean food but i have to say that this place is alright.  It definitely does not deserve 4 or 5 stars. Our food took forever to come out.  Getting the bill was like asking for gold. That took 15 minutes in itself.  It really shouldn't be that hard.  I know they're busy but still.   The food was good but not great.  Their portions were great, definitely enough to fulfill an hungry person.  I'll have to have some of their seafood next time and see what I think about them.
