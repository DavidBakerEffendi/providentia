Cute atmosphere.  Neighborhood service.  Great beer, wine and food. Looks like Upstate has just opened.  It was packed last night when I was there. Small cozy place that is very comfortable.  Great selection of unusual draft beers and wines.  No menu yet, but the knowledgeable staff makes a menu unnecessary.  Mostly fresh seafood, with interesting presentations and wonderful flavors.  Go for the oysters. It still needs a sign, but you can not miss it, right next door to an Indian place that has more Christmas lights than the tree at Rockefeller Center. I will go back.  Maybe become a regular.
