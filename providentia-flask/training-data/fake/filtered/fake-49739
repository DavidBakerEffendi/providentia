Took the family to Union square area to enjoy the nice weather this weekend and happen to stumble into this gem for opening day! The decor and ambiance is unheard of for a fast food restaurant - simple... clean... relaxing! Food was delicious++ we had Kebob Laffa, Veggie pita and Shawarma pita - best pita sandwiches we had in NYC so far. We shared a French toast pita sandwich for dessert... out of this world!!! -- Toasted pita bread, covered with Silan (which is "date honey" - beats maple syrup) loaded with fresh berries and vanilla ice-cream.... yum..um..mm! We'll be back for more...
