I think this place was just fantastic. Friendly atmosphere, good sake, fresh, well-prepared food, big portions. Great big slices of fish, delicate tempura. We definitely look forward to returning. Try the sushi combos you won't believe how much sushi you get for $32. The tuna tataki was amazing and so fresh...Hope they do well! The listing here has the wrong address or they moved, it's 28 Central and the DO have a bar. (Yay!)
