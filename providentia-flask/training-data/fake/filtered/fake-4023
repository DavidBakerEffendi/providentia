This place is great! I Can't believe I've lived in the Somerset area for over a year an never tried this place until now! My husband suggested we order after we went online to find this was one of the only few privately owned "authentic" Pizza places that deliver. Can I tell you first of all,  the food was delivered piping hot and VERY fast less then a half hour for a pretty complex order!  I had the Ziti which came with a nice size salad & dressing and a nice warm loaf of sliced bread (YUM!!) all for a really cheap price. I made sure to tip well when I saw the delivery guy was a cute old Italian man looking like he needed to rest in an office somewhere. Kudos to you delivery man!!! Last but not least the food was great!!! we LOVED the pizza and even though I have yet to find a place that compares to my hometown BROOKLYN pizza this place was sure as heck close to it!!  Delivery is best or take out. The restaurant is definitely outdated and old looking nothing I'm not used to living in BROOKLYN!!
