If I could give no stars I would have done so. Came here on a Sunday night with 3 of my friends after the Made In America festival. They didn't close until 2 AM and we were hungry so we decided to check them out. When we walked in the guy at the door welcomed us and walked us to a table and as we were about to sit down a lady came out from behind the counter and told him to stop. She talked to him in Chinese and then turned us and said "No, no more" and refused to serve us and proceeded to kick us out. They had PLENTY of free tables and we came in here around midnight.. How can you have no more when you close at 2? How this place has a 4 star review I don't understand.
