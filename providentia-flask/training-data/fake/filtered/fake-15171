I went to Room Service few months ago . we found this place accidently looking for another restaurant in this aria and let me tell you .... I loved it !!! the food was so delicious and beautifully decorated ! I can't wait to go there for more! I'm getting hungry even now just by thinking about it !!I do have little complain about the service but I can get over it since everything else was so perfect :) hopefully next time we get better server who wants to pay little more attention
