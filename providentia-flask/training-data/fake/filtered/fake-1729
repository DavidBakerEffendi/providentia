My first time to Blue Ribbon was back in 1996.. wow.. and I went back last week and loved it just the same. It's chic, romantic yet not stuffy, and has a sort of underground feel to it.. which you probably feel more when stopping by after the club at 3am. The food is amazing: everything from the mussels, calamari, steak, chicken and the deserts.. fuggetaboutit. YUM. Yes it's expensive but it's worth the splurge. 13 years after going to Blue Ribbon for the first time, I still love them.
