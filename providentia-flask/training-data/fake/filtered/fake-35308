I am trying to love this place, really I am, but I just can't get past like. A lot of effort was put into creating the space, and it looks very cool, but its not very comfortable for patrons.  For example the chairs are custom-made but not very comfortable and all but impossible to move. The ambience overall is very dark and maybe a tad uninviting. I can't decide if the gigantic fish tank is mesmerizing or just distracting.   The tap beer selection is vast, and yet it is very esoteric and sometimes I have a hard time finding even one beer that I like. Maybe I'm coming here too often but the music is a bit repetitive, would like more variety there. The late night food option is great for the nabe and I give their food two thumbs ups.
