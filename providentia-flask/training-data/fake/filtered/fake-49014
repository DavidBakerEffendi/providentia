I think Piora had an off night... The food was excellent.  We had the monkey bread, tuna crude, rigatoni, and sea trout.  All were really delicious. Unfortunately though, we waited something like 45 minutes between the first and second course.   The staff was very upfront about the wait in the kitchen, and as a result they showered us with free booze, dessert, and a cheese tray.  This was a nice touch, but after sitting down at 830 and leaving at nearly 11:30, we were kind of over it.  Free dessert only goes so far when you have to wait for it nearly 20 minutes too! Hopefully its a fluke - the space is beautiful and the food was really good.
