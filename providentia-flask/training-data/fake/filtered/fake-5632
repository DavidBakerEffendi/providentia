I hosted a dinner for a bachelorette party here and things couldn't have gone better. The manager Katie worked with me to come up with a prefix menu and was extremely prompt in all of her responses to my [several] emails leading up to the evening. One may not think of this as an ideal place to fit a party of 14 for dinner, which is what made the entire evening so impressive. I was sure that no matter how much I planned, there would be some sort of hiccup in the execution. This was not at all the case. Every last detail was delivered and everything was presented beautifully and tasted delicious. The waffle fries, cheesesteak waffle and the mac and cheese were big winners across the board. Our server Sarah was an absolute delight. She was laid back, attentive, friendly, and handled our big group like a pro. She had our order starting when we arrived and we probably waited 20 minutes before our [giant] meal was delivered. Timing was perfect. Â There was never a water glass empty or a need not filled immediately. After our meal, she gave us time to sit and digest and chat before rushing out with a dessert. Our chocolate cocktails--served with dessert--were absolutely incredible (definitely my favorite part of the meal) and the chocolate pizza was great as well. If they can knock it out of the park for a party of 14, I would say it's definitely a place worth your while. It's the perfect spot for a girls night out. If I lived in the area, I would go there regularly just for dessert cocktails. Side note: branding and graphics are incredibly modern and appealing.
