My friend was invited by the owner who he met earlier in the day. So we decided to give it a try. I would love to tell you how good the food was but that would require service. We literally were seated for 15 minutes before we called someone over to be told that she was not our server. Unbelievable! After another 10 minutes we just left. I would not recommend any one going there if you like service. There are too many restaurants in the area to choose that provide quality service. Oh by the way, who Â understand they are a service business and their purpose is to offer food and beverages. Terrible!!!
