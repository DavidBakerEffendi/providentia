On May 14th, we went to Dosai Place to celebrate my in-law's brithday and chose to go Indian rather than OIive Garden, much against the kids' suggestion and boy were we wrong.   For a Sunday afternoon, there were exactly two men managing the entire show and were simply incapable of managing the exactly 4 tables that were occupied by various customers.   To begin with: - There was no one to professionally greet us and welcome us - We sat at a table that wobbled terribly - The menu is pricey for the type and kind of dosas we expected (Saravana Bhavan at Oak Tree....is so much better for similar south indian fare) - The service is slow and we had to take the water jugs from the other tables - Server Abhinav could not manage to hold on to the plates and dropped a couple on his way in and out of the kitchen - The final straw was the automatic gratuity of $11.78 on an other food bill of $65.42. Needless to say I would not recommend this as a place to consider for south indian food.   I was at table 11 with 6 people at 8.20 pm.
