When I moved to town a few months ago, my little brother said that I should try out this diner--he said that it's his favorite. Being a trusting sister, I took him at his word, and stopped in with a friend a few Fridays ago while our laundry was going across the street. Long story short: PRO: Waitresses were amazing, food was delicious (you should've seen my omelet--so big and fluffy), coffee bottomless (although cups are all different sizes, so I'd ask for the biggest to get the most bang for your buck), servers AMAZING (whoops said that already), really close to Church Street. CON: Owner was Facebook creeping at counter, absolutely ugly decor (framed fabric? ugh), front entrance clearly meant to be something else (looks like a hoarder was put in charge of it--what's with all the pointless plates? Or having bakery cases and bakery signs and NO BAKED GOODS?), very very large group of creepy guys at table in entrance room. All in all, I liked this place alright. My favorite part was definitely the waitresses--they both made my friend and I feel welcome, and like we'd be greeted back like friends if we ever came back. That's definitely a plus! Go here if you're a fan of omelets done right!
