More than we were looking for! After a long plane trip from our home in Oregon, my wife and I were just looking for a light meal close to our downtown hotel. What we found at The Quick Fixx was amazing fresh made pasta, creative dishes and a terrific build your own choice menu. Portions were generous and the staff was all very friendly and helpful. A much better meal than we expecting tonight.
