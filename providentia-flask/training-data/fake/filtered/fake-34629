We went here recently and loved it. The waitress was very friendly which was a plus. The food was cooked fast and tasted great. I have only been here a few times but every time has been great. Their homemade toast is awesome! We love their breakfast Â items. No it is not a fancy place, but a great place for a home cook meal. Good eats.
