Food-Thought it was just average. Could get this type of Italian in a number of restaurants around the area. Nothing really overwhelmed me. Burrata salad nice, the double cut pork chop special with veg salad was nice but both are just standards. Service- was really poor. We had to ask for water refills and wine refills many times. The kitchen got swamped too. It seems like they get one big hit at 7 and with tables outside it adds way too much for kitchen to handle. We had 7:30 res for party of 6. We got our entrees at 9:30. Bad front of the house management killed the kitchen. Ambiance- love the french doors. Added a wonderful breeze throughout the night. Hated the lighting. Made the place really dark and difficult on the eyes. Overall, I'd pass on return visit.
