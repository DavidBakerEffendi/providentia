This is the kind of place poor folks go to because they think this is how the rich folks roll. NOPE. This joint looks to be patronized as some kinda hot destination by those who just don't know no better. Why? Because the menu is barely superior to that of a midtown diner. Thus the natives reduce their taste to that of the icky tourists.
