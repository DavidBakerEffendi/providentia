I have been to over 2000 restaurants around the world and now I am going to officially start weighing in because I love good food, good service, fantastic atmospheres and the intangibles. When I say PA I mean Pink Approved this indicates a 4-STAR or better rating and is my way of saying thank you. Minetta Tavern is one of m favorite restaurants in the world and is definitely PA. The highlights for me include the dry aged cote de boeuf, the black label burger, the french dip (one of the top 2-3 french dips in NY) and the frites. The Cote de Boeuf -- cooked to exactly the right level of pink inside with a crispy outside, the meat (which I last had on New Year's Eve in 2010) was juicy, tender and easy to cut. The outside was just the right level of brown and the bone marrows were decadent. I would give this 4 STARS and recommend it for any special occasion (it comes in at $124 in and of itself) BlacK Label Burger -- Last had this for brunch last weekend. It is quite simply my current favorite burger. it is made with several types of meat, is cooked exactly as requested (for me medium rare) and sits on the bun with a controlled volume of delicious juices. I am a big fan and would recommend this to any burger fan or even for those that would not normally try a burger because this is outstanding. 4.5 STARS. French Dip -- the bun is amazing in combination with the juicy roast beef and the au jus is an amazing balance of salt and juice and combines well with the bun and roast beef. 4.5 STARS Service -- service is generally fantastic and they treat me like royalty (I assume this is true of most people) so it is difficult to find fault. I would say that it is not perfet but anytime I go they give me a warm welcome, consistent service at my table and answer questions promptly and with consistency and depth. Minetta Tavern a PA gem in the Village. Thank you Keith! Pink
