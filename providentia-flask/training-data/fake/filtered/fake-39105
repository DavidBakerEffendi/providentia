Stumbled upon this place during a bike ride that i took to hopefully lift my spirits after a tough day. The instant you enter upon this space, your spirit is over-whelmed with certainty. Certainty that you will have comfortable, friendly service, a spot-on caffeine fix, and some of the best pastries you'll come across. The atmosphere and the garden are just captivating. Truly made my bad day turn into a GREAT day :) GRAZIE, job well done Milk and Roses!
