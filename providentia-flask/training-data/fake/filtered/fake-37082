I miss this place !!! In Vegas now and really wish I wasn't. It has without a doubt the BEST chicken savoy, & ziti EVER !!!!! anyone who doesn't appreciate this NJ favorite should be doomed to eat the food of West coast forever!!!! Shame on anyone who dares give the Belmont Tavern a bad review. God Bless Stretch and the Belmont !!!!!!!!
