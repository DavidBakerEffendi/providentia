Food was good.... Service was horrible!! I don't think I will ever go back. Spent $$$ to be treated like I wasn't even a customer there. Took forever to get drinks and 45 minutes to get a check.. Almost just walked out... Maybe I should have.. I wouldn't be surprised if customers haven't already done this... Way to lose $$$ Freddy and Tony's.. And you can thank your servers!!
