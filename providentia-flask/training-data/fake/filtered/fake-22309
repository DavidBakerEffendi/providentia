Ive been to the whiskey café a few times, the owner of this establishment is nothing but rude and also does not know how to treat his customers...but it gets worse his girlfriend who is also a waitress is one of the biggest loud mouth I ever have met in my life she was actually my waitress a few times and she is also the reason why I will never go to the whiskey café ever again. She has these chains that hang from her neck and they are just so dirty and disgusting no other restaurant would allow this. She abuses her other employees and you can just tell that she is probably the reason why no one actually goes there I don't understand what the owner is thinking by keeping her around she is not even pretty or a WOMAN at all she remind me of a uncaged animal. Ive been there mostly on Saturday nights and the older gentleman behind the bar gives great service and knows how to make you laugh but there not much more to say good about this place its a dive and the drinks are way to pricey and the owner needs to get rid of that woman who treats everyone like crap, that's no way to run a business. I also have a brother who has gone to this establishment and he has stated that the place is a mess outdated and the staff is poorly picked, especially that tall freak of a woman. I do not recommend this place at all.
