What kind of food do you expect from a person that holds the title THE RAMEN KING? Shigemi Kawahara, owner of IPPUDO NY, is the Ramen King. He has won The World Ramen Chapmpion 3 years in a row and has been inducted into the Ramen Hall of Fame.   If you are going there for the first time, you must have the Hirata Buns for the appetizer. any Ramen that you fancy and for desert, you must try the Mascarpone Cheese and Ice Cream.
