Ok, so first of all, I am a restaurant lover, me and my girlfriend went to this place on a Saturday night, we had 6:30pm reservations. The area around the restaurant is hard to find parking but there is a parking lot for about $10. I got there first and my friend was stuck intraffic, they kindly accomodated us and held our reservation until she arrived, I requested a window seat and we still got it. I have to say this will be the place I use for my birthday celebration. Alex was our waitress and when I tell you she was outstanding, there was never a time when I wanted or needed something that she was not right there either asking us if we were ok or recommeding what she thought was good. I had arepas, which I never had before for appetizers, and they were excellent. Then we had the frozen sangrias and the frozen sangritas and they were also excellent. Then for our main course we had the pernil and my friend had a chicken dish, both were so good we didnt even need a doggie bag. I have to give a special shout out to Lance, whom I spoke to on the phone and he was just as fine and pleasant in person, these employees make any restaurant experience outstanding, more places need to hire help like them. I cant say enough good things about this place. We never felt rushed to leave even as the place got more packed as the night went on. My friend loves dessert and so she had molten cake with icecream and I usually dont do dessert, it was outstanding. We both cleaned that plate! The view was also a highlight of this restaurant, after dinner we went outside and took pictures of the view of nyc. Great night and I will be there again.
