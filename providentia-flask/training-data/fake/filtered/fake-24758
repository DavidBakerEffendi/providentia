My friend who lives around the corner recommended this place to me for its inexpensive, delicious and well-portioned pastas and its cozy, quaint atmosphere. So, when I had to choose where to go for dinner on the turn of a dime (I had a hungry boy on my hands), I headed to Bianca. The service was slow in that European, "we are not going to push you to order before you are ready" kind of way. However, we were able to get a bread basked right away (I asked before my dining companion collapsed due to low blood sugar), so we didn't really notice. We split the Gnoccho Frito (fried dough pockets reminiscent of savory sopapillas) with stracchino, which was delicious. I got the spaghettini al pomodoro--a little salty, but studded with fresh basil and the pasta had that great chewy texture that is so hard to come by--and my companion had the gnocchi. Portions were quite hardy; I had at least two more meals worth of leftovers. We were definitely too full for dessert, but had espresso (get the espresso, not the Americano). Wine-wise, the list is heavily (if not all) italian has several bottles in the $27-40 range, and not just the standard Napa-type varietals. Word to the claustrophobic: you will not have personal space. They literally move the tables to fit you in to your spot. This leads to a very communal atmosphere and that "its so crowded its intimate" deal. My friend and I were catching up after a few months apart, so it was a great scene for us. But maybe not on a first date, when you want to hear everything. Perfect for a second or third date, though. Also, no reservations, and cash only... but there is a Chase across the street. All and all, affordable, delicious, low-key dining. I definitely recommend.
