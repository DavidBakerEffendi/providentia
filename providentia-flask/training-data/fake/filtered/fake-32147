We tried this restaurant after several people we know raved about it. We were greeted warmly by the owner who asked us if we wanted chips and guac. We agreed and found the guac horrible! No flavor or seasoning at all. I had a burrito which sucked and my husband a plate of steak with two types of rice and pinto beans. He had the same no flavor no seasoning problem. The " homemade" lemonade tasted like country time powder. Waste of money all around. We left after 10 min of receiving our food. Owner kept asking my husband if everything was alright. He didn't want to say how horrible our experience was. Btw my husband is a Mexican ex-restaurant manager. He knows food.
