Used to be a great Restaurant. Not any more. It has always been the highest priced place in the area, but the portions were large and the was food good. Now, at a time when most places do not charge delivery, they still charge $1.50, even recently on an order over $100.00 Food no longer the best, Side order of spaghetti  with oil and garlic had little oil and little garlic. Although Antipasto is high priced, it was almost all lettuce. Lemon dishes like Chicken Picatta had no lemon flavor. Last Two delivery orders we placed had mistakes when the orders arrived. We wonder if this restaurant had a change of managent since it has gone down hill so fast. At a time when most restaurants are leaning over backwards to hold onto customers, Tony's seems more interested in  making more profit.
