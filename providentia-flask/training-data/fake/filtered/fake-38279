This place is amazing!!  The best dinner i've had in the city without breaking my bank!  A friend recommended this place and i'm so happy he did because it's my new favorite place.   The 3 Little Pigs sliders were fantastic, they all complimented each other so well.  Then i had the fish tacos (per the owner's recommendation) and they were some of the best i've ever had.  The owner was great and really made us feel at home and everything he suggested was phenomenal.  We had the ancho chili brownies for dessert and they were great, a nice mix of sweet and heat! The bar and the decor are really cool too and it looks like a great place to watch games without having to suffer through typical bar food.  And they have some awesome cocktails that i've never had before on their drink list.  Try the rough and tumble and the troublemaker!   Definitely coming back to try the rest of the menu!!!
