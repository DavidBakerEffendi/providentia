It was my first time to Big Fish last night and I was not impressed.  Although the decor and ambiance was very nice, the food left little to be desired.  Our appetizers were good (oysters on the half shell served with both mignonette and cocktail sauce) and BBQ shrimp.  Our entrees, on the otherhand, were not.  I ordered Boulibaisse.  To say I was disappointed is an understatement.  The broth had absolutely no flavor!  It lacked salt, pepper, garlic, lemon, fresh herbs, etc.  The "stew" was mostly rings of calamari with a few (two) pieces of red snapper and some shrimp and mussels.   My husband chose an evening special (trout almondine).  Again, a very bland dish served with vanilla-laced potatoes (????) and asparagus.  Are there any spices in that kitchen!?!?!?  Our dessert, Key Lime pie, was very good.  Our service  and server, Jeffrey, was good.  Would I go back????  Probably not; it wasn't worth the price.
