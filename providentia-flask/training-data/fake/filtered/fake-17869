Have eaten here a couple of times, when they first opened the restaurant I was so impressed they had homemade fries which were to die for. Over the years I feel the quality has gone down. The waiters are very nice, the hostesses don't Â really welcome you but the waiters make up for that. The food is pretty expensive although the portions are fairly big. The mushroom soup is very good, the meat is average...the stuff on their bar menu is worth taking a look at.
