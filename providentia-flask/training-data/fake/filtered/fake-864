This place is OK, but you could do so much better.  Thumbs up for the decor, ambiance, friendly staff, tasty drinks. Thumbs down for the price to quality/portion size ratio -- ridiculously over priced -- and tendency to get madly overpacked with people.  Location might be nice if you lived in Center City, but if you have to get there by car, it's so not worth the trip.  It's expensive, and while i could see paying a premium for a premium product, this isn't it.
