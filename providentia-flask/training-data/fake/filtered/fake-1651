Recommended by a friend, so we came here after work to give it a shot. For a corner, hole-in-the-wall type restaurant this place was crowded and it was only 6:30pm.   My friend is right, one thing is for sure, this place is guaranteed to be safe as the law enforcement customers were packing more heat than the charcoal grill. 1/2 Chicken with Rice and beans, $5.00.  The chicken was juicy and delicious.   1/2 Ribs with Rice and beans, $5.00, not as good as the chicken, a bit tough, but my buddy tells me that it is usually tender. Good place to eat if you are in the area, but not really a place I would go out of my way to get to.w
