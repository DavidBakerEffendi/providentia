American Flatbread is my favorite pizza restaurant in Burlington, VT. The pizzas are delicious and the staff is friendly. The only problem is, that when I visit in the summer, there's a bit of a wait to be seated.  It gets so very crowded.....which also attests to its being a great pizza restaurant....because everyone  wants to eat there !
