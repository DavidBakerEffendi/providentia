Excellent service. Amazing food. Great prices. This is one of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood. The curry here is just fantastic, if you want your curry spicy you'll be sweating and if you want it mild they get it just right. The appetizers are just as good with the medu vada and idli being my favorites. If you are in the area stop by and treat yourself.
