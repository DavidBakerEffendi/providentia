Be prepared to wait a very long time for this exquisite pizza.  The word is that their sicilian (square) is the better of the two options, the crust is both crunchy and chewy, a perfect blend.  I am from Massachusetts and visited there with my brother in law, wife (both from NY) and our infant daughter.  Luckily, she is well behaved because we waited almost 3 hours for 2 sicilian pies.  I have never felt unsafe in NY but as we walked out of DiFara's to our car, not far away, I truly felt that I might be knocked over the head with a blunt object.  They would have left my wallet and watch but snatched up the 2 pies.  I would think twice about going again, at least with kids in tow, but I will always savor the experience and flavor of the "best sicilian pizza" in NYC.
