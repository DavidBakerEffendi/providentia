FD- shame on you!  The service was so rude today that I walked in to the bar and walked right out. I've had slow, but thoughtful service there before, but I will never go back again.  It is unbelievable that anyone in the hospitality industry would ever treat any of their customers with such blatant disrespect.  And this review is coming from someone that has worked as a bartender in NYC for ten years.
