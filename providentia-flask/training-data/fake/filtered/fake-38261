This is a charming little restaurant that had closed for some time and reopened I am guessing under new management. Having eaten there in its past life I was very disappointed by the new restaurant. First it was a crowed evening and I felt as though Â more waitstaff would have helped. Our service was painfully slow as we watched table after table fill, eat and leave. The diners at my table all order Italian fair. Presentation was simply awful, all meals looked as though they were simply ladled into large bowls and none had much taste to them. Once we received our checkl it was another 10 minutes minutes befor it was collected and payed. We all, six of us, agreed that it was not very good. I am surprised this is the original chef, it was no where near as good as my two previous outings under the old management. I would say this is probably a much better place to enjoy a cocktail rather than a meal. All in all not a good experience.
