The owner is a sweetheart.  The front of house guys are all working SO HARD.  The place gets packed, so sometimes you have to wait, but not for lack of very efficient and skilled assembly.  I am floored by the good job they're all doing... to make incredible food!  I think I've tried about 90% of the menu by now and it is all wonderful.  Fresh, inventive, incredible sauces, totally amazing food.  My meat-eating friends aren't bored here because it's not just good vegan food, it's good food, period.
