Awful experience. A one hour (!) wait to get 5 pieces of disgusting pork, I had nausea (and my wife as well) before finishing it. No vegetables, no rice with it, just pieces of meat : is it a joke ? In any case, it's not a funny one because it's a $23 dish ! $46 for two people, this is just ridiculous and absurd. We have been to restaurants in many countries but it is by far the worst experience we have ever had. Overpriced and disgusting : we'll never go back there in a million years.
