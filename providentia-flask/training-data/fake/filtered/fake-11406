This place is awesome. I just got back from New York a couple weeks ago. The only downside is that it is always packed! I went and did a wine tasting while I was there, only because it was the only thing without a line! Wine was good and the entire place is a little overwheming but it is such a cool place. Would recommend going here to check it out.
