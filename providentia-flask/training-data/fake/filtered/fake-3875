I went to this place for brunch, the food were great! all of my friends loved the food. our waitress was the worst ever! It was the 6 of us, so they added 20% tips to the check, we did not mind tipping 20% at all, but def not for the service that we were given. she knew that she would get the 20% out of us, she didnt even try at all. i dont think i will go back again because of the bad service.
