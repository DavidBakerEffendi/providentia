I have been meaning to write a review for a while now because i was SO happy with the meal I ate here the day after Valentines Day. my girlfriend and i went, we both wait tables and decided to make money on V-day then spend it the night after. the atmosphere was awesome, i love the lodgey rustic feel. the waitstaff was informed but not pretentious, on point and friendly. points! we ordered a clam chowder which was off the charts and a perfectly simple ceaser salad (i can't help it, i love them!) we also ordered a half dozen beaucoleil oysters, which i had never tried and they were absolute perfection. yum! i had a class of muscadet which i loved as well. we then decided to split one of the specials which was a braised short rib dish which was also very good, meat fell of the bone! the only thing is it was a liiitttle salty. not too bad but i'm a fan of salt so i notice when things are over the top. after dinner i finished the night with an orange manhattan. woah! delicious and got me a little tipsy. all in all i had a fabulous time here and plan on bringing my dad when he visits in june. way to go walter foods!
