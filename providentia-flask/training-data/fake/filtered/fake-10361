Had to hang out somewhere while a family member was in the nearby hospital.  I randomly chose Steinhof and was glad I did.  The staff was very attentive and provided good conversation while I had my bar lunch and drink.   My Salmon sandwich was delicious complete with an authentic Austrian cheese spread. The bartender even gave me a complimentary drink after I hung out for a couple hours. Will certainly come back if in the neighborhood.
