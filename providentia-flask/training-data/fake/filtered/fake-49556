Best sushi that I've had for its price. While more expensive than your average dinner, the raw fish is always super fresh. Ordered a sashimi deluxe, which was great, and Dinner Box D, which featured skewers of meat that were a tad overcooked. Also had butterfly and dragon rolls which were amazing! Definitely should stick with the sushi and the rolls when ordering. Service is a bit sketchy - the waitress never came to check on us and we had to flag them down to get more tea.
