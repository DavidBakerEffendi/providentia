As a pizza aficionado, I can say, without hesitation, that you have not had real pizza until you've eaten Di Fara's.  This pizza is artfully made and is always high-quality.  Fresh herbs, all fresh veggies, and just enough cheese and olive oil...It is worth the wait, worth the money, worth the sprint with the box back to my apartment before it gets cold--but it tastes fantastic that way, too.
