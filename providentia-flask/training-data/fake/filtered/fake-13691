I just got a new job in the city 2 weeks ago and wanted to take my girlfriend out on a date to a nice restaurant to celebrate my new position. I am so glad I found Cuba because their food, service, music, and Mojito's are AMAZING!!!! If you like fine authentic Cuban food and enjoy a smooth Cigar after a long day at work I would highly recommend Cuba. Try their Mahi Mahi...one word AMAZING!!!
