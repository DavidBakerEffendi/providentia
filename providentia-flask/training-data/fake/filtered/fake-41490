My husband and I celebrated his birthday at Fuji Mountain with 15 of our friends. We reserved the Karaoke Room and had a fixed menu and open bar. The food was great (and there was a lot of it!) and the service/presentation was even better. John, the manager, worked very closely with me leading up to the event to make sure it was exactly what I wanted. He worked with his staff to set up all of the decorations I dropped off (they did an excellent job!) and was very attentive to our needs and any questions or issues that came up. We all had an excellent time and I would totally recommend Fuji Mountain for your next fun event with friends!
