Now that this place has reopened after closing to remodel after it's FOURTH fire in five years, it sucks worse than ever! Our waitress was completely oblivious! She didn't give us silver ware when we sat down, she always forgot if we asked for something (asked for napkins FIVE times, even asked other workers and they didn't even remember!), and she got my order wrong. Not that it was a big deal because luckily I liked what she gave me. But anyways, the wait was so long because the restaurant is so small and always has been. There's barely any parking. And overall the service was terrible. Also the plating for the food was horrendous. It didn't even look appetizing. If you want breakfast, stay home and make it rather than going here. Hell, even go to Mcdonalds down the street over going here.
