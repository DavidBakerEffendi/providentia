Sure you've heard it before.. "Brooklyn style pizza is the best pizza" but its true!! We waited for 1h in the cold but it was well worth it. All the hype is true. Its the best brooklyn pizza with the best view! The staff was very nice. The owner is the one that greats you at the door so it makes it feel more like a mom n' pop joint. We ordered two larges amongst five people and it was enough. Next time we are going to try it with the fresh garlic on our pizza.
