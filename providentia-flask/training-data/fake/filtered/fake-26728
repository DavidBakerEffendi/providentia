Previously, I gave Mama Gyro a 5 star rating for excellent quality food, fast/friendly service and reasonable prices. Unfortunately, that was about 2 years ago. Now, Mama Gyro regularly takes over an hour to deliver food, the prices have risen about 33%, and they often make mistakes in the order. On top of all of that, when they make mistakes, they refuse to rectify the situation and give an attitude. For example, today, I ordered about $30 in dips and spreads. I paid for 3 extra pita breads. When the delivery arrived, no additional pita bread was included. When grubhub asked for a refund, Mama Gyro refused. Naturally, it was not as enjoyable to eat dips and spreads without pita bread... but they did not care or offer to try to accommodate me. Another example: Last week I ordered a $6 piece of feta cheese. I gave my credit card info and the order was placed on the telephone. Ten minutes later, a lady from Mama Gyro called me and told me that it was not in stock. So, instead of offering a refund, she insisted on me ordering a similar priced item. When I refused, she got mad and said fine, but it will take 3 business days. I am done with Mama Gryo.
