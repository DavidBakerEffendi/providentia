This review is only for family style.  The service was fine as always, need to hail a waiter, but all of the seafood was not fresh and very fishy tasting (even the shrimp.)  The only thing that was good was the beef dish (very good.)  I wouldn't recommend this, although I like Nam Phuong normally when we get the regular food.
