It may be difficult to get a reservation but suceed and you will see why and it will be oh-so-worth it.  This is some of the best Japanese food I've had in NYC and I love that it's tapas style so you can try a bunch of different things.  Among them, my faves are the uni soba and the washu beef tataki.  I don't think the prices are terrible either, especially if you're splitting the bill for tons of shared plates with lots of friends!
