The food great, fresh tasting. The service was kind especially the lady she is very calm and collected. I enjoyed the background music not too loud just perfect for a conversation. Very proud of the owners that they have established a piece of their culture here, they sell coffee, clothing and other items all hand made. I had challenge with the waiter as he could not understand , what i was trying to request. There was misunderstanding on the order and this was corrected quickly and very smoothly.
