I came on a sunday morning for a quick breakfast, I've heard such great reviews and I had to check it out. Â it wasnt that busy and we were seated quickly. After that, unfortunately, everything after that went down hill. we had very simple orders, pancakes and chicken and waffles that took about 25 mins to show up, we never had our waitress stop by to update us on how long the food would take. we had about 3 tables sat after us and they got their food before we did. the bacon tasted like salt sticks and ive never had to wait so long for somebody to close out my bill 10 mins after i handed her my card she came back with the bill. I see so many good reviews on this place im shocked that i got such bad service
