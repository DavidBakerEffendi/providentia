Usually not hard to please, however there were several things that happened in succession that ticked me off. First, if I ask for something to be taken off of a dish and the waiter respond that he can't make me any guarantees, something's wrong. I asked for red peppers to be taken off, consequently the waiter brings steak slices COVERED in peppercorns, ok I didn't expressly ask but I mean common sense. My drink was empty for the majority of my dinner and the waitstaff had an air about them that screamed: it's a privilege for you top be served by me. Third, if I'm paying $20 for meatloaf, I'd better have enough for leftovers, which I didn't... Thumbs down.
