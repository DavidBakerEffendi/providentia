I had read good reviews of this restaurant, love creole food, and wanted to try a new place on Mother's Day, so we had lunch at the Khyber Pub. We were not disappointed. The food and service were great, although we were the only diners there at 12:30. I had the fried oyster po boy, my daughter ordered the fried chicken, and my husband chose a selection of appetizers (soup and salad). We sat looking out on 2nd street and people watched. The po boy tasted like one I remember from New Orleans--oysters crunchy on the outside and soft and fishy on the inside. The bread had a nice crunchy/chewy crust. My daughter's chicken had a crisp, but thin outer skin and was perfectly done--moist, not greasy. Her sides of greens and mac and cheese were to die for. Prices were reasonable. We'll definitely return!! Next I want to try their barbecue.
