Unlike Matt L. I would prefer the Chew as appose to sampan.   I don't go out to eat because of the decor, it's a nice touch, but c'mon we all know the food is where it's at!   I went here a couple months ago and the service was great at Sam pan and the food was ok.  I only say that it was ok because i judge the food on the price.  I don't mind dropping big bills for any meal as long as i feel it's being made up for from either value or taste.  This place left a hole in my wallet as well as my stomach!   Yeah the food is ok, but that's it! I've been saving my money and going couple blocks over to Chew man chu where i can get a pad thai for 2 at only $15. Cool place but prob not gonna go back
