Ok, so I NEVER do these, but I had to write about my great experience at the Wrap Shack.  I don't really like wraps, but my friend insisted that we go here for lunch one day, since we work nearby.  Let me just tell you, I am now hooked!  The place was crowded, but the line moved quickly and the order-taker was really friendly and efficient, a refreshing change from a lot of other places in the area.  I love seafood and decided to try the Chloe Crabcake... DELISH!  A big ol' crabcake at a VERY reasonable price.  I was wary about ordering seafood at a place with the word "Shack" in its name, but this crabcake was so fresh and fabulous, full of lump crabmeat with almost no filler.  My friend and I shared an order of the fries and they were soooo good... and nice and hot!  I love the fries at 5 Guys, but these were even better, believe it or not.   I can't wait to go back to the Wrap Shack this week with some other co-workers.  We are also planning on getting some wraps delivered for our design team meeting later in the week.  5 stars!
