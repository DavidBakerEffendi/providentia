I haven't ordered from Sabrinas in awhile, because last time the order was a complete mess. This time, it took over an hour when he told me give them 35 minutes. I called to find out what was going on and the woman said it's on it's way, no sorry, nothing. When the food got here, the bread and french fries were soggy and everything was cold. I will never order from there again. I would not recommend this place to anybody. It's so terrible.
