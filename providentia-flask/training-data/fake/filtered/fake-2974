AWESOME Omelettes! However they do take a while to make, you'll know why when you go!  They are delicious and the pancakes, homefries, and toast are great as well.  Very crowded since they are only open for a short period of time, not like IHop.   I have had a few different things on the menu, all of which are great, however my ultimate favorite is the Santa Fe omlette.  The salsa served with it is delicious and VERY spicy.  Love the kick it gives you.  This place is very filling!! Definitely a must go!
