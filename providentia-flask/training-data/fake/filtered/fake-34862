I ordered catering from Brooklyn Fare Chef's Table for my wedding reception on New Year's Eve, and they never showed up with the food!  In fact, when we called to see what happened, they couldn't even find the order.   I had confirmed the order with Chef Joel and given him my credit card details by phone, and then nothing!  This was so disappointing -- I was a big fan of the food, but I can't believe the lack of accountability.  I never even got an apology.
