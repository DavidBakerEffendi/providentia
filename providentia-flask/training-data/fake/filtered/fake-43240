Awesome... I am a regular at makoto since its opening and love it. Its by far the best sushi in a 5 mile radius on all accounts. By far the best presentation of sushi that I have seen outside of nyc and always fresh and delicious. The staff is very freindly and the decor is quaint and inviting for various occasions from a simple dinner to Â slightly formal. Great place to take a date!
