Recently spent 4 nights at the Inn.  It is truly a wonderful place to stay!  The Inn is quite rustic and romantic.   First and foremost, the staff is fantastic.  From the owners to the wait staff, everyone is quite friendly, very willing to answer questions about the Inn or things to do in the area and in general very nice people There are 12 rooms of varying degrees, none of them the same, although some are similar.  Our room was quite large, king size bed, gas fireplace, large bathroom with whirlpool tub.  The room was immaculate when we got there and whomever cleaned the room each day did a fantastic job. They have a wonderful restaurant on the main floor of the Inn.  The breakfast was complimentary with our package and it was fantastic.  Fresh and local ingredients.   We also ate dinner twice at the hotel and it was fantastic both times.  The menu has an ala carte section but also a 5 course dinner with and without wine pairing.  The Inn has a very nice wine menu and the wines are reasonable priced (no 200% mark-up).   In addition, they have a nice large deck outside with a fire pit.  The Inn also offers complimentary snacks and fresh cider in the 'common area' each day.   I highly recommend staying at the Inn, you will not be disappointed.  If you do stay, definitely eat at the restaurant, you will be glad you did!
