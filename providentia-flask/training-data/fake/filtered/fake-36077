I loved La Fourno! I went with my boyfriend on a Saturday night around 7pm without a reservation and luckily got seated immediately. The inside is cozy and a lot more charming than the outside. We both got whiskey sours which were absolutely delicious. For our meals, I ordered chicken parm and he got penne alla vodka. We had no complaints about the food at all! The chicken parm was amazing and cooked to absolute perfection and the vodka sauce was to die for. Our waiter was also really friendly and made an effort to talk to us and make us feel welcome. This place is such a good break from all the takeout windows and bars along South Street.
