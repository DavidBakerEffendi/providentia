Well - we've given breakfast at Chef's Corner a final try and once again have been bitterly disappointed. Blueberry scones - dry, artificial tasting and a dearth of berries.     Pancakes - bland and flavorless.  Ham quiche -  under cooked bottom crust and made with sliced deli ham!  Though, perhaps the latter shouldn't have surprised me since the Eggs Benedict I ordered on a previous visit was also made with sliced deli ham. Definitely not what one would expect from a chef owned and operated establishment. As Williston residents we really like the idea of a great local breakfast spot and have tried  CC multiple times over the years - always hoping for it to have improved and we always leave making excuses.  We noticed today that they have recently redecorated and give them kudos for a pleasant atmosphere and grant that they have some positives (their fresh baked breads are wonderful!) but unfortunately, that's just not enough. Bottom line - We don't mind paying a premium price for quality, but not for mediocrity.
