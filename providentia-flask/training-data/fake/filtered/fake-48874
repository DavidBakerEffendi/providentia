It is a nice place with horrible hostesses. The waiters, bartenders are okay. Hostesses are terrible. When you call to make a reservation, they hang up on you. If you are a minute late, your table is given to someone else. Yes, 1 minute. Â But again, the food is good, drinks are really nice. But they need more friendly hostesses.
