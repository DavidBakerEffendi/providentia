We went with skepticism when it first opened 4/20. We feel in love with the food first bite and the staff. Claudio and Rinaldo make you feel so welcomed. Folks talk table to table. We have returned at least a dozen times trying everything on the menu. A special duck confit empanads were out of this world. The skirt steak marvelous. The sauces used are subtle but meld the flavors. All pasta homemade and the ravioli, mine had veal, out of this world. They were so delicate. You MUST save room for dessert. The crepes with fresh fruit just make you smile with every bite. The orange flan you want to savor the taste in your mouth. Wine list by bottle and glass excellent. We are so happy we have an excellent restaurant right around the corner!
