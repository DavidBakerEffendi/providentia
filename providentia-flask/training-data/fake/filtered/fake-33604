I was on date with my bf, First time we sat downstairs, waitress was very sweet and helpful we had really good time, second time we sat upstairs with live music, worst thing ever!! First they took forever to get our order ready, second food sucked!! Too salty and service sucked as well. Going to try one more time because I love Nepali food and my bf is from Nepal. Hope it was only one time thing.
