BEST ramen joint, perfect for a cold day in NYC. Apparently, everyone in NYC thought so too because it was a 2 hour wait. We got there around 12, put our name down, and walked around. My boyfriend doesn't even like ramen and he loved it! He got the Kogashi Karaka Miso Ramen (spicy) and I got the Akamaru Modern (traditional one). I tried some of his and both dishes were full of flavor. The pork buns were amazing too. Ippudo beats all other ramen places I've tried (Japantown SF, Austin).
