Arrived on a Friday evening to a 10-15 minute wait. Hostess called us in over 30 minutes, and was generally rude and flustered. Service unimpressive, they were out of pulled pork, brisket, and ketchup. Pie served cold. Sent it back and it came out cold again. Baby Blues has definitely gotten worse since they opened a few years ago.
