I debated whether or not to write a review of The Marshal because I had such a great experience there and I selfishly don't want it to become so popular that I can't get a table, but alas here I am writing my very first yelp review. I had an unbelievably tasty meal at The Marshal - from the delicious chicken to the flavorful bread salad to the amazing corn on the cob with butter and cheese. Next time I'm going to make sure I leave room for dessert because that, too, looks incredible. Also, the people who run and work at the restaurant could not be nicer.
