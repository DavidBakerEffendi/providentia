Miya's is weird. You can't even get a simple salmon roll because it's not "sustainable", or whatever. Most of the menu is full of weird stuff I would never put in sushi, and the staff gives you dirty looks if you ask for anything you'd find at a normal sushi restaurant. The sushi I received wasn't even that good. It's overpriced for what you get (there are so many other great sushi restaurants in the area that are better quality for the money). It takes too long to get your food, and the service isn't that great - the staff barely comes over to your table. If you're a fan of adventurous food, that's about all Miya's can offer you.
