I must say that this place was hyped beyond what could be considered "typical". Yet, after paying a visit to my 2nd Garces Restaurant, it lived up to the hype and then some. It was a nice evening and so we (my wife and I) knew that it would fill up quick. We managed to attain a reservation, but it had to be an earlier dinner for us.  When we arrived, we were greeted and seated right away.  Our server came to the table and made several suggestions. I will typically do this because they seem to know what's buzzing.  We followed her instruction and walked away satisfied as I have ever been satisfied.  Our favorites were the stuffed pepper with crab, the spicy potatoes, and the short rib flatbread. We split a delightful blueberry ice cream dessert that neither of us had room for, but being that it was early, we made it work.   Overall, the service was impressive as was the ambiance.  I can't wait to go back and try something completely different. We were tempted to go back the next day!
