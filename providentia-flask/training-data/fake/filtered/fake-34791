Ok. Why didnt I check out this place earlier? Despite what other people say here, I had a great time dining. Food was great, the service was amazing. My waitress really took care of me and my boyfriend. Her recommendations were awesome and she was super friendly. I've been to restaurants where they just take my order and expect me to tip them very well but this place is different. If you are looking for a non-bitchy (non-NYer) experience, totally visit here. I had the pork belly, soy garlic wings and clam and muscles. DELICIOUS. You wont regret.
