I was staying at the Chelsea Inn next door while visiting my daughter. Petite Abeille has an arrangement with the Inn to provide a continental breakfast which I enjoyed almost every morning for a week. I also stopped by most afternoons for a beer before heading out for the evening. After a couple days the staff recognized me and were out-of-the-way hospitable. Incredibly friendly folks. God bless Dorene who often works the counter. Felt like she was part of my family after a week at the Chelsea. Belgian beers to die for. Also enjoyed a lovely dinner. If this place was in my neighborhood I would be a regular.
