My boyfriend and I dined here last night and it was FANTASTIC!!! We had the goat cheese tart and escargot to start our meal which nicely prepared us for what was yet to come. Our entrees - the duck and the pork - were so delicious, we couldn't put our forks down. I wish I had the recipe because I would probably have the same meal again tonight. And to top it all - it was BYOB, so we were able to enjoy a $30 bottle of bordeaux that in most restaurants would have been marked up to $60-$80. Overall, one of our best dining experiences in the city. This will be added to our list of favorite restaurants and I can't wait to go back. Only negative - we didn't get seated for our 9:30pm reservation until 10pm. It was well worth the wait!
