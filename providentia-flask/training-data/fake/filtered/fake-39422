What a great evening!   The staff was courteous, fun and attentive. The space was not to quiet or too loud - you could actually have a conversation.   Every dish was delicious and had some suprising element that put it over the top.  Loved Zack our server who was very knowledgeable as well as charming and charismatic.  You must visit Ela!
