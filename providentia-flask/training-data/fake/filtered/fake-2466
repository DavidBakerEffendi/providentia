I've popped in twice in the past few weeks on trips to Old City. Both times there was great beer selections, great service, and fantastic food. The atmosphere was relaxed and low-key; the perfect Â easy lunch/dinner place. It's good for a group too, with all of their vegan/vegetarian options. Simply stated, it's one of my new go-to places in Old City.
