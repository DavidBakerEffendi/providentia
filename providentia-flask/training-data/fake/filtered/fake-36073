Great homemade bread cooked in their pizza oven and delicious salads with every entree are a great way to start the meal at this South Street Italian restaurant. It might surprise some to find such good food on the famous tourist drag but this restaurant does delicious food, fresh hot pizza's and has a friendly staff. With two floors and a mixture of classic posters and work by local artists there is good ambiance. I recommend the Gnocchi or the well made class Chicken Parmigiana.
