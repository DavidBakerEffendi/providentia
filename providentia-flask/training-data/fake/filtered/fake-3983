Get Fresh is welcome new addition to the block. Great food and friendly service. I live in the area and there is nothing along the lines of the local and organic bent like this. When so many other places in Park Slope seem tired and just go through the motions they are priced well and whenever I go the food is prepared perfectly. The servers there are always super friendly and accommodating. They even do Whole Hog on Sundays which is worth the trip.
