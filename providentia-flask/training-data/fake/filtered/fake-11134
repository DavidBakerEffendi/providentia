Most folks are focusing on the food in these reviews, and that's fine. The food's not bad-- the black pudding (morcilla) is excellent-- and the Guiness is as good as you'll get anywhere on the west side of the Atlantic. It's certainly the best in southern Connecticut. for me it's the football/soccer club -- almost all televised English Premiership, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A games can be seen here in a great atmosphere. Liverpool fans couldn't find a better spot to see the Kop beaten by their superiors to the east along the M62.
