Last night, my brother and I walked way down into the Hook looking for a decent, informal sort of place to eat.  When we first spotted this place, we thought "perfect, time to get our fried fish on!"  Unfortunately, when we showed up, we were told that they were no longer seating people and we couldn't be served.  This was at 9:40.  On a Friday night.  WTF?!?  We were told that because the kitchen closed at 11, they couldn't possibly fry us up some fish between 9:40 and 11.  I mean, how hard can it be to fry up some fish in an hour and a half-- they seemed to have plenty of people working there, and there was an empty table directly in front of us.  And it's not like there are lots of other restaurants nearby; it's kind of out in the boonies, so if you are refused service (at 9:40, on a Friday!), you don't have a lot of other options. We wound up eating at the Fairway, which is probably a better bet...
