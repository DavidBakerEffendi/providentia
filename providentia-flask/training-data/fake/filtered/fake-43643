The food at Five Leaves is good, but my problem is with the service.  I have been twice and once the service was fine, but the second time I came for brunch and had the worst service I have had in years.  The wait staff neglected to get us menus and even when our waitress stopped by about drink orders she didn't glace down to notice we were menu-less.  Then they brought us the wrong drinks and later they brought us the wrong food.  It took forever to get anyone to get us the check.  And the icing on the cake (though not anyone on the staff's fault) is that the bench on the wall has heaters underneath it and the seats turn into a sauna.  Both times I was there I was sweating by the time I finished my meals.  I may return, but it won't be until the heat is turned off.
