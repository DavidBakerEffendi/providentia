Best homemade breakfast ever!   If your mother was a gourmet cook, this is what she would cook for you! Some innovative dishes like French toast made with challah bread.   Home made walnut bread for your choice of toast.   Even bagels and lox for the gourmet diner. You can have a traditional breakfast or an 'interesting' custom ordered omelette -- it's up to you -- unlimited choices. Very friendly staff, including owner Lisa, who is warm, bubbly and fun.   Very accommodating -- they will make anything you ask for.  And you'll enjoy chatting and laughing with them --by the end of breakfast (or lunch) they'll seem like your newest friends. Love the location -- upscale, almost urban -- could be a quiet side street in San Francisco, Boston or NY.   The outdoor cafe seating makes you feel like you're on vacation.   The quaint, homey Inside feels like you're in a cute cafe on the Cape, in Newport or Kennebunkport, with all the time in the world to spend, just having a relaxing time. The customers are nicely dressed, well-behaved people of all ages -- you won't see any fist fights or screaming matches here that end up on YouTube!   Sorry, none of that kind of excitement HERE.....  Go to Denny's if that's your 'thing.' Be patient -- this is a relaxing, relaxed family place to spend some time enjoying the ambiance, the other customers and the staff, in addition to the food, of course! Don't take the negative reviews too seriously -- some people are just overly critical, and others maybe are used to eating at fast food places, and not at a comfortable, relaxed cafe like Mustard Seed.   Maybe it's not for everyone.   But everything about it is utterly charming!
