For the life of me I cannot understand all the love for this place. Is it because Zagat told you that you're supposed to like it? Come on people, think for yourselves. Dom moves at a snails pace and is generally oblivious to arriving customers (thereby being the main contributor to the 30+ minute wait for pizza). The pizza was A) incredibly overpriced, B) unacceptably small, and C) terribly oily. On top of all that, the crust was doughy and the cheese was oozy. I give it 2 stars because it's a step above Domino's. This is supposed to be Brooklyn's finest and I can name about 40 better places in Queens.
