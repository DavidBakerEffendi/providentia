This place went downhill fast ever since they changed owners and changed their name! It used to be called Istanbul before. They removed the lamb gyro/doner from their menu which is the only reason why I went there in the first place. Everything else is under cooked, even though I specifically say well done to them. Falafel is all mushed up and taste horrible. The bread is too hard. Stay away.
