This was my 1st time at this restaurant and I heard from my friend the food is very good. So we went there & when we got there (there wasn't alot of people, all at the bar, just starred at us. I knw people stare but they starred longer) so we got to our table and the server ask what we wanted to drink & I asked what do you have? Server said we have everything just tell me what you want. In my head I'm like how am I suppose to know if it's my 1st time there? Then 2nd time was my friend was writing down how much tip should he give to this guy and this guy server was standing right behind my friend. As soon as he saw the tip, guy walked away. 3rd we asked if they can separate the food to go which they did separate but they didn't tell us or label which one was which. I'm sorry but we both enjoyed the food but the service sucks! I don't know if they're racist or what!
