Well, I love food and always excited to try new places (2-3 week).  In addition, I love the Fairmount area where I live since 2000. I did try Fare with my friend last week end, we were starving and needed to eat fast.  Sorry, but it didn't do it for me at all.  Starting with the " organic wine. ", even at $5/glass, it's not worth it.  The wine selection was horrendous,too bad the Wine School is not close by any more.  In addition, I  hate to see wine served from a plastic container.  Not sure which is ecofriendly (plastic vs. glass, at least for the house selection). After 60 minutes of wait (the bartender kept telling us that the lamb takes long to cook), the lamb came. The meat was cold, really cold but the plate warm. I have to say that the lamb tasted fine. The hot-smoked salmon was so salty we had to return it.  When I told one of my friend about it, she said " am surprised because that Chef doesn't add salt, he is known for that". Well, even the bartender tried the salmon and didn't like it. The gingered beets salad was really tasteless and no taste of walnut there. We eat  healthy, local and organic at home, but please some taste, some flavor, why so boring? Overall, I will give a C to Fare, hoping to see improvement. No one wants to leave a restaurant and say" It's a total waste of money". Because I love my area I will give it another chance. I was naive enough to post my comments in the blog of the restaurant, not knowing the power of the censure. Everyone should accept a constructive criticism.  I hope no food critics did review the place yet...The place is just not ready yet
