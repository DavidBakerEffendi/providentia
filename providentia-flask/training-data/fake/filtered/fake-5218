Good Food, Good Service, Excellent Dessert. I am new to the area and my neighbor told me about this wonderful cafe'.  Very friendly and good service.  From the moment I walked in the door, they treated me like I have been a customer for years. Thanks to  Joey, my neighbor , I have found not only a new favorite restaurant but a place I will enjoy eating at for a long time to come.
