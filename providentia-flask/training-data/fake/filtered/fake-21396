First of all Heidi's House is an exceptional venue.  It's everything a wine bar should be and more.  The wine is undeniably well priced!  Very Very affordable. The food, wine, ambiance, and service are all fantastic.  It's High end, yet still retains that "local bar" feeling.  Renowned Chef Cipriano Pita creates and delivers perfection EVERY SINGLE TIME.  Heidi and Ed treat everybody like regulars.  They are amazing!   A-maz-ing.   It's very affordable (on the upper east side).  Best mac n cheese in the world.  Check it out, you're guaranteed to have a great time!
