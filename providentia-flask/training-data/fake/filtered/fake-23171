I wanted to like this place for the quality of their food and the price based on recommendations through friends. The service was a different story, hence the 3 star rating. I went early on weekday with a family of friends and 2 small children. The waitress forgot to fire our order. Our food arrived 1 hour and 20 minutes later. She was not even aware of her error until we mentioned it. Fortunately for us, the customers, we were chatting up old times. For me, as a former server in NYC and 28 year resident of the EV, this is unacceptable. Not only did we receive the food late but also the full bill with no compensation for the delay and barely an apology. I will eat here again, just not in that particular server's section.
