The freshest and best roast beef in town...maybe the state!  The menu is so interesting and always changing...but I usually get the roast beef sandwhich on a roll.  It's easy to tell how good a shop is by how well they do the simple stuff.  SGB is the best and the service is always friendly and attentive.
