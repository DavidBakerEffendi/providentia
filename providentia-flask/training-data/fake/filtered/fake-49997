I am sorry to say that I cannot recommend Hearth.  Efficient, yes but it is missing something important.  It is far too expensive for the quality of the food.  For these prices, you could dine at one of the more luxurious restaurants in NY.  The menu had limiting choices and the fish entree was overcooked and far too salty.  Interesting looking restaurant but loud.  If they lowered menu prices and redid the menu then I would recommend.
