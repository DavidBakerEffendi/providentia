I cannot even begin to tell you how amazing this restaurant is.  I frequent this restaurant on a regular basis and each and every time I visit, I love it even more.  I have had almost all the appetizers there are and all main courses.  Favorites that I cannot get enough of are the brick chicken and all their fresh fish dishes. When you dine at Kanella, you are family to them.  They are always making sure that you are enjoying your food and will make sure each dining experience is better than the next.  I take my family and friends here every chance I get and they keep bringing their friends as well.  I cannot tell you in words really how the experience will be, one must go and see for themselves.  I have never been disappointed and neither will you.
