We are frequent visitors at the First and Last Bakery and have never had anything but excellent food and service over the past 7 years. Management and staff provide a friendly, almost family-like environment which makes us appreciate the food even more. The menu includes not only delicious baked goods but also panini sandwiches, omelettes, French toast and pancakes , a variety of fresh coffee and even more items..
