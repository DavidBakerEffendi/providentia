A friend and I went there for an early dinner on a Friday night. The calamari salad was outstanding! Lots of calamari with a light dressing - plenty to share. Tried the french onion soup dumplings, which sounded like an interesting concept but failed to please my taste buds. We also tried the dumpling soup, which was okay. The food was not as good as I remember.
