Not better than JIM'S steaks....they don't even take there time making the cheesesteak...as soon as u order it, they hand it to u within less than 30 seconds like u ordered a hot dog..as i was eating it, it taste just like a cheesesteak that u can buy from ur local pizza shop... no one was on the line when we got there and that seemed weird cuz Jim's steaks is always packed...don't be fooled by the bright lights that try to lure u in...this is the McDonalds/burger king of cheesesteaks!
