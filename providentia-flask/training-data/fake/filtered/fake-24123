i wish i could say the same to this place as the other reviewers. but i've given it a fair 2 tries and it never failed to disoppints me. Went to Minca for the first time in March 2007. my japanese coworker said this is the best ramen in town and reminds him of home. ok, well, it's 8pm and i was starving. we ordered the gyoza and two bowls of the regular tonkatsu ramen. satisfying, but didn't wow me. resembled nothing like the ramen i had in tokyo. the ramen was hard and the soup wasn't as thick as i'd like it. but the worse is that both he and i got food poisoning the next day. we both felt dizzy and nauseaus throughout the day. who do u think did it? second try. June 2008. after a 3.5 mile walk in the freezing rain for corporate challenge. my bf picked me up and saw me half soaked in rain and shivering non stop. he asked what i'd liek to eat, the first word out of my mouth is NOODLE SOUP, i don't care what kind. but let's give this minca place another try (this is around the time i got addicted to yelp and can't resist all the nice reviews) again, hard ramen, tasteless soup and COLD pork slices. unacceptable. i came out disoppinted and felt sorry for my bf to have to eat this crap with me. we probably would have had better chance cooking instant noodle at home. the only good thing though. the pork gyoza. oh how i wish i could go back just to buy some pork gyoza.
