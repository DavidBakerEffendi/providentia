I went to Nori on Friday night and I really liked it.  It's nothing like any other sushi restaurant I have ever been to.  It is clean and has a really warm atmosphere.  This place has yummy fruit in their sushi.  I had the Donkey Kong which is fried banana and shrimp tempura and the mango roll.  Delicious.
