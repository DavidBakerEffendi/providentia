Why is this place sooo overrated?  It definitely does not deserve five stars.  All these yelpers giving the restaurant five stars apparently works for the restaurant or has some connections.  (Please take a look at Warren F. pictures, they look like they were taken by a professional).  I've ordered the wonton noodles, their wonton was firm and packed with pork instead of shrimp.  Their beef tripes were FATTY and you were definitely get a heart attack from eating too much of these.  If not a heart attack, it will clog you arteries.  $6.75 for beef tripes, you might as well get your beef tripes from a dim sum restaurant with a larger portion.  One star goes to good customer service other than that, I will never go back to this place again even with a 50% discount.  The only place that I wanted to try was their fried fish skin and they don't even have that at 12:30pm (lunch).  Please don't put items on the menu if they are not available.  Try Noodletown instead for their awesome wonton mein.
