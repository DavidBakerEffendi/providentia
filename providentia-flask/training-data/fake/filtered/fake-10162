Based on all the positive reviews I would guess that most people have never tasted a homemade cookie.  I received a 3lb tray as a holiday gift and was so utterly disappointed that I threw the cookies out.  The tray consisted of 4 different cookies with 3 of them being made from the exact same batter, just an add of red food coloring to differentiate.  The service is terrible and the quality and taste of the items is not worth it.  This bakery lives off of a reputation it can no longer live up too.
