Mehek has the best indian food in town and great service to match!  Their chicken tikka masala is hardy, with sauce enough to eat with their perfect garlic naan.  Lunch buffet is great too -- and definitely cheap enough for a college student's budget.  It is without a doubt my go to spot in Princeton.
