I really enjoyed their food. A little bit of a different style than I'm used to but all in all good!!!!! The seafood paella was cooked very well. My huband had the filet we were happy with the ambiance and the price was reasonable. We were going to get dessert but decided against. We were so full from dinner !!!! At least you know you get your monies worth when your portion is a good size!!!!! All in all very good. We will dine here again.
