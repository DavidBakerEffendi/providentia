As a newbie to the Bed Stuy area I was excited to try out this place given all the great reviews I'd heard. What a colossal disappointment. I went with two girlfriends on a Friday night and had to wait as expected since they don't take reservations. First negative of the evening: the bartender (Ryan or something?) is a TOTAL CHACH. He was incredibly rude and started to get borderline belligerently drunk as the night went on (we waited around an hour at the bar) because he took shots with patrons and constantly had a beer bottle on deck to sip on. Second negative: the food. I ordered pasta with the jumbo lump crabmeat for $18 which came on a tiny appetizer plate ( I kid you not) smothered in an oily brown "sauce" with little to no crab. My girlfriends split a margherita pizza which was thin and laden with too much sauce. Such a bummer. On the plus side: Cocktails were amazing and the space is unique and cozy. Tempted to give this place a second shot but reluctant given the shitty bar service and ridiculously sub-par food for the price.
