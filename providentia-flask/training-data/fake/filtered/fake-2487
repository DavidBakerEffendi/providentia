It's really not all that. Especially for what they are charging for the quality and for the PORTIONS! I can get just as good of a cheesesteak at Subway for half the price and a larger sandwich at that. I could tell my fries were cooked hours ago and reheated back in the deep fryer. $10.85 for a regular old cheeseteak and a small cup of reheated fries was a complete waste of $ and I will not be back.
