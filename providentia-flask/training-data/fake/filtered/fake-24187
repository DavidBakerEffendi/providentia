Place is beautiful, coffee excellent, and Greek yogurt was awesome. I could have gone without the smug cashier/order taker.  Clearly saw we were the only people in line (made eye contact) and Didn't acknowledge us until he was done conversing with his coworker.  10/17 morning around 10am. Would have given 5 stars if not for poor service.
