Unfortunately, my family and ate at this place a few days ago. I was super excited because I love BYO's and this place had steles reviews. As soon as we walked in I knew we were in for an evening. After about 10 minutes of not even getting our menus, we were informed that "one of the servers called out" and that only one server and one bus boy were in the front of the house. Awesome! One server for about 15 tables. So needless to say, the service was horrible. I understand that people call out and things happen. But when situations like that arise, you come up with solutions. Where was the owner? No help there? Come on! The food was great, it really was. It really lived up to the reviews, it was hot, fresh, and super good. However, because of the poor management and service on that unfortunate night, Ill find another place.
