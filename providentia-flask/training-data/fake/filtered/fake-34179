I have been fortunate to have Sushi across the world.  Sushi Yasuda is truly among the absolute very best in the world including Japan.  BEWARE!!!!!  I have eaten there twice in lat month and each time was significantly overcharged.  First time is a mistake, second appears to be trend.  I observed that no one looks at their bill.  They are typically with dates or clients and readily turn the credit card over without looking at the check.  First time it happen overcharged $70, second time it was $110.  Second time they apologized and bought me dinner.  All I want is to pay for what I eat.  It is great Sushi but they know most people don't look at their bill.  I believe this is common practice.  BEWARE!
