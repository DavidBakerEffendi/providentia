I feel sad writing this review - the food is very good, being real Thai food rather than that overly sweetened American version, but the new space is not very pleasant and the service is impersonal and lackluster.  The overall feeling is one of being shuttled in and out of Port Authority at rush hour by a crew of harried traffic cops with walkie talkies.   Even so, I wouldn't mind any of this if the pricing was't so offensive.  Portions are small, prices are high.  This is meant to be honest, unpretentious food from Southeast Asia, and Pok Pok has the plastic plates and tablecloths to prove it.  It also has small $19 entrees.   I'll be at Ayada next time.
