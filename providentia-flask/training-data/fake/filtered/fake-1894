I would give this place TEN STARS if i could!!! The food is always amazing!!! Everything i have tried is delicious and authentic!!! The roasted chicken, beef stew, roasted pork, fried pork, picadillo, rice and beans, plantains, and rice and beans are always fresh and awesome! Today i went a little bit after lunch time and they were making fresh empanadas, total HEAVEN!!!! The owner is always so nice and happy to have my business and thanks me many times when i am there. He is working on a simple website so he can post daily specials and such! Try this amazing little restaurant, you will NOT BE SORRY! :)
