Pies and thighs are good for a sit down restaurant but if you order take out its horrible. Â I have order 3 times from the place thinking that they probably was busy that's why their service wasn't that great. But no their service is just horrible. You can't order their chicken bucket and other food items all together. They say its too large of an order. They have always forgotten to at least 1 item in my order. Plus If I ask to order a food one specific way they say they can't do it. I now barely go there and honestly their food is good but its not good enough to make up their employees rude attitude towards the customer. Probably won't go there again.
