So, after looking on the Internet up the thai and indian places, my friend and I found Citrus with great reviews on Yelp and decided to go there for the buffet. Small place but such a great ambience, friendly staff and we had the best sev poori, basil (tulsi) sushi-kind rolls, great salad, best best dal fry, chhole and palak paneer.  As for thai, being vegetarian, the only two choices I had were eggplant dish and noodles that they made it for us without egg in it (nice of them).  Loved the thai food as well. As if these great food wasn't enough, the dessert was yummy.... I'd recommend everyone to go to this place once, and I bet you will be a fan of this place like I am. Giving 4 stars - I'd have given 4.5 if there were a couple more vegetarian dishes. JP
