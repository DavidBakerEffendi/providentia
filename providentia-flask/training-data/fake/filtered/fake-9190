My family and I have been ordering Chinese food from this location for 25 years . We'll order from them for a casual lunch or dinner.  We'll order if we've got company over.  We even order from them to cater food for a large party. Food is always delivered fast to our door. Staff is very friendly too. They make the best beef with broccoli.  and pan fried dumplings. Like I've said, we've been ordering here for years and the food has always been consistent and delicious.   They're located right by cvs.  They do deliver, but they also accept credit card now.
