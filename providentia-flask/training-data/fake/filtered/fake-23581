I am a native New Yorker who first visited the Spotted Pig 10 years ago. I decided to have dinner with two buddies of mine. I put my name down on the list and was told the wait would be an hour which was fine. After an hour of waiting I was told it would we were up next for a table. After an additional 30 minutes of waiting we were seated. I complained to the host who said they had large parties. You think he could have offered up one round of beers on the house. While the burger was good is wasn't great and NOT worth a 1.5 hour wait. Tiny little restrooms and a very uncomfortable dining experience on account of how diminutive the physical space of the restaurant is. The shoe string fries were Horrible. I will never go back and stick with 5 Napkin Burger instead.
