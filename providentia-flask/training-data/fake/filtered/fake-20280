The menu says "Chicken, mozzarella, onions, green peppers basted in barbecue sauce" sounds good right? When I opened the box, I thought I had the wrong order. There were no onions or green peppers in sight. I had to smell the pizza to detect that there was barbecue sauce on it. It took almost an hour to be delivered so I just ate it. Still not sure if it was really my order.
