I don't think the reviews here represent Marsilio's Kitchen at all! This place is truly one of those dining experiences that I have been searching for.  It has a diverse menu and good prices, along with a comfortable atmosphere with competent and friendly service.  The food is delicious all around. I had the calamari and it was tender and fried to perfection.  We also had the eggplant rolatini which was light and creamy and the sauce was just right. The chopped antipasto was served on a chilled plate with a tangy dressing that was satisfying and filling... it's a big salad for two.  We also had the Veal chop and chicken cacciatore and we couldn't have been more pleased.  it's the perfect place to bring your date, a girl's night out or even your parents! This was my fourth time here in a month.  The waiter remembers us and the owner came by to introduce himself.  What a gem of place that we will keep going back to.  Finally, a place we can call "our place".  You can bring your own, or they have a wine list from a local winery.  Marsilio's Kitchen is at the top of my list!
