After trying a few other pizzas in Brooklyn I decided to try Lombardi's. I wasn't expecting too much as I already knew it was more tourist-oriented than most and was not the best. An early plus is that it is easy to get to, a short walk away from the subway. The service is friendly, it didn't seem that busy but we were taken through the kitchen to a back room (nice to see the coal burning oven). After ordering the pizza was delivered very quickly, probably within ten minutes of arriving. We ordered a large Margherita with no toppings. Overall I can't say that it wasn't good, compared to what you are going to get in most of the country it is great. But the crust is a bit too thick in my opinion, the sauce doesn't blow you away, and neither does the cheese. The basil is applied sparingly here, not like Di Fara where there are full leaves on the pie. The char you would expect from a quick bake in a coal oven is not really there; you can taste the char a bit but not too much. Overall it's just a good pie. It tastes good but nothing blows you away. Now if you came to New York and had never had anything but chain pizza you'd think this was god-like. But all it takes is a trip to various other places in the city to find much better pizza. I guess if you're a pizza fan you have to come here once, although the history doesn't have much of a presence either, considering this isn't the original location. In conclusion it's a good pizza, just overshadowed by places like Motorino or Di Fara.
