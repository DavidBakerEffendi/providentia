Been here a couple times and wasnt on yelp so decided to write a most recent review. The stuffed mushrooms were an excellent appetizer. Good for dunking bread into. I had the grilled pork chop and it was one of the best I had. Was thick and juicy and perfectly cooked. I must say every time I been here food was good. Guess that why we go back. My girlfriend loves his salmon dish that was a special and hopes everytime we go back its on the menu.
