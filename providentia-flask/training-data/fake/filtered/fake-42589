New Man Hing is the best! Everything I've gotten from them has been so tasty. Delivery is super quick. I work at an animal hospital in the area and my co-workers order from there once a week. They got me hooked on their food. When my fiance and I don't feel like cooking we pull out the New Man Hing menu. Our favorites are chicken with garlic sauce, shrimp with garlic sauce and steamed dumplings. If you don't have a menu or can't find their menu they have it listed online at newmanhing.com. Order from here and you won't go anywhere else again.
