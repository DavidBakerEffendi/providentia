My Family and I tried this establishment based on the online reviews of this website. The food was very average for China town, what was the shocker is how expensive it was. Please be ware that if you eat at this restaurant  a 15% tip is automatically added to your bill.   The atmosphere was crowded and loud - service was very, very average - difficult to get the waters attention. We eat in china town at least once a week and I can tell you that with all the choices, this place is at the very bottom of my list. a bill for three people with tip came to $80.00USD.   The same meal a few blocks away cost me $30.00   If you are looking for a Tourist trap - this is the place. In conclusion, the poster reviews are very likely padded, that is, the businesses hire someone to add many positive reviews driving up their rating. Avoid this place at all costs, -P-
