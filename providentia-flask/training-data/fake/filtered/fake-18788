I was a bit skeptical of this place... I mean really, who names their establishment "The Flying Meatballs?"  Then I realized this could only come from some true blue eye-talians.  Who else has the gumption to put a name like that on the front?  Well let me tell you, these guys don't mess around when it comes to food.  The Flying Meatball sandwich is out of this freakin' world.  Who the Hell puts toasted prosciutto on a meatball sub?  These guys, that's who.  They've got a whole bunch of meats and imported products I've never even heard of.  Sure, there's your old standbys, like prosciutto and lasagna pasta on the shelves and stuff, but man, some of those names are crazy.  Truly and undeniably Italian.  I thought Russian was a masochistic language, what with stringing all those consonants together and whatnot, but I dare you to pronounce some of those words on the boxes.  Of course, the fact that I can't pronounce them makes me want to eat them more, but that's another story.  They've got homemade marinara if you want to buy it, and dinners to take home.  You can even throw them in the microwave or oven if you want.  Alright, I'll stop rambling.  Just go to this place.  Oh wait, don't forget to try the pasta when you get in there.  I had the Penne Vodka pasta and there was grilled chicken in there and I swear to God my taste buds started a rebellion in my mouth when I stopped eating it.  I can't wait to go back, because I heard they have different things every day.  I didn't even mention the meatballs or desserts...  This place definitely deserves some return visits!
