Where do I begin... Completely deserving all 5 stars. I had heard about this beautiful restaurant for a while, and finally I had the chance to go on 10/14/2014 for my boyfriends birthday. I called a week in advance to make a reservation and the day of I was called to confirm. The dinner was a surprise for a party of 8. They were so accommodating I can't even explain. They hid my party and sat them all behind my boyfriends back. After sitting, my waitress Alexandra who was GREAT Â helped us out with drinks. They stalled by offering drinks and appetizers until the rest of my party arrived. Once they came, we ordered food which did not take long. After reading reviews for 2 days and stressing myself out due to some negative reviews, I'm glad to say that I ignored the negatives and tried it out for myself. My boyfriend ended up knowing the manager and a bartender who were also great. The table was set with a beautiful card saying happy birthday and a cute note inside to save for memories. The food was great , prices are normal, drinks were great (2 for 1 Mojitos on Tuesdays lol) service was great and the view was amazing. This is definitely a place where I can see myself coming back to ALOT. I highly recommend !
