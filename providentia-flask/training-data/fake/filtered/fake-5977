All I can say is WOW, and not in a good way. Went for a big group birthday dinner and after 2.5 hours we decided to cancel the rest of our order (the majority of which still hadn't come out) and cut our losses. While there's a host of mind-bogglingly epic fails that I could bore readers with, I think the highlight was when I desperately asked our overly-verbose and underly-helpful waiter for some bread to prevent passing out after only having been served a few pieces of balsamic-soaked broccoli over the first two hours. The response he dutifully passed along from the manager who one hopes will not be a manager for very much longer was, "I regret to inform you that all of our bread is reserved for our sandwich." Â  I couldn't make this up people. Stay away, some things just weren't meant to be and this pretentious side-room of Urban Outfitters that calls itself a restaurant is one of them.
