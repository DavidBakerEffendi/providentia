Ramen- pretty good!  I currently live in Ithaca, so good food here is far and few between for lack of a better descriptor.  So when I get to go into the city, I go crazy.  We made our way to Ippudo after our lunch a Jean Georges as our in between snack.  Lots of walking in the city so didn't feel so bad about it! WE (obviously) ordered the hirata buns / pork belly, so good!  I liked it better than Momofuku noodle bar.  There are 3 types of ramen so we all decided to get one and share.  My fav. was the Karaka-men, which is the spiced up version of their original ramen.  The noodles were done well, good chew to it but not too much and great flavor.  The bill was ok, I mean it's $15 dollars for noodles...but well worth it.
