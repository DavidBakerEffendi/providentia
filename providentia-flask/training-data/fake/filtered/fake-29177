El Sarape has long been the best Mexican restaurant in Hartford.  I've lived in Mexico and can attest that this food is way more traditional than most of the Mexican places around.  Although it has gone downhill a bit since expanding a few years ago I still have a lot of love for this little place.  Prices have gone up too, but it's still affordable.  Try the carne asada burrito, the whole fried talapia, and the tacos.  They also have a good breakfast if you are looking to change up your brunch.  Menudo and pozole on the weekend!
