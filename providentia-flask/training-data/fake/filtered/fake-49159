I went to Salute for the first time last night with a small group.  I was EXTREMELY impressed with the restaurant as a whole.   The atmosphere had a trendy yet simple and relaxing feel.  It was very welcoming.     The food was amazing, deliscious with great presentation.  Our food came out promptly and was fabulous!   One of the biggest Standouts of this restaurant was its attentive service.  We were taken care of from all staff members from the bus boy to the owners.  They were friendly, attentive, professional and fun.  I will definitely be going back.  I highly reccomend that you check out Salute when you are in town!
