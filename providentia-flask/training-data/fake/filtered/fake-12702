I went to Lupa last week because i'd heard so much and wanted to try some good Italian food (Being spoiled by my family in Italy makes it hard to get excited about restaurants here). I have to say that from the presentation to the authentic ingredients and dishes, Lupa succeeds in creating a genuine Italian dining experience. I also dug the big share table that continues the family-style atmosphere.. I think I may have simply ordered the wrong thing, because everyone else I was with enjoyed their meals a lot. I had linguine with mussels, and found them a bit fishy and chewy, I didn't finish them and munched on the yummy foccaccia bread that comes to each table. I will return and sample more dishes because I like the room and trust the opinions of my companions and other reviewers. They have daily specials that are supposed to be exceptional, and I'm going to choose one of those and time my visit accordingly.. The lamb "Scottaditto" on Saturdays sounds about right.. The wine list is great, and ended up being the highlight of my night.. A good Sangiovese saves all.. I will succeeed in having the complete experience everyone speaks of, soon..
