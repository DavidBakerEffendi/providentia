As a brazilian, I can say that this restaurant Â is tipically Brazilian, very "carioca", the athmosphere, tiles on the wall, floor, even the glasses are tipically from the "botecos" in Rio and So Paulo. Very cozy, and i felt like I was home, having my Guarana, and listening to the music, but only till I got the food. Feijoada is terrible, taste and looks like a soup. This is not cooked by a Brazilian for sure. I could say that from all the other brazilian restaurants in New york, this is the one with the best "brasilian feeling" but the worst brazilian taste.
