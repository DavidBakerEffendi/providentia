I first walked in to a busy but vibing spot with a friend on a brunch. There were one too many hosts eager to seat us and we got a table straight away. The food was typical- not bad- but not exciting. the service was a bit rushed, but considering the volume of traffic I understand. Service was met with smiles all around. I want to come back to try dinner or lunch during off-peak hours.
