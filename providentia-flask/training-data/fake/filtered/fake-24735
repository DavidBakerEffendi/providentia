After reading all the amazing reviews my bf and I couldn't wait to finally try this place out. Went there on a Wednesday at 8,30 and were seated after one hour ( I was expecting that so no big deal and FYI, they dont take reservations!) The place is mad noisy, which I didnt care about, just don't go there if you want to have a romantic dinner. It was pretty hot inside, so that made my experience kind of unpleasant. Service was just the way I like it: they tell you the specials, come take your order, check on you once! Also, the place was packed but the food came out pretty quickly. Talking about the food...APPETIZERS: gnocco fritto with cold cuts-good and very nice to share!/Fried Artichokes: unremarkable. PASTAS: lasagna-one of the best I ever had in NYC (not in my life, as lasagna in Italy cannot be compared to those)/Tagliolini ai Frutti Di Mare (seafood Tagliolini): bland :( DESSERT: ciambella al mascarpone: awful, I barely touched it/pannacotta: very good. WINE (by the glass): not so good...However, I have to give it to this place: it is pretty cheap!! Will I be back to try something else? Sure, why not! PS: cash only!
