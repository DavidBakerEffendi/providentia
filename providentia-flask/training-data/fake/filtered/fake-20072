Its a bummer that this cute neighborhood caf√© doesn't have better coffee. I kept trying to go back in hopes of getting a good cup but not the case. Each time I received a latte that was half foam. For some reason, the coffee itself taste burnt and the foam tastes like dishwater. Love the atmosphere. Good sandwhiches. They just need to get the coffee right or change brands.
