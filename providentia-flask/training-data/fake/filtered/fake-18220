" I will rather go fasting, than come back here". This was the comment from one of our group of six who had the unfortunate inclination to dine here this past weekend, and it pretty much sums up what we all thought about the place. We had a planned outing for Friday and this place happened to be near where we had planned to be and therefore we thought it would be a great new place to try out. How Â wrong we were!!! We did not have a reservation but since the place was almost empty we assumed we would be seated quickly. Instead, we had to wait a bit and were informed ( quite patronizingly) that we should check out the website and that the chef had participated in "Chopped". We were finally seated near the door to the kitchen and a well-tattooed waiter took our orders. He was terse, condescending and downright rude to us when asked about some of the items on the menu and served us as if doing us a favor. The ambience was great but the food not quite as much. We felt insulted, robbed ( quite pricey food for the not so great presentation or taste) and it pretty much spoiled the beginning of the evening for us. The management should definitely focus on training their staff on the etiquette of the service industry and how to treat every customer the same irrespective of race or appearance. Heck... we pay the same price for the same food as any other person in the restaurant and should be treated with respect.
