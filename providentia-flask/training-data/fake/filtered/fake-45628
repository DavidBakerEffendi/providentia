Some friends and I went here between games of the Women's Big  East Tournament. We got there a little after 4 p.m. People started coming in after us. We got drinks, ordered and waited and waited for our food. Other people who came in after were getting served. We kept trying to flag our waiter down who kept saying "soon." We asked for the manager and was told  he was cooking. At 5:20 - an hour after we got there and upon watching people pay and leave,  I went to the kitchen to ask to see the manager and again was told he was cooking.  I asked the people in the restaurant if anyone else hadn't been served.  Everyone had except one table. Eventually the manager came and said there was a computer error. He said he just arrived - our waiter lied - He said our food would be right out.  Five minutes later my cold French onion soup came. The other order was wrong and the other two never came.  At 5:45 we left. We would never recommend this restaurant to anyone.
