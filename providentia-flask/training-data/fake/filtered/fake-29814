Ignore all negative yelp reviews. Lobster joint is perfect. Don't complain about prices, just don't go. Your paying for the best seafood rolls in NYC. its a clean honest place that deserves much credit. Their crab roll is packed. You get to really really eat the crab. not like a lot of places where your eating bread and other things they put in. Lobster joint is for people that love these foods. keep up the good work. The nice girl Asia rules behind the counter
