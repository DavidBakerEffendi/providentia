HI Guru Palace, Thank you and your team for making this years My Wedding the best one yet! All in all, we welcomed over 175 guests and we are receiving positive feedback non-stop since we got married on Saturday. Most of the comments rave about two things - food and decor. Guru Palace's involvement definitely elevated our event to the next level -So thank you! I know you worked especially closely on this event and made sure that every element was perfect. And it was. I am so happy and honored to have had Guru Palace partner with us for my wedding and I hope you felt the same way. Please extend my thank you to Jasbir for his personal efforts and entire team for being so amazing. I will be sending you a proper thank you and post-event coverage report in a few weeks, but I wanted to send a quick thank you.
