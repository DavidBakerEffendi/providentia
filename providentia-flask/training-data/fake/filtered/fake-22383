I would like to comment on the review written by Shelby from Caldwell. Sorry future patrons but she couldnt be more wrong about Stephanies!!! It was obviously her first time there as my husband and I have been going to Stephanies for years and have never encountered a so called experience like hers.. The owners have always been accommadating and friendly. The place is on the small side and is extremely busy on Saturday nights so her so called experience is not an every night thing, if it happened the way she say it did, which I doubt from some of her way out comments, maybe it was from her negative attitude. The food is good and maybe she didn't receive enough attention for her " holier Â than thou"personality!! Rest assure, you WILL have a great dinner and great service here! Shelby, you just may be better off at Applebee's or Cloverleaf, better yet, Subway!
