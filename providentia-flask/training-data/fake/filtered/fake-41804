I cannot speak about their pizza or delivery service.  I do think this is a great place to eat dinner.  Their small sized menu has a great selection.  Their pasta tastes homemade and the sauces fantastic.  I also like a menu with lots of fresh vegetable choices so everything is not so heavy.  This place has it.  I am surprised to see this place is not a 4 star or 5.  But I guess it is all so subjective.
