Great bar with an eclectic crowd.  I loved the subtle "Sunny" decor, the "pirate" sign on the office door made us giggle.  The food and service was outstanding.  We had the cajun chicken on a ceasar, and the green and white chicken cutlet, oh and the gravy fries...oh the gravy fries.  The heat was slightly unbearable, especially in the bathroom, but it still did not make us want to leave.  The bartenders were attentive and quick.  There also is outside seating now.  Although, thanks to the no smoking in bars law...I imagine you might want to sit inside for fresh air.  I will definately return, I've never eaten bar food so amazingly tasty.
