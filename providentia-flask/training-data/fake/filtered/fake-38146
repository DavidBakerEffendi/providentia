What a lovely place! The Kickshaw is known for their grilled cheese and beer selections, which other reviewers do a great job of describing, but my friend and I were looking for an after dinner spot to grab some coffee and dessert last night and the Kickshaw did not disappoint! It was just the right atmosphere: very social, but still cozy. The menu is totally reasonable and offers a nice snack-ish assortment of savory and sweet. Our friendly server advised me to try the fontina cheesecake. Initially, I thought this was be your average slice of billowy sugar, but their interpretation is far more unique. The cheesecake is only slightly sweet and the emphasis is on the richness and freshness of the cheese itself, complemented by a lovely, mild blackberry sauce. Very curious to come back for grilled cheese, I'm sure that will be happening soon!
