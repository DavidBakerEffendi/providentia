After walking around downtown Burlington on a cold rainy day for a late lunch we finally came across this gem at the end of Church Street.   Inside was nice soothing décor and atmosphere, the bartender help with beer selection and was more than accommodating to make drinks not listed on the menu. With an extensive food menu he also made great suggestions.   On the recommendation of the bartender we had the maple habanera wings which were fantastic and a chef Jason special. We then split a garden salad and split an open steak sandwich. The chef couldn't be more accommodating with cooking each steak to both our likings, half medium rare and the other half well done and both were delicious.  We also had a first gravy fries which were also surprisingly good. Overall our experience was great, with friendly chef Jason whose culinary skills were fantastic and very sociable this will definitely be a place I would return to when visiting Burlington VT.
