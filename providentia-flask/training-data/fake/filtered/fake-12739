I've been to Jacob's Pickles three time now. Each time I can't resist ordering the mushroom gravy fried chicken and biscuits. It's totally decadent and amazing. It comes with cheddar grits. The first two times I ordered the dish the grits were really good. The last time they were really bland. I've also had the fried pickles. This was my first time ever having fried pickles, and I will be getting them again there. Crunchy on the outside and the pickle was tangy and Â you can tell it was made there with love.
