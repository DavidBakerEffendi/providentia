Ok. Here's the truth. You line up for 25 minutes, pay $10 for a piece of Philly culture, then chomp down on a greasy mess that is nothing more than a guilty pleasure. It's fun, do it once, then try making it at home. See? You made it at home!!! AND It's cheaper and better than with Geno's or Pat's. And it was easy to make!!!
