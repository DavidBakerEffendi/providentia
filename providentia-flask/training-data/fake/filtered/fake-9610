Went to this place for my birthday dinner on 2/16/2014. The chef we had for Hibachi Â called himself Abu, he was fantastic. The children and adults were all entertained. The food was fresh and tasty, the drinks were well made also. The ambiance was perfect. I will be back soon, and will request the same chef :)
