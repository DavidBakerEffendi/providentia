As far as the pizza, it wasn't bad.. I mean i did eat half the pie. Although wasnt the best I ever had.But i loved the atmosphere. So rustic looking with their wooden tables and wooden chairs. loved that. Wine wasn't that great. Their gelato was fantastic :) and so was the music playing. All around great place.
