yeaaaa buddy, this place is gold. haven't had hush puppies since long john silver-not sayin ljs's come anywhere close to the ones here, catahoula's are the best.The whole menu is loaded with good stuff. Po boys, blackened cajun style fish, and the beer list is always spot on perfect. You don't even realize you're in the shadow of 95, more like down in the big easy
