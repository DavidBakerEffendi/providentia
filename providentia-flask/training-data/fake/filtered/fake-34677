Great Panini menu. A perfect cozy place to eat and drink (wine) with friends. Eventually Il Bambino will open a back seating area. AWESOME! My only problem... sometimes the cupcakes will just be the tiniest bit stale. This has happened to me a few times. (Yeah, maybe i shouldn't be eating all these cupcakes in the first place) Â But when I get a fresh batch of cupcakes... it's to die for!
