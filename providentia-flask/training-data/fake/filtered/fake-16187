I LOVE this place. The servers wear all black and white with skinny suspenders. Everyone who works there looks young, and possibly a bit snobby, but if you actually get to know them, they all super fun and insteresting characters. The place offers a hip and cool ambiance and a great all american menu. The hanger steak cobb salad is AMAZING as well as the Mac and Cheese appetizer, and the sliders. I know some reviewers say that waiting in line is a pain, but it's definitely worth the wait. AND there's a DJ that spins in the lounge downstairs every night starting at 8pm. Really good for small groups of friends who want to catch up and actually hear each other's conversations while still being in a crowded bar scene.
