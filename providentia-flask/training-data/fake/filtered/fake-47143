I was really looking forward to eating here with my husband and his family while they were visiting from Florida, before attending a comedy show this past Saturday. Unfortunately, we never had the chance to. We had a 7:45 reservation but we were running late, so we called to inform them and they insisted it was no problem. We arrived by 8:00 and the waitress said she was just waiting for another party to finish up dessert. Since we were late, we understood and patiently waited out front (extremely small restaurant). During the next twenty minutes, we watched three large parties leave. Ten minutes after they left, we went back in and they were still clearing the table. Another ten minutes went by, and they were still setting our table (we had a party of 6). When it was 8:50 and we hadn't even been seated, we realized we no longer had the time to eat if we were going to make it to our 10:00 show. So, we called from out front to report to the manager what had happened. He immediately became defensive, dismissive and blamed everything on us. His attitude was disgusting. You would think a manager in a customer service industry would want to treat already disgruntled patrons with a smidgen of respect. All he had to say was "I am incredibly sorry this happened, I hope we can make this up to you in the future", instead of "oh well, too bad". After five minutes of screaming, he began to apologize and 'yell' at the wait staff "you let a 6 top wait out front for 45 minutes?!" Had the manager acted in a professional manner, I would have loved to give Entr√©e another shot. Sadly, he turned us all off from this restaurant and I will never have the chance to dine there again. The owners should really consider replacing him with someone that understands how a manager should speak to his customers.
