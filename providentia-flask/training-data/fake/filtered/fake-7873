I went with my family to Pepe's expecting something special. I came out disappointed and with a general impression best summed up with a "meh" and a shrug of the shoulders. My pizza was good, but not great. However, my families' pies were burnt and they were quite unimpressed to say the least. The service was the worst part of it all, we fortunately did not have to wait long for a table but our server was borderline rude, uninterested and did not make us feel welcome. Overall I think they have the potential to make good brick oven pizzas but their service was bad and the pies this time around did not impress.
