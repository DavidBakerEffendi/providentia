Accidentally ended up at brunch here Sunday morning as the place we initially tried was on a list. Great news for us! This was one of the best brunch spots I have ever been to, if not the best. It is a "chocolate" themed restaurant but offer everything, and serve chocolate with just about every item. They had the best hot chocolate ever (chocolate on tap doesn't hurt). Chai hot chocolate and italian hot Â chocolate were outstanding! Only down-side is that it is a bit pricey for brunch, but overall, this place was amazing and well worth it!
