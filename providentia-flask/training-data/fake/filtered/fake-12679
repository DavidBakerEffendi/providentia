I came here on a romantic date and we were less than impressed. Lupa was highly recommended and did not live up to its reputation. Â For one, the seating is very cramped in the restaurant which leads to an unrelaxed atmosphere. The lighting is subdued and pleasant, however our candle went out and no one fixed it. Mostly the food was delicious, especially the swordfish. There was nothing sensational about the flavor palettes of the antipastei course (esp. Hot Coppa, Ricotta & Roasted Squash), and the primi course (Ricotta Gnocchi and Bavette). The Fall greens salad was too rich and made me vomit, which basically ruined the entire meal. The maitre d' did very little to make me feel better, and I left dispappointed in a good meal gone sour.
