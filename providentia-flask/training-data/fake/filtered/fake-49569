I ate here once a few months ago and left satiated. And while I didn't think the food was superb when I went, I enjoyed the ambiance. I recently revisited for a good friends' birthday. Literally, everything that could go wrong, went wrong. They got every order wrong. The table wait was grossly inaccurate (30 minute wait became a 60 minute wait). The dishes were wrong. The drinks were forgotten. The waitress seemed high (which I guess justifies forgetting our entire order). When we had arranged for the bill to be covered and for desserts with a candle to come out, and all that was screwed up, we went to the manager to ask for some kind of explanation. He proceeded to basically tell us we were in the wrong and that we shouldn't tell other people about our experience there. So, YELP community, don't eat at glasserie. The New Yorker review got it right-- overhyped, underwhelming. If you're going to eat in Greenpoint, go to Five Leaves.
