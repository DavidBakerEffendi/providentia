I wish this restaurant was a little closer to home, because trooping to Staten Island is a mission. However, I must say that I can't forget the taste of their guacamole with fried crisps, and mouth watering lamb chops. The portions may be pricey and small but there's no better way to control food intake than by adding a few $$$$. Overall, this place is amazing.
