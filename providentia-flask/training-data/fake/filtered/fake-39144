This place is a great example of how a popular format - in this case quality burgers - get a bunch of hype just because of the format. Ate lunch here with my brother-in-law during the work day. The burgers? Ok - 6/10 maybe. Too drippy, not a bunch of taste, too thick. There are places that do a way better job with the cheeseburger. Fries - good, not great. Service was bad. Confusing and borderline rude. seating is nuts. I just don't really get what this place wants to be. If its a rude Philly restaurant that makes great burgers...then they need to work on making better burgers.
