Came here with my wife for the much raved about burger. It is not on the dinner menu, but they will happily serve it to you if you ask. It did not disappoint. In a city with many excellent burgers, this is one of the best I have ever tasted. Their homemade hot sauce goes excellent with the fries. Service was excellent - we even got two donut holes for dessert on the house! It is a smallish restaurant, so I can imagine it gets quite crowded on the weekends, but was pretty much empty on a Monday evening. And for those that live in LES or the East Village, they deliver via Grubhub or Seamless (and the burger is on the delivery menu).
