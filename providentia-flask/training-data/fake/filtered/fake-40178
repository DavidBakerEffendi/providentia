best pizza in the whole world, forever. if forced to choose between a square and circle pie, i think that a sicilian pie with porcini mushrooms or with sausage and sun dried peppers is the way to go (this from a bell pepper hater.) this place is worth the wait, but don't come hungry or without a wide open schedule. i love Di Faras!
