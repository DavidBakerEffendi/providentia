This place is a horror. Three out of four meals were too salty and of poor quality. Fatty and raw pork chop, stems of vegetables. When we told the waitress she offered free coffee and desert. When we declined, the owner came over and was very close and very verbal, to the extent of extreme discomfort. He ran back to the kitchen and came to us with the discarded pork chop in his bare hands and began to tear it apart to make his point.We paid our bill and got out quick.Later I called the restaurant to again speak to the owner and our waitress took the call stating that she was a co-owner. She said,"You people came in with an attitude". She started to scream and called me several explicit names. I just hung up!
