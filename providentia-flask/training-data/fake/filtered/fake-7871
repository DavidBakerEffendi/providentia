I went for the first time on Friday after work to get some takeout.  I called in my order and went to pick it up about 20 minutes later.  The young man behind the counter was so welcoming and helpful and like many others I got to meet Sandra too who was just as friendly as other reviews have described!  They're moving to a cash only because of the high fees associated with cards but they still let me use my card yesterday because I didn't know.   Onto the food...I had the church plate with the BBQ pulled pork.  It was delicious!  It wasn't covered in BBQ sauce like I had expected, but it had great flavor with a little spice to it (maybe a dry rub?) and it was very moist and tasty!  My sides were all fantastic: fried okra, mac and cheese, collard greens, and yams.  So so good!  There was a square of cornbread included too.  The best part was the care they took in packaging the food so that everything stayed fresh and delicious, not soggy or on top of anything else!   This place is as good as everyone says and I can't wait to go back again!  You should definitely try it out for yourself!  Super friendly, great food!
