Based on the four-star rating, I decided to give this cafe a go for brunch today... Unfortunately, I have to say I wish I hadn't... The decor is lovely, it was busy and the service was great, good portions (maybe even too much) but the food was a huge let down. I ordered eggs benedict with an english muffin, spinach, potatoes, side of bacon and a pancake. The hollandaise sauce had absolutely no flavour which ruined the eggs for me. The potatoes were very lack lustre - no flavour and not crisp at all. If it wasn't for the bacon, I would have had a completely bland meal. The pancake was thick and heavy which made it unenjoyable and not very easy to eat.
