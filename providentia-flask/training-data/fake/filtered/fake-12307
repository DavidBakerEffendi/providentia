DOMINICK'S pizza is amazing, as well as their other menu items.    Whenever I am out of town, all I can think of is getting back home to have their pizza.  I love the traditional round pie with cheese, but you have to try the fresh garlic and tomato! WOW!  No, they do not deliver or offer coupons or take credit cards.  Why?  Because they don't have to or need to. People are willing to come there no matter what.  I have lived in Totowa for 32 years.  Many other pizzarias have come and gone, but Dominick's is always there because it is the best.
