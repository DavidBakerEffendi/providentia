After two visits, I am in love with this place - the food, the ambiance, the soundtrack - it all comes together for a memorable meal.   Somebody here cares about food and the experience of those eating his or her food.  Actually, it seems everyone that works there, cares about the details and your experience.  This restaurant is everything that is right with the Brooklyn dining scene - but don't even categorize it as that - just a wonderful restaurant that you will want to go back to and keep trying.  The bone marrow is so simple, beautiful and delicious, I crave the pasta with duck and I had a tripe dish last night that tasted like home (I'm 1st generation Italian - and I do NOT call sauce GRAVY).   This is not a place for big groups - so don't go with 5 of your friends - keep it simple, like they do and you will have a great experience.
