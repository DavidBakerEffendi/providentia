I found this hidden East Village spot three years ago and haven't left... Great Latino bistro with an awesome chill ambiance where a very fun eclectic crowd of Wallstreeters, East Village artsies,  Soho retailers, and other cool types mingle over  amazing cocktails and tasty PanLatino food served by super sexy and friendly wait staff and mixologists...  Don't expect an attitude or a clubby scene. Unbelievably, Yerba is a cool, anti-scene place where you can be comfortable with a date, your parents, or last night's hot trick!
