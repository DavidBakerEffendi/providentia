IT IS SO NOT WORTH IT! Waited an hour and a half for mediocre food, a rude wait staff, fruit punch sangria, and a LUNATIC manger ( i really hope he was not the -owner- and the owner reads this) I was warned , did not listen, and I came here and waited. Lesson learned!!!!!!! Use YELP ---look at the "unrecommended reviews" from people who do not YELP often, ... Do not waste your time and money on this! Domenic??...... If that really is your name and you do own this----- ride this wave now cause I can't imagine social media is going to allow your business to continue with a manager/owner like you.... After your disrespect tonight.... I will personally openly offer my opinion on what a horrid experience Â you are!
