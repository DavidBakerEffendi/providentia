I made plans to meet a friend for brunch 2 weeks in advance. Â Everything was great except my meal and how they chose deal with giving me a horrible Eggs Benedict with a thick piece of what they called ham...I called it an 80% wade of fat that I got a mouthful off and had to spit out in the napkin. Since this huge piece of fat was covered with eggs and sauce...I did not know until it was too late. Then they asked me if I cared for another $13 mimosa...I said yes...I personally spent $57 dollars yes...(including tip) for two drinks and a bad meal...nothing taken off the bill or given as an apology.
