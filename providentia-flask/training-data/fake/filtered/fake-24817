Extremely picturesque location. The Restaurant is designed to look like a country home in Giverny. Interesting steam effects are created by water devices in the outdoor area. We ordered Steak Frites, Potato Leek Soup, and Beet Salad. The cold Potato Leek Soup was the most amazing treat of the day. It was incredibly creamy, and tasted like the best chip dip I have ever had. The steak Frites were well cooked and the fries well seasoned. The Creme Brulee was just the right consistency. The sculpture park is included with the meal.
