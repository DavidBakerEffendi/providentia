my experiences have all been very positive - however, I will say that I mostly order takeout.  I went in once for a sit down dinner and the service was good and the food (tuna melt) excellent.  I only had one bad experience, when i called ahead for a lunch yet when i got there no one had any record of the phonecall so i had to wait a bit longer for the food - but still it was only ten minutes. I've had several salads, hamburger, hot turkey sandwich, gyro, tuna melt, french onion soup, lobster bisque - all have been excellent. I can't say one bad thing about the food - as for the service, like i said, i only ate IN the diner once, and it was positive.   Since they destroyed Rick's with het another Walgreen's - this is now my "go to" place when I'm too lazy to cook.
