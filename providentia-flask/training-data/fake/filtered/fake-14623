I was slightly leery when I first walked up. The truck itself isn't much to look at, a plain, if clean, little metal stall. Prices seemed a little high, for what I expected to be a standard size burrito. I got the carnitas, because I love seasoned pork in my taco, and I'm happy I did. The thing was *really* big, so much so that I got two meals out of it for $7. The beans, rice, cheese, meat and sour cream were very much in balance, and you could get different combinations just by rotating where you bit. If I have one knock it's that I asked for spicy and it wasn't quite as hot as I might have liked, but their level worked so well with the other seasonings that I'm really quibbling. I'll definitely be trying more from here.
