Unprofessional business asking me to pay for a wrong order - waitress fault. No bueno! After much back & forth w/various members of the staff, the chef agreed to make my original order. I stood hoping the restaurant would somehow redeem themselves. But, when I received a tasteless boney fried tilapia, i knew i should've walked out. I paid my bill for uneatable food & took a walk to BEETs on 7th Ave where they have great food w/portions big enuf to share.
