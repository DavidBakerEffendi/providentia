First of all, this is not an Indian restaurant even though some Indians seem to be bent on claiming it. This place doesn't stink of ginger/garlic paste that the usual Indian restaurants serve. It's really a Nepali/Tibetan restaurant for patrons who don't want to curse the owners the next morning. It's a reasonably priced place with tons of options. Take their menu to any Indian and ask them which one sounds like an authentic Indian dish! Yeah, I thought so. Hands off my Himalayn food! My recommendations: Ruthang Momo Chasha Shamdey Pan Fried Sha Momo You're welcome.
