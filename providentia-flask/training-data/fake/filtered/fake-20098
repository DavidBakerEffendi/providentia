Seems like slowly but surely the hype has affected this place. I've gone twice now with similar results - the famed pancakes were runny in the middle and my accompanying sides - sausage the first time, turkey bacon the second - were underdone and burned to a crisp, respectively. It was packed and the servers were harried. One passed my waving hand twice before realizing I hadn't ordered yet, and several people nearby had to ask repeatedly for silverware. A family sitting on the stools next to me ordered breakfast and sent most of it right back. I heard the mom say under her breath "This is definitely not like it was last time I was here." I think that might be the case now - it probably was the business when it was a little-known spot serving up breakfast for working folks heading to their City Hall or Walnut Street offices. Now the word's out, they're busy and they're getting sloppy. Shame, because I'm a pancake fiend and I have yet to find a good stack in Philly outside of IHOP. I have had the apple dumplings - not bad, but I wouldn't really make a special trip for them. Would much rather snag some dark-chocolate-covered pretzels at Mueller's.
