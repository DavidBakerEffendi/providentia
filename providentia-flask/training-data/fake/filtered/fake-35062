OH MY GOSH. The food here is absolutely incredible. I had the vegetarian bahn mi which is a little spicy and beyond flavorful. The combination of the warm baguette, the savory tofu and the veggies was divine. The vegetarian pho was scrumptious as well. The light broth is satisfying and perfectly unsalted. The sweet potato fries were delicious and only $3! What a steal. We also ordered the sauteed broccoli and it was so nicely seasoned. Yummy! Can't wait to go back : )
