This diner was a perfect place to stop on our vacation travels home to CT. We found it by accident avoiding traffic and we were pleasantly surprised and pleased with the service, food and atmosphere. The patrons as well as the staff were all very nice. We accidentally left behind our young son's brand new souvenir hat and since we were on the way home to CT, we couldn't return to retrieve it. Â We called on the off chance that they would have found it and as soon as I explained our predicament, the woman on the phone offered to mail it out to me right away. I thanked her and several days later the hat arrived in the mail! What a small but wonderful way to be kind! We will certainly recommend this diner to anyone and will try to return if our travels ever take us back that way.
