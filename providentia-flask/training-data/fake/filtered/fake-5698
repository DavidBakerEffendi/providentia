First time I visited Dalessandro's was in 1968, just before I married my wife at Leverington Church on Ridge ave. The best steak, anywhere in Philly. It's been almost 25 years since we've been back. I live with my wife here in Virginia Beach, Va. They try to imitate Philly steaks, but always ruin them with ROLLS that destroy the intent of the steak. Hope to come up before Christmas, to make our Visit a GIFT, and great memory with a LARGE, traditional Dalessandro STEAK....Yum. I can almost taste it from 230 miles away.
