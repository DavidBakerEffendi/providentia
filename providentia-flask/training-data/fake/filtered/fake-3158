Pizza is nice and hot at lunchtime. Slices are giant and inexpensive. This is one of the best pizza restaurants I have tried and would tell a friend but still not that perfect. My wife really liked ricotta one but spinach one was tasteless. When we came there in the evening slices weren't that fresh.
