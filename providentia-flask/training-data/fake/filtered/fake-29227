Mexico is our most loved travel destination and by far our most favorite cuisine. La Taqueria on Fresh Pond Rd is the closest thing you will get to Mexico without actually traveling. The food here is so amazing and athentic that my boyfriend and I come here 2-3 times a week. The owners are wonderful and the staff is very friendly. I would highly reccomend getting the shrimp tacos, the surf and turf and the corn. soooo gooood! So happy we finally have such a good Mexican restaurant in the neighboorhood!
