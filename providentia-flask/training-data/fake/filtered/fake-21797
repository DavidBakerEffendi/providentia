While visiting Philly on business, I went to the Reading Terminal Market several times for lunch. Great selection and reasonable prices in a historic venue. If you visit the fresh fruit/veggie stands before they close you can get great deals as most of the normal bags of produce that go for $3-4 are marked down to a $1!
