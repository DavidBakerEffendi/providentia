Went here for the first time with two of my friends. We sat in the back garden, for three hours laughing, joking & enjoying the food and hookah. Our waitress was beyond wonderful, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was beautiful. I would absolutely recommend this restaurant to others. Thank you for a great night!!!
