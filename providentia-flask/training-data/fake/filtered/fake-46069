Antinori was simply excellent from the moment I walked through the door.  Impressive service, wonderful ambience and simply terrific cuisine!  It was a warm evening in the city, and I enjoyed a cute table on the terrace.  I stay at the DoubleTree whenever I come to NYC on business, and  Antinori never disappoints.  So glad they are there to offer an excellent dining experience and a respite from a busy day.  I will be back!
