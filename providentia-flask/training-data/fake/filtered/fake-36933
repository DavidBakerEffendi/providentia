Delicious!! We ordered Mussels, cheese dish and potato latke for Appetzers. It was all good but the potato Latke with salmon tartar was a real standout. The duck breast we got was also yammi, it melted in your mouth. I really wanted to try their bread pudding since I heard it was also good, but didn't have enough space in my belly. Highly recommend this place, also very romantic.
