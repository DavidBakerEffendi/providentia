If you are looking for a Chinese restaurant that has a great menu, fresh ingredients, and an affable owner this is your place! I am simple guy when it comes to ordering from Chinese places - egg drop orwonton soup, beef and broccoli and roast pork fried rice kinda guy etc, etc Oh and I love, LOVE spare ribs! So with that in mind if you are looking for a less greasy, freshly prepared meal this is your place. Hands down the best Chinese food in the area.
