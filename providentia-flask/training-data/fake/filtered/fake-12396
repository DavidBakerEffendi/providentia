Great place.  I always liked but don't usually don't go out of my way for Mediterranean food, but this place has the most delicious lamp chops and reasonable prices.  I think they have about two main seatings every night.  It fills up to the brim at 6pm (it is big - two floors)  and then empties out by 10pm.  Very efficient and pleasant service.
