BAR BITES! Mmmmmmmm. So good. The Bison Bites are also quite amazing. And the bacon cheeseburger? Oh my god.. WoodnTap definitely has the best cooked burgers, in my book, in Orange. And they are reasonably priced..ish... Could be cheaper but honestly they cook it exactly as you request it.. I work at a store right down the street and if I'm closing, my buddy and I always run in there and grab a couple beers and some bar bites, for him bison bites. Did I mention they have a freakin' amazing beer selection? And the staff is very polite and fun to be around.
