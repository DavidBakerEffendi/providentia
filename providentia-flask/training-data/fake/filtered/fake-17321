First, I must admit that the selection of Italian food here is excellent. The store is a big, beautiful and clean establishment. That said, I have to admit that the prices are on the high side, but you are paying for quality. It might be helpful though if they included more moderately priced products along with the high end stuff. Risoldi's Market and Porfirios in the same township offer more modestly priced  Italian food, but not in such high end surroundings. I shoudnt need to cash a cd to buy a couple of packages of pasta, But the worst thing about the place is the out and out rudeness of some of the staff members. Some of the men behind the deli counter are abrupt and definitely unfriendly.  But the  most disturbing aspect is one of the women who runs the check out. I have had a couple of negative, distinctly hostile encounters with her, and I know several people who have had similar experiences with her. A friend of mine complained about this lady to a man who appeared to be a manager or owner and his response was that the woman in question was a family member and they couldnt do anything about her attitude.
