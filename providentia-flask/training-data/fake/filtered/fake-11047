My first visit to Lot 2 was for brunch yesterday, and on that basis, I'll look forward to going back for dinner. Two of us shared the egg strata (made yesterday with swiss chard, mushrooms, and parmesan) and pork jowl hash. The strata was great; light, fluffy, with just the right amount of the day's special ingredients. It was accompanied by a simple arugula salad, which scored points for the quality of its dressing. The hash was also very good, not overly heavy or greasy, and brightened a bit by roasted brussels sprouts. Good coffee and (loose leaf) tea. Lot 2 takes a risk with such a limited menu, but if everything is as well-executed as yesterday's dishes, the kitchen has made a smart move. I'll always take a small menu of offerings done well over the alternative. If I had to make a criticism, it would be of the dining room's spartan decor. I understand and appreciate minimalism, and get the idea as it relates to these nouveau-barnyard joints, but a couple oversized photos (of fall's bounty, naturally) or chalkboards or found farm implements hung on the walls would go a long way toward giving the place a sense of permanence.
