Boqueria. A nice place to go for Tapas. Service is was very pleasing. Waitress took time to answer all questions. She wasn't sure of a few minor details, but I asked about 15 questions. She found out everything right away. It's all good. The place has a nice feel to it. Capable of getting a little too busy, but nothing a tasty bite of deliciousness doesn't wash away. Tapas - They've got WELL over a dozen options: - Baby Squid - With Scallions and Tomato - Tortilla Hispaniola - Omelet w/ potatos and onions. - Bombas - Beef and potato croquettes - Almond stuffed dates wrapped in bacon (3 orders please - assuming i'm alone) - Colorado lamb Pintxos - Baaaaaaangin. You don't have to stick to just tapas. i recommend ordering 4 to 7 tapas for the table, varying #'s of each, depending - then everyone order a single dish for just them. Some choice picks: Shredded salt cod; Pimientos w/ smoked pork belly; Fried Brussels sprouts w/ apples and marcona (the best) almonds. Very nice wine/beverage menu as well. I tried a taste of about 75% of their dessert options. All were muy, muy delicioso. Over all a TOUCH on the pricey side for what you get, but hey, fuck it. Nice work Boqu'.
