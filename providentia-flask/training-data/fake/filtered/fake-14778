A girlfriend and I went on a Saturday afternoon about two weeks ago for lunch. Had a great experience with a very friendly waiter, Barry.....he was very new, but anything we asked, he either knew the answer or found out quickly for us...he was definitely working hard! Ordered fish tacos and they were very good. Decided to go back to dinner last night with two girlfriends....same great experience but our waiter was Luigi, who was also very good....we shared the mozzarella basil spring rolls (delish) and the spinach artichoke dip, also great! Â CK and I had crab cakes which were delish and TH had the macadamia crusted salmon....we all agreed we really liked our dinners. Would definitely go back....lots of fun!!
