Father knows the owner so review is dependent on so. THEE MOST DELICIOUS authentic italian food!, i'm talking better than little italy and wherever places. If italian dishes doused in cheese, this isn't for you. Ambiance: great crowd, not too crazy noisy, and always has new portraits on the wall. Great service as the waiters help one another out without even speaking to one another. Food: MUST order- any pasta as they're made from scratch along with their sauce, and the steak drizzled with truffle oil- it's gunna melt in your mouth. My father comes here at least once a week, and we Â celebrate family occasions here; I come at least once a month if not twice a month. = A MUST considering I eat here at least twice a month. I have yet to find an AUTHENTIC italian restaurant since.
