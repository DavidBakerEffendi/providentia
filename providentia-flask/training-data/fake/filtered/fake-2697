I've been eating at Algarve since 1997. And, while I've been somewhat disappointed with the service once or twice in these last 14 years (and ONLY once or twice), I must say, the service has ALWAYS been friendly and the food has NEVER disappointed. The atmosphere is great whether you're in jeans or in a tux, you're going to feel comfortable. And, if you go, odds are, we will be there at the same time.
