Patti G. My husband and I went to The Shannon Rose on Route 35 in Woodbridge, NJ for the first time tonight.  I always thought the outside was so beautiful and it is, but the inside blew me away.  I felt like I took a trip to Ireland!  Amazing and authentic, and as cozy as you can get!  The hostess who sat us was very courteous, and our waiter John was extremely efficient and also, never hurts, very friendly!  He made our dinner a really nice experience.  The salads were fantastic, and OMG, the food was home style cooking that actually relieved my stress.  Comfort food, only healthy  : ).  I had the amazing Shephards Pie which I cannot say enough good things about.  Every bite was a treat!  And the warm Irish soda bread with soft butter was unbelievable!  My husband had the sirloin streak with mushrooms, a baked potatoe and fresh green beans seasoned to perfection!  And his plate looked like it was cooked in your family kitchen with large portions and real care put into taste and presentation.  The lighting is so soothing!  Yet you see people having a great time in a quiet atmosphere with light music in the background.  Very homey and cozy!!  The prices for everything are affordable and fair and you really get what you pay for.   Honestly, it was a great night out and is now going to be my favorite place to go out for dinner  : ).  I cannot say enough GREAT things about this beautiful pub!
