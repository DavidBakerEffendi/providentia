I have to add an update to my first review. All I can say is that no matter how much I eat their food I never get tired of their food. Me and my fiancee ate from there the first time and she enjoyed the shrimp dish so much that she went on a madd hunt for this shrimp dish again. Tonight she order and found the shrimp she had. The shrimp dish is called Goan Shrimp Curry and she said it was AMAZING!! Unfortunately I don't like shrimp but the Chicken Tikka Masala is GREAT as well!!! I would recommend this Restaurant to anybody!!!!!
