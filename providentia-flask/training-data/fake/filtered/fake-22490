My suggestion fellow Yelper - Take the NY Times Review if you dine here.  Compare the decor with Home Depot fixtures - notice the similarity?  The ceiling is very pretty though. Sadly, the tables are set out on the main floor like a food court.  This dawg ain't gonna last without a serious redo.  But I leave it to you to decide if you happen to go.  But if you go, compare your experience with the gushing Times review.  Hello?  Reality check?  Picture in the Times was very flattering, BTW. The Hen Ragu - Rubber pasta in a child's cereal bowl.  If it was an over-the-top Ragu -  that could and would be be overlooked.  But the under-boiled, rubbery Ronzoni lasgna (parpadelle ?? - not as I know it on this planet) reminded me that fresh pasta is readily available in New Haven and surrounds. That dish was highly touted by the Times. Really?  "Hen" ?? - not chicken??...Hmmm, okay term of art I guess.   The Steak - Outback Steakhouse Reject. Nuff' Said there.  Put that dish out of its misery or humanely dispose of the pitiful cow you must have taken that fatty piece of grisle from.  That dish got a photo in the Times. Really? Your kidding - right? Wine List - $30/$60/$90 - No real finds nor values.  I don't mind dropping serious coin for a good bottle - but give me something to spend my money to enjoy with the meal.  That's so easy to do. Bottomline - Owners need sit down, ignore the NYTimes fantasy review and take a serious look at  the food.  Foodies will eat in a hole-in-the-wall if the grub is great.  It's all about the food and that fell way short of even reasonably good here.  Service was good, BTW.  But I won't return because of service.
