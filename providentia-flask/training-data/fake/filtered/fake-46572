The food was great (I had duck breast), but my experience with the service was unpleasant at best, especially due to the host. From the start he made us feel like he thought we probably couldn't afford to eat at Hudson Clearwater (we are both 24). We didn't have a reservation so he told us we could only sit at the chef's table--which we were totally cool with--but there were 3 or 4 empty tables the whole time we were there, and we weren't allowed to sit at one. I tried to sit catty-corner from my boyfriend at the chef's table so that I could face him, but I was asked to move back to my original seat (there was no one around us). A couple near us asked if the window could be closed because one of them was getting over the flu, the host said "ehhh I'll ask." It was never closed while we were there. Like I said, the food was great, but I felt the staff was unaccommodating and unwelcoming.
