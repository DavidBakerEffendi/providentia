We went here about 10 times in the last 2 years, the food is OK, but some of their waiters are unbelievably rude, even though I never tipped less than 18%. The last time we went there, we had 10 people, and we asked for 12 seats table, considering it was Tuesday, and their store was 90 percent empty, that's not an excessive request. The waiter refused initially, then ask for more tips for giving us the 12 seats table!!! We walked out after hearing this, and this would be our last visit there. The manager were not present that day. I hope he/she could see this.
