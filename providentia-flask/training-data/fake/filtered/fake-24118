OK for the basics. Not many healthy options. Refused to redeem "Restaurant.com" certificate. Sorry, but putting a sign on your door about a service you voluntarily signed up for doesn't help me when I am buying the certificate at home a week before. Doubt I will ever go back. The hostess spends too much time gabbing & getting in the waitresses way. Really slows up the servers.
