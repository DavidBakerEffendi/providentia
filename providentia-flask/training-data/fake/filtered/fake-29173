First off this place is amazing the atmosphere is so aesthetically pleasing that I would recommend everyone to come by just to read a book and hang out. I came by the other day with only enough time to get a pastry and a latte.I was immediately hit by all the delicious smells.then when I got to the register I was greeted by this girl with a huge smile on her face. She made it seem like that was a great plave ro work. I placed my order, for an eclair and vanilla latte. Upon receiving the éclair I was distracted and ended up leaving without my latte! I was halfway down the street when that same girl came running after me with my drink.  Maison really has a great staff who cares.  I'll definitely be returning. Not only for the great staff but as well for those éclairs!
