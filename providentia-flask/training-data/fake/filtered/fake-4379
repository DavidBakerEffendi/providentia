We went for our 20th anniversary as most of the restaurants in our area are closed during stick season or still closed from Irene (e.g., The Common Man, Hen of the Woods). Service was fine and the appetizers (mussels and a cheese plate) were great, but the both entrees (salmon and NY strip) were so salty it overwhelmed the flavor of the food. It was the first time I've had mushrooms that tasted more like salt than butter or mushrooms. The steak was stringier and chewier than we're used to with Vermont steak. The Vesper cocktail was perfect. We did not stay for dessert. This was not a good choice for a special occasion.
