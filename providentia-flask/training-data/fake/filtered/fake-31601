Went here the other night with a group of friends.  The view of the city skyline was breathe taking and the food was stellar.  We all shared dishes and all were great.  Our server Alexandra Sanchez made sure our visit was one to remember and paired drinks with our entrees perfectly.  Her knowledge of the menu was impressive and dessert recommendations were spot on to our liking. Will ask to be sat in her section my next visit for sure.
