I like their food, you can say it's the best Vn restaurant I've been to in Burlington. However, the service was not very good. We don't go to restaurant not just for food, but also to enjoy the atmostphere, to be served nicely, professionaly. We went to this place on Saturday night, it wasn't crowded, but it took so long for them to serve a party of six. My brother and my Mom got their food first, then 20 minute later my sis and her boyfriend got their food after the rest of us asked to see if we can bring our food home, cause at that time my brother and my Mom had done their meals. So unprofessional. I really like their food but it's not worth the wait
