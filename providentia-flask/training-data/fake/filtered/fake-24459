09/12/14 Probably it was the French wine that the waitress recommended but I fell in love with Buvette! Tiny, cramped yet we were all very relaxed. Service is great. Food is satisfactory, wines are fantastic!! Their entrees are tapas size but overall filling for a girly appetite. Can't wait to try out their Brunch menu!
