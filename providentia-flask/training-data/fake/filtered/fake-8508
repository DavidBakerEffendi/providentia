Great thin crust pizza!  My favorite is the Shrimp Scampi Pizza.  Sausage also very good.  Nice long bar, often attractive female bartenders.  Mixed drinks a bit pricey for a neighborhood bar/restaurant.  Small but excellent menu.  My favorite entree is Steak Giambotta.  Love the baby artichokes w breadcrumb appetizer.  Can't go wrong here.  Located in strip mall with a Foodtown.
