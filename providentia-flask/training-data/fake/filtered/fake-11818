I came here for our anniversary lunch today! I decided to take my boyfriend here bc I heard so many great reviews about this place I really had to try it. The atmosphere is just perfect. The dining area is very nice. WE were greeted very warm and professionally by Goran.The Calamari was out of this world, one of the best we had out of all the restaurants we ever ate at. The pizza was delicious. I have to say its probably the best pizza on state street. Modern pizza can move way over bc Da Legna is definitely on top of my list! Â Even though it got a little busy Goran took the time to chat with us and treated us like we were long time friends. I will surely be returning, I was impressed with everything :)
