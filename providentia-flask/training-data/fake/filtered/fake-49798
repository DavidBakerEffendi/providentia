Don't need to bother going there. Unless you are not hungry and have too much money to waste. In this place, almost nothing is right. Trust me, they forced you to order for 2 people, hot pot, but it's not even enough for one, and it's not even half good as the shabu shabu we ate elsewhere. the Â only reason I give one star is because the green tea ice cream at end which come w/the order is very delicious.
