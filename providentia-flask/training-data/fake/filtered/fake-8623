I can't believe all the positive reviews of this place. Their pizza is THE WORST. Honestly, you have to TRY to make pizza this bad. It's greasy and tasteless. I live 1 block away -- ONE BLOCK -- and anytime I've ordered pizza for deliver from them it shows up stone cold. For a while I liked their chicken parm sandwich. The last time I got one the chicken was so undercooked that even the thin fillet they use was pink in the middle. Not good. Stay away from this place. Frank, the owner, is a stupid jackass who won't even talk to you about your "dissatisfaction". He'll just curse you out.
