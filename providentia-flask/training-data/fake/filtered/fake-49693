I used to be a big fan of this restaurant.  At one time, the food was heavenly, the ambiance sublime and the service impeccable.  Sadly, Steven Starr has ruined another gem with his kistchy, cookie-cutter management.  The food is no different from what you will find at any of his restaurants in Philly.  The waitstaff are vacant and the "hostess" would have seemed right at home with the cast from Jersey Shore.  It was nice to still go somewhere that felt special and decadent.  Last time we were there, we were seated next to a couple in cut-off shorts and flip-flops.  The high tandards have gone right out the window.  I really miss how special this once was.  It is truly a shame.
