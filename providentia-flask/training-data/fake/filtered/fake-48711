My daughter and her boyfriend are big fans of Lidia since they have been to her pricey restaurants. Becco has made me a big fan of Lidia and I am going to this restaurant whenever I am in town. The bread, bread sticks, olives, & white bean dip for starters where just to difficult to stay away from. For entree, I had the sliced steak sprinkled with shredded horseradish and served on roasted root vegetables and buckwheat polenta. The chef would not even hear it if your order is other than rare or medium rare.... Chef's right the steak melts in your mouth. That dish would always linger in my buds. Dessert was zabaglione with fresh berries but since I am a big fan of panna cottas, I wished I ordered that instead. I still finished the zabaglione though by myself! Oh... don't forget about the great staff! Only one of few places I've been where the moment you turn your head one of the staff will be there for you. And they are very knowledgeable of what they serve, & warm & friendly! I'm very glad I agreed with my daughter to go for Becco. Too bad though, we were so stuffed that we dropped going to see the movie "Julie & Julia" and headed back to our hotel.
