I struggle to relate with the positive reviews for this horrible restaurant. I'm ashamed to call myself Italian after eating here. I had reservations placed three weeks in advance at 9pm for 8 people. Our party arrived on time and were told to wait 5 minutes. We didn't get seated until after 10pm. Each time we asked how long for our table, and each time were told 5 minutes. After a half hour went by, we asked to speak to the manager. We were told no. We asked for him/her to come by when they were available. They never showed their face. We were seated at a table that maybe could seat 5. Maybe. The bus boys filled half our party's water glasses, and then failed to return to fill the rest. The waiters were running all over the place and sweating profusely. Not to mention the body odor all had. Which is understandable in such tight quarters to operate. But certainly unacceptable when they reach directly over your head to serve you. The food is way overrated. The bread was heated in an oven, however not brought to our table hot. So we were forced to enjoy hard, cold bread. Bread in Italian restaurants should be used for oil and soaking up sauce. You cannot soak with rock-like bread. The lettuce used for salads was brown. The pasta sauces were bland, watery, and lacked flavor. The chicken and veal was 100% frozen before cooked. The restaurant may also have the worst atmosphere in the entire city. They pack tables on top of each other (literally touching each other) at both locations. The tableware is old, bent, chipped, and cracked. Ask for a new wine glass because yours is chipped and you'll get a water glass. There is absolutely no redeeming qualities about this restaurant. Especially with other BYOB gems such as Branzino within a block away. Caff√© Casta Diva, Melograno, and Mercato are among others close by as well. Don't bother wasting your time and money at La Viola.
