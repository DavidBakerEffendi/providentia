I ordered food from here yesterday (11/22/14) and I have never had a food allergy in my life. After eating their food I began to develop bad hives and my throat began to get tight. My brother had called the restaurant to simply ask what ingredients that may be in their recipe to figure out what it is I could have been possibly allergic too. All they did was give him an attitude and refused to tell us the ingredients. They did not care.
