My family hosted my 40th birthday celebration at Centro this past weekend!  Everything from the planning of the night throughout the party was great.  Joe helped us plan everything, from the menu, which we were able to add on some items that we wanted with no problem, to were we were gonna be sitted for the dinner of 28 guests.  The staff really did an amazing job at helping us with everything.  The four course dinner we choose had apps, salad to order, pasta course and than the main meal.  Alot of Filet's were ordered by our guests all came out cooked perfect.  Everyone loved the food!  We were able to use the outside area to sit and talk between course's, it was a beautiful night which made this even better. We cant thank Joe and his staff for everything they did to accomadate us!  we defenitaly will be back.
