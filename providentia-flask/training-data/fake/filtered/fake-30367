Our last time at Saraghina was an amazing experience. We ate outside in their beautiful garden, we loved the octopus salad, the burrata was the best I have EVER had. The grilled chicken was perfect, and well priced. Â Service was superb considering how packed it was! After reading these reviews i have to disagree about the "soggy pizza" . The pizza is not soggy, it is how good pizza should be. Best Tiramisu I have ever had, great Pana Cotta, tasty gelato, good coffee, I dont know what else to say :) See you next time Saraghina :)
