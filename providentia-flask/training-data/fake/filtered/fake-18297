I live in the heart of Princeton and I go to DiAngelo's all the time!  It is a great addition to Princeton.  Its Italian, Sicilian dishes are delicious.  The pastry is unbelievable.  They have their own pastry chef and it makes a huge difference.   The owners and staff are friendly and give good service. I recommend D'Angelo's to all my friends and I drag them there for a capuccino and pastry.
