My husband and I waited 25 minutes to receive our orders -- eggs-over-easy for me, bacon burger for him. This was around 3 in the afternoon, and the place was not busy. When the food finally arrived my eggs were scrambled not over-easy, and the waitress brought rye toast instead of the whole-wheat I'd ordered. My husband's burger had no bacon. "I didn't hear you say bacon" the waitress argued. The fries were unbelievably greasy and had a weird texture, as if they'd been dipped in breadcrumbs before being fried (breaded fries? what a concept). They made me queasy and I couldn't eat them. Worst was the orange marmelade I spread on my toast -- I realized too late that there was a bad smell to it and it tasted revolting. How old could it have been? And stored how? When it came time to leave, the waitress could not be found to prepare our check. While waiting for someone else to do it I mentioned our unhappy experience to the manager, who just shrugged. I'm actually not a picky person about food, and we were very, very hungry. But this was the WORST diner experience I've ever had!!
