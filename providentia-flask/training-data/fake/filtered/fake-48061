We arrived around 8:30p.m. hostess said we'd have a 30 minute wait and we were finally seated after waiting for well over an hour (after checking in with her repeatedly). The food was good (I had the ravioli) and they gave us appetizers: the chips and string beans which were great. I would come back but would definitely make a reservation first.
