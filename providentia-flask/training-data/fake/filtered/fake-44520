The best I've ever had... enough said! OK... ok... maybe I owe to you guys an explanation. I love Indian Food and have loved it since I was introduced to it at the age of twelve through my best friend's family who are Indian by the way. Today I am a consultant and I travel quite a bit and one of the things I do everywhere I go is find good Indian restaurants. I've been in Philly for about the last three months on a project and I should say I've tried a handful of Indian Restaurants. I went to Karma maybe the third week I was in town. I absolutely loved it and have not found any other place that compares to the quality of food and friendly service. This past weekend I made my way over to Karma once again and needless to say they won me over a second time around by giving me an even better experience then the first. I have to say Karma is one of the best restaurants I've been to and possibly the best Indian restaurant I've been to in my life's journey. I recommend this place to anyone in search for great Indian food in Philadelphia.
