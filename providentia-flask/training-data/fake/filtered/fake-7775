Went there for my daughter's 18th Birthday Dinner and we weren't impressed. I had been there previously for a Bachelorette Party and thought that their Guacamole and appetizers were pretty good. Apparently, that's about all they had going for themselves. We waited a while to be served, the place was obnoxiously noisy and my Tequila was water down. I would not recommend this place! Their Guacamole's not even worth the trouble!
