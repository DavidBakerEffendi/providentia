The best pizza I have ever tasted....everyone I have never met anyone that doesnt love this pizza...They use the caitupiri cheese which is heaven almost a cross between monterrey and cream cheese..and the toppings are unbelievable. One slice and you are good... even though I have to have at least 2. My picky kids chow down...everyone Brazilian or not loves this pizza. My friend from the south recently tried it and is hooked. I dont know Â what the other reviews are talking about but this pizza is the bomb. Try the chef's special. If you want something different than bread and cheese try this place...warning though it's addictive.
