Finally a Cicis is open near me. Have been seeing the advertisement for years. Went there on a Friday evening. The place was really packed with families. Great environment, loved the food. The food was worth the wait. Service was very prompt. Salad was extremely fresh, the salad is way better than the Salad you get at Oliver Garden. Chicken noodle soup was really flavorful. They made sure the buffet was always full and the pizzas were being rotated. Loved the meat lovers pizza, taco pizza was very good as well. My favorite was the deep dish Cheese pizza, it was like Cheesy bread from Pizza Hut but 200% better than any other Cheesy bread..slurp! Spinach alfredo was good as well and brownies and Cinnamon rolls were to die for! I will go there again tomorrow just for the brownies and Cinnamon rolls. The place was clean, lot of young kids were working the night I went but, they were all very energetic and smiling. Loved the chant they did, didn't really get the chant but it created a nice environment. I loved the welcome and good bye and the way they referred me by the name. Loved the girl Christine that took care of our table. She was awesome and too sweet. The staff even refilled my sodas. Did't expect all this things for just $5.79 and the food was extremely fresh and tasteful.
