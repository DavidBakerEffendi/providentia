The atmosphere is inviting, a nice bar but food & service disappointing.  Young and inexperienced staff, salads served warm and hot meals served room temperature. Pasta dish had 4 gnocci swimming in red sauce.  Veal dish breaded and served on a bed of romaine lettuce.  Cold & unappetizing.  Would not venture back to this place, not recommended.
