I'm a big fan of Japanese however, Ippudo didn't make the third star. The noodle soup was unimpressive as mine was extremely salty for some particular reason. The most annoying thing I had to deal with when dining here was the constant screaming from all the staff that worked there. I'm not sure if it was a custom or even understood what they were saying. The noise pollution here is beyond me. Will not come back.
