Great addition to the neighborhood. Â Terrific menu for brunch or dinner. The Shakshuka is every bit as good as the one served at Ottolenghi in London. Good wine list. Wonderful service from a staff that delights in introducing you to dishes and tastes you might not be familiar with. If you like Mogador you'll love Zizi Limona.
