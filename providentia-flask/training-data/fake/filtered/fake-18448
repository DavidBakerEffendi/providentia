This restaurant was absolutely amazing! The meal was incredible from start to finish. I recommend getting the ceviche appetizer. It was delicious. Another highlight was their signature flaming cigar desert. It was a perfect ending to my dinner. The service was awesome as well. My waiter was super polite and made some tasty recommendations I thoroughly enjoyed. Â  If you're in the area, you're missing out if you don't stop by this place. Seriously.
