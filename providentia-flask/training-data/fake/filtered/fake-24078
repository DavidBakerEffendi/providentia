Do yourself a favor and visit Marigold Kitchen in Philly for a wonderful dining experience.  The ambiance is cozy,  wait staff very friendly and professional, and the general manager makes sure you are comfortable and happy.  Every plate (14 small courses) was beautiful to look at and more importantly delicious; and by the end of the experience, very filling satisfying.  This is unlike most restaurants that you will visit.  It's very special and you won't regret it!
