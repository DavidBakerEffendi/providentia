Love, love, love Parc! It has a great French romantic, laid back open air atmosphere that is good for groups or couples or friends. My best friend and I visit whenever we are in town to catch up and have a wonderful meal together. We used to live in NYC and it reminds me of Pastis (but bigger) or an upscale French Roast. The restaurant itself is huge but reservations are a must because it can get crowded. I like the croque Monsieur. The trout was out of this world as well. They also give you a nice basket of French breads. Â You can't go wrong here - it's a whole experience!
