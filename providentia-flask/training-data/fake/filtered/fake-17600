Everyt ime I come here I feel like I went to Italy and I'm at a Pizzeria, sharing an exquisite glass red wine or a pint of Peroni at the bar with my best friend, with an awesome bartender that makes me not want to leave this place ever. I live around the corner but I had come a couple times to the bar for happy hour during the spring and it was busy and the manager Marcos completely ignored me and when he saw me he was very short tempered and rude to my face so I decided to never come back until recently when a friend invited me to have a birthday drink. From starters, they have $4 house wines that are surprisingly delicious, and the $6 Aperol Spritz the bartender Christopher or Christian (who I call Chris) made me was off the charts. The crowd was very chill  and the service SUPERB!!! and we literally stayed for three hours because I FELT LIKE I WAS  at HOME . Chris was amazing! he walked me through the menu, described each item with so much passion, he ended up convincing us and we had a full three course dinner with Appetizers, Main Course and Dessert and a bottle of wine I let the bartender choose. Such AMAZING was our experience that we decided to come back every week and we have been coming ever since, we sit at the bar and let Chris do his magic. I LOVE THIS RESTAURANT and I have brought my whole family who loves it too. I gave the restaurant 3 stars because I believe Mr. Manager Marcos needs to re-adjust his attitude a little bit and if it wasn't for HIS staff and how they treat me I wouldn't come back ever again.  He already turned away two of my friends. Keep up the good work and we will be coming back this Friday!! HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!
