The food is the best in the area. Jake's Steak House, the Market Table, Simon Pearce, really everything I've tried in this area pales in comparison. Don't waste your time trying other places. Stick to wine. Adam selects the best. Honestly, I'm not sure how he gets the bottles since you can't find them in VT liquor stores or groceries. As for cocktails, keep them simple and you'll be happy.
