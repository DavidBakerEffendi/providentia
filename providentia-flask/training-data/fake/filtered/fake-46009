Super nice environment with multiple floors to dine in. The place is very upscale, but for a casual crowd. The bar was well stocked and the food was excellent. We tried the seafood tier with flat bread shrimp pizza which were out of this world. Can't wait to go back and try the short ribs and oxtails! Â Great place to take friends and quiet enough to take a date. The staff is very friendly and they are full time personnel so they are very professional. You won't be disappointed.
