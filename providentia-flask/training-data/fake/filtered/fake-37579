This place was horrible!! My sister and I waited for 15 minutes to order and they completing IGNORED us!!! Then my mum came and was like why are you ignoring them!? It says u open at 5 and it's 10 past?! Then surprise surprise, 5 seconds latr they start serving. Also I've had it before and the food tasted like CRAP!!!! Don't go.
