I love the hibachi here, and even the regular dinner is nice. It's a perfect place for a small event or gathering like a birthday, or even a graduation dinner. The food is always very good -- and the hibachi cowboys are always good for a laugh this only thing is that I'm allergic to mushrooms and several times I've had to tell them to bring me regular broth instead of their normal appetizer. They also put shrimp into their hibachi so do let them know ASAP if you're allergic or it might ruin your food. Over all it's a great place!
