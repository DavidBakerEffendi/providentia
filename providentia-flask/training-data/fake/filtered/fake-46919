So here goes, sitting at the mac store in center city and i just have to write this.   Please excuse the grammar and mis-wording because i was so disappointed that this may be a different form of a review.      As we entered we decided to valet which was the wrong decision because it cost thirty bucks on a Sunday morning.  We entered and were expected something reminiscent of Lacroix  .......the food was aweful.. pitchers of eggs for omelettes , pre-poached eggs for eggs benedict ....dirty serving spoons ....the food staff was marrying dishes in the dining room....i wanted some grapes but the spoon had cheese on it...one cheese plate which was in shambles and all mixed up ...only had 3 cheese.s left on it...half frozen crab legs......the dessert tasted as it it was uncovered in the fridge.......  the salmon was great and lamb was nice but that was it as far as selection goes it was underwhelming and for 70 bucks you would expect more.....we got seated basically with a view of the food tables and next to the server station......thats just about the food and not all of it....the waiters were nice  yet the tables were un-cleaned and a mess at one point we did not have water for five minutes....  we had to share a napkin that was dirty until we asked for another one......the silverware was being thrown in to the server station and very noisy.....the platers and cutters staff at the food station looked hung over and did not even know there sauces...we work in the service industry and understand all aspects so to write this it kills us but it was un acceptable...everything about this place was dis-appointing   the tab came to 178.oo and i never complain...but this time i refused to pay for it...we told the manager and he was happy to take half off and even at that we feel like we got ripped off it was still 100....matter of fact we should of had the whole thing comped.......this place is no lacroix  hopefully dinner will be different...............to finish this was only the surface so much more was wrong with this place!
