Went to check this place out for its ranking in the TOP 10 BBQ spots in Philly.  Drove down on a Sunday afternoon, about 2:30PM, the  place was buzzing over brunch.   I ordered the Rib & chicken combo with Coleslaw and mac'n cheese sides.   The ribs were nicely prepared, not too fatty, but a little small compared to others.  The sauce has a "hawaiian/asian" flair to it - a little sweet, tangy & only a hint of spice.  Chicken was not exceptional or pleasantly memorable to speak of.  The mac'n cheese was very-very good.  The coleslaw had pretty good flavor but is finely chopped so much so that the texture is really odd and there is no creaminess to it at all.  Ordered the bread pudding for dessert... it was divine!   Ribs warmed up nicely as leftovers - coleslaw only got worse!    Service was very good, promp,t attentive, pleasant.  Ambiance is trendy, attractive, clean... great for people watching.  Nice  mix of people this time of day.  Excellent Bar Menu (beer, wine & spirits).  I imagine its a big hippster hangout on Friday & Saturday nights.
