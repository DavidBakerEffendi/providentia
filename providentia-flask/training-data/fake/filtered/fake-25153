Great food.  We are displaced New Yorkers and Amis delivered last week as well as any of our favorite restaurants in Tribeca or Brooklyn.  All of the plates we had were delicious and all had great flavors + seasonings and well put together seasonal vegetables integrated into the dishes.  didn't seem like the chef was trying overly hard on the local point (which is starting to get ridiculous at times these days). Couple of points which really sets Philadelphia restaurants apart from the best in NYC and Los Angeles (and I'd throw Chicago in there) are small touches like the fact Amis uses Dial pump soap in the bathrooms (Dial, really?)  At least throw down $2.50 for Method at Costco.  And the waiters outfits just seems like someone had thought too hard about making a statement.   GREAT food
