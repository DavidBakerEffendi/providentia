I used to just come here for coffee or bubble tea, which was good. But I recently tried one of their spicy sandwiches. I can't handle spicy, so it was a slightly painful experience. But you know what? It tasted good. I don't know how they do it. I'll have it again, only with a whole bottle of water or milk to cool down. No pain, no gain, and that spicy pork sandwich with peppers is a perfect example.
