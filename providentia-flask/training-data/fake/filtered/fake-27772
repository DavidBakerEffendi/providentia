Amazing! The atmosphere as we walked in was that of an authentic Italian restaurante. We were made to feel welcome and at home instantly. Katie was our waitress and offered suggestions for appetizers that we might not have normally ordered. They were amazing and full of flavor. Â We took the Staten Island Ferry to watch the sunset & see the Statue of Liberty. With the awesome service and food at Enoteca Maria, we ended up with a night to remember.
