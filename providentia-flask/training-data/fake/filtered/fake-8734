Me and my boyfriend was driving around and came across this restaurant, so we decide to yelp the restaurant to see what is about and for the reviews. They were great reviews so we decide to to park the car and go in, im gold we did. It was a very  impressive restaurant small but it was full of good energy. I love the props in the walls and the bathroom and the school table also. Our waiter Cynthia was so sweet and lovely we had a bonding moment over fashion. If you guys read this and decide to go to the restaurant  ask for Cynthia she's amazing! Im not a big drinker and neither is my boyfriend but we had to try the sangria and it was good. We order appetizers some empandas that Cynthia recommend ( the chicken empandas were my favorite) and we also tired a special appetizer called beef scoop they were amazing. For dinner i had the special of the day which was the fish of the day with seafood rice that was yummy. My boyfriend had the bistec encebollado with yellow rice and black bean he said that the food easy so good it was like a party in his month...lol Although we waited long for the food due to a party everything else was amazing, this restaurant gives amazing service im for sure coming back for happy hour.
