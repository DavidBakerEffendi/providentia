Dolce and Clementes is one of the best Italian stores on the east coast! That's no lie! The food is presented in the most appealing of ways. The salads are super fresh, the sandwiches are second to none and the hot prepared foods are delicious. We had an event catered after trying the food and it was awesome. The store personal was great with helping place our order, the delivery was set up at our house and the food was the highest of quality. I would recommend it to anyone, anytime! Believe me just go to the store to check it out and you'll see for yourself what we're talking about!!!!
