. . . . A woman that I've been trying to love with all my heart for over 5 years and I , last week went to Umai Umai for the first time. It's a beautiful little spot that I highly recommend which had upon that day one of the most pleasant and personal and professional waitresses that I've ever encountered. Maya and I just absolutely loved everything. The bill was near 100$. I had what may be the most delicious food or thing I've ever eaten. And unlike other reviews I will not be telling you what we ordered Â ....lol
