Good lord  do I miss home!  27 yrs in Philly, now in S.California and can't get a good Italian meal unless I cook it. This place has been around since my Dad was my age and he would always drool just talking about it. Last I went here I ordered some veal special that was kickass. My bf got a linguine pescatore type dish.  EXCELLENT.  Pasta di Linguine- that's it. Finish up with a cannoli, mmmm! Atmosphere is ok- not wonderful, not mediocre... decent. Waitress was friendly and nice. Prices aren't bad- midline for the area and quality. I dream about it now that I'm living in lousyfoodville. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is Macaroni (Not Macaroni Grill) off Old Welsh Rd in NE Philly.  I have to leave room for better.
