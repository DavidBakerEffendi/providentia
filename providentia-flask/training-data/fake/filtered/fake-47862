Not sure why the exceedingly accommodating staff would not make a green salad for your girlfriend.  That place is the best.  Admittedly, this is meat and potatoes, steak and hot wing, Guinness and Jameson kind of place.  All the people who work there and go there are friendly.  The more you go, the more the place grows on you.  Pay attention and you might find yourself talking to a millionaire who has been sitting and happily talking and drinking with  a roofer who has been talking to an Artist who has been talking to Doctor who has been taking to a pro athlete who is talking to a recording artist........keep coming, it will grow on you.
