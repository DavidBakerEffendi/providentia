Cheap chinese food? Yes please! Usually get delivery from this place and they are always surprisingly quick. Do I think this is the best Chinese I've ever had, no probably not, but it is really good and really cheap, so I can't ever say no. They also have crab rangoon, which not a lot of Chinese places around here have, so this makes me super happy. I just wish their menu was online.
