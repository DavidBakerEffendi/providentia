While the food can be very good, I have a significant issue with this place. While I am not one to site race as an issue, this place made me think twice about that stance. On the two occasions I have eaten here, our meals were poorly executed, service abrupt, and management inconsiderate. For example, the last time I ate here, I was with a group of four. We waited for about twenty minutes before the server approached us, and even then we were told to order. No hello, no mention of specials, nothing. Â  Mind you, this was on a Thursday and the place was not too busy. We ordered our food, and then waited another 45 minutes when they served us our entrees. The biggest issue was that they never served us our appetizers. I attempted to get our servers attention , but she never came back. I instead had to approach the manager. She just glarred at me and told me she couldn't do anything about it. Needless to say, we won't be back.
