I ordered the Buffalo Bleu Burger medium rare and Buffalo wings, with another person who ordered a salad.  Although the place was nearly empty, we thought they forgot about us because it took so long to get our food.  The appetizers (buffalo wings) didn't come out for 30 minutes, and the rest of the food didn't come out until about 30-40 minutes after that.  After over an hour, when the burger did come out, it was very rare, not medium rare. I'm signing up for yelp, just to post this review because the food was so bad.
