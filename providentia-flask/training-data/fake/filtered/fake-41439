Before they officially opened, they catered for a birthday party in the neighborhood and I was quite impressed. It's finally nice this section of Church Avenue has some more options, especially vegetarian. Â Their tofu in coconut curry is amazing! It is also appealing because their focus is to keep their ingredients as local as possible. I went in there tonight and spoke to them and they seemed like a very warm and friendly addition to the neighborhood. I'm thrilled and will become a regular.
