Wow! My partner and I just loved everything about this new restaurant - the ambience, service and - you guessed it, the food. The carrot ginger soup with toasted chili marshmallow is a knock-out and my husband couldn't get enough of the miso-glazed bone marrow. We shared the rib-eye (he's a red meat man) which was perfectly cooked, juicy and flavoursome. I didn't have room for dessert, but being the old-fashioned guy he is, he couldn't resist the apple-raisin crumble with vanilla ice cream.  Fantastic.  We'll be back soon.
