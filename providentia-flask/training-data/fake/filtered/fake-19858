My fiancee and I have dined at Sugar Freak three times. Each time has been a unique, wonderful experience. The first time, SF delivered unparalleled fried chicken which immediately inspired us to return for a second visit. The second visit was marked by gracious, thoughtful service. We had probably been waiting, I don't know, 20 or 25 minutes or so for our entrees (by no means an extraordinary wait time for NYC). Our waiter came over without any signal from us, apologized, and offered free pork rinds and free beer to bide the time. We waited perhaps 10 more minutes for our entree. Tonight, our waiter said upfront that there would be a bit of a wait for the fried chicken Â since the\ cooks make it from scratch. Again, we waited, perhaps 20 minutes this time. He came over and apologized and offered us free drinks to make up for the "long" wait. Then, as we were paying, he told us that he accidentally threw away the chicken we had asked to have boxed up. He gave us an entire entree's worth of chicken (more, really) to take home, freshly prepared. These are the kinds of experiences that suggest the manager and staff of SF think of patrons more as guests than as anonymous customers. We will return for a fourth visit, gladly.
