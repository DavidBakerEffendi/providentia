I absolutely loved the service there. The waiter/waitresses are so friendly, and the atmosphere has such a relaxing setting. My boyfriend and I attended the restaurant on the night of our eight month anniversary, and came back on the night of our two Â year anniversary. The same young woman who had taken our order, during our first visit, was the very same person that had done so on our second outing there. She remembered us. The food is very delicious! Their steamed dumplings are amazing, as well as their Thai Pad Rice! Delish! I had to go back for take out!
