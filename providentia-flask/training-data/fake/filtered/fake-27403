So if you're looking for an overhyped mediocre pizza/ dining/ ambiance experience L&B is the spot. I've eaten here for over a decade, when i was a teen and it was the cool spot to go to, but now its the pizzaria that accommodates late night gravesend. Lines forever. For ok pizza. Last time i was there it was for a dinner, and it was like eating on the n train, loud & crowded. L and B Lackluster and Blah. Plus if you are looking for the extras on Sopranos and their progeny this is the place. Its a hilarious stereotype in the summertime the only reason its not 1 star is they know how to make a good malted milk shake.
