Tried this place yesterday we started with the Croquetas de Jamon which were outstanding.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned, good portion size as well.  Then we both had Cuban Sandwiches with Tostones on the side.  The Cuban sandwich was great the amount of items on the sandwich was perfect, not too much not to little of one item.  The Tostones were also top notch, cooked perfectly.  Crispy outside and soft on the inside.  The wait staff was great and the were also nice enough to let us sample the Pernil, which was a real treat.  I am very critical about my Pernil I have had good and bad and this one is incredible.  Tons of flavor and super tender, the next meal I have at this place will be a huge plate of Pernil and rice.  If you like good Cuban food, and actually know what good Cuban food is you have to give this place a shot you will not be sorry.
