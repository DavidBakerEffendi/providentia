A few of us get together every weekend and head out to Sanford's for brunch. The food is amazing and the service rocks. It is inexpensive compared to any other restaurants of similar quality in the area. If you are lucky to live close to them (I'm only 3 blocks away), they even do take-out through delivery.com! A $13 brunch which includes 2 mimosas, 2 glasses of wine or 2 white wine spritzers, you cannot beat it. The service is always flawless and the dining area and bathrooms are spotless. I recommend this place to anyone and everyone. You will probably see me there!
