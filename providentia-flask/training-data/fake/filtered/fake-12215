Love this place.  I was in town for a night and saw this place had a high Zagat survey score, so I decided to check it out.  A little pricey, but I thought it was worth it. Tried the Spicy Sake! Wow!  Loved it!!  There is definitely a chill vibe here.  Everyone is really cool and I enjoyed the crowd.  The food was top notch and they had a few interesting twists on sushi rolls.  The next time I'm in town, I will hit this place up again!
