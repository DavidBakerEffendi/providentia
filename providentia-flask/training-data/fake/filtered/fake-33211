Everything about this place is a yes. I respect their no-frills approach to service. You may not get a smile, but what you will get is a falafel so mouth-wateringly delicious that you'll find yourself yearning for it's spicy, savory, smokeyness again and again. Order the harissa plate, and flirt with the hot Israeli dude.
