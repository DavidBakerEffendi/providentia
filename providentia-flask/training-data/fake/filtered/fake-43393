I checked out Hawthornes last night, and I'm glad this place opened up in my neighborhood. The beer selection is very cool, they have nearly as many as The Foodery does.  There were some interesting choices that I haven't seen before, like a Watermelon wheat beer.   I ordered a grilled cheese/ham/olive tapenade sandwich, and it was tasty.  The chips were homemade.  Nothing to go crazy about, but the food was well-made and hit the spot. I think the thing I most like about this place is the atmosphere.  Very friendly.  I like that there are no waiters--you just pick a beer from the case, pay for it at the counter, and find a table.  It's actually kind of a novel idea. It seems like a nice place to go with some friends and just hang around drinking interesting beers.  A bottle of microbrew will cost you as low as 2.50, which is cheaper than it would be at a bar. One thing I would like to see is a way to figure out how much the beers cost before taking them to the counter.  I took up a beer that was $16.  I said "oh, didn't know it was that much, hold on while I go put it back."
