Has never disappointed. Amazing date night location. Almost the entire staff and management are familiar with me because I go so often! They recently have a little give away going on; with any entree free movie ticket to the neighboring AMC. I asked the manager to explain all the details to me, and he said the tickets were good for any movie! The fried cheesecake is a treat! I love that they're open relatively late. Very convenient for late nights :D
