Bridget Foy's 3rd floor is the perfect place for a private party! I have recently been there on two occasions for a private party. My staff Holiday party was held there and it was positively fantastic! It was an evening cocktail party with karaoke. We all had a blast! The snack menu and drinks were perfect for our group. The service was terrific. I was also there for a brunch baby shower. We were fortunate enough to sample some of the new brunch items, including the flat bread pizza...YUM! It's a cozy, intimate space that doesn't feel too large or small. I have nothing but praise for the space, food, cocktails and service. It is the perfect place for a gathering of any kind!
