Nice location with outdoor seating.  But service was a bit slow even though it wasn't very busy.  The soup was nothing special, it almost tasted like it came out of a can.  I ordered my steak medium rare and it came out medium.  The potatoes were very good and almost made up for the poorly cooked steak.  Overall it was a mediocre meal but I will probably give them another chance.
