Pasta the way it should be. Simple, fresh and flavorful without drowning in sauce. Quality ingredients and the pasta is always cooked perfectly! I HAVE NEVER had a bad meal here..EVER. Even when I have gone outside my comfort zone and decided to try something I wasn't sure about I am always pleasantly surprised . They always satisfy me. The staff is friendly and efficient but saying the space is small is an understatement. However ,the food is so good I don't care. One of the very few places where I will wait to get a table. All food is made to order and the kitchen is open to your view. If you are reading this and thinking about trying Capri Cafe.....GO!!!! You'll be happy you did.
