La Cigogne has to be the most chillest restaurant Â in the surrounding area. No scratch that The Best restaurant in the area. The decor was set up great for a light atmosphere. The food was absolutely astonishing . From the flambees to their delicious burger, I fell in love with the restaurant. The owners of the restaurant were very friendly and interactive in the services if need be. Honestly I would recommend this place to anyone who wants great eats and a relaxing atmosphere. Let's just say whenever I come down to New York, this will be my go to place for brunch and dinner.
