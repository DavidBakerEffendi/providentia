We celebrated my mom's 80th birthday on May 3rd in this place. Our  reservation was from 5 pm to 7:30 pm. My guests arrived at 5 pm in the restaurant and was not allowed to enter because our table was not ready yet so the manager had asked my guests to stay outside the restaurant even though it was raining that time.  Some of them were allowed to go in and stay at the bar if they were to order some drinks and 'pay' for it.  I was so embarrassed by the way he treated my guest.  The manager needs a lot of training and needs to wear something professional  not just a white t-shirt without collar. So that the guests will know that they were being asked out of the restaurant by a 'manager'.   It took us 5 weeks to finalized the party because all I'll get is his answering machine and it  will take him days to return my call,  the longest was one week even thru emails same thing. I requested something with the food and he didn't follow it. One thing good about this place is the waiter who served us.  His name is ....He was very courteous and explained the 'kamayan'  style of eating. The food was good except for the lechon (roast pig) which they put in the middle of the table and while the guests were eating liquid were dripping on and had drip in one of my guest's lap. Our suggestion, to put the roast pig on a flat tray to avoid this.  We also ordered crabs and shrimps they should probably  provide a bucket to put the shells. I want to give them a 3 star but I'm giving them 1 star because of the manager. This place is expensive $$$ and I expect better service specially with the manager.
