I liked the owner and staff very much. On first arriving there was a strong smell of tar, I think from the rail yard outside. Either we got used to it or it went away. The meal seemed very skimpy. I took a piece of bread and the container disappeared. The Caesar salad was good but small and on a huge plate. The 4 seared scallops were to die for, on a bed of watercress with some nice sauce drizzled on the side, but no rice or anything. It just seemed so sparse although beautifully presented. The $ was way out of line.
