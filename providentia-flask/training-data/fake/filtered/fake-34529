I went here with a coupon from clipper magazine advertising buy 1 entree get 1 free on Monday 2/20. Ran home from work, picked up the coupon and went over to what I was expecting to be a decent dinner for a good price. The place was crowded in comparison to times when we've been the only ones there and saw the coupon on other tables. Service was not great since it was busier than any other time, but since I was getting a free meal I was very tolerant. I saw 1 couple get aggravated with the female manager and they walked out before ordering. Then to my surprise when i was given the check and gave them my coupon I was informed that in fine print on the bottom (needed my son to read it for me) it stated that reservations were required. So i had a some mediocre sushi at a price I wasn't expecting to pay and had lousy service to boot. It will be a long time till I eat here again. This is no way to treat your customers!!!!
