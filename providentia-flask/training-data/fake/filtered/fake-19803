Wow! I just had my engagement party Friday and everyone is still talking about how amazing it was. The food was great, the service was great, the place is beautiful! Â This was my first event I planned and was very satisfied with the venue in all aspects. I would recommend speaking with Manager as he was the best vendor I got to work with on my engagement.....
