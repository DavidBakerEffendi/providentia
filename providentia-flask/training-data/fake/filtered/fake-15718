So I use to go here a lot but not after the time a server came out and fought with me over getting a low tip. My sister and I love the sushi there because it has great flavor and there a coupon you can use on their website. BUT service was horrible. you always have to wave someone down to get any service. and just because I didn't give a tip that I thought suit their need she ran outside an fought with me. I asked to speak to the manager and she tells me there no manager on at all. Absolutely upset with that. I rather go somewhere else than here if I have to go in a battle field with a server about the tip I gave her.
