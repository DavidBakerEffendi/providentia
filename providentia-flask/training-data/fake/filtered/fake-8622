Not great menu selection.  Food quality was fairly ordinary.  Good service, but tables are VERY cramped to extent my wife & I felt as if eating with tables near us.  $10 corking fee for a non-alcohol wine bottle with screw off cap was outrageous. We are blessed to eat out almost weekend and far too many other great/good Italian restaurants to return here. Salvatore
