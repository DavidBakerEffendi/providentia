Very disappointed by the sashimi bleu. $21.95 for 15 pieces. They did not tell you that four of the 15 were the fakes crabmeat. It is unbelievable that any sushi bar would serve faked crabmeat as sashimi to its customers. For twelve pieces of mediocre quality tuna, salmon and yellowtail, $21.95 was grossly over priced.
