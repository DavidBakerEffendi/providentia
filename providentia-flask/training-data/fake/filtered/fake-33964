Was in town for a couple days to take our son on a college tour, and we were told that this was THE pizza place to go to (maybe we should have checked yelp first). The pizza was pretty good but the wait was really bad.  It's annoying to see a line of take out orders get their food way before you.  It really seems like they prioritize those carrying food out. They say this on their website: "Take out is available.  There might be a wait for take out orders too." Might be a wait.  It'd be an interesting test to get in line for the restaurant, then phone in an order, and see if which pizza gets finished first, the one you try to order from inside or the one you phone in. Call in your order if you don't want to wait.
