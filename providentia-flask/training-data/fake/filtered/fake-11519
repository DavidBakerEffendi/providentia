My best-friend and I wanted to try a new restaurant we got tired of the same mundane routine at the other place we have been to, as soon as we walked through the door we knew we made the right chose. The service was the best that I have every experienced, the drink menu you was great and the sides that came with our meal was to die for. We ended up ordering the beef ribs do to that fact that we don't eat pork but was completely amazed how tender and juicy the meat was, and the sauces that come on the table is to die for but you really don't need the sauce the smoked infused taste is just enough. So if your looking for a great meal at a reasonable price then this is the restaurant to be at. ( my facebook profile picture is me eating their ribs it was so good)
