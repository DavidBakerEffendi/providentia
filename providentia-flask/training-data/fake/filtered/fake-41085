Cleaning up all of the glasses and plates (including those still containing food) the second we stopped ordering sends a pretty clear signal that the place is only in it for maximum profits. A beefy, muscled bouncer barking at customers is extremely necessary in tough neighborhoods like Midtown East where you get the most rough-edged people enjoying wine after work. Pathetic. The other wine bars in the area know how to treat customers.
