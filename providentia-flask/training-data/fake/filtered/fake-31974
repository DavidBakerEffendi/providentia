Posto is a wonderful place to have dinner if you want delicious pizza, at a great price. Lets not forget there delicious appetizers such as, the bruschetta and antipasto plate and their amazing cheese ravioli, perfectly cooked everytime! They have a good and simple selection of wines that pair well with the food being served. Now the service... I think the people who have written negative comments towards the Posto staff, should stop a realize that Posto is not a 5 Star Michelin awarded restaurant so the level or service may be different. Also it is an extremely busy restaurant and I myself have had to wait everytime for a table but its all very much worth the wait!  The staff is wonderful, I was in last thursday, on new years eve during the rush and was pleasantly greeted by the hostess and had a lovely conversation with my waitress.  On my way out, I was told to have a good night by the staff and to have a happy new year.   I think Posto is a great restaurant and the staff is wonderful! I've lived in this neighborhood for over 20 years and its about time some good restaurants with good service come around.
