if you're looking for great seafood this is the place to be. I am never disappointed when it comes to Kyclades. The stuffed shrimp and lemon potatoes are melt in your mouth delicious. I can truly say that anything i have every ordered from here has always met my expectations. Whenever i have friends in town i always chose to take them to Taverna Kyclades. Everything is so fresh and clean and that is important when it comes to seafood.
