The first time I came here was for dinner with a friend and had a good experience. The food is great, generally. But then! Ugh. Came here for brunch a couple of weeks ago with 3 other people. The waitress took our order (didn't write it down, red flag #1), then came back 20 minutes later and asked me to repeat my order (red flag # 2). Everyone else's food came out and a rediculous amount of time later (15/20 minutes?) as I'm watching everyone else FINISH their meal, I finally asked them where the hell my food was. They brought it out a few minutes later and it was cold (obviously they hadn't cooked/heated it long enough). Way to forget to put in an order. I would come back, however, because I'm the forgiving type [read: pretty good crepes].
