I recently had dinner at this place with a big group. We dined in the back near the other bar. Firstly, the happy hour drink specials were great. Our waitress Sophie suggested that we try the gimlet and we loved it. We also ordered flatbread, tacos, and zucchini fries for the table. The food was delicious, the service was great, and we tried many different kinds of beer.
