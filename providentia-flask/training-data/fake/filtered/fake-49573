So many restaurants and doing the same thing, small plates, new American blah blah blah, local, sustainable, buzzword, buzzword, buzzword. It's like Brooklyn forgot that food can be something else then New Brooklyn Cuisine. Not at Glasserie. The food here is beyond delicious, has a very serious identity and attitude. Incredibly flavorful and interesting. Have been multiple times, and was not sure if the chef change earlier in the year would affect the restaurant. Was nervous about coming again but, the poetry and wonder of the food is STILL there and it's so good. I could go into specifics about each dish I had, but instead, you should go and eat it. Everything, anything. So good. I want to give it 5 stars because the food carries such serious weight, but instead, I'm at 4 because the service could use some more attention.
