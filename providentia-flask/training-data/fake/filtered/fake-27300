Saturday I hosted a dinner for my sister's 30th birthday in the back room. You have to understand I have a little obsession with this back room, the piano, the chandelier lamps that sit on it, the bookcases with the purposefully worn books, the cozy arm chairs, the fire place. I was so happy. So yes that back room with a warm fire place and Etta James on the mike. They ALWAYS play good music. Katherine (spelling?) our waitress was so completely patient with us. We were supposed to get there at 6:30 and of course even those who got there on time (not me) snuggled by the fire until 7 or so when almost all the 20 or so guests had arrived. Oh and then there was the food. Beets and goat cheese never fail. The scallops were perfect, I think half our table ordered them and everyone loved them. Yes, I did pick one off my friend's plate who was too full to finish. The custom cakes from the special bakery were also amazing. And best of all no one tried to push us out the door. Food, service, ambience were all 5 star. And i think even the manhattanites will be back.
