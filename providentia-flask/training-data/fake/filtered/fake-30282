AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! Â Went to the 62nd Street location in West Philly. Maybe they thought that I ordered chopped shoes on a bun. The meat was tough, overlooked, and had no flavor. The rolls were incredible, however. I've had Jim's Steaks on South Street and they should sue this place for defamation.
