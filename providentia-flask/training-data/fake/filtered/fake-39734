Wonderful place.  We had the 6 course tasting menu with wine pairings and they were fantastic.  Our server was knowledgeable and gave us interesting information on each course.  Both food and wine was most delicious.  Amazingly enough, the carrot course was one of the best.  Who would have thought?!?  Would go again in a minute.
