I had a great experience last night at the Good Fork. The food, staff, and setting were all wonderful. We wanted to sit outside (cute, intimate backyard), and despite the wait, the host was very helpful and comped us a desert for our wait (which was less than he had quoted us and which we were perfectly fine with). The food was delicious -- I had the oyster po' boy, which, while not a replica of the southern sandwich was great and included a generous (for an app) amount of oysters and a great guac side. The seasonal ravioli were also great.
