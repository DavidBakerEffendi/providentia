This past weekend my girlfriends and I went to Alma de Cuba for a night out and dinner. We had been here a few years ago, and I wasn't too excited to go. This time around was completely different. It seemed the menu had changed and the food was unbelievable. We had the ceviche and several appetizers and then shared some main courses. The desserts are out of this world. The service was also exceptional. The chef is SUPER cute and knows everything about food. The whole thing was amazing and we will be back for sure!!!
