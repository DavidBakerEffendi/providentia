I was invited to a coworkers retirement party here. We work for a large company with branches all over NJ. So I wasn't really looking forward to driving up 2 hours from Burlington county just to have a meal. But I said what the heck we used to work together in the same office so out of respect for him I battled Turnpike traffic and came up North for the party. Boy was I glad I did. Man the food was outstanding! The service was impeccable! I grew up in an Italian household and hadn't had authentic food like that since my Parents were alive. They passed over 20 Years ago. My Wife is Jewish so she's not much in the cooking dept. lol. The portions were enough to feed 3 let alone one. The food reminded me of Sunday brunch at my Parents. Brought back memories. Lets just say I will be making more trips up North to visit Bella Italia.. Oh did i mention the prices were great.....
