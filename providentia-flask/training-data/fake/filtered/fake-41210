Favourite ramen in the city! The Totto Spicy Ramen is perfection. Service is no-nonsense but polite and efficient. Of late, I've been going solo. Each time I was seated immediately at the counter (which is prime seating in my opinion) and in and out probably in 20 minutes. It's really not a place to linger and catch up with friends, so I highly suggest not going with a big party or a long lost friend. Go purely to enjoy the ramen.
