For a pizza joint that is made up of many former employees of Ramuto's I had higher expectations.  Ramunto's was the real deal, amazing New York pizza, even though the owner was an ass.   Ziggy's crust is hit or miss, the sauce isn't as flavorful, and the menu selection is not stellar.  The menu must-haves of most pizza joints are not found at Ziggy's.  No chef salad and little selection for sandwiches.   Ziggy's was fantastic when it first opened and has declined since.  After a several month hiatus we decided to give them another try this weekend.  Not a great idea.  The crust was tough, the sauce mediocre, floors sticky in front of the soda machine, and several guys were in the back tossing pizza dough back and forth which then elevated into chucking the dough across the kitchen.  I really hope that dough didn't get turned into a pizza someone was going to eat.   The quality of Ziggy's, Ramunto's comparisons aside, has declined fast.  Not sure I'll be in again.
