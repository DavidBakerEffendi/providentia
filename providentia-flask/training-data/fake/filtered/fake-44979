* 7:39 pm : A friend calls me and tells me 'Man, you've been in the apartment working all day. Let's go outside and do something. I have a surprise!' That sounds exciting! * 7:54 pm : We get on the 1 Train heading towards 72nd street * 8:12 pm : We get of the 1 Train and it feels like I'm walking against a wall of heat compared to the acclimatized air in the car. * 8:14 pm : I still don't know where we are going!! * 8:26 pm : We arrive at Pier I Caf√© and sit down to enjoy the warm breeze of this evening. * 8:28 pm : I realize it's self-service! * 8:31 pm : I'm standing in a little line to get the food and beverages. * 8:39 pm : I return to the table with a bottle of red wine, two glasses, forks and knives in my hands. * 8:43 pm : I'm off to another round in the small line to get some fries and burgers. * 8:51 pm : We are enjoying the juicy burger with some exceptionally good fries. Red wine is awesome! * 8:59 pm : A fly is annoying me, but that shouldn't destroy the nice ambience of this place! * 9:06 pm : We realize that at the nearby pier they are having an open air movie showing. * 9:07 pm : Fortunately the screen is big and the speakers loud enough that we can watch a very entertaining movie from the 30's! * 9:34 pm : Some more wine... * 10:47 pm : Time to return home though we don't want to. Decor is very nice, beach feeling and it's still pretty warm! * 10:55 pm : Walking towards to the subway and end of the schedule ;) !
