I'm a long time customer of Big Daddys and they deliver to my house here in Winooski every so often. I like their pizza-it has a good crust on it and I usually just get the cheese pizza. Over the past few months they've added a new items and I was in the mood for a burger and they have them. On Monday Feb 3rd Â 2014 I ordered a med cheese pizza, two Mac Daddy burgers and a garden salad. Delivery was prompt and the driver was very nice. The salad was so-so & looked like it had been sitting around for more than day. I called them about it and the person answering calls was very courteous and immediately offered to replace it at no charge. I also offered to tip the driver extra for coming out to Winooski again which I did . One note here: I think if Big Daddy's changed the type of lettuce mix they use (looks like they are using a mixed greens type at present) the garden salad would be more sucessful esp in the light that cucumbers were in the salad. Cukes have a tendency to wilt small greens and are incapable of standing up for any length of time. The driver brought me out a Caesar Salad as I had requested and he even threw in a brownie for free. Now on to the burgers! I was bowled over by the quality of bread that is used for these burgers and they were totally delicious-the meat patty wasn't the biggest but the way it was made with the condiments on this roll (brioche?) was OUTSTANDING! It's been a while since I have reviewed Big Daddy's and this time I'm giving them 5 stars. #1: Pizza always good / consistent quality-you can tell it's been made with care. #2 The hamburger roll- Big Daddy don't stop using this type of roll-it's excellant! #3:Sorta' old salad but Big Daddy was more than nice in replacing it and driving back out to Winooski again. #4: Driver was friendly, courteous and threw a big ol' brownie (which was totally delicious) in the bag with the replaced salad. I have a soft spot in my heart for Big Daddy's so here's the 5 stars!
