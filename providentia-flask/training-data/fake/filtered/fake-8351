I'm at this bagel place 3-4 times a week and never had a rude experience or poor customer service.... people need to stop writing bullshit.... One time I was over charged by a couple of dollars and I didn't return until 2 days later and the person who took my order remember and my whole order was FREE. Â I'm not talking about a bagel I'm talking about 1 bagel, 3 breakfast sandwiches and a coffee
