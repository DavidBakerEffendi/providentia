I came here for the first time last week for some Stone Enjoy 2.15. The place is pretty dimmed like most bars. Their beer selection is OK but isn't comparable to their other bar, Kraftworks. However... I do think their food menu is better than Kraftworks. I ordered their "Kinky Burger" and it was GREAT! I'm a huge foodie and I honestly thought it was awesome, especially with a nice cold crafted beer. Their Carnitas is awesome too so that's a definite must if you decide to go there. The bar tenders were decent and pretty quick. My overall experience here was nice here but whats going to be bringing me back here is their food menu.
