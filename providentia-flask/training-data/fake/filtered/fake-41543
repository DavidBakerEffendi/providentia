The first time I ate at this place, I was delighted by the fresh taste of the seafood. I have gone at least 3 more times and the service and freshness of the food has since plummeted. The last time I had gone was the last straw. The calamari was rubbery, we were seated by the kitchen in the back of the establishment when there were plenty of open tables available in the front of the restaurant. I didnt't mention that there was an air conditioner dripping water onto my friend. My friend just ordered a side of fries because she wasn't in the mood for much else since she was just accompanying me so that I could satisfy my calamari craving. All of the french fries that was served were tiny BITS of fries...no long fries. The fries appeared as if they were the last of a large bag of fries. The waitress didn't seem to happy to bring me another container of tartar sauce either. I must mention that I am a Black woman because I feel it matters upon watching my waitress and where others were seated. I am over fish.
