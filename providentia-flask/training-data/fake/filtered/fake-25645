As good as it gets. I cant say enough about this place. Ambiance and atmosphere were GORGEOUS.  Everything from the impeccable and attentive service, to mouth watering meal (OCTOPUS, people!! best ever!!), to the innovative drinks and amazing wine selection. The owners got it right.   Would recommend to any and everyone.   Amid the overhyped and overpriced Bill's and Monkey Bar, this place is a gem. Cheers.
