We dined at Istanbul on Saturday, 9/21. Seated between a banquet in an adjoining room and a local potentate, we were practically overlooked during our visit. It took too long to get our food, the waitress forgot that we ordered a salad and when reminded, brought it without the requested feta cheese. The potentate who arrived after we did practically had his and his companion's whole meal before we had anything. The food, when it arrived, was excellent. Just don't go when they are busy or be prepared to wait.
