Last night we went to Da Andrea for a family birthday party.  They greeted us courteously, provided very nice service and fed us well.  We had a range of appetizers, including mussels, calamari, octopus,la tigelle (If I am spelling it correctly), and mozzarella.  The five appetizers were sufficient for a table of nine.  The calamari and octopus was very good.  The tigelle comes with proscuitto, which was good.  The buns that you place  them on did not stand out for me.  I didn't get to try the mussels and mozzarella, which is probably a testament to how good other people found them. The olive oil for dipping bread was good. The glass of Montepulciano I had was good, nothing special, but good. My main course was delicious.  I never had a chicken paillard like this. It was juicy and a large portion.  It was artistically rolled, so that at first I thought I had a wrap!  On the side were very well prepared zucchini.  I was very happy with that choice.  One member of our party who had the steak thought it would tasty, well prepared and presented. For the birthday boy, they put candles on a number of desserts to make it festive.  Other tables joined in "Happy Birthday".   The tiramisu was good.  The chocolate covered cake dessert was a crowd pleaser!  We got competitive over the shared portions!  The Italian cookies really stood out from most Italian cookies I have had.  They were very fine.  Three portions of dessert and two plates of cookies were sufficient for the table of nine.   The noise level was acceptable. You could have a conversation with the person next to you and across from you, something you can't do in every restaurant.   I would recommend this restaurant for couples and for groups.
