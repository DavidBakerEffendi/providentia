I am in love with this little Polish deli that is a breeze to swing by and quickly park in front of as you travel down Rte. 202, located right in the parking lot by Boonton Lanes. The homemade Polish recipes seem to be family favorites and the signature soups are outstanding. Subtle hints of dill accompany a rich Tomato soup (that my girls and I die for), the cabbage-and-kielbasa soup is light and satisfying, while the chicken noodle soup is the best of its kind. The chef is a kind Polish woman who runs her own shop along with her three cool kids..they seem to be filmmakers, photographers, musicians, and one is a pilot...a real Renaissance family. Can you tell I go there a lot and talk a bit too much? Hidden among the Polish groceries, Deli "to-go" foods, bakery treats, and threadbare decor is the true Time Capsule of hipster cred: an old vinyl record player. I turned my girls onto the Beatles there, and their music collection is quite eclectic and nostalgic (The Kinks, The Clash, The Bee Gees? Mom and kids have differing musical tastes...) Don't miss your chance to swing by and try the BEST kielbasa (and I've tried so many), yummy Pierogies, and delicious Mushroom-and-Gravy Meatballs. Or just a quick, simple Deli sandwich. They do it all, and there is usually a table for you.
