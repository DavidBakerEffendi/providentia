Order to go Â from there they charge me $4.00 for a small (HOT) juice WTH, I also ordered sandwich came w wrong bread and COLD. Order some Brazilian finger foods they were alright... But funny thing is w all this orders I only got on small cache of ketchup wth... Cheap and don't recommended as much!!!! Not very cautions about taking orders!!!!
