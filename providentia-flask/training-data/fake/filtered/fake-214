We came out to the east coast from California in search of some great food.  After a weekend in New York, we headed to Philly just for the cheesesteaks.  After hearing extensively about Geno's and Pat's, we decided to walk the 2 miles from our hotel through 35 degree weather and 30 mph winds to flavor what was supposed to be the best steaks in the city.  What a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!  Not only were the cheesesteaks from both places not very good, but the service was just awful!  We arrived at Geno's only to discover there was NO INDOOR SEATING.  Um, of I realize most of you locals probably knew this already, but when you're from out of state, you kind of expect there to be indoor seating in an east coast city in the middle of JANUARY!!!!  It would make sense right? I mean the average temperature there is like the mid 30s!  Well, there isn't any.  To top it all off, the service was awful.  We were treated so rudely by the two staff members who took our order and served us our cheesesteaks that we wouldn't have considered returning even if the sandwiches were good...and let me assure you, they were not.  After sampling both cheesesteaks we were so dissatisfied that we decided to try another from the Flyers Arena  at Wells Fargo Center.  The sandwiches we had there were SO much better....exactly what I expected from a trip to Geno's....stay away both Geno's and Pat's...they are not what you expect out of a Philly.
