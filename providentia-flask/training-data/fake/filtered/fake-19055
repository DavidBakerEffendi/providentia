My first 5 star review, and it's well-deserved. Pizza has always been good, sure. But Artichoke just changes the game. The Crab, Margherita, and the Artichoke are amazing. Sicilian? Not sure about, those three have always done it for me. Sure, they're heavy slices with a bunch of creamy sauce on them (as if that's a bad thing), but the price reflects that. Honestly, if I could eat one food and not have to worry about gaining weight, I would eat Artichoke all day. At this point of human development, I'm gonna limit it to about once every three months. And the beers come in Super Big Gulp sizes (Jersey anyone?). What more can you ask for? Only, only gripe ever: the last time I went, I ordered the crab slice. When it came, it was barely lukewarm. Not a huge deal, but certainly noteworthy.
