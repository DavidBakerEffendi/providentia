We ate here twice, so we really enjoyed our breakfasts: gruyere cheese omelets, salmon with great salad, breakfast wrap and great burgers & fries.  Sorry I missed the opportunity to have the great looking french toast when we returned on Sunday - not offered then.  Very cozy seating but efficient service and food served HOT.  Portions are just right and satisfying. Nice touch to offer complimentary sparkling water.
