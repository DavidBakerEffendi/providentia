Just went to mood cafe for the first time with my boyfriend with a groupon.  We love Indian food and are pretty critical.  Amazing food and wonderful service, we got the lamb and chicken dishes suggested by our server and they were excellent! It's also Byob, which is always a plus. We will definitely go back for more :-)
