I was a bit disappointed. The food was great, but a few aspects were underwhelming. --My wife and I had the chef's tasting menu, and while everything was very nice, the tiny portions left me pretty hungry at the end. --And we were both served the same dishes for each course. (Perhaps our expectations were too high after Vetri). --They seem proud of their bartender, but the cocktail menu is pretty limited, and each signature cocktail is either weak or includes at least one off-putting ingredient, so there were few choices for me. There is a full bar, though, so that is only a minor disappointment, not a critical flaw.
