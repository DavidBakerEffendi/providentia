I am a huge fan. It seems everyone loves the decor but I think it is a bit over the top.The Garden is fantastic. I won't go into the food as so many other reviewers do it better than I.  Honestly though the food is so good and the staff is so friendly if  it was served under a bridge by a homeless shelter I would still pay  for it. The waiters and owners are some of my favorites. They are friendly without being intrusive and knowledgeable without being arrogant or dismissive. They treat you  like old time friends as soon as you walk through the door every time. No they don't scream "Norm" because they show it in the ways a customer likes.
