I usually don't bother to write reviews, but after today's visit to Cafe Sabarsky I really feel compelled to write a few words. It is a unique place with wonderful ambiance, great food and quality service. If you're there for lunch or dinner, make sure not to miss the schnitzel, which I believe is among the finest items on the menu. It was beautifully prepared and artfully plated, as were the other dishes on our table: my friend ordered the frankfurters in goulash sauce, which looked so seductively, that she didn't know whether to eat Â them or give them a ride home ;) For dessert I had a cafe creme (espresso with hot cream) and a delicate lemon mousse cake, which added a delightful note of playfulness to my otherwise hearty and decadent indulgence. The servers were attentive, professional and helpful, and what is perhaps most remarkable, were able to maintain a friendly and positive demeanor despite working for what seems to be many hours in this high-volume and high pressure environment. One other thing that needs to be mentioned: think twice before bringing your kids along. Cafe Sabarsky is not a very kid-friendly restaurant. They have no high-chairs, no kids' menus and very little tolerance for loud, disruptive, undisciplined and misbehaving children. The layout of the place makes it difficult to accommodate strollers and baby-carriers. From what I've seen, any attempts to negotiate these issues with the staff are doomed to fail. Overall, a really great place. Five stars. I strongly recommend visiting.
