I think I found this place 4 years too late.  Seriously, this was so good, my friend wondered how long they have been around, we were thinking perhaps they were this new phenomenon, but wow, 4 years, why didn't we know about you?   Ridiculuously good, even more ridiculously cheap, this delicious pancakes are so huge and amazing, and its only a freakin' 2 bucks.   Gosh, I wish I could advertise this place more.  Perhaps, I wish the next time you see a commercial for KFC or McD's advertising their dollar menu, Vanessa's would jump into their ad, and be like, "No, how about this for a buck?" The rudimentary pork dumplings are simple and taste precisely as they should, which is to say of pork, dumpling and a hint of chive. Yeah, take your time with this thing... enjoy it.
