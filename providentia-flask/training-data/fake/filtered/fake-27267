I've been going to le barricou since it first opened and seen its many transformations. Unfortunately, after two years the service is still uniformly ok at best. At least twice I've been forgotten about. Often it seems as if the staff doesn't know what is going on. The food and rustic atmosphere kept me returning but the mediocre service isn't worth it anymore.
