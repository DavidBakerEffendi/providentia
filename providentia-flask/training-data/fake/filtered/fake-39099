Movie at The Ziegfeld preceded by dinner at Basso56. Being native NYer's we approached Basso56 with a little trepidation (mostly due to "touristy" location). WRONG! Food was excellent, very reasonably priced, oustanding service ("Thanks" Alfredo), ambiance a little hustle-bustlely but still wonderful. Highly recommended.
