HORRIBLE SERVICE!! Refused to give me Hot temp. rice first, then gave in with a "dirty look". REFUSED to give my Mother a less spicy soup. Refused to give us hot water! What kind of "service oriented" place IS THIS?! The dishes are Very Overpriced as well. They Actually told us that they cannot Alter Anything on the menu ( even the simplest things like warm rice instead of cold rice). They also have No waitstaff but the 2 owners and the "no service" was SLOW. If only there were other Korean Restaurants nearby! TERRIBLE. WORST IN EVERY WAY.
