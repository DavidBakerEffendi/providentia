I went to Bouley for lunch with 3 others in August and the experience was fantastic.   I had experience the original Bouley a few years back and the memories were still vibrant and strong, so we decided to try the fix price lunch.     There wasn't a dish that I didn't like as we were trading bites, but what stood out the most was the porcini flan dish.   It was totally worth the money and you got a lot of quality and value for it. Lastly, the service people were amazing, everything was done timely and like a fine tuned machine.   I will be going back shortly.
