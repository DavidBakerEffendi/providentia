I have come here to eat ever since I was a baby. I am proud to say that I have introduced both my sons and 3 of my friends (2 from out of tow, and 1 from another part of Brooklyn) to L&B, and they all loved it! First of all, the square pies are just as good as they were 20-30 years ago. Those slices are messy to eat, but that's part of the fun. The sauce on top / cheese on bottom combo is delicious, and so is the spumoni (I always get rainbow -- combo of vanilla, chocolate, and pistachio -- if I get spumoni that day). Veal parm, chicken parm, and pasta are great too, and so are their dessert options if you have a large number of people dining. If God Himself wanted pizza, He would go to L&B for their squares.
