Awful. Not sure which is worse, the food or the service. I live in the neighborhood and have been going to brunch here for years.  The food has deteriorated to the point of inedibility and the service, which was never it's strong point to begin with, is now downright abysmal.  Don't get suckered, avoid this spot.
