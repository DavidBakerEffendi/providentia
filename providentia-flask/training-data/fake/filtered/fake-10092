Brunch:  Banana French Toast.  Period. Dinner:  Sea Bass.  Period. I can't help but feel a little unoriginal saying I love Extra Virgin as much as I do, but whatever I do what I want. The only thing is, it's pretty cramped, and the hostess never seems to notice when new people walk in the door.  I chalk it up to the fact that I'm short and she can't see me.  I'm just justifying the damn french toast, I guess...
