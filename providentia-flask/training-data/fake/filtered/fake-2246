ok so yes the wait is RIDICULOUS but it's definitely worth the wait. I've been here a few times but this is the first time i actually was not so wasted so I could really review this spot. I was celebrating my bday a lil early with a couple of my chicks and we put our name down and it was about a 2 hour wait. We went on a Thursday at around 7pm. It was pretty busy and we had no idea what to do with ourselves. But we waited outside and when it got a lil too cold we went in and ordered some wine to warm us up. When we finally did get a seat it was outside. It was cold but we wanted to just eat at that point. The waitress and the waiter were AWESOME. They were really chill which kept us in a good mood. I ordered the naked classic meatballs with the Parmesan cheese sauce with mashed potatoes underneath. When I got my cheesy balls they were absolutely AMAZING!! they were juicy and not too salty (who likes dry salty balls??) . The potatoes went great with the sauce and the balls. So i was thoroughly happy with my meal and so were my ladies. Since it was my bday I had to order some dessert and their homemade ice cream sandwiches hit the spot. Even though it was really cold during the night, it was worth it. I wasnt sure Â how exactly to eat the sandwich because it was so fat. But I licked, scooped and bite until i couldn't do it anymore. So overall, if you're ok with waiting this spot is the place to go. The service is awesome and so is the food.
