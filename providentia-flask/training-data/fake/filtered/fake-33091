The BEST food in the city! I have been going to Hinge for about  5 years and it is my favorite guilty pleasure!  It is like eating  at a Center City restaurant but with better prices,a more casual atmosphere and no parking hassle (it is in Port Richmond). Many of the dinner items change monthly.When the new items come out  my friends and I rush to see what's new and can't wait to sample them all. It is a must try!  Once you do you'll be hooked too!
