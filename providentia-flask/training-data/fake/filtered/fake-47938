Dined last night 10/16 with my BF to celebrate my birthday. I selected ITRWB  based upon previous dining experiences at owner Ignacio Blanco's other restaurants- Ibiza & Pika Tapas in New Haven and the former Meson Galicia in Norwalk.  Our experience was similar to Sandra W.  I ordered the Costilla and Lubina (short ribs and sea bass). The short ribs were the disappointment of the two.  Tasting like post roast and not served as described with smokey bacon potatos puree, but with a mound of ordinary mashed potatoes and very little sauce under the potatoes. My BF selected the garlic shrimp and the garlic chicken and both were OK except the garlic shrimp was the smallest tapas portion I have ever seen. You get more at Bistro Basque in Milford.  For dessert we ordered the almond tart- lackluster with no almond flavor and the chocolate croquettes which were stellar!  Also disapointing no coffee served! Lacking the expense account budget of a professional critic I would not return.
