When I ordered Grilled Salmon from the menu. The waitress asked me, "How would I like fish? Rare? Medium rare or well-done?" I was wondering how come fish could be cooked rare or medium, it was supposed to be cooked well-done. Nevertheless, the waitress told me the salmon would taste better medium rare. I was curious so I followed her suggestion. It took about 20 minutes for the Grilled Salmon. It served with saut√©ed baby bok choy, cremini, red curry butter. The salmon was so tender, the skin had a nice brown color. The inside was soft. That was the best salmon I ever had in New York! I shared herbed french fries on the side with my friend. For dessert, I had Pignoli rosemary biscotti (Roasted Pears with Honey Ice Cream) The dessert was a happy ending.
