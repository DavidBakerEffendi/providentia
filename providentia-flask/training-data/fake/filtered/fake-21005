New Years Eve -  AMAZING. $85/person, 4 course. I want to return as soon as my schedule allows and do a full menu dinner! They were polite and acommodating when we changed the number in our reservation and forgot to call. It was just the two of us but we thought my son was coming with us when we called in. They were going to make a price and menu adjustment for him - which we thought was great. But we ended up going alone and leaving him with family so we could have a just us dinner. When we showed up without him and realized we didnt call, we got nervous. But they didnt skip a beat. Just sat us at a 2 top. Maybe because they were relieved to not have to cater to a child but he actually has an expansive palate for a 10 year old, if that exists :) Either way, we were happy our mistake wasnt an issue. Our server was very pleasant and knowledgable. Appearing out of nowhere when we needed him and absent when we didnt. The chef came out and made some recommendations, which we followed and were very happy we did.   My main was pigeon pie and he had a rabbit pasta dish - pasta melted in your mouth, clearly remember that! The salads we had were so fresh and flavorful. I know I had a duck egg app that was more intricate than I expected, in a great way. I cant remember what he had for app. Dessert was to die for. Both of us finished our desserts which isnt typical. I wish I had reviewed immediately so I could share more details about the menu. I cant remember exactly what we had but I remember enough that I cant wait to return!
