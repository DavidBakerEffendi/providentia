I am so disgusted!! I finally have a yelp and can get this off of my chest... I went in the summer early fall while in town and sat out back... Oh em gee!!! The herbs for the food are grown out back and easily accessible to anyone.. So accessible that I saw two drunk guys spitting on them!!!! Also.. The wings were disgusting and there are no condiments for the burgers.. Pass this by. Save your money. Protect your health!
