Great bagel sandwiches, however, the $10 minimum for credit/debit card use is annoying, to say the very least....we're in 2011 people!!! I was also not pleased with the way the owners addressed their employees. Although they are pretty busy in the mornings (on wknds which is when I normally go), the young people were doing their best under pressure and I hated to see them get spoken to roughly by the owners....both him and his wife. Otherwise, the bagels are top notch and I would give them two thumbs up on taste.
