Finally was able to make it here after hearing constant praise for everything from the ketchup to burgers to the shakes. And I have to say that Bobby's Burger Palace is worth all of the hype. The Chipolte Ketchup was great with the fries and onion rings. Also, the burgers were great. I had Bobby's Blue Burger and my wife had the LA Burger. This place is definitely worth a try and we will be going back again at some point in the future.
