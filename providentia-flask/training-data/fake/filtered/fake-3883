It was my first time going here with 3 friends and it really could have been better. The waitress wasn't very attentive and seemed to try to be nice but you could tell she wasn't. My friends ordered the mussels which they claimed were good, and I got the tomato soup and a cornbread muffin which was actually pretty good. As far as the entrees go , none of us seemed really pleased. Two of my friends got the special of pasta and shrimp, and their pasta wasn't cooked properly. I go the eggplant sandwich, which fell apart, wasn't well seasoned and I could honestly make better at home. Two of us got drinks a sangria and a ruby margarita I believe, it was ok but I've had much better. At the end when we got out bill they added a 20% gratuity to our check. For four people, I think that was total bs, especially considering the waitress was not that friendly and the food not really worth it. Don't think I'll be returning to this place, there are much better choices in philly than this.
