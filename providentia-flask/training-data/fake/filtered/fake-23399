After having had a great dinner at Budakkan in Manhattan (check my review) my friends and I came here for dessert. I have been coming here on and off for about 10 years. It's a small quaint spot. dimly lit and perfect to end a cozy night. they have a terrific assortment of pastries & cakes and hot beverages. They also have a food menu, pizza's calzone...Italian fare which is also very tasty. but we just went to cap off the night. This little place is charming and is always busy...guess why they've managed to stay afloat with 8 Strabucks per city block! Cappuccino was delicious. Tiramisu creamy & decadent! You must give this charming little place a visit 2 thumbs up!
