Really a wonderful place and an icon in Philadelphia. So much variety, great prices and unique shops. This place has come a long way in the 30 plus years I have been going there. Still love the diner, fruit stands, flower shops, spice shops and all the great names associated with the market. And Amish vendors are still providing some of the most delicious items around. Something for everyone and always an adventure.
