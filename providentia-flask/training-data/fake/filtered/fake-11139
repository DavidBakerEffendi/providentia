I've been trying to buy an in-store gift card for a family member that loves this place.  The system to buy the gift card is so outdated it seems really sketchy. (Who asks for a photocopy of important information anymore, that's what Paypal is for.)  Furthermore, after following their instructions I haven't received any confirmations or follow-up. Voicemails and emails have been ignored too.   Really disappointed that they've made it so hard and ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET A HOLD OF.
