Feeling really ripped off going to this place. I was really excited to try this place after getting a recommendation from a friend an artist that lives in Brooklyn. Sounded amazing, an off the grid(bushwick)sushi joint which fantastic reviews on yelp. Unfortunately, its simply not worth it. The positives, the space is really cool. Kinda like someone's garage that got pimped out. And the owner is a very friendly guy. The bad - the quality of the sushi is just not good. We got the 70 dollar per person pre-fix so i tried a little bit of everything. They have the sushi bombs, which is really just a piece of fish sushi over a bigger "bomb" sized piece of rice and a dab of Mayonnaise. The rice cold and the fish chewy. I really don't get it, I could have to gotten similar quality fish from Duane Reade. We also got this special steak that is supposed to be even better then Kobe. I forgot what the name was, and it might ahve been but it was so overcooked that it tasted no better then the steak you get on manager's special. I guess that what I get for ordering steak at a sushi joint. Skip this place if you live in Manhattan. Any mid-tier sushi joint would be better then this.
