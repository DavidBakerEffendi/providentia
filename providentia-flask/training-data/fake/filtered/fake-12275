Stopped by the other night and had a great experience! Loved the new menu and the look of the joint! If you are looking for great steak, you have to try this place. It was cooked just right ( getting harder to find nowadays)! Even though the just opened the my waitress knew the menu and her suggestions were great. She was polite and attentive without hovering over the table like they do at other places. Like MacArthur, we shall return!
