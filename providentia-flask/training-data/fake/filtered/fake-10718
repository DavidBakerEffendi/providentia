Their food is delicious! I love seafood and so i usually order their grilled whole sea bass fish and it's the best, very tasty sweet and juicy. The only cons is it's expensive but worth it to me. Me and my husband also love their adana and doner kebabs. Very tasty, generous amount and decent price. Their food presentation is great and staff are friendly.
