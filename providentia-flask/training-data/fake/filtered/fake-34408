Supper was just AMAZING! I invited about 20 people for my 25th birthday dinner and the staff was SO helpful throughout the whole experience. I live abroad and the manager kept in touch with me often to finalize the menu (they have two options: 3 or 4 courses) and was incredibly attentive to answering any questions I had. Made it easy to plan a dinner from across the Atlantic! They let us decorate the cozy private room downstairs and plug in our ipod to their sound system. It felt incredibly personalized, not just like any other dinner. The food was great - can't go wrong with those meatballs - and the free-flowing wine of the prix-fixe was a great accompaniment. Dinner quickly turned into a full-out celebration dancing to our favorite tunes while indulging on cake. It felt like I had hosted a birthday party in the intimacy of my own home and didn't have to worry about one thing! Conclusion: If you are thinking about planning a group dinner, Supper is a MUST!
