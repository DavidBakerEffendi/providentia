I've been here a number of times now, and have been consistently happy with it. Love that there is a small bar snack-type section to the menu, because the bar area (with a couple of tall tables separate from the actual bar) is a great place to have a happy-hour bite. The cocktail list is AMAZING. The "Uncle Ralph" is a winner. Appetizers are all really solid, but I have to say that the duck confit and the grilled octopus blew me away. I'm that person who always orders the grilled octopus when I see it on a menu, and this was right up there with the best I've had. Pastas are all very, very good, and all housemade. The bolognese and the rabbit rigatoni are faves - I always lean towards the meat sauces. I usually don't order meat entrees (I stick with appetizers and pastas) but the last time I was there I was really surprised by how good the chicken was (being that it was chicken, the most boring meat on earth). Someone at our table ordered it and we all tried it, because it was really surprising that it was a standout among the rest of our entrees. Our waiter was great, as is the ambiance--depending on where you're seated, it can be bustling and fun or cozy and private. I will keep coming back!
