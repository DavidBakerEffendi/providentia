I've been to Shots a bunch of times, and the food is always great.  And the portions are huge.  I had a chicken quesadilla that I swore the bar had to lose money on because there was so much cheese and chicken.  On another order, not sure if the cook messed up or what, but my order of mini sliders looked like 3 full size cheeseburgers.  There always seems to be drink specials too, both during lunch and weeknights.  I would like a better bathroom set up (which may not be anyone's fault because it was packed that night), but other than that, everything is always top notch.  Definitely going to continue coming back.
