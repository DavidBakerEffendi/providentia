If you ever find yourself in Kensington, this is the bar to go to. The food is amazing, and they really did an excellent job with the decor and atmosphere. Great beers, a knowledgeable and friendly waitstaff, and a good crowd makes this a hidden gem in the entire city. I know it may be far from center city and some of the other more popular areas, but if you are looking for an adventure or a new place to try out. Seriously check this place out. It will be worth your time, and you will be thanking me later.
