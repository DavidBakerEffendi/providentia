This is the worst place we have ever ordered from. We just dropped $50.00 for a delivery order. They sent us the wrong pizza and cut it wrong. So we called the lady and politely said that the pizza they delivered was not correct. She said Oh sorry I made a mistake. So we said ok so what are you going to do about it. She said to eat it anyway and hung up in our face. We both work in food business and would never treat any customer that way. I would never recommend anyone spend their hard earned money there. The dough was chewy with absolutely no flavor and to the women that hung up in our face I hope this review turns other hard working people away from your terrible restaurant. On another note "karma" is a good word to sart the new year lady.
