Peaches did me justice one Sunday afternoon after my cousins Graduation. Sat down pretty quickly party of 5 table was clean water was served and also the waiter introduced herself smiled and made us feel welcome. I ordered the French toast and Cheese Grits Eggs And Bacon (Turkey) since I was driving I couldn't order any cock tails in which I wanted cranberry juice was fine. The food to my surprise was great didn't like the grits too much it was not thick how I like it but no need to complain. Parking was good it was cool and quiet they have so many places to sit outside and imside and also at the bar .. Peaches you're amazing I appreciate your service I just want you to know AND YOU ARE IN BED STUY SALUTE !!!
