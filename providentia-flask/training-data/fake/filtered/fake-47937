We've been to this restaurant on numerous occasions (over 20 times) and initially enjoyed our experience.  However, recently the food and service have fallen off. The quality of the tapas is quite variable depending on the day and how busy it is - the food at times is poor; at times good. The sangria is horrible - who serves Sangria without fruit????? The drinks are now mostly ice. When the owner was there every day, the service was great and he made good efforts to ensure that clients were pleased. More recently, he is often not at the Hamden location and staff at the Hamden location are chatting, the manager sits at the bar with very little interest in seeing that things are running smoothly (the previous manager was pleasant and greeted clients - this current manager sits at the counter with a laptop). We have had to wait for our tapas for extended periods  and feel that the service is certainly not what it was before. Overall,  the service has decreased and the quality of the food has fallen - the entire experience is not worth the money and we will no longer spend our money for service and food which varies so greatly from one visit to another.
