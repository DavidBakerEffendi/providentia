As we live in the UK only 1st visit, last week. The children visited twice. What a good quality of burgers, 100% mince ! Delicious. Creating a personal burger was new for me, but pleased very much. Nice and clean establishment and a very friendly & helpful service. Mc Johnny's does not offer such a good quality (not in UK/Europe anyway), as far as I know. A real meal, to stop the hunger. My compliments to everyone, Henri PS A very convenient location too
