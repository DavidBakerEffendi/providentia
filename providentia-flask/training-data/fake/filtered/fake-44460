The beer selection is awesome and generally the place is a great way to spend a Friday night, I've done it many times but read the reviews about rude staff and be weary.  I have experienced it most recently with an unfortunate event.  I went there on a Friday night (06/06/2014) to watch a band and left my phone on a table.  The band found my phone and gave it to one of the staff who supposedly gave it to a manager.  You guessed it, the phone disappeared and not 1 single person was willing to help me but they were very quick to pass the buck to the next manager.  I went back 3 days in a row in attempt to track down the waitress or speak to the manager and just found myself being dismissed, like I was wasting their time.  I've been a long time patron and have looked past sometimes spotty service that sometimes can't be helped because of capacity, but can't get over this latest episode.
