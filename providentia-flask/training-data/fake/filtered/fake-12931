i had the octopus pizza here more than a year ago, and i'm still high over it!   their pizza is top notch, their pasta is top notch, service was great. i actually like it better than vetri, but there's a bit of a personal foible there, so i won't go into it.  anyway, i would come here once a week, if i had the bankroll!
