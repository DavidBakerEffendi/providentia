What a fiasco! Probably prisoners on death row receive better service! Made a reservation days in advance. Arrived on time and was told there were six parties ahead of me and reservations didn't matter! Yes, that's exactly what the manager said. Then he told me to get out of his way. I kept looking for the hidden camera figuring this must be some kind of joke. Needless to say we left and will NEVER go back!!
