I love this bar, the service is always good, the girls that work there are nice, and I haven't had a single thing there I haven't liked.  Their sandwiches that I have had so far have been great, the Salmon BLT, Pear and Brie sandwich, and Veggie Burger are all good, and veggie burgers are hard to get right.  Their kitchen is open late so it's a good spot to go late when you're hungry.  Their food is much better than typical bar food.  I bring people there all the time!
