Hands down, THE BEST sushi I have ever had in my entire life.Way better than Fat Salmon or any of those other fancy places where the seating totally sucks. I can't stop thinking about it. Probably going back there today. The Aspen rolls were the most amazing thing I've ever put in my mouth. Girl behind the counter was super sweet, she also gets 5 stars. Bit of a hole in the wall, not ideal for a first date.But, if you want the greatest sushi Philly has to offer, check this place out.
