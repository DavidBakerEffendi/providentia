1/3 supermarket 2/3 restaurants More restaurant than supermarket. I went to Eataly this evening (7pm) to do some grocery shopping and eat some gelato. The store is not really made for shopping. It seems to be more of an eating destination. The aisles or to slim to easily navigate your cart. The produce selection is very small and unfortunately not much organic produce is offered (I saw some organic greens, but nothing else; prices are in line with Whole Foods, just nothing organic). So nothing for me to buy in that section. Moving on to the cheese: nice selection of differently time-period aged parmesan cheese. The cookie and chocolate section was DISAPPOINTING. I am regularly buying Italian sweets from shops on Amazon and was very much looking forward to that section. No Ferrero, Baccio, or other - just expensive artisanal pieces (8.99 for a small choco bar; 9.99 for some cookies). The pasta section is through a couple of restaurants. Definitely big, but expensive (5.99 and up; Barilla is cheap at around $2). There are so many different oils on offer. No indication though on flavors or usage; so I was lost. I like that Williams and Sonoma tells you about the taste or special usage. I do not think that the space used up by canned tomatoes is well used. They charge 5.99 for a can of peeled tomatoes that you can get at Gristede's for 1.29. Bread was good, foccacio was mushy. Fresh meat looked good, my husband was really disappointed that they do not have any Italian sausages. To go to the check-out, make your way again through a restaurant. The gelato was unfortunately almost completely sold out (only hazelnut and strawberry left over. Conclusion: Whole Foods will not lose the yuppies to Eataly for fresh food, but potentially for the restaurants. I with they would get some of the Italian cookies, chocos, etc. that can be found in every Italian supermarket.
