... I travel a looooong long way to eat Pho at this little eatery!!! All way from LONDON UK!!! ... My mom is great at making pho... I am brilliant At making pho... But this place top it all... They know their pho!! For a viet girl to admit someone else mom can make better Pho than her own mother is a huge ask... The corn-feed chicken was succulent, Cook to perfection.. Juicy , not over cook.. and just yum!! The pho broth was clear but so flavoursome.. The salt and pepper line leave dipping sauce was orgasmic.. Top with the side salad of bean sprout and Viet basil and mint and Lemon wedge was amazing!! The portion was very generous too. Am so glad that I track this Restaurant down while I was in Philadelphia.. It was definitely worth it!! Every mouthful!!! The staff are super efficient and friendly... And the food get to my table fast!!! Â This is homemade food heaven right here...!! And the chef?!! She was super duper cute.. She even come out to give me a cuddle once she realise how far I travel!!? Hope to be back in phila soon.. Lots of love PEARL thuy-huyen ( ENGLAND UK)
