I really loved this place. I go about twice a month or so. The food is great and so is their beer selection. I first tried sour beers here and I am hooked! I also love their pear and apple cider. When we go, we usually get Duck fries, the hummus platter and a burger. I have tried almost everything in the menu and I have really enjoyed everything. What amazes me is that even when the place is packed, the service is fast and cordial. We went for brunch once too and it was amazing too. Prices are right as well. One of my favorite watering/eating holes ever!
