this is the best hot pastrami sandwich ever. I went to one of those places on foodtv in North Jersey and all I kept thinking was I should of rushed home to get to K&A before they closed. I live in NJ about 10 minutes from Ben or Walt and it takes me bout 30 minutes to get here with no traffic from home and well worth the drive. I LOVE this place. Potato salad is good to. Have old school hood drinks aka Franks Black Cherry soda. did I say I love this place? the sandwiches are huge. Its enough to share with someone else. Pastrami sliced thin, warm on nice fresh bread. Line is always long but they move fast so 15-30minutes during busy times.
