since Hurricane Sandy I am really enthusiastic about  shopping local and eating at local restaurants since NJ got hit rather hard, I often check the deals on Groupon or Living Social deal to try new locations, I had seen Lalibela numerous times when I used to go to the gas station across the street I was happy to see an offer & purchased it immediately.   I was so pleased by the atmosphere when I walked in, a quaint little place with very attractive decor and several couples sitting at tables.  I walked up to the counter where a very pleasant young man stood I explained I'd never had Ethiopian.  I told him I'd need his help, he was more than happy to offer suggestions and ask my preferences.  Everything I selected was excellent.  I did not sit to eat I carried out, and there was so much food that I shared and still had plenty of left overs.  I plan to return today to try something else and plan to eat in.     Check it out I don't think you'll be disappointed!
