Forever I've been hearing how amazing Roberta pizza is and I've also heard that famous ppl love this place example Bill Clinton. Well I have no idea what on earth they must love about this light weight pizza? I just spent 17 bucks on a pie margarita pizza and it arrived cold and thinner than paper what a wast of money seriously. I've heard this place was the best pizza in town NOT according to my taste buds and proportions. Waste of money. The pizza joint on N7 and Bedford on the corner is far better and fulfilling than Roberta's.
