Well, my husband hadn't eaten here in about 30 years and I had never been there so we thought we'd try it out for lunch the other weekend. Plus we knew that Guy Fieri had been there awhile ago and recommended the hash. We didn't have the hash, and what we did have was absolutely dreadful. I ordered a simple egg salad on a croissant. You know, those light, flaky little rolls that are supposed to melt in your mouth. Fat chance. The croissant was like a brick. Actually, the brick would have tasted better. The egg salad had no taste. My husband had gotten a corned beef wrap. While he had no complaints about the overall taste, they had grilled it which made it greasy. And it was pathetically small. The cole slaw served with each was unremarkable. And they served, what I can only assume was supposed to be a pickle spear on top of the cole slaw. They looked like limp string beans. Very sad. And the service was pathetic. Once the waiter dropped off our food he walked by our table 5 separate times and never once asked if we needed anything or how the food was. My husband had to flag him down to get the check. Needless to say, we won't be going back.
