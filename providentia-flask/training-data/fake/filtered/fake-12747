This is such a cute little lunch place - houses a couple of small and two community tables. Great lunch spot - tiny and very friendly. Your waiter will most likely be Australian. The clientele from all over. Their salads are really not too shabby - if you like your salad a bit hearty, go for the Avocado Chicken Salad: mixed greens, grilled chicken breast, avocado & boiled egg. For a lighter salad go for the Pear & Walnut: with chicken, fresh pear, walnuts & arugula. And I absolutely love their Fresh Basil Lemonade.
