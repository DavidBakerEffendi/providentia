Ear Inn has just seen so many permutations, so much history, and that's what makes this cool hole in the wall so awesome.  It was a house for George Washington's African American aide, and then a speakeasy during prohibition.  It didn't have a name and the sailors used to call it the Green Door, but then, when they wanted to give it a formal name, instead of dealing with the licensing review boards' bureaucratic process, they just painted over the 'BAR' sign to read 'EAR'.  And that's just the kind of bar I love. A bar with a big plastic ear in the corner, that has jazz in this tiny little space on sundays, looks like it hasn't been touched since the days of Speakeasies and/or George Washington, used to be *on the waterfront* before they filled it in and is generally up to here in history.  I've never actually eaten there, I really should- but I hear their food is pretty stellar and I know from watching that it has enormous portions.  The beer is cold and cheap, the bartender is friendly, and as a whole I like the Hudson Square work crowd- they're kind of artsy (WNYC is just a couple blocks east of there) and good natured.  A cold beer is a cold beer is a cold beer,  but this is a great bar. Hudson Square is lucky to have it.
