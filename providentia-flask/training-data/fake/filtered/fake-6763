i've been coming here for so long. I recently moved out of the neighborhood and miss bistango! they just (last april) completed a full renovation and updated the menu. This is the perfect neighborhood restaurant. Anthony is the best. Makes you feel as part of the family. chirs the bartended is hilarious too!
