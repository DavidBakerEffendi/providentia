My first time at this place. Food was really good and I would have gone with 5 star if chicken tikka was little better. Service was excellent and main dishes I orders (malai kofta and Chicken Dahiwala) were excellent. I will be going back and may change review to 5 star after my 2nd visit, hopefully.
