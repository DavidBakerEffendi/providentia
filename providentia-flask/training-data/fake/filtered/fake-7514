As much as I enjoy the food here I dont see what all the fuss is about its a solid Italian restaurant thats all. I dont see waiting an hour for a table especially that there is no bar to wait at, anfd yes they have a wine bar big deal. The service gets a bit scirmish when its busy but there is no decor no ambiance, simply a good Italian joint
