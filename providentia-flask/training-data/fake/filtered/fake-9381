Lombardi's is a new york staple. You can't come to the city and experience the deliciously thin crust pizza, the relaxed environs and the friendly service. The secret is in the sauce and the perfect crust. Hot tip: they even deliver to your favorite nearby bar if you get the munchies while your out!!
