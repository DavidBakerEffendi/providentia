Cute and intimate space!  If possible, get a seat by the bar so you can see the chefs make the tapas.  Also, reservations are rather tough to come by, so I would try booking about 2 weeks in advance. Each dish is so different and some of the flavors, though contrasting, complement each other so well and create a synergistic effect of food euphoria!  Try the duck egg with mojama and the crispy pork belly with green market apples.  Sumptuous! My fiance and I shared 5 tapas and 1 dessert, which ended up being a perfect amount for us. I blogged about the rest of my experience at this restaurant here: nycfinedining.blogspot.c…
