I have been to Kenji Fusion a couple of times and always had good experience there until this past Saturday, April 23rd. I went there with two of my friends and we ordered salads as well as a couple specialty rolls. Everything was going great until I was on my 3rd sushi roll when my tooth hit something hard. I thought at first it was a shell because I was eating a roll with crabmeat as one of the ingredients. After a second bite I hit the hard piece again and pulled it out of my mouth. Once I pulled it out of my mouth I noticed it was not a piece of shell but a 1 inch zip-zag shaped wire! I showed it to our waitress immediately and she brought the situation of the owner who walked over to our table with a big attitude. He started to raise his voice as he accused me of putting the wire into the sushi roll to try and get a free meal!!! Which is ridiculous!!!! After a short argument with the owner, he stormed off. The hostess came over who was very sweet and apologetic and offered to give us a percentage off our meal. I was speechless. I couldn't' believe an owner would accuse a customer of doing something like this, plus scream at them in front of other customers! I was so embarrassed and annoyed that we told the hostess we would like to pay our bill and leave ASAP. After leaving for a couple of minutes she returned stating we did not have to pay for anything and to please leave. We left our waitress a tip and left. I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!!!
