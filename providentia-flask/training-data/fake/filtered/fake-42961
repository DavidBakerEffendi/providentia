I ordered a chicken biryani, muton curry and Paneer masala. The veg dish was good but the chicken biryani and mutton curry sucked.. It was like chicken, rice and onions were coked seprately and them mixed together and little spices added on top to make the biryani. Mutton curry was not cooked properly.
