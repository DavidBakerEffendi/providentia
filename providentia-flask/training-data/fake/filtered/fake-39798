BY FAR THE WORST DELIVERY EXPERIENCE EVER. I've never reviewed a restaurant in my 7 years in NYC but my experience with this gross joint changed that. It took exactly 63 minutes from seamless order to delivery. When I called to check up on the order I was scolded for calling and made to feel bad for being in a warm apt while his delivery man was doing his job although Im pretty sure I paid for the pleasure. THE FOOD ARRIVED COLD, SOGGY, INEDIBLE. No joke, my dog sniffed at it and left the room disgusted. APPROPRIATELY NAMED STEAKJOINT; THIS PLACE SAPPED MY APPETITE LIKE SAMSON'S STRENGTH...... P.S. you cant give a place ZERO stars???
