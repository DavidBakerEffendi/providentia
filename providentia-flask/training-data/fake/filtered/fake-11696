I read some good reviews before going to the Sushi Palace.  I liked the concept, but reality was bad.  The food was not fresh at all.  We were afraid to put the sashimi in our mouths.  The teriyaki, any kind, was buried under a scoop of sauce, without knowing that was teriyaki, I'd never knew what it was.  The presentation of food just made them unappetizing and after tasting we did not want to eat much.  The waitress did not spoke English well, so communication was not easy.  With $22.99 a person, I'd rather go to a regular place,  order what I want to eat.
