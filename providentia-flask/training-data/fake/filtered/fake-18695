Simply said, "THIS IS MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN NEW YORK." Wow. The decor is incredibly beautiful. There are always fresh flowers. The bar is beautiful. The ceilings are high and the colors put you at rest. The service....it is the best in New York City. The food is fantastic. The drinks are terrific. You can dine in the dining room or in the bar area. They have two different menus...depending of where you sit. I like the bar area for lunch and the dining room for dinner.
