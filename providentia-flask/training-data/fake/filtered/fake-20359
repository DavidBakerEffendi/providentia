A great place to hang out before Prudential Center events, Edison Ale House is also the perfect spot for lunch. I had two appetizers, fried pickles and pretzel sticks. The pretzel sticks were my favorite of the two, but I finished both. The menu is full of great choices, but since it was lunchtime, I chose one of the burgers. I had a bacon cheeseburger with regular fries ( they have a variety of fries too ) and the meal did not disappoint. The restaurant has a great atmosphere, comfortable and relaxing. The staff is very courteous and efficient. Our orders were delivered promptly and correctly. The menu is affordably priced, and features daily specials, so there is something for everyone to enjoy. I will be going back. There's lots more for me to try!
