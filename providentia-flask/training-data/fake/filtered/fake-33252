Perfect little neighborhood joint with a large enough menu to keep it interesting if one eats here at least once a week. Really, what more could one want? Well executed dishes with simple ingredients, a super warm staff, a cute garden, wine and beer, good coffee and a laid-back atmosphere. Nothing more, really. OK, the use truffle oil in a great many dishes is a bit of an overkill, but that's not such a bad thing in itself. I kinda like truffle oil (especially in mac & cheese!)
