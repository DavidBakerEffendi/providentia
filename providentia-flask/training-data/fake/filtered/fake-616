Poor experience last night. We had a reservation. They were about half full  but  were seated in the worst table in the house right next to the kitchen separated by a flimsy curtain. We watched as many new arrivals with no reservation were seated in the better locations. My food was very poor.  The duck leg was served with the thigh sliced right through the bone.  It consisted of 10% meat and 90% was fat and bone. The meatless drumstick bone was hidden on the plate under a bed of raw shredded carrots. Who places a bone on a plate and where was the meat that had been removed from the bone? The fried rice appeared old, reheated and was tasteless served with about a tablespoon of soy sauce. My companion's entree included calamari that was so tough and rubbery it was inedible. My complaint to the manager brought a "sorry" .  At least a comp for coffee would have been appropriate.  We will not return. The one star is for pleasant and timely service.
