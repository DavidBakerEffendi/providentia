Melograno is a great little Italian place in the Rittenhouse area.  Finding a reasonably priced, BYOB restaurant in this area is tough, but Melograno fits the bill!  I recently brought a party 10 there for a celebratory dinner.  Making reservations was easy and convenient, and they were very professional (called to confirm the day before, provided a menu in advance, etc.).  Everyone loved their food and the portions were generous for the price.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  It was a bit noisy, but other than that, it was a great experience.  I will definitely return here soon!
