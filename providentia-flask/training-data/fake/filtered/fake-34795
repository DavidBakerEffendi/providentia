My first review - so why not start with the most reviewed restaurant on all of Yelp?! Ippudo is worth the wait. Done. The atmosphere is festive and friendly; the food is sensational. My favorite of their ramens is the Modern - its broth a silky, almost buttery, indulgence of flavors. You can see the chefs making the noodles as you're led to your table and by the end of your meal, you will know that you just glimpsed genius. Also on my Ippudo playlist (on repeat for many years) are the pork buns and hot, house sak√© which -bonus- can both be ordered up front while you wait. In sum, the patient are rewarded. And now those daunting wait times go by even faster as the hostess will take your phone number and text you when your table is ready, allowing you to venture into nearby stores if you don't snag a spot at the bar.
