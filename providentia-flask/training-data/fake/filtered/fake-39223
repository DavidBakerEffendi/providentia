This is one of my favorite restaurants. The food and service are outstanding. The tavern is casual and the decor is reminiscent of an English pub. The pork-pulled sandwich and Rocky Hill burgers are especially delicious.  For more formal occasions, the dining room is warm and elegant. The salmon and Griggstown chicken are my favorites here, but you can order from either menu in either room, so that's a plus.     This is definitely a winner!
