So on my first and only trip to Philly, the group I was with for the conference I was at decided to go to geno's. I noticed pat's across the street. It's definitely not as flashy looking as geno's but it doesn't have to be. I ate a Philly from geno's and immediately walked across the street and got one from pat's. I was immediately confused by their sign directing people on how to order. After reading it over for about 5 minute to make sure I understood how to order(if you screw it up or take too long they send you to the back of the line. Lol). After ordering the sandwich it was about a 1 minute wait before it was in my hands. I have to say that hands down, pat's Philly cheesesteaks are a cut above geno's. The beef is more flavorful, the roll is softer, and the selection if cheeses and other toppings is much better. I know everyone has their opinion and they're both amazing sandwiches but for this Oregonian, pat's is the sure winner in philly's cheesesteak war.
