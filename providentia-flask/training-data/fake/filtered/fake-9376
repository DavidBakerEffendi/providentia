Ok - the staff were really excellent. The Front Of House lady was charming, accommodating and genuinely nice. The waiters were equally nice - I guess this stuff starts from the top down. We loved the cozy size and the intimacy of the place - it's really charming. So why only four stars?  Unfortunately the food itself was just ok.  The fish starter (sardines) was good.  The onion soup was very good - definitely try that.  It's quite filling though. The rest of our dishes were over salted.  We had the half chicken and the fish of the day, and a side of Kale.  The Kale was almost pickled in salt and wasn't nice at all. The half chicken was disappointing. There's so much you could do to make it really yummy - but it just got a load of salt and pepper. So we love the place, the staff, the ambiance and SOME of the food.  The rest of the food needs to improve fast. This place really deserves to have great food.
