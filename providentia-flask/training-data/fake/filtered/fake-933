Awesome place.  Great food, friendly staff and reasonable prices.  Would highly recommend it!  While not everything on the menu is traditional, they have enough tried and true recipes, mixed with some really creative dishes.  The staff was particularly attentive and went out of their way to be friendly and accommodating, which seems harder to find nowadays.  Try it and you won't be disappointed! Highly recommended!
