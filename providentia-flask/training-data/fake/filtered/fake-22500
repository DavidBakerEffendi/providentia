A restaurant can be a magical place. There is something wonderful about great food, great ambience, comfortable seating and a relaxing atmosphere that lends itself to conversation and camaraderie...pair that with a chef who clearly puts his passion and love of food on every plate and you have perfection. Roia is just such a place. I have eaten there a number of times and each experience was a joy. The menu is compact and painstakingly chosen so that each dish satisfies. The wine list is top notch. The staff is friendly, well trained and attentive. If these are qualities in a restaurant that appeal to you, then go as soon as possible. Let them work their magic
