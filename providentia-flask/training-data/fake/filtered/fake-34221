extremely overrated like NOBU.. but I don't have to argue with anyone. Because I don't see many japanese custmers in this restaurant, whic h simply means the price is overpriced and food is not worth it. It wasn't bad, but there are tons of better restaurants in Japan,and they Â are much cheaper than YASUDA.and we Japanese peope know that. so we don't go there. sorry.
