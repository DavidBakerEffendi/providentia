What a neighborhood gem.  I went here for brunch and was floored.  The food was delicious. Service was on point and totally more than it needed to be.  The dessert was just right.  I think the brunch prices are reasonable, and am dying to try the lunch special they have going on.  Totally check out this place and sit outside, too.  The inside is also nice flet like vacation dinner..( Being away from home) I'm bringing my girls here for our friday lunch.............:-)
