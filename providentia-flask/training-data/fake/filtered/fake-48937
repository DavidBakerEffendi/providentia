A few weeks ago I wrote a rather scathing review of Almond on YELP, upon my first visit there. And while I stand by the accuracy of that experience, I must say I was pleasantly surprised when someone from Almond's management tracked me down, apologized and invited me back to Almond for another try. I tried it again last night with three friends and our experience could not have been more different. This time the food, service and attention to detail were exceptional - 5 stars! When we arrived, we were seated right away.  The primary waiter serving us was amazing - great attitude and very attentive.  The food was delicious; we mostly ordered seafood as I now realize that, that is Almond's strength.  We were treated as royalty.  I am impressed that the restaurant cared about our unpleasant prior experience and invited us to return so they could show their better side.  And that better side, which I hope is their norm, is spectacular.
