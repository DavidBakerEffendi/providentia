Carne asada and carnitas tacos were pretty good. Perhaps they should be double wrapped? Corn tortilla fell apart halfway through. But I always prefer more filling to less. Hope this place does alright. They're on a side street that doesn't get a lot of Â foot traffic. People who work here are super friendly.
