This was the WORST place I've eaten at during my 3+ years of Manhattan living!   I don't understand how or why everyone keeps giving it good reviews!  Me and my girlfriend ordered two separate meals and they were both sub-par, awful, and inedible!   I had the pizza with 'fresh tomatoes, crushed garlic, and basil' - what I got was ragu sauce on some day-old crust, with chopped, stale garlic left in massive chunks!  My girlfriend got eggplant parmesian with 'homemade sauce' which was eggplant with some breadcrumbs tossed on it, more sauce/ragu and a lame piece of cheese! I'm not harsh when it comes to food, I love nothing more than a good meal, but this was a $30 meal that ended up being picked at, and then trashed, because it was repulsive and expensive.
