We learned about this place from a friend, so we tried for the first time.  It's a typical small Korean restaurant (in a plaza).  The side dishes are basice such as bean sprouts, cucumbers, Kimchi, etc.  But I was disappointed since they don't taste fresh.  We ordered Tofu soup, and BBQ.  The soup tastes good, however it's not spicy enough even with "spicy", we need to order "very spicy" next time.  The BBQ tastes good, but smaller portion compared to what we normally get from other restaurant with the same price.  We compared this restaurant with our favorite Korean rest. on Main Street in Fort Lee, (specialize in soft tofu only).
