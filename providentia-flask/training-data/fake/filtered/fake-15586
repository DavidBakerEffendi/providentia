This place is here to stay. I have been coming in for lunch since this place opened. There were some challenges with service early on but I guess that is to be expected. However, the food has always been and continues to be amazing, always fresh and consistent. I love the selection of specialty rolls and the fact that it also has some alternatives such as coconut sea scallops. I find the price quite reasonable in comparison to other quality sushi establishments. The decor is elegant but unpretentious, a successful balance of cool and comfort.
