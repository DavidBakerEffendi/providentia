Ordered from this restaurant on Seamless last night. The amount of food we received was completely unacceptable. We ordered three pasta dishes, all three contained barely anything!! Â I proceeded to call the restaurant back to ask what happened, the person took down my order, said they'd speak to their boss and more food was on the way. That food never came. I bet this restaurant is great in person, but i'd stay away on Seamless.
