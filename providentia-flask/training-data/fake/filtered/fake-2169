This was our second time at Il Pittore. Once again this restaurant delivers! The food was fantastic.  We followed our server's suggestions and he was spot on.  On a side note, Kevin (our server) was fantastic.  I would recommend requesting him if you go. His attention to detail, food knowledge and familiarity with the menu was second to none (and I've been to most all of the Starr restaurants). We had the following:Crudo Tasting, Merluzzo Affumicato, the grilled shrimp special, Tortellini,Pappardelle,Malloreddus, Pescatrice Saltimbocca, Brasata D'Agnello, Guancia Di Vitello, Sorbet for dessert. Yes there were three of us this time. The overall consensus of the group was our favorite entree was the Lamb and the favorite appetizer was the shirmp special.   Northern Italian comfort food with a modern twist!
