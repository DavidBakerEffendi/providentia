Horrible service. Rude personnel. I've never written a bad review before, but we were so irritated with the service. We walked in Frank Pepe's as another customer was exiting. Immediately inside we saw a sign to our left that read, "Please Seat Yourself." There were two empty booths so we sat down. Five minutes later a male employee approached and abrasively questioned if are on the list. I said, "oh, I saw the sign to seat ourselves." Then he became a bit obnoxious treating us as if we were stupid because we didn't see his other sign on the entrance door that says to wait to be seated (the opposite of the other sign.) Hello? How can customers READ the sign on the door if the door is open -- a customer was exiting as we were entering so we couldn't read the sign. Duh. Yet this employee was treating us as if we were stupid and rude. We walked out and will NEVER try this place again. Fortunately there are several other fabulous pizza places. We found another place with GREAT service and delicious pizza!
