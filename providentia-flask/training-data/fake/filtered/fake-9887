Can't figure out if I like this place or not.  I walked in from work and wasn't in the mood to head to Shake Shack so I went to check it out.  Here is the breakdown.  Since I was pretty hungry, I walked in in a bit of a grumpy mood.  The staff didn't make me feel any better when I was ordering.  It seemed as if it was extremely troubling for the cashier to take my order.   I wound up getting a regular burger and it was actually pretty good.  Truffle fries on the side definitly turned me from grumpy to happy (but sleepy!)  The place was a bit unkempt and a tad hot but overall I would go back if the staff was a bit more attentive to making the customers feel welcomed.
