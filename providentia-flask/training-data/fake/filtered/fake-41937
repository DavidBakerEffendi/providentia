Went here with my wife on a Friday night.  The food was very good overall and good sized portions-We order the make your own guacamole as an appetizer and it was probably the best I have ever had.  We were quite disappointed in the service however.  From the beginning of the meal to the end, we felt like we were being rushed.  Our guac came out before we even ordered our meals.  And our meals came out while we were eating the guac. After we finished our meals, the waiter came and packed up our left overs and immediately returned with the check.  I have never been to a restaurant where coffee and dessert were available yet we were never asked if we would like some or anything else. We were a both in a little bit of shock.  We waited another 15 minutes or so and finally flagged down another waiter to take our dessert order. I understand it was a Friday night but still there are certain courtesy that should ALWAYS be extended!  And there was no one waiting for a table and there were even several other tables open for some time.  Enjoy the food but be prepared for the lack of service!
