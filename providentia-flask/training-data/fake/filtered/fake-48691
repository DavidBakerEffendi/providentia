This has been a neighborhood staple for at least 8 years. The food is wonderful and the owner, Socrates, is the nicest guy ever. A few years back they had a special empanada that blew my mind. I can't remember what was in there. I was in there, literally, every day until I had to stop because I gained 10 pounds. I take every out-of-towner here when they visit and each if them becomes an addict. If you're in the neighborhood, it's definitely worth a visit. Seating is extremely limited so try visit before or after the dinner rush. Good tunes are usually playing too.
