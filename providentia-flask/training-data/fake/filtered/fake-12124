Okay guacamole, bagged (stale) chips. Indifferent service--even though the owner was there and only two other tables were occupied. No drinks offered. The waitress returned 10 minutes after we'd placed our food orders to tell us they were out of pipian (pumpkin-seed) sauce. "Red or green" were the only options. I ordered green, she warned me it would be hot. It wasn't, and chicken enchiladas were a gloppy bland mess. Other dishes were poorly prepared, too--mostly bland, or with one overpowering flavor. Too bad-- there aren't many Mexican restaurants with liquor licenses in the area.
