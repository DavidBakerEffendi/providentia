Yesterday was the third or fourth time we've visited this restaurant during the past year. One thing I can say is that there are no surprises at this restaurant. The food is always good, the fish is done perfectly, and I loved the sheaphard salad grated feta on top. The fish was whole Branzini on the grille. If you like medeterrainian cuisine, you will really like this place.
