Huge disappointment! Checked the ratings prior to going, reality is that the food was expensive and mediocre at best. Omelete was $9.00 served with one Slice of toast and nothing else. No homefries or fruit. Was service good? No, asked for my check and they wouldn't stop counting their tips to bring me my check. People came in and they were ignored! Looking for a good breakfast spot in Westville this is not the place.
