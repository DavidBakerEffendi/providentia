Le Parisien is what NYC was missing. An authentic french bistro. Period. The atmosphere is real (Christian, the owner, professional and friendly, Â was born in Paris, and has worked in the best restaurants in NY for 20 years), the food is to die for and very affordable (classic dishes like escargots, frisee lardon poached egg, pate, soupe du jour, steak frites (home-made), confit de canard, etc... as well as creative dishes like a cod fish with mashed potatoes and black olives, skate with pumpkin risotto, moules frites with saffron, etc...). As far as the wines, you can either order a glass (10 different options), carafe or bottle. As a french native, i hardly recommend this new restaurant (opened last july and already packed). Also, great date place because it's cosy, and the music is very low, so you can talk ! Also, the $11.95 brunch is worth a cab ride if you don't live midtown. Bon appetit !
