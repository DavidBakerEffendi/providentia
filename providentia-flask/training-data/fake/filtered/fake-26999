As coming close to the end of year, it is not new to host families and friends. In addition, it is always tiresome to pick a nice restaurant to which gives good impression yet in affordable price range to bring them. When I heard a nice feedback from my co-worker after her visit to the new Asian food restaurant in East Hartford, it trigger me to try out.  As I expected, the restaurant had a nice ambience and offered fun and interesting food menus with great taste in affordable prices, and not to forget kind services.  When I sat down and finished ordering food, the wait staff put down comlimentary small side dishes on our table, like tapas. I first thought somebody else's order came to our table as mistake, and my guests and I were wowed when we found out that they were all on the house. They already paid off my bill. We all had so much fun and left the restaurant with great experience and full  stomach. Some, even went home with left-over food due to the generous food portion. I thank Goong Restaurant for making my guests pleased for this holiday. I do recommend this restaurant to many people and I am surely going back to try rest of their food that I have not tried on that day.
