I just had dinner here with two friends from an academic conference.  The food was really delicious.  For appetizers, we had the Ahi tuna dumplings with guacamole; pork belly; and dumplings in chili sauce.  The Ahi dumplings were deep-fried, which was a little surprising, but VERY tasty.  Pork belly was fantastic; the dumplings in chili sauce were a little boring next to the other two.  For entrees, we had the green curry with chicken; a hot pot with fish; and pan-seared Ahi tuna.  All were AMAZING.  The green curry was among the best Thai curries I've had anywhere.  Spicy, but manageable.  The hot pot was very spicy and very flavorful; the fish tasted fresh.  And the pan-seared Ahi was cooked just right (that is, rare) and nicely seasoned with pepper. The ambience is very hip; lots of colorful mood lighting, feels very trendy.  Service was excellent - fast, accurate, and unobtrusive.  I would definitely eat here again if in town.  The drink I had was a type of mojito and really good, generous pour loaded down with mint.  I was impressed that the bartender asked whether I'd like it sweet or "on the dry side."  I opted for "on the dry side", and it came out moderately sweet.  I'm curious about the authentic Szechuan menu - it looked very interesting for Chinese food connoisseurs.
