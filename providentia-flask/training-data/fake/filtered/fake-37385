I agree with Tanvi A's review and I think I have figured out what was that 'something' that was missing Tanvi mentions in her review - it was Taste...Duh.... The buffet options were pretty ordinary with the exception of Paneer Chilly - and for dessert they had Jello - yes Jello in an Indian restaurant - and given how watery it was they could have atleast given us some straws to sip from!!!! Bottomline - I am not going there again even if they pay me!!!
