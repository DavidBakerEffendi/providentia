Went to this restaurant last week, it was BYOB which was nice. The service was very good and the food seemed delicious as well. I ordered the spicy shrimp (which was not that spicy at all), calamari as appetizer, and had to go for the fried oreo dessert as well. Both I and the person I went with were feeling sick afterwards so maybe be wary of that combination/that dessert. Overall great service though, just don't make my mistake and order seafood + crazy dessert!
