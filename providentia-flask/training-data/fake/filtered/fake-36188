Terrible. Just terrible. The food was barley OK, but I guess anything is good when you've waited more than half an hour for it. Also, as other reviews have said, service is nonexistent. We walked in with high hopes for a good meal, but all the inconveniences made all of us not want to come again. First, they messed up the first order we said. Next, as said before the food took forever to come. Â I forgot to mention, but we were the only ones there. It must take an hour to get your food when there's more than 2 people there! Next, when we told the waiter we were missing an order, she said "it will get here when it gets here" she didn't even ask what order was missing. Overall this place is a pain. STEER CLEAR!!
