I went here with a friend for lunch once. Before I spoke to anyone, I noticed that I really liked the "uniforms" or outfits the waitresses were wearing. Unfortunately, once I started talking to the hostess, I wasn't excited anymore. I must admit my friend and I were being a bit indecisive about where we wanted to eat (inside or outside) and I wasn't hungry at that moment but I told her that I would sit with her while she ate. The hostess told us that we couldn't sit down unless both of us were eating, which I thought was a little odd. We decided to leave (mostly because of the hostess' attitude) so we went outside and then we decided to stay after all (I told you we were being indecisive). She reminded us with her rude tone that we couldn't sit down if we weren't both eating and we told her we would both get a little something. She took us to our table and literally threw our menus at us. As someone who used to live in LA (for 5 hellish years), I know pretense when I see it and this place just gives off that vibe. Like, "Are you good enough to eat here?" I don't eat at places because everyone else does--I eat at them because they're good and I enjoy myself. That is why I will never eat at Cafe Gitane again.
