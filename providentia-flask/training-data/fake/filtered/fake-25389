Anella is great. Definately the best restaurant in this area. The place itself is super cute, very charming and cozy. The food is always very very good. They do change up the menu alot, but it always turns out to be very good. They have a good wine list, and the servers are also super nice and friendly. The outdoor patio is very nice too. Definitely a greenpoint must.
