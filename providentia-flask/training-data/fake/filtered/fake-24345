The spice levels listed on the menu are * (low spice), ** (mildly spicy), *** (spicy) and ***** (super spicy).  Or something very close to that.  I am a huge fan of very spicy Thai curry dishes with a delicious Thai iced tea to cut through the heat.   Vientiane will NOT sell me the super spicy.  I don't know why.  I've tried ordering the spiciesy.  They will give me mild.  I've tried convincing the waitstaff that indeed they cannot make it hot enough.  I've received mild food.  I've even then pointed out a lack of heat in the dish and the crappy side of spicy red pepper flakes in oil.  My wife has had the exact same problem.  I gave up going here because it would appear they do not make anything spicy. Then, my friend Mike assured me he was actually served spicy food here.  It was renovated so I gave it another chance.  Both my wife and I ordered 5 stars.  Our waiter looked surprised with my wife's order and checked with her to confirm that she REALLY did want 5 stars.  She said yes, that she wants it as hot as possible.  5 stars.  MAKE IT HOT.  I then proceeded to order 5 stars as well. She received mildly spicy.  I received zero spice.  When the check arrived we were shocked.  Her order was written down with 5 stars next to it and TWO of the stars were whited out.  Yes, they changed her order.  Mine?  Well it had one star written next to it. I have no idea why.  But they will not sell us spicy food.  This is not just once, it is endemic.  Fans of spicy food, do not frequent this place.  I know I will not.
