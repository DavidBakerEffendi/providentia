Great place! Feel in love w brazilian bbq, found this place on restaurant.com, so decided to try it! The experience started w the free parking. Yes, its free but u tip the guys there...but I didnt like that I wasnt allowed to park my own car. Im very picky about handing over keys to my car! Once inside, the place was very nice. Decore was modern and clean. Our server was very nice and fast w our drinks. We ordered the all u can eat which came w the salad bar. The salad bar was big, lots of different things from cold salads, mozz & tomatoes, fruit, hot items... The only issue I had was the meat started to come out almost as soon as we sat down w our salad plates. The meat was delicious! And for the price...who can pass up all u can eat! We finished off w cappacino and good dessert of a big cart w many choices! The dessert and coffee were good! The bonus...we got a great price because of restaurant.com I cant wait to go back!
