I had a good experience getting takeout from here, but delivery was an embarrassment. I called after an hour to check on it (ETD was 45min.) and was told it was just out the door and would be here in 5-10min. Twenty minutes later, I called back, got an apology and an offer of free bubble tea. I said I don't drink bubble tea but would take $5 off my order. Ten minutes later (now 90min. of wait and twice the estimated delivery time) I called back to find out they canceled my order. Yes, this means I'm writing this review on an empty stomach, hence excessive grumpiness. I think the food is decent for the price but it's definitely not worth this headache.
