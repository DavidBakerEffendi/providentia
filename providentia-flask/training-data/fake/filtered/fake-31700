We ordered for dinner this evening, giving this restaurant one more chance at redemption after a bad experience about 6 months ago.  Not only did it NOT redeem itself, it completely nailed the coffin shut for us ever even considering this restaurant for a meal.  To begin, the man at the counter threw the change back at my son who went to pick up our dinner.  We ordered a large meatball grinder with peppers, cheese and sauce (which should not be considered extra in the first place) and a chicken Parmesan  grinder.  Neither were even edible and could not be eaten.  I am not kidding you here, it was thrown away!  I thought about going back to return it, but it's a very cold night and it's not worth it, but , this restaurant is probably struggling if this is the quality of food that they charge for and expect repeat clientele.  Stay away and spend your Italian  food dollars somewhere else.  Too bad...this restaurant has been in West Hartford for many years.
