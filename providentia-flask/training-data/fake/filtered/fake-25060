The staff seems very helpful and courteous.The restaurant is warm comfortable and very nicely appointed.      But hey your here to eat right?   The food is "AWFUL" I travel to the area twice a month and stay next door at the Quality INN so I actually gave this Restaurant "4"chances.   The food is eccentric,  weird...just bad. teriyaki steak......but no hint of teriyaki flavor just smothered in crumbled blue cheese? served  with a massive softball sized potato that was under cooked. Meatloaf with strange tart stuffings made several Weeks ago Corned beef hash with "HUGE" chunks of stringy (4 or 5 inches) beef  seasoned in some strange tangy flavor. Vegetable medley:    fried cucumbers,squash, peppers and onions with some peppery weird glaze. Salad bar is tiny with cheap dressing and a handfull of toppings. All three times some eccentric local band was playing original accustic guitar and singing in the bar.......all originals   all weird.......they fit right in
