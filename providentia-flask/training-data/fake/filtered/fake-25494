I believe that if you are in a public restaurant and behaving appropriately , you deserve to be treated appropriately. When you are celebrating with family and enjoying a night out, you should be forewarned at leunig's that you need to abide by their strict policy of prohibition. That is to say, that no one may have more than 2/2 liquor drinks within a 2 hour time frame ; ie Martini, Manhatten, Rusty Nail etc. We were not warned of their law, and I say that because it is not a VT State liquor law. We had just completed ordering our dinner and our 2nd Manhattan within the first hour ( we waited a half hour plus at the bar), when we were told we could not have a third Manhattan proceeding into our 2nd hour. Now I believe Leunigs has an obligation to pronounce their strict liquor law when anyone is ordering a 2 Liquor drink.The Manhattans were not  oversized by any definition, we were not driving afterwards, and we were not allowed to cancel the order 10 minute into placing the order so we could enjoy our time elsewhere, we ended taking it out because the  tense atmosphere . I have lived in Burlington  for over 25 years and had insisted that  we try Leunigs when others in our party read a different vibe about the hostess greeting. Unfortunately, that is the first and last time I will dine out or recommend Leunigs Bistro.
