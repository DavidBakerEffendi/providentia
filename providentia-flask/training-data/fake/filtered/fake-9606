its my favor sushi hibachi place in bayonne,,The fish was very fresh, good presentation  and good service.  Loved everything about the place.  Had all-u-can eat as well as a la cart sushi and hibachi.  Everything was well prepared . I have gone on two separate occasions and was not disappointed at all  either time. The service was excellent and you could see the hibachi chef entertaining as he was cooking for party of 10. It look like everyone was having a wonderful time. The place is clean and welcoming.  Adding a picture of their valentine roll to this review -- adorable and delicious!! i will definitely coming back.
