The first time I came to eat here, I wasn't able to because there was a long wait for a table. On my second try, someone booked the whole place. So I get it. Make reservations. We finally made reservations. When we got there, the host told us he didn't have us down for any reservations. We were finally seated after 15 minutes of him deciding where to put us although half of the dining area was available. He sat us by the entrance which is the most annoying place to sit at most restaurants. But we were happy to finally find out what the hype was about even after the reservation debacle. Â  The food was okay. We had the turista menu. If you like very buttery and salty Italian food, then this is the place for you. I prefer something flavorful (minus the load of butter and saltiness) over what they offer.
