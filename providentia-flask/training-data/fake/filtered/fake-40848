Visited this pizza place as we wanted to try some NY-style pizza and what better place to try it than at the first pizza place in America! We came in late (around 10 PM) for some dinner and there was still a lot of people there.  They make their pizzas using a coal-style oven, so, that definitely interested us! We got a medium pizza and added pepperoni, sausages, onions and mushrooms to it.  It came out pretty efficiently (10 mins) and the pizza was very tasty, the thin slices were great, and the price was reasonable!  The service was decent and I'd definitely see myself going to a pizza place like this!  The neighborhood pizza place, the history of the place, the good pizza... all good positives! Definitely like!  New York Pizza is definitely Great!
