Hungover hipster service with major attitude.  If you don't want to wait on people , then get out of the service industry.  And your food is fair at best.  I remember ordering a chicken burger and had a chicken sandwich brought out instead because the chicken was out of burgers (thanks for taking control of what I ate).  Then another time (fool me twice) you charge me 20% gratuity on 2 drinks.  So before you put receipts on blast, how about checking your service staff and your questionable business practices.  This place is 100% overrated. For a legit burger go to Sketch Burger on Girard or anywhere else but here.
