I recently had brunch with a friend at Champs and loved the food. I was fifteen minutes early, my friend fifteen minutes late...the story of my life. The hostess was very sweet and accommodating. There wasn't a whole lot of waiting and we ended up eating at the bar, which I generally like anyway. I ordered the 'Buenas Dias Salad' and it's definitely well named. Delicious! The tofu scramble here is much more flavorful than the scramble served up at Bliss on Bedford Avenue so I'm a convert. My very small gripe is that they only accept cash, which in this day and age can provoke feelings ranging from minor annoyance to extreme rage for a sociopathic diner. There's an ATM inside, but who wants to pay ATM fees when you're poor like me and still want to eat tasty vegan food? Well, I guess it's OK for a restaurant to be 'cash only' if indeed it's a money laundering business, but otherwise, get with the program.
