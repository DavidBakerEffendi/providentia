Everything about this place is great, except for the service.  I love the bartender, but sometimes he can be in an angry mood, but I'm sure dealing with idiots all day would put everyone in bad mood. The one hostess is just a straight up bitch, and thinks way too holy of herself.  Shes just a hostess, she needs to realize that.   Food is great though, and I still tipped 20% because you can't hate on a server just cause the bartender and hostess are mad at the world. Overall, this isn't the only bar with dim lighting and 80s metal, so they should stop acting like they are unique and different.
