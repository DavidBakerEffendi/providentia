My son and I were in town for the Yankees/Red Sox game.  We love BBQ and we love to visit  out of the way local places.  This is the best BBQ I've ever had bar none.  We had the brisket, ribs, potato salad and mac and cheese.  All excellent. Our waiter was very friendly and made excellent suggestions. Next time I'm in NYC, will definitely go out of my way to eat here again.
