As a result of the Stewart's being closed next door, we ventured here for some modestly priced diner fare. We were seated straight away and the server started friendly. My friends ordered three root beer floats and I asked for coffee. The server joked if I actually wanted another root beer float or ice cream in my coffee. I didn't like that, but there was a laugh had. The floats were good, to hear it from my friends. The coffee tasted like garbage. I like my coffee black, but had to add cream and sugar. We then ordered food. Rueben melt, disco fries, and chili cheese dogs with onion. The dogs weren't on the menu, but they agreed to make it. When water was brought out, we were asked who wanted the pink water, which had fruit punch traces in it. The fries came out about 15 minutes later. The instant gravy was not flavorful but the texture was fine. The cheese wasn't melted, but the rest of it was hot. A strange smell met my nose when the main courses came out. Could't identify it. The burger wasn't cooked to temperature. The dressing was off, the sauerkraut was on the verge of rancidity, and the bread was stale. I took three bites in the hope that it got better, but it didn't. The hot dogs were boiled and unusually pale. There was no onion. Just before they came out, the server mentioned an increased cost associated with the extra items. If only they mentioned it sooner. When asked if it were a dollar more, the server replied "Yeah, whatever." The price was doubled. The friend described it as the worst hot dog they'd ever had. We'd said as much to the server and he replied that we didn't have to eat at the establishment. After that, our food was rushed away. We left right as soon as we could. This could've been worse, but it was still a displeasing experience. Not returning.
