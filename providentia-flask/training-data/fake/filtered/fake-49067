Going to this place is like visiting long-lost family members! I've been to Evil Eye Cafe about four times now, and they've remembered me each time. The family who owns the place are wonderful, friendly, and generous people. I first visited with some friends when they had just opened, and as they were still setting prices, they charged us next to nothing for our food. Every successive time I've visited, they've insisted on giving me samples of everything before I pick something to order. Everything is fresh and homemade that day, and there's always something new and interesting to try! They have lunch-type food , including Turkish food, and also desserts (mostly baked goods, but also ice cream). They do really good coffee and even bubble tea! My absolute favorite thing they sell, however, is the berry cheesecake. I'm not even a cheesecake person, but this is one of the most delicious things I've ever put in my mouth. You do not understand cheesecake if you have not tried this thing. I bring all my friends here and make them try it, because I care about them and I want them to lead a happy and fulfilled life. If you care about your friends, you will bring them here too. If you don't, you probably don't care about your friends. And that's kind of sad. I also love the cafe's decor. It's cool, sort of wacky, and very in keeping with the South Street aesthetic!
