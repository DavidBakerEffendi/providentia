Yes been here,,,good stock with chili oil mix and pork stock but noodles all wrong as tasted of granular texture more liken to buckwheat.  Best thing was the pork buns with a swear of spicy aioli and lettuce.  Drinks and service friendly and this place is mobbed...always a wait for tables but a wonder not a single Japanese/Asian person in the kitchen!
