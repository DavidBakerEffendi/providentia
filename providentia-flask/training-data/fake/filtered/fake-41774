Ok so I never right reviews and this is my first one doing this . My friend and I came into town from pittsburgh and we were staying at a hotel near this bar. We decided to walk there and give it a try we were starving. Walked in , it's dimmer lighting with candles for a relaxed atmosphere , they have about 7 beers on tap an yes they have Guinness and Stella's the real deal . All kinda of liquor top shelf and bottom . We were greeted by Erica the bartender and we grabbed a seat at the bar . I ordered the mozzrella knots and my friend did the French onion to start , the food was absoulutley amazing . The fried mozzarella was fresh mozz from deli and hand breaded .. Mmmm ! With a tomatoe pesto sauce on the side was fantastic ! For dinner my friend for the chicken sand which and I got the burger and fries all around amazing place ! A diamond in the rough is to say the least ! I know when I come back into town with friends or family I will gladly take them to rhis place knowing it's great . And Erica the bartender , she was working Saturday night is awesome !!
