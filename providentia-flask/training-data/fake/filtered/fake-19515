I am from Albany NY and this is definitely my favorite place to visit when in Philadelphia.  I have never been disappointed in the cordiality of the bartenders and isn't that what a pub is all about??  The food is good too!!  I also love to watch the diversity of the patrons... many who are younger than me but have such a good time at this establishment.
