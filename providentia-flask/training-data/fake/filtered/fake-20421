I can't even begin describe the absurdity that is this restaurant.  I came in for brunch with friends and was greeted with a satan worshipper guised as a waitress.  The menu was expensive, but I had heard good things about the restaurant so I figured it was high quality (or at least quantity?). Boy was I wrong! Two of us ordered a soft boiled egg with "challah soldiers" as it was the least expensive (but still expensive) thing on the menu, and our other friend ordered a belgian waffle.  We waited and waited. Finally their dishes came.  The waffle tasted like soap, and the soft boiled egg was not at all soft boiled. It was a hardboiled egg. The challah "soldiers" that came with the egg were the most stingy little slices of toast I have ever seen...they weren't even full pieces of bread. They were little crustless rectangles cut out of a piece of bread.  My friend was so hungry from the amount of time we'd been waiting that she just ate it despite her displeasure.  I, on the other hand, was not going to let this slide.  Once my "soft" boiled egg came, I switched it for a poached egg.  That was pricier but good, until I found a hair interwoven in my dish.  When my friends told our no-smiling-allowed waitress that there was a hair in my food, she looked at them, unconvinced, and said in monotone "where?" They had to hold it right up to this woman's face and pull it out so she could see the full length and nastiness of the article.  Only after this was I not charged for my meal. Not paying was absolutely the highlight.
