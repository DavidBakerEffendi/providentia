We visited Philadelphia recently for the flower show.  Since this was our first visit to PHL we were at a loss regarding dining locations when we happened on Spasso. To say that we were pleasantly surprised would be an understatement!!  We were absolutely delighted with the atmosphere, the service and, most importantly, the overall quality of the meal. Our server was professional and friendly and was of obvious Italian descent. She was timely and attentive without being overbearing and quite helpful in explaining the selections. The fried calamari was "to die for"....very tender and tasty and accompanied by an outstanding marinara sauce. My wife's linguini with white clam sauce was excellent as well. The pasta was "al dente" and was accompanied by a generous portion of baby clams in a delicate sauce.  My entree, veal saltinbaca, was extraordinary.  The veal was tender and expertly prepared with fresh spinach and mozzarella in a very flavorful sauce. It was accompanied by a generous portion of sauteed vegetables. My only regret is that the portions were so generous we had no room for dessert!!!  This was the best Italian experience we have had and will definitely return on our next visit to Philadelphia.
