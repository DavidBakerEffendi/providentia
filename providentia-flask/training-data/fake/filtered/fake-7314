There were a couple reviews mentioning the really bad service and the expensive price for the less-than-competent staff and not-so-great food. There is no reason to expect as much as some of these people have expected from Petite Crevette. This is obviously not a restaurant like with Le Bernardin or Le Cirque. What you CAN expect is heartwarming charm, great seafood for an absolutely unbeatable price. There is no room for snotty, over-the-top, irrational personalities in Brooklyn. I regularly come to eat at Petite Crevette and have done so for at least 10 times now and i can attest that it is a humble and romantic place to have dinner. You can even stop by for a quick lunch. Some of the highlights for dinner (or even lunch for that matter) i can highly recommend are the perfectly seared sea Scallops with their amicably creamy and mustardy Dijonaise sauce, the classic Cioppino (similar to the Bouillabaisse) with its succulent lobster and seafood tomato broth, and the grilled Branzino (although the other whole fish are amazing, depending on your preference). The appetizers i absolutely love (and hear others recommend) are the amazing fried oysters with wasabi mayo and dijonaise mustard, the amazingly rich-tasting, deep red Heirloom tomato and fresh mozzarella over mixed green salad, and the seafood chowder with chunks of cod fish and just the right amount of carrots and zucchini. Like I said. This is not a 5 star restaurant so please don't go to Petite Crevette thinking you will be absolutely flabbergasted by the service. The staff is very friendly and you will not be disappointed. It is a humble place and you will feel at home. The food is absolute greatness! Chef Neil Ganic really knows his seafood, and his souschefs seem well trained to transcend his abilities and give you exactly what the last diner has received: absolute bliss! PROS: Homey atmosphere, great for couples, Amazing food, inexpensive CONS: not extremely easy to find, CASH ONLY
