Never coming back here again. I drove an hour and was super excited to enjoy the pizza. I brought 3 of my friends with me. We ordered 4 pies and 3 sodas. They don't TELL you that they charge for refills, so we got ripped off on that. We ordered diet coke, and if you noticed the taste is off, it's because its RC COLA, the cheap stuff. When it came time to pay the bill, we asked to split it, the waitress said the computer can't do it and we need to figure it out. So i took out a calculator and we each paid and included a tip, the waitress came back with a nasty attitude and said were short on 50 cents due to taxes. It was odd, because i double checked everything. She stood there condescending staring and waiting for me to pay the difference, I put down another 5 dollars. She made a big deal for my friend to pay with credit card because she didn't reach the 15 dollar limit, and said she will add another 5 to her bill, and I'm thinking okay add 5 to her bill and we will give her back 5 cash, and the waitress said NO MY TIP. She comes back with the credit card, and said your total was 76 dollars. The waitress said we were short to ADD on to her tip, she gave herself a tip of 10 dollars on top of a 65 dollar bill after charging us for RC COLA refills. Never coming back here again. Dining here was a dent on a good day.
