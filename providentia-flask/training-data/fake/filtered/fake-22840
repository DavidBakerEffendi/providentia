This is my first yelp review and I must say Cici's was AMAZING! Their pizza is great and they have so many different types of options/varieties. If there is a specific type of pizza that you want and you don't see it, the staff will happily make it for you. Can't really go wrong for endless salad, bread sticks, pizza, pasta, and dessert for about $6. Would definitely go back there with my family.
