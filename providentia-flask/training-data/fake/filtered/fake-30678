Great sandwiches, fun salads, nice staff.  It's about all I can say about this awesome little sandwich shop.  Several months ago, my boss bought the office lunch and I was to pick where to get it.  I chose this place and the entire office are now chronic patrons.  Couldn't ask for a better quick lunch spot for the area :-)
