Go for the atomsphere, go for the wine, go for the lounge area with fireplaces and go for the crab cakes. Really nice atomsphere and very friendly. There does seem to be a lot of corporate functions going on there so it maybe tough to get seated and even order a drink, but the bartenders do their best, so no complaints
