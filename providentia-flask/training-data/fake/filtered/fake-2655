Went here with my husband for Valentine's Day Dinner and we both were very disappointed. The food wasn't good and the portions were very small. Needless to say it was a prixe fixed menu with weird food options. We asked the waiter about one of the courses because i don't eat cheese and he wasn't able to tell me what was in my dish. That was a red flag in itself. We left the place hungry.
