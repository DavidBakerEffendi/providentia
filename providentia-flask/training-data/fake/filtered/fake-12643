Instant classic, all-time Williamsburg favorite. Have gone over 10 times and it's hard to think of anything bad to say. Have tried most of the menu and the kitchen's pride shows in precise execution. Floor staff come off casual but genuinely engaged. Great for impromptu dinner or family-and-close-friends "event" meals. Just be ready for a (well-earned) wait. Feels reductive to say the prices are great for the quality, but it's worth noting, especially compared to the Peter Lugers of the world. Must try dishes: giant ribeye by the oz., NY strip, grilled octopus (so tender--best I've ever had), bourbon-braised pork chop, haloumi salad, spinach gratin (also best anywhere--nothing like the Â soupy kind you've had elsewhere),
