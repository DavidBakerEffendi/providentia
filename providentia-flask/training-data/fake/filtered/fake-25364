After reading all the reviews, I decided to try it with my friend. The corn that almost everyone is raving about wasn't that great. It was cold and dry. The Roast Pork and grilled steak tacos were soso, I had better ones at  a Mexican restaurant in Brooklyn. The short woman that I believe is in charge wasn't that friendly either.  I would not go back to this restaurant because I have a much better to go to in Brooklyn and the price is much cheaper.
