I'd always heard great things about Salute, but had never been there until lastnight.  We went there to celebrate my fiance's 30th birthday as well as our recent engagement.  It was the first time her parents and mine have met.  We still are not quite sure how the host figured this out, but he knew exactly what was going on and gave us extra special attention all night- even going as far as to offer us complimentary dessert and coffee, which we declined since we had cake waiting at home.  He gave us two loaves of their AMAZING cheesy garlic bread to go instead.  We have no idea how he latched on to the importance of the occasion, because no one ever informed him, but we're grateful for all the special attention.  We will most certainly be going back to Salute next time we go to the Bushnell!
