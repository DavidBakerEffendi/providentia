Read here my story, my English is really bad but I try...I went to this Restaurant costanera last Sunday two of my best friend they invited me. We got there everything was fine I asked to my friend lets order one ceviche for all, we did we order it, when the Ceviche came In a bowl we share it.. When we almost done ate that Ceviche I saw something on my Plate was move so god when I saw that crazy thing move in my plate was a crazy animal a big warm!!! That was a crazy thing happen to me I can't believe something like that happen to me. On the table I tell to my friends please look what is on my plate he said god what is this he almost throat out. We call the manager he came and apologized with us, he said something like ours fish so fresh maybe that warm was in one of the fish. I almost die because over of the ceviche they put like a piece of sweet potatoes and my friend bring her a little baby of 10 month older and we was give to the baby that sweet potatoes, we all get up of that table like we can't walk we accept the apologize but happen is after that day I went thoatout and diarea for the last 4 days maybe is psychologic cause I thinking I ate one of these animal... Just disappointed that happen to me and I don't want it happen to anyone...
