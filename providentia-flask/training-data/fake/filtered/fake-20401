Tiny Thai - they promote that you can bring your own alcohol - but get all antsy in their pantsy when you bring more then one bottle of wine. Service - Eye-Stabbing rude. Waitress - thought she was on Mars. Food - Good - but I would rather shoot myself in the foot before dealing with the people again. Never asked if the food was ok - brought the check over without asking if we wanted dessert - (we did). Go if you want good food and if you want to lose faith in humanity after you eat there.
