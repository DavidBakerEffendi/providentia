My boyfriend and I were there last night for the first time and  were impressed with the food and excellent service . I tried the sampler (can't remember the name) and he had the chicken burrito which was served over a green somewhat sweet sauce , along with rice and refried beans.   We also had the Mexican Flan which was delicious. Will difinitely be going back !
