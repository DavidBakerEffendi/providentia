We visited this French restaurant last night on the recommendations of some friends, and the food topped even their praise. All of our choices, appetizers, main courses, and desserts, were superlative. Plus, the wait staff couldn't have been nicer. Too bad it's not located in the heart of the Bloomfield Ave. strip in Montclair. It would clean up.
