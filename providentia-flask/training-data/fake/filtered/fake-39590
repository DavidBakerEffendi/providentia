SriPraPhai is in the middle of a mini Thai neighborhood in Elmhurst, and is definitely the best Thai restaurant in NY. Their crispy watercress salad is the best! The tom yum shrimp soup is so fresh and with just enough tang. Love their crispy pork belly. The saut√©ed Chicken is so good too. They only take CASH though. Their desserts are awesome
