Hoagie Haven is the best thing about the city of Princeton.  Yes, even better than the all of the discoveries and humanitarian achievements of Princeton alumni.  For where else can one pick anything on the menu, find it delicious,  plentiful and at a price more consistent with an earlier era? Enjoy
