I had a bad experience at Casa Mona. I went there with a friend, no reservation and as the restaurant was almost empty, we sat. It took at least 20 minutes for the waiter to give us some attention. We then order - one dish for each of us- and the waiter asked to wait a minute. Then comes the manager saying that  one must order two dishes at least! Can you believe it? I explained calmly that I don;t each much- nor does my friend - and on dish was enough. He insist we could not do that. saying is their policy. I argued that it is not written anywhere that they have such policy and that they made us waste a lot of time and they should accept our order. Then another guy came and said they were going to  accept the order. We didn't stay as I was afraid they would spit on my food. I think they can have whatever policy they think is appropriate but they have to display that so you can make your decision. I've been in restaurant that say"no salad as dinner", so I don't go there as my dinner is normally a salad.
