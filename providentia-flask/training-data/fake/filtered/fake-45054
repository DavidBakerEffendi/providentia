I would travel thousands of miles for their EGGS BENEDICT ! And actually I do. My home is in south Texas & my son lives in Long Island City. No visit to NY is complete without a trip to Henri's. The coffee is delightful. I am especially fond of the cozy atmosphere. It's small enough to make you feel 'special' just being there.
