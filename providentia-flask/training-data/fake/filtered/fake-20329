I wish there might be a negative star option to rate them; I bought sweets in their store once and the quality/taste just SUCKS. one of my friend wanted to surprise me and ordered some snacks/sweets online- I should have returned by looking their "SUKHADIA'S" name, when I received the package............ but I decided to try second time - But, their "MADE FRESH SNACKS" - not even palatable - I tossed all those four boxes into Trash in the next minute.
