I prefer Sally's and modern. To me this is number 3. It is still very good but the reason i write this review is that the franchise are not as good. Do not go say to Mohegan Sun and expect it to be as good as New Haven because it is not. It is not consistent as I have had good pizza there one time and not so good the next time. They could not get away with that in new haven as we know our pizza but i guess they can get away with it in Eastern Ct.
