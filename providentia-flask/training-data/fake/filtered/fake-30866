Went in with my son for dinner.  Have been there several times.  My son ordered the half smoked chicken which we have both had several times.  After two bites he stated it was not as good as usual.  When he opened it up the whole inside was blood red.  Took it to the counter to be told that's how smoked chicken is supposed to be.  This was not pink, it was blood red.  Meal went into trash, will not be going back
