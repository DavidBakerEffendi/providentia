This place is super awesomely yummy. Just opened recently but Damn do they got some good food. I had their kung pao tofu and wow what a combination of flavors. Also, their EGGPLANT. Get it, try it, love it. They serve free tea and complimentary peanuts, amazing! Â  I'm definitely going back, and highly suggest it to all. Peace
