For a restaurant that brags on receiving: " American Academy of Hospitality Services 5 Stars - Diamond Award (1998, 1999) Home News Tribune 4 Stars (7/98) Princeton Living Magazine 4 Stars (5/98) Star Ledger 31/2 Stars (10/99) New Jersey Monthly Reader's Choice Awards (9/99) " (Directly from Website) This restaurant desperately needs to button themselves up in the service department. I recently went to Tre Piani with a family member who was visiting from The city; and received service that one would be outraged at receiving at a chain restaurant..! (Whew, deep breath/ I have been waiting a number of weeks so I would not write rashly...) Pros: -aesthetically beautiful -Accessible Cons: -(6) different occasions we asked for simple requests (i.e.: silverware, water, butter) and were forced to repeatedly remind the waitstaff who was seldom to be seen. -Waiter who was possibly hard of hearing misordered, an entree for an appetizer salad and when we asked him what it was he turned and walked away. Â Upon asking the Maitre De, he was rude and denied any mistake, even though he and the waiter would not risk taking a guess at what had originally been ordered. -Wait staff had very little grasp of either the English or Italian language. (which may have resorted in the misorder -Nothing was done in way of apology or reparations for the neglectful and erroneous service. * we did sit outside, and it is possible that the inferior waiters handle this section but this still is no excuse I believe this restaurant should reassess the level of there hospitality and think about why they have not received any "Accolades" in the past 8 years. Worst experience I have ever received at a restaurant in this price range. Needless to say I will never return to this establishment.
