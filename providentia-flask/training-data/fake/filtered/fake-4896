The waitress said it was a tapas style..... I went with my sister on a recent trip out east, we strolled in on a bustling friday night (by recommendation of a "local"), got seated right away. Service was quick the Drinks were delish and the food was sooo yummy, big portions considering we were expecting small plates. The Lobster mash potatoes was a enough for a meal alone. Ate everything, the food is so yummy! The ambience was great, love the design and layout... I will definitely be back.
