I've been in the Ironbound section of Newark for 10+ years and this is by far the BEST Mexican food that I've ever had there.  Spending a lot of time out in Southern California (with many trips to Tijuana/Rosarito, MX) when I was younger, I have become a very tough critic when it comes to Mexican food...But this place was GREAT! I had a Mango Milkshake and the Pollo a la Mexicana con Guacamole!  The tortilla chips and 3 different hot sauces/salsas were also delicious! A++++  (I will be back!)
