The food is always very good at the Half Door.  A real neighborhood place to come for a drink or dining.  All types of patrons, nice and eclectic.  You have outside dining or inside dining.  Good food and nice portions.  Service is pretty good too along with reasonable prices.  Parking can be a problem but not to the point where you might not come.  Smokers sit outside and you can get wafts of smoke on occasion into the dining room.
