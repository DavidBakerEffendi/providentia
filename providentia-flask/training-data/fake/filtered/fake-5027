I've been going to this restaurant almost every week because I loved the service there. The hostesses are just amazing and friendly and so does the servers. Yes you might have to wait for a bit to get in(maybe because it was weekend?) but that's just because this place is real awesome. As I entered BCD Tofu House, the hostess asked me to wait a bit but I could totally wait due to her beautiful friendly smile and also because the restaurant was very busy that even I can see that they were real busy. Then I went in to have my tofu stew and I just loved it. I tried almost all kind of tofu stew there and they were all delicious as heaven. I go there almost every saturday and I can tell you people all, that they are just wonderful for both the food and the service. Not only me but my friends who go there with me every weekend, they also have been telling me how the people there serve us right. I have no idea how lucky I am to find this restaurant.. TONES OF STARS FOR BCD TOFU HOUSE!!!!!!!!!!!!
