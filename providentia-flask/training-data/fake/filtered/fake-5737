The best thing about ordering from this pizzeria was the quick delivery. In my Â opinion the pizza was not great. The coleslaw was the nastiest cole slaw that I ever had. The wings were ok. The wings weren't better than dominos or Pizza Hut. The prices were disappointing given that the pizza was not the greatest. I wish I would've ordered Dominos which was near by. Other than the food I had a blast in Philly:)
