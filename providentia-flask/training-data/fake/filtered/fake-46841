I came here with a buddy in town for work on Wednesday, Dec 18. We're both huge fans of all types of Indian food. I'd heard from friends in the neighborhood of this fantastic new Indian restaurant that had just opened around the corner. We were not disappointed: from the inviting ambiance and very cool retro "Anglo-Indian" design to a fabulous menu and wonderful service. My only quibble is that it's not possible to find the menu online so that I might be more specific about what we ordered beyond the divine monkfish curry I devoured at the bar. Speaking of the bar, not getting a seat in this seemingly always busy restaurant may actually be a godsend if you end up with Brennan as the bartender (not to speak badly of any other bartenders as I've only been there once and met one - perhaps they're all fabulous). Â  Brennan is one of the very few bartenders I've run into who knows the menu and the fabulous libation options well enough to make inspired suggestions on what to order to eat as well as what might be the best drink to accompany it (or precede it, or follow it, for that matter). I very much look forward to returning to Drunken Munkey soon ... or rather, often, as it is in the neighborhood and there are so many things left on the menu that I look forward to trying. Judging from reviews that Drunken Munkey has received in the local media, I'm not the only one who has become enamored of this neighborhood jewel. I'm guessing that the next time I go, I'll have to call ahead to make sure there's a table. No worries. If you can't get a table, having a drink and dinner at the bar is definitely worth the visit as well.
