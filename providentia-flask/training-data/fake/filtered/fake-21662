I want to like this place. But I don't.  Before I even get to the food, the restaurant is just so cold, no character. Even when the waiter is nice and this time he was, it is cold and boring.  Last time I had dinner there the waitress was so cold and had this manner like she knew better then us and we were in her place and not in the welcoming way.  All of them were similar except the hostess when we inquired about the menu before dining there.  It just seems to have this much too sterile feel, waitstaff included. The food is ok.  Lucky for them the burger is pretty good and the two times we have ordered this is was cooked to temperature.  I cant say much about the other items.  The lentils and sausage are only good enough to attempt to eat, and the macaroni and cheese is a far cry from tasty and the pasta was over cooked and bland.  The cheese mix was ok but all in all the balance of this dish as well as the sausage dish was off.  Overall, no balance, tasteless and boring food. Of the items we have tried, i would only order the burger again but nothing else.
