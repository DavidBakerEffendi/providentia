I loved the d√©cor. It was very modern, artsy and cool inside. We went for brunch. Sadly, service was slow. I saw tons of employees, just they always seemed too busy to help our table. When we did finally get orders in and food received, the food was disappointing. Too expensive for portions we got, and it wasn't that tasty. Thumb down.
