When I first moved to the area I tried many different restaurants but was continually dissatisfied for a number of reasons.  Even the most well reviewed restaurants in the area seemed to suffer from inconsistent food, occasional poor service, and  less than ideal atmosphere  But I find myself coming back to Lucas time and time again.  They are the only restaurant I have found to consistently put 100% into every order, table, or customer. They have a well crafted and diverse menu consisting of delicious italian dishes with home-made pasta, as well as items such as Kobe burgers, sweet potato fries, and home made focaccia sandwiches.   The atmosphere is warm, tasteful, and inviting, unlike many other italian restaurants in this state.  The portions are more than adequate, and for what you pay the food is an extremely good value.  Having gotten to know the owner/head chef Andrea, it is easy to see he takes pride in every dish he makes whether it is the cocoa agnolotti stuffed with butternut squash, the New York strip, a grilled pizza, or a last minute cheesesteak before they close at 11:00.   It's details like this that keep me coming back.  Whether I am picking up casual take-out, or  looking for a high-end italian meal to celebrate with friends and family, I keep finding myself back at Luca's.
