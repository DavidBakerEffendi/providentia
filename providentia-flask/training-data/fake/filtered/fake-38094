This bar is way to busy to enjoy yourself. It has 3 floors but they're so packed and small. The people that work in there the night we went were really rude to our party. We sat on the second floor and the bartender gave us such an attitude. As soon as we sat down she came up and asked if we were "eating...or what?.." then when we ordered our drinks she acted like we were bothering her. Â  Me and my boyfriend didn't order any drinks because we were the drivers and she got annoyed and walked away shaking her head and said something about us to another guy working there. I almost walked out. Someone must have said something because she all of a sudden apologized and didn't charge us for two of our drinks. We won't ever be going back there again.
