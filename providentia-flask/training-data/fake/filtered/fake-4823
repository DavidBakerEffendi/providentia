While traveling, I decided to stop by this place because I was curious about a Peruvian restaurant that also has pizza on the menu. I was craving pizza and I have always enjoyed Peruvian food so I thought it could be a interesting experience. After reviewing the menu, I decided to have the Jalea instead of pizza. It was outstanding. My daughter had the Papa a la Huancaina and Sopa de Pollo. Everything reminded me of her Abuelita's cooking. Great food!
