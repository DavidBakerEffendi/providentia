Great ambiance and decor - but the very very loud. Pizza and calazone was very good (not the best I have ever had) but tasty.  Not a good place to bring kids under 6 years old.  The staff was very nice, we had great service, especially the hostess outside - she kept us up to date on where we were on the wait list to get a table. Bonus there was seating outside while we waited for our table (we waited for an hour and a half).  I was surprised it was BYOB.
