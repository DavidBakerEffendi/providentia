The bar side is great tvs everywhere, outsides a nice feature, food is amazing Specially after 3 drinks, this is the bar to be at in bayonne. Convenient, a nice pool table for a good time with your friends. Also the servers are on par, and if u go ask for chris. He"s an upcoming comedian. Â Also ask for kim she's hotttt. And of course your drink is never empty, what more would u want from a sports bar. I'd give them 10 stars.
