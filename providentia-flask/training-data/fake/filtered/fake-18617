Cool ambiance, modern, but cozy, at least in the back room where I was seated. Server was very nice, water was always filled. I had the cauliflower appetizer and shrimp salad. We started off with hummus, baba ghanouj, tabouli and stuffed grape leaves, then followed by the makanek, fried potato cubes, and finally the mixed grilled meats.
