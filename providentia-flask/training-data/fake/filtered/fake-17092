This is our third time at the Sea Fire Grill. In one word, AMAZING! From the fantastic Manager... Arron Kraja, to the fantastic wait staff including Donny and Madison; our dining experience was perfect! Our 2nd visit was my wife's birthday and it was exceptional... So much so that we came back the next evening. If you are looking for a perfect blend of both amazing food, drinks and atmosphere; the Sea Fire Grill is a must! As an added bonus, they have the best Oysters to be had from Philadelphia to Manhattan!
