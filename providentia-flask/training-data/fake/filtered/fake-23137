The food was good.  I thought the rice was very flavorful.  I would have liked the option of seafood only, but I'll take the chicken and beef too.  I've been to another Peruvian restaurant in the area, and the portions were smaller here.  So, I was a little let down, since the price was higher.  On one of the items, it described the dish with potatoes, but it was more like half a small potato.  The steak was a little bland.   The service, it was just terrible.  It took a long time to get seated, which was strange because the restaurant wasn't full.  Then when we were finally seated, it took forever for a waitress to come over.  She took our drink order, and even though we stated we were ready to order our meals she just walked away.   After we were done with the meal it took a long time to get our check and even longer for them to pick it up.  I almost felt like going to the counter to pay for it and be done.   The only great thing beside the "arroz chaufa" was the fact that they had live music going on.   The staff is definitely under-trained and they are a bit disorganized.  At one point the bathrooms were barricaded by chairs and tables that they kept moving to the back. If they were a bit more organized and had better service, this could be a great restaurant, but I don't think I'll be going back.
