My brother and I ate here before seeing a play.  He'd heard about Cielo from a friend.  Dinner was fantastic.  We each had one of the two homemade ravioli dishes.  Another diner's angel hair pasta with pomodoro looked really good too. The mushroom ravioli is vegan, and the menu includes gluten-free options, which I think is a nice touch--making it a good place to get classic Italian food with a group. I liked the ambiance.  The wood beams and beveled glass windows show they put care into the details. This place opened recently, and it's exactly what the city needs more of.  A cozy spot with great food and very reasonable.  We mentioned that we were seeing a play and the staff made sure our meals came out quickly enough for us to enjoy them without feeling rushed.
