They have a variety of different food styles to choose from.  They serve breakfast all day long.  I ordered 1 waffle that was supposed to be "crisp" according to the menu, but it was actually kinda airy, not crisp.  I also ordered the chicken marsala with pasta.  The chicken marsala was okay, but tasted more like fish than chicken,which made me question how old the meat was.  The chicken soup (the soup of the day) tasted like something out of a can.  The apple pie also looked like something they had bought at the local supermarket and cut into separate pieces.  A bit over priced for the quality of the food.
