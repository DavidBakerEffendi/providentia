I looove this place. The food, drinks and service are great (with the exception of one incident during brunch). I cannot tell you how many people I have referred it to...and they all love it. It gets very loud in the evening so it isn't great for romantic, quiet dining....but who needs romance when everything else is 100% purrrrfect.
