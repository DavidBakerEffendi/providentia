Ate here the other day with my husband.  I've heard about it sooo much and I can see why.  Large portions!  The Small pizza was huge.  Tasted great with that coal baked oven taste.  I just love the pizza in NYC.  I went to college in michigan and the stuff they call pizza is a sham.  Will try to check out the Hoboken version next time.
