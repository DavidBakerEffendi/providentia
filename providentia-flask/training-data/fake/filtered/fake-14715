About once a month we order a delivery of pizza from here so where it is means little.  Second best pizza in the area [after Sal at Telemark, a former Pizza King!]. The regular order is white with all veggies, extra eggplant plus fresh garlic.  It comes nicely stacked with fresh veggies, a normal persons garlic [not enough for me] and a nice thinish crust that tastes great.  Only regular complaint by me is that the outer 1.5ish inches of the pie have no garnish so I have to move some, but as a person who never eats the crust, it is A-OK and I eat it all.  Delivery is usually quite prompt and the guys pleasant, prices very fair.  Plain pie [not my thing] is good and my kids eat it hot and cold.
