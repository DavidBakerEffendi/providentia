Finaly, a place to kick back and enjoy one of the best meals you'll ever have. Great atmosphere, great service, great value, great food and great service. Maybe they should call it, "The Great Chestnut Cafe" From the second you walk in to the time you leave, which you will find hard to do after enjoying all of the above, this is what it means to be able to enjoy "The Dining Experience". By the way, wait till you try the coffee.
