Came here for a birthday party that my friends planned for me. Initially thought I was going to dinner with a friend. It's my typical go to sushi place, good quality sushi, great service and clean comforting atmosphere. Was surprised to find a group of my friends hiding upstairs in a special secret karaoke room (on I think the fourth floor), and had full restaurant service even up there. Had a blast with great food, drinks, company and karaoke! The waiter was super accommodating and helped make my birthday super fun. Wrote the review for people who need help finding a place for large groups where you can eat and drink. This is the place.
