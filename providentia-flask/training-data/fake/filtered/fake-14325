I haven't ordered from this place in a very long time (there are so many better pizza restaurants in town), and will NOT be back for a very long time. Ordered take-out dinners for approx. 12 people on a Sunday night. Picked up the food (the place was very quiet which concerned me) and, when I arrived back home, found 1/4 of the order missing. I purposely asked the women behind the counter if this was everyting since it looked a little light and her reply was YES. Well, 20 minutes later, they drove the rest of the order up.... When I called to complain, everyone pointed the finger on someone else demonstrating the incompetence of the staff and their ability to focus on 'customer service'. How difficult is it to put an order together....COMPLETELY??? If you cannot execute the basics, close the restaurant down!!! Food was plain at best. With so many better pizza places in town, I don't see this one surviving.
