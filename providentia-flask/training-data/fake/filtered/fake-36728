During a lunch break my co-worker and I enjoyed a nice, quick lunch out front of PYT. of course I had to try the Donut Cheesesteak Burger... AMAZING! I am very picky when it comes to food but being from philadelphia I had to try it and enjoyed every bite! Don't forget the delicious fries!! During our lunch we even got the chance to meet the general manager. She was friendly and just as excited as we were for our first visit. She even had our waiter, Bob, bring us each a milkshake on the house! I had the delicous, one-of-a-kind Bacon Peanut Butter Milkshake while my co-worker had the brilliantly decorated Birthday Cake Milkshake! The milkshakes were perfect in thickness, I didn't have to dig for all the goodies at the end either because it came with an extra wide straw! (that all may sound kinky but hey, PYT had my taste buds in a million different directions :) ) CAN'T WAIT TO COME BACK! Thanks for the great dining experience during such a short lunch break!!! OUT DID YOURSELVES!
