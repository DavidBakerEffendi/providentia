Putting my money where my mouth is, I have been here 3x in the 3 weeks since The Writing Room opened. This place is squeaky clean, and pays attention to details.  The kitchen is open so you can actually see how clean everything is.   For me, that's a priority.   I brought my  family here last weekend, reserved a large table and everyone loved it.  I can recommend it for the attentive and friendly service at every interaction from the host stand to the waitstaff.   Feels homey, and I love the Study/Library room that has a fireplace!     I liked what I ordered the first time so much I have kept ordering it:   the winter roasted vegetable salad, the cod, and for dessert - apple pie in its own little iron-clad skillet.     I have seen several families eating there, kids, parents and grandparents.  Seems to be popular for Girls Nights Out groups.   Cozy bar with leather high top booths are perfect for 2 people to have dinner, and watch a game.
