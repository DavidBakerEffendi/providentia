Reliable sushi place. Fish is OK, decent size portions. Used it several times both as take out and sit-down choice. $10 web coupon is useful. Very good value for the money. But - nothing special. Just not bad. Service is consistently good, they are trying to please, language problem when ordering is usually surmountable (their Chinese is much better than their English ;) Not worth special drive, but if you are in the nabe, pay a visit. It is BYO - there is a good wine store two doors down in the same strip mall.
