Happened upon Woodrow's after an event in Tribeca. Even though it took us a while to get seated (bar was packed) we finally got a seat in the back dining room. My friend alerted me to the free check in goodies and I finally made my account ;)They were out of the free homemade chips because they were so busy but our waitress was great and surprised us with free sweet potato chips and chips and salsa..yummmm. But they made us thirsy for more beer!! I didnt love the Shipyard Blueberry but the pint
