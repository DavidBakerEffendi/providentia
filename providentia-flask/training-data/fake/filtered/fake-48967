This small Moroccan restaurant is a jewel in Bay Ridge.  My work takes me abroad frequently, so restaurants are my main source of meals.  Let me say that I have not yet had an experience like the one at Casablanca.  The owner/chef, Nasser and his assistant, Sue greet everyone like friends from the moment one pushes open the door.  Nasser frequently has some sample or the other for his guests to try. (Try the lentil soup.)  I think it is pronounced Hadad. (not sure of the spelling).  The bread is fresh and delicious.  Conversation flows among guests.  It is truly a unique place where guests become friends with other guests quite easily.  And the food is scrumptious.  The best way i can say it is: meals at most restaurants are a transaction.  At Casablanca in Bay Ridge, meals are a connection.
