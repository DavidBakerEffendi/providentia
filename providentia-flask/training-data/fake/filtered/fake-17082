We were looking for an upscale establishment and Gramercy came highly recommended ... and this place did not disappoint. There were 3 of us ordering different dishes. I ordered the lamb it was over seasoned a bit on the salty side. I write this because this is one of the things that still sticks out in my experience. But I still give this place a 5 because the service was absolutely exceptional and they offered to replace the dish ..but I ate it so did not feel they should have. They brought us free desert to make up for the lamb. Hit this place up!
