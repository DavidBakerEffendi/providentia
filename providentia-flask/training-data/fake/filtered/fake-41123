Definitely won't go back. Waited more than 3 hours in a freezing weather. Fine. Dirty plates and forks. Fine. Taste? Fine but not special. Also got different amount of pork slices even we ordered the same thing. I had 5 and he had 2. Not Fine. Service? Not fine but okay I know you are busy. Tipped them 12% and the owner ran out saying, 'USUALLY NEW YORKERS TIP 15%'. Wow! so humiliated in front of so many people. F-U. Sorry for not being a real New Yorker yet.
