We wanted some drinks and a "quick" bite so we stopped in based on a friend's recommendation.  The decor had an old fashioned feel and the staff was super friendly.  We sat at the bar and both ordered the basic burger. The burger by itself was delicious, but the dipping sauce on the side bumped it up to OUTSTANDING.  I asked for seconds of the "sauce" and dunked my fries in it as well.  If it wasn't taboo I would have just spooned it directly into my mouth, that's how good it was!  I liked the vibe of the place and the food was so good that we'll definitely be back again to try an actual sit-down dinner... and I'm definitely looking forward to it!
