INSANE gift for your girl on Valentine's Day.   Don't even think about buying a heart-shaped box of chocolate. I've heard the line can be 1.5 hrs + on 2/14, so go there after work on 2/13 (~30 min wait) and refrigerate over night. I spent about $46 on a box of 16.  The packaging and presentation is superb, and the taste is unmatched.  These macarons were so good they quite literally made her cry.  Needless to say, Ladurée UES will be a Valentine's tradition every year from now. Try every flavor.  You won't regret it.
