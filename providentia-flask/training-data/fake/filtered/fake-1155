my husband and i decided to give this place a shot over the weekend and we didnt go wrong we tried to octopus salad which definetly met my expectation it tasted as fresh as it gets as a main course we shared the lamp chops medium rare and have to say where out of this world.. they also have a great variety of beer and not to pricy also for 2 people out check came under $55 we'll be coming back soon to this place and try out the rest of the menu
