The food was outstanding! The prices were a third of what you would pay in New York. I had a lump crab meat and avocado salad that was unbelievably delicious, and with so much crab meat, I couldn't believe the reasonable price. The pizzas are wonderful and the waitstaff are always very attentive and sweet. The room is a bit noisy, but for the food and service - we don't mind. We will definitely be back.
