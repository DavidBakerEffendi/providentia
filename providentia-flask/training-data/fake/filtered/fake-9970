I have been dining at Sabrina Cafe for about 3 years.  The food is wonderful, However, each time I go a get more annoyed at the Hostess service.  I have no problem waiting an hour and some time an hour and a half.  But I have eaten there for the last time.  Just a suggestion your staff needs to be a little more customer friendly.
