This place is completely overrated. I was there Saturday with my husband. We started with the fried pickles (a favorite of ours), & they were the dilliest-make-your-mouth-pucker-hamburger-slices type of pickles. (disappointed). I had their chicken & waffles. (my 1st time for chicken & waffles). The chicken was completely BLAND. I don't even think there was salt on it. Yes it was crispy, but it was SO over cooked it was dry. If not for the syrup from the waffles, it would have been inedible. (The waffles were tasty however). My husband had the pulled pork sandwich. Once again, nothing to rave over: just pulled pork that didn't seem to once again, have ANY seasoning whatsoever on it. I didn't try his coleslaw, but he said that was dry too! I also had a Hibiscus tea (love this stuff, order it frequently in my favorite Mexican restaurant). It was SO sour, it was if I'd been sucking directly on the lime garnish on the glass. I added & added sugar to it, but it just never tasted good. The chairs are hard wood ancient folding chairs (which I was afraid to MOVE on once I sat on it, for fear of it not holding my weight). I also saw people come in, tell the girl the size of their party, & be told to wait outside 15 mins. or so. Less than a minute or 2 later, there was a table cleared & it sat there empty 10-15 minutes while several parties of waiting customers waited outside to be seated. (It was about 40ยบ, which isn't THAT bad, but I can't imagine if it were around 20ยบ, standing outside waiting like that). The only good thing I have to say about this place is the doughnuts. We took one home, & when we shared it later, it was DELICIOUS! It was filled (I don't remember the flavor it was), but it was very tasty & HEAVY. (2 people can share 1 doughnut!) Maybe if you stick to the pies & desserts here you'll be o.k., but the cooks need at a minimum a salt shaker!!
