Read all you want, but the key is just to go.  Stop reading and start eating.  This is nirvana.  Pommes Frites is fantastic in every way, including the cool East Village neighborhood, the quaint old atmosphere, the mesmerizing smallness of the space, but above all, the tasty fries and amazing sauces.  I had the Horseradish Mayo which satisfied in every culinary way.  There's a reason there's a line extending out and down the sidewalk. It's better than going to Belgium (and yes I've been, so I know).   Go to Pommes Frites !!!
