I went to Cafe Steinhof this past New Years Eve, and though the atmosphere was fun, the goulash had clearly been microwaved:  it was too dry in one portion, and then ice cold in another.  Inedible, basically.  It almost managed to ruin our New Years Eve, but thankfully we went home and cooked our own meal, and salvaged the night.
