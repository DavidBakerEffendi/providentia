Vic has become my new favorite sushi place. It's cheap (two rolls for about 7$, three for 10$). It's good (the avocado roll makes me stop and say 'mmmm,' and I've heard similar noises about the fishy ones too). Plus, they're super friendly (we're always treated really well). It's a very small place, with only five seats at the sushi bar- this does, however, give you a great view of the sushi being made, which is a plus- something about how that chef rolls up the maki is just beautiful! You can dine in, but it's easy to just enjoy the show and go elsewhere, too. Just remember to tip before you go- they deserve it! And- AND- they're open until 10pm, and deliver, too! So much love.
