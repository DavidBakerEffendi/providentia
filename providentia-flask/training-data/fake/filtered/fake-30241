BEST BURGER in CT hands down. Wipes the floor with Plan B, Max Burger, Five Guys, etc. The only other places that are as good are Catsup & Mustard and Grant's (pricey). The Southern Hospitality w/bacon is to die for, the fried mac/cheese bars are essentially an orgasm, the fries are PERFECT, and their current special, The Ed Heath, should be a regular on the menu. F'ING PHENOMENAL. Will be back ASAFP. Â Oh, how could I forget to mention the "Goo-Balls." Wow. White chocolate-lemon-cocount. And I normally hate coconut. I'll be back every 7-8 days to see what the next flavor is. May I suggest some sort of Goo-Ball-S'more, or in the fall, something with pumpkin.
