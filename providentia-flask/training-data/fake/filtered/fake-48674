Great food at cheap prices, good presentation, good service.  Overall a good experience.  It's a relatively small (but good looking) place so if you are going in a big group make sure to allot some waiting time.  By the way, the place is open 24 hours. About the food - I went with three friends and we ordered a variety of empanadas and they were all delicious.   Definitely a place to go!!!
