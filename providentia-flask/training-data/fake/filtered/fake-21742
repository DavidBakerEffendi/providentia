I recently visited Gigi's cupcakes in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. The attitude and rude behaviour of the sales clerks ( one was the daughter of the owner) was very disturbing. I asked to speak to the owner and was kept waiting for a long time. Finally the owner answered me but was unresponsive and neither helpful nor understanding. The cupcakes were 'all icing', with very little cake. It was way too rich and creamy! I vowed  never to venture to THIS  place again, especially when on vacation and  looking for a fun and peaceful time!
