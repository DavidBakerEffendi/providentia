I have been going here for lunch for several years, and in the past, everything was great.   However, in the last week or two it seems like quality has really gone down hill!  Last week, there was almost nothing on my sandwich.  This week, my panini wasn't even warm and the bread was all soggy.  $7-$8 is way too much to spend on a sandwich you end up throwing away.  Don't think I will be back for a while.
