Last weekend for memorial day I went to Benito One and there was a rodent camping out underneath my table. This was sooooo unnerving and unsanitary that I could not even eat my meal so to rate the food would be impossible however I can say I will never go there again as I was afraid I might get sick. If there are mice (or RATS) who wants to go there?
