The food is ok. But what can really make or break your evening is the service, which can vary from average (at best) to downright horrible (at worst). I have been to the place on more than one occasion and have experienced this first hand. The last time I was there, the waitress took a good 50 minutes to get my friend's order; while I sat and watched her eat waiting for mine to arrive. Ten minutes later (1 hour after the order was placed), when I finally asked her about my order (crepe), she apologized saying that she did not remember that I had placed an order!! And when I reminded her that I had ordered crepe, her very matter-of-fact reply was "Oh..we are out of crepes". So leave alone remembering what I had ordered, she did not even remember that I had ordered at all!! All this a good hour long wait. It very much spoilt our evening; I asked for the check and we left. The Naked Chocolate Cafe might not have as much to offer in terms of food, but scores over this place as far as ambiance (quieter), and service goes.
