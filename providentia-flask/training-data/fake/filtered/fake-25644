Everyone is always talking about going to Scarpetta's for italian food, and so I bit the bullet and went with a couple of friends last weekend.  I'm not a food snob or anything, but I do like to eat, and I really didn't find anything exceptional about the food here.  There's a bit of a scene to be had at the bar, and its also located in the Meat Packing, but relative to the difficulty it is to get a reservation here, i'm not really sure its worth it.  I felt that there are better options for this kind of food in the city, and i also felt if you're looking for a cool restaurant bar to hang out in, there are also better options.
