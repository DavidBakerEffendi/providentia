This was our first experience at Hat City Kitchen.  We had read a number of reviews, mostly positive but came with an open mind.  I am on crutches due to a fractured leg and required an extra chair for elevation.  The staff couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating.  So were the patrons for that matter.  I am very appreciative of all for their kindness and helpfulness. On to the food:  My husband had the cheeseburger.  It was a good size and stuffed well in a generous bun.  He liked it a lot but noted it was just a tad overdone.  He would order it again.  He just loved the Winter ale.  The bread pudding was excellent and we both greedily gobbled it up with gusto. I had the salmon with spices and brown sugar.  Although the New York Times reviewer indicated that it was overcooked and underspiced, my dish was really perfect.  I can't find anything to quibble about.  The broccoli rabe was also perfect.  I had a Godfather and enjoyed that as well. Service was excellent and attentive despite the fact that there were only 2 servers in the main dining area by the stage.  We didn't experience any excessive wait for drinks or our meal although I did read that a lot of other people have had that issue.  Perhaps they have sorted that out. We saw Dave Stryker the night we were there and very much enjoyed the show.  He has a nice relaxed style of playing and connects with the audience in just the right way.  The band members individually showed their stuff and they are a good ensemble.   All in all it was a very pleasant experience and we plan to return soon, hopefully without the crutches!
