I've been going to different Portuguese/Brazilian restaurants for about 20 years or so and I really have to say that as of lately, Brasilia has been the best. Some of the factors that make it great: Meat is not overcooked, it tends to be medium and even medium rare so its juicy. Its not overly greasy or grizzly. They give you a selection of sides from a hot/cold buffet whereas the other places give just collards, fries and rice that get cold before your meat comes. The sangria is fantastic. The service was perfect and they didn't "cut us off" like some places tend to do. The selection was exactly what we hoped. I can't wait to go back.
