Excellent. Wandered in here on the 2nd night it was open  -- to avoid  a long wait at nearby eatery. The two of us ate at the bar, which is nicely done in polished wood, as are most other parts of the restaurant. Food was delicious and very moderately priced. Specifically, the chicken kabobs were soft, moist and nicely charred, and reflected a good marinade. Came with very fresh salad and hot pita bread. Portions were quite large. The appetizer we had was calimari, sauteed  with vegetables and spices rather than deep fried, which is the usual; and these were very tasty. Staff was extraordinarily friendly. In sum, we ate here better than, and at  about sixty percent of the price of, a well-known and very popular eatery the night before.
