I dont understand the hype about this place, I really don't. We decided to try it, my wife and I but what a let down, both times, yes, take out and dine in. Their curries are just loaded with butter and cream, maybe that's for some but not for us. Also veggies were overcooked and they just ignored our mild request, I guess they just make everything extremely hot. Dine in experience wasnt so great, food with same results as the take out and the space is too small for confort. Over rated, over priced. We won't be back to all this non sense
