I am so pleased to see some of the positive reviews (and so disturbed to see the few negative ones; please try again). This authentic Mexican restaurant is a real find, lost in the restaurant abyss that is Bayonne (save a few Italian ones); as one reviewer says, a diamond in the rough. An extensive menu, generous servings, extremely pleasant (if not always fast) service. To call it, as some have, with no irony apparently intended, good for the area or great Mexican for New Jersey is really damni8ng it with faint praise. It deserves serious praise; if you like Mexican food and are anywhere in the vicinity, give it a try. You will come back again.
