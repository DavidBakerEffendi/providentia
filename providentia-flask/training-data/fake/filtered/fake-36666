PYT was one of my favorite places to grab a burger or a beer in the city, but a recent experience has prompted me to be extremely weary to ever return! I went there on my birthday with my girlfriend and her friend and our waiter was brash, lude, and downright creepy. He cursed because he thought it was cool to, he tried to force more alcohol on the women by pouring them more champagne despite their refusal. Even after they said they were driving, he tried to get them to drink more! That's not even the worst part ..my girlfriend paid with a credit card and the Â waiter FACEBOOKED MY GIRLFRIEND FROM HER CREDIT CARD NAME!!! He said he knew she was with me but decided he might have a shot anyway ...She was freaked out and I am not taking her back there again. The waiter was a skinny, average height white male with piercings, short brown hair and a stupid hat. He talked in poor english and seemed to think he was the coolest hipster in all of Philadelphia.
