this place is over priced and over staffed.. as i sat there trying to enjoy my over priced meal the manager kept yelling at his bartender to keep her jacket off although it was so cold in there he wore his jacket... Â the staff was nice but it's a shame they work there it's obvious that place is a dump... high end prices with laminated menus horrible...
