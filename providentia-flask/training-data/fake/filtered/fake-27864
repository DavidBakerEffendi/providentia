I get pizza here at least once a week here. The men that work here are so nice and accommodate me when they make mistakes. I originally ordered large pizza and wings and a calzone. When I checked out I noticed one item was wrong so the man offered to make a new one free of charge. I really didn't want to wait so I took what I had, but what's important is they apologized and offer to fix it instead of fighting with me. The pizza here is really good!!! and I'm very picky about my pizza!
