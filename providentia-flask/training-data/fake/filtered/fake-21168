Put me in a meat coma which I still haven't recovered from.  Food is delicious, though I think the lamb chops and picanha are the best.  Waitstaff was attentive and very nice without being too pushy.  Salad bar is legit (you could take a vegetarian here, no problem).  Drinks were delicious, definitely get the caipirinha.  Desserts are also very good but nothing earth shattering.  We dressed up a bit, but I don't think you really need to (I saw people in shorts/polos).  For 2 people with desserts and drinks, we ended up around $200 with tip, and it was well worth it.
