Wow - where do I start?   The waitress informing us of no free refills on the apple juice (duh) or that they have no sprite or 7 up.  How about the upcharge to have the mixed greens REMOVED from the crabcake entree' because it's the one entree with NO substitutions!!  All because we ordered a grilled romaine salad as an appetizer???  I'm confused.... How about two dining couples requesting separate checks - resulting in...NO separate checks.  However, the  waitress was kind enough to explain the inner workings of the kitchen - that one check order would be placed with the kitchen and two checks would be presented at the the end of our meal - you kdding me?  I don't care how your kitchen operates...and then the check comes out as one. HA!!! Dessert was offered with two diners absent from the table - in the ladies room. Every request was met with a reason why the request could not be met.  We absolutely had no idea what we would recieve after placing our order.  Also, we felt lectured to and patronized by the waitress.   Overall ambience - zero.  Service - maybe a 2 - because our food came out hot. For the prices charged I would at least like empty glasses removed from the table.  How about  tablecloths on tables?   If you want to be appreciated as a serious epicurean experience there is a lot of room for improvement. Next time, Yardley Inn - at least I know what to expect. It was the most surreal, absurd dining experience in quite some time.
