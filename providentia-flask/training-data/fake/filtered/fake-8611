This place was amazing. Â The best Thai I ever had. I love the atmosphere. The food was really really really good. We had four different appetizers, an entree and then dessert. I was dead full but could still eat more. I'm not a picky eater but I rarely leave a place thinking how good it was. So when I say that it's good, it's good.
