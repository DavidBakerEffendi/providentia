I took a very demanding foodie friend out to dinner here and even he was impressed... Truly charming and relaxed restaurant with fantastic food and service. The goat cheese salad was delicious, the steak frites were cooked to perfection and the tarragon roasted chicken was full of flavor. A faultless Ile Flottante gave the meal a great finish. Wtih good wine to hand to set off the food and welcoming and attentive service, we had a great evening. Â Excellent value, a truly enjoyable meal. If you want to be transported to the perfect French bistro without leaving New York, this is for you.
