I was visiting friends in Montclair, and one suggested Vital. I wasn't sure about the place at first because I wasn't sure about the concept. The menu looked interesting and being a Chef, I was interested. I usually don't order salmon unless I'm at a more expensive place because usually restaurants overcook it horribly. I had beet, ginger, and carrot juice and it was amazing!!! When the Salmon came it had cauliflower, okra and a tomato coulis. Right off the bat I noticed that the sear on the fish was perfect!! Also before In got it the waitress asked what temp i wanted it at!! No one every asks that and I always cook mine to medium. It came at a perfect medium. All in all, the meal was in my top 10 meals of all time and I eat a lot of great food! They also brought out vegan mac and cheese for us to critique and see if they should put it on the menu. It was amazing. Coconut sauce with Almonds...amazing! We said yes!! We all wiped our plates clean! Definitely going back next time I visit my friends!! Kudos!!
