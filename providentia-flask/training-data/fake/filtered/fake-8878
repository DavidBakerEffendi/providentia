My friend took me here yesterday. I can't believe that people are queuing up an waiting for hours to eat their dosa. I ordered for a chilli onion rava masala dosa (looked lengthy and nice in menu) after waiting for 40 min out number got called. I was having high expectation for the wait. Total turn down! Even by Saravanan bhavan standards! Pathetic service! Lassi tasted good though! A place known to be a dosa place should make good dosas - this place doesn't!
