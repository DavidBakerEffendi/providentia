I love this especially at night when they dim the lights down. This is a usual spot and I order the fried soft shell crab with pineapple, pumpkin and curry sauce with their delicious coconut or jasmine rice, almost every time I go. The lychee and coconut ice cream is a must try and also the lychee martini is so good. The severs are really nice.
