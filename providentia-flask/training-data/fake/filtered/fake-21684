Overall a great place in the neighborhood. Their Mac & cheese is the best. The half chicken is absolutely delicious! Sometimes I experience inconsistency in seasoning, especially with the burger/ chicken sandwich/ fish sandwich... I mean one day the burger is absolutely on the spot and the next day it's completely unseasoned. Almost as if sometimes the kitchen looses focus. If they cook their food consistently on their highest level, this place will succeed even more. Another issue for me is the staff. Usually great, a guy named Donny is very nice and professional, however I wish the staff would be a little more attentive to regular customers. The owner is a nice guy as well, polite, smiles at you and makes you feel comfortable.
