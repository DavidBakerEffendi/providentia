I frequent Due Amice on a regular basis, my wife and I enjoy the comfortable feeling we get inside this restaurant.  Make no mistake this is a small BYOB restaurant. nothing fancy but very comfortable.  On Wednesday and Thursday night you cannot beat the specials.  They usually have 2 special dishes which come with garlic bread and a small fresh garden salad.  If you pick one of the specials $10.95 which we almost always do, you will not be disappointed.  Last week I had penne pasta with eggplant and sausage, delicious and my wife had the manicotti which is absolutely outstanding. (Light and fresh)  I know my tomato sauce like the back of my hand.  I grew up in a house where we made entire years worth of our own sauce from fresh grown garden jersey plum tomatoes. I believe the sauce here is made fresh; otherwise very good Italian tomatoes are being used.  Since its Wednesday night, my wife, son and I are about to head down for a bite, it will cost me another $11.00 for the 18 year old, but $33.00 for 3 people to get a nice meal.  It doesn't pay to cook and stay home.  I will not elaborate further, there are a limited number of tables and I don't want the rest of you getting in my way!
