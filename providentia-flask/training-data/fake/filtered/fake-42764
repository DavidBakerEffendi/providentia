My husband and I went there for dinner last night (just us). I was prepared for the wait bc everyone says the food will take an hour or so. But since it was just us we got our Mussels in Red Sauce in 15 minutes and it was such a HUGE portion my sister (who's a chef) said that will cost us $50, but it was only $18! She came back 10 mins later surprised that we ate it all. She saw my husband scooping the red sauce with a mussel shell so she offered to put the sauce in a contaier for him. He ordered prime rib and i had the chicken and shrimp parm...they were both so much food that 1 dish can easily feed 4 ppl. I absolutely loved my dish! The bread that she gave us was also so good with the food and her very own Olive Oil. We were so stuffed and happy. We went in at 7 and was out by 8! I know people mentioned she's a bit bitchy but she was our waiter and cook last night and she was nice enough to us. It's her restaurant and she can basically do whatever she wants bc ppl will come back for the food...not her! Overall great food! go on a off day like Tues. night and there's no wait!
