My friend Jess and I stopped in to Le b for  brunch this weekend. Had to wait a little bit for our table ( as you usually do at busy brunch spots) but it, as always  was totally worth it. I ordered the pancakes which were huge and scrumptious and my friend had a fried oyster benedict. Yum!  Definately will be back again and again. I also want to comment on those 5-6 people and their hate fest of reviews. We were actually sitting a table away and heard and saw everything. They waited for their food  ( as we all did) but they were being total jerks to their server making smart comments. So the manager did come over and was very upset, they were being rude to his staff and insulting him. But I have to applaud him, they were rude and as a server myself I see people like them all the time and wish I had the guts to do it too.
