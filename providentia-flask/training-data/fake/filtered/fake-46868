NO LONG HOTS! Just Bananas. Based on the multitude of favorable reviews regarding their sandwhiches I decided to stop by for lunch today. Two guys behind the counter were very friendly and I sat down to try the much hyped "Arista" sandwhich. Tender, flavorful roasted, shredded pork served in its own natural au jus was ladled on a great seeded semolina roll with sharp provolone and broccoli rabe and according to every review or menu long hot peppers. Here's the problem. The peppers were pickled banana peppers you get on a WAWA hoagie at 2am when nothing else is open on your way back from a night out. I asked one of the guys behind the counter if the sandwhich had long hots on it. He said yes and I took a bite of an otherwise good sandwhich but the pickled banana peppers killed it. If they ran out , I can understand, but let me know so I can try another sandwhich. Try Shanks or Tony Lukes if you want real roasted long hots on your pork.
