This is a wonderful place to experience great food.  We had a sublime linguini with sea urchin & chili that was incredible; cuttle fish was great;  seared foie gras was exquisite; tripe was cooked to perfection.  The salads were fabulous and enjoyed the salumi.  The Axl Rosenburg pizza w/o jalapeno was delicious and the roasted chicken cooked in the pizza oven was very tasty.  To tell you the truth - everything I tried last night was just out of this world...  kudos for Chef Carlo and all the people who make Roberta's Pizzeria such a glorious place to eat!  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys food prepared with care, and fresh and organic ingredients.
