We went there for dinner a few weeks ago.  The service was excellent and the food was absolutely amazing.  I had never had Peruvian food before, but they explained and suggested food for us to order. Everything was got was absolutely amazing and tasted very fresh.  I am now a huge fan of Ceviche! The decor is super cute, awesome to go with a small group or a bunch of friends.  They'll even make Sangria for you if you bring your own wine!  I highly recommend it, especially if you're looking to try out something new!
