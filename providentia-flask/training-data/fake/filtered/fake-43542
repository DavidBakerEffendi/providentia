After reading up on some reviews, I've decided to give this place a try and very glad I did.  I was without a doubt quite impressed.   My favorite thing about this place is the concept.  The menu was very well organized in a minimalist but informative manner.  The experience, from choosing to ordering is completely American, which brings up the comfort level. Our slightly flamboyant and very awesome waiter was energetic and knowledgeable.  The food, is without a doubt Chinese.... More specifically Sichuan, the real kind. We ordered dumplings in chili sauce and I had the fish dry pot.  The sauce in the dumplings, oh my gosh, was so good that I wish I could buy it in gallons and put it on everything.  My fish dry pot was without a doubt the precise mouth-numbing spiciness I looked for.   Over all, the food may not be the best I've ever had, but it certainly is the best Chinese I've sampled in the Philly area.  The experience, however was a unique one that I thoroughly enjoyed.   Hell yeah I'll be back!  With an entourage, too.
