Just went here for the first time with friends who live in New Brunswick.  WOW..... everything was wonderful.  I don't know how they can sell an amazing rack of lamb for only $19, but it was yummy.  Cocktails were cheap and the staff was great.  Met the new GM who comes from NYC.  He was such a professional and made us feel welcomed.  He even gave us a tour of the outside dining area that looks like it would be great for summer.  Look forward to going back..... just an amazing value all the way around!! (I know a few people here said that it can be loud, and it can.  But quiet restaurants aren't in business very long!! LOL)
