Nice beer selection.  Decent food.  ABSOLUTE WORST dining room wait service.  Seriously, this guy (Francisco, I think) may have been the worst waiter I have ever had, and I eat out a lot.  Smug, arrogant, clumsy... and worst of all inattentive to the extreme to a large group of respectful diners.  It was uncanny how ill-suited this guy was to deal with the public.  I entertain a lot of well-paying folks in this town, and I will NEVER return to this place.  Too bad, really.
