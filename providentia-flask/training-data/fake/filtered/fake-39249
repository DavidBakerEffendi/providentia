The bartender (and I think manager?) Anthony was the best. He made incredible drinks on and off the menu and chatted with us for hours. The food was delicious (we had the rice balls, sliders, and spinach salad). I could have spent the whole day and night there and be happy. Great location and decor. Anthony even charged my phone behind the bar and when I left without it came running out after me. Loved it all! Will definitely return.
