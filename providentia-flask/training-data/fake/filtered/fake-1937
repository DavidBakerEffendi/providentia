My husband wanted to celebrate Father's Day on Saturday so we headed to Brooklyn Crab. After reading the reviews I had very low expectations. Keep in mind that restaurants need at least a couple of weeks before they figure out how to work out the kinks and we went on the first week. We waited an hour and a half to be seated. Feel free to have one or two cocktails at the bar because even if you are driving,  if you stop drinking just before you order it will be at least two hours before you have to drive.  Feed your kids before otherwise  your day will be very long. The kids, my husband and I had an awesome time. The food was really good. Fred, our waiter, was fantastic. Great fried oysters and the crabs were perfect. I know all these items are much more inexpensive in other places but this is Brooklyn and it was fabulous.  Great afternoon!
