I heard about this restaurant through a friend and went there last night.  Best middle eastern food I have ever had. The hummus they serve there is like no other hummus I have ever tasted "Two Thumbs up." I also loved there shawarma.  Just thinking about it I'm getting hungry. Additionally, the environment was so relaxing along with excellent service..... If your ever in New Haven and you need to grab something to eat you have got to try this place.  I will definitely go and eat at this place again...
