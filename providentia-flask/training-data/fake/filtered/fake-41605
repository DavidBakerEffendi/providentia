I've been to Barcelona for the last time.  The folks in my group who ordered tapas were happy enough.  But several of us ordered entrees, which only appeared an hour and a half after we ordered.  In fact, the entrees were served only after we requested that they be served3 times and we had finally cancelled our order.   It was an outrage! In the end we had no dinner. Clearly, this place is far more interested in it's bar business than it's restaurant.   Don't go there unless you are searching for a bar scene.
