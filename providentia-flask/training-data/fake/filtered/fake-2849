DELICIOUS food...AWFUL service. To me, half the experience of dining out is the service. Perhaps this is due to working in the restaurant industry for 10 years. The hostesses were nothing short of rude. When I had called the day prior to make reservations for a party of 5,  the young woman said, "well, we only take reservations for parties of 6 or more so you'll just have to come and and see if you can get a table." I disregarded this, understanding everyone has a bad day once in a while. Though, when we arrived we were continuoulsy bumped into by every staff member, with no appology. The hostess then seated us at a make-shift 5-top (4-top with a chair on the end), and the hostess failed to set the table before seating us, but would not let us actually sit down until she was finished setting out the plates and grabbing an extra chair. Our waiter paid very little attention to our table the entire evening, and never once appologized for the neglect. He also told us we were not allowed to place our appetizer/tapas order before our meals (unheard of). Our food took 40 minutes to come out, our waiter never once in that time came to check on us or inform us of the delay. When the food finally did arrive, we were short one setting of a fork and knife and when we asked the gentleman who brought out our food, he replied, "you have to ask your waiter"  (UNREAL). Dessert took 20 minutes. Also, nowhere on the website does it say BYO, so when I saw a Sangria and Mojito menu, I wrongly assumed it was with alcohol. Furthermore, they have a link to a review in the NY Times cubanpetesrestaurant.com… and it's not very favorable. I would never go back or reccommend this place to anyone. There are plenty of delicious cuban restaurants that know how to properly treat their guests.
