Worst restaurant in the city! The food was terrible, it had no flavor. The French fries were so over cooked they were impossible to eat and when we told the waitress she went and told the chef sitting at the bar and he dismissed it with a rood hand motion. The service was exceptionally bad. When we asked the waitress to clear our plates she answered: "don't you see what I'm doing, I'm picking it up now." In addition she was never there when we needed something. When you spend 140 dollars you expect more. A piece of advice do not spend ur time or money at Landmarc.
