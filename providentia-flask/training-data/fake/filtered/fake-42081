I have to say I keep going back to this place. Â prices are reasonable and the pizza is delicious. However, the service is really bad! They are rarely friendly, don't ever check back to see how the food is, don't refill waters, and then you end up waiting forever for your check. We go back for the food but every time are disappointed by the service.
