Having grown up going to the old Rudy, I am another convert to the new Rudy's. The food is delicious, the restaurant itself is brand spanking new, and they have an excellent beer selection. The fries are as good as before, actually better. The staff is as friendly as ever, even if they are dressed as yuppies from days gone by. No cover charge, great entertainment provided by live bands, and they brought over some memorabilia from the old spot to fill the back rooms. They did a great job relocating a historic New Haven institution.
