This is the place where I feel confident bringing my out-of-town friends - this place never fails to impress. The appetizers are all awesome; I especially love the seared tuna. Love the various tofu appetizers as well. Tried the classic and modern ramen, both are great. They used to have the black ramen I absolutely love, but it was taken off the menu.
