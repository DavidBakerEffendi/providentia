Peppinos is far superior to your typical neighborhood slice shop but it isn't a destination pizza place. The staff is friendly to a fault, which almost makes up for the errors in their food. 2 out of the last 3 times that I've ordered pies from them, they have put the wrong toppings on the pies. I'm not a picky guy but it is annoying when you are paying $20 + for a pizza. I'm not sure what the issue is but I hope they get it fixed. Delivery service is inconsistent in delivery time (15-45 minutes) but the food does arrive hot every time. In addition to their pies their salads and sandwiches are also delicious, especially the pepperoni hero.
