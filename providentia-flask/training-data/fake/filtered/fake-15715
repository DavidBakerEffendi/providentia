Food was disappointing.  I remember the Cranbury Inn having a great Cesar Salad in the early 1980's; the Salad in December 2012 was Romaine lettuce with a bit of vinegar and oil on the bottom.  Lamb entree was too fatty; crab cakes were very good.  Apple Torte dessert was horrible--it tasted like it had been sitting in refrigerator for a week (cold and wet).  I could not eat it.  The interior decor needs a face lift; it looks a bit shabby.  This was a really nice restaurant 25+ years ago.
