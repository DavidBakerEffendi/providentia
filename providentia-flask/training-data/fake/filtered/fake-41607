We have been coming here for a number of years now and have always had a good experience. We were just here last week and ordered tapas this time around rather than entrees.  We had the short ribs, meatballs, broccoli rabe, roasted cauliflower, lamp chops (to die for!), Shrimp with garlic, mahi mahi a la plancha, beef empandas, and ham and chicken croquettes.  The short ribs fell a bit short as they were kinda tough.  Everything else was very good.  The lamb chop were outstanding!  So succulent!  The mixed green salad with the goat cheese croquettes was awesome too.  Love this salad!  I get it every time I come.   Our two server were attentive and friendly.  All in all, we enjoyed our dinner and will be coming back.   I have also gone to the Fairfield location a number of times, but their food is not nearly as good as new Haven.
