My husband and I went to Brauhaus Schmitz with a group of friends and we really enjoyed ourselves! We shared the smoked meat app. and then I had the schnitzel with spatzle and my husband enjoyed the brats! I am not a drinker, but my husband loved sampling the many beer options and the bartender was very helpful in his selections! Would absolutely come back!
