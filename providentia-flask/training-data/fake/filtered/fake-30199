The only good thing I have to say and the only reason they get two stars and not one is the very nice girl that delivered my totally wrong order.  I reviewed the site, read the reviews and thought I would get a good pizza and enjoy my evening.  I was wrong.  It took almost an hour, when it came to my hotel, it was totally wrong.  When I called the girl that answered was like oh man I totally made the wrong pizza.  I asked for my correct order and for them to credit my bill for the I convince and she didn't even pause when she said oh no I can't do that...I had a bite of the wrong pizza after I hung up the phone and it is not even worth it.  Hopefully you don't make the same mistake as I did and order from Uncle Tony.
