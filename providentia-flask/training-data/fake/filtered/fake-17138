I had a terrible experience with attempting to order take-out here.  The order taker (a woman) was rude.  She apparently couldn't hear me; so, I called back.  She did not ask me what kind of dressing I wanted on my salad...and was not clear about the fact that they don't have honey mustard...yet...she still wouldn't tell me the dressing choice.  She kept saying I was #32.  I had no idea what she was talking about and gave up. She said she didn't have all day to talk on the phone.  I decided to go there in person.  The owner was standing next to her and took her side, saying she couldn't hear me.  I finally got it out of them that there was no honey mustard dressing and that they put house dressing on the side of take out orders.  The order taker kept glaring at me with one arm on her hip.  I heard her answer the phone and speak rudely to someone else.  But...the owner was now speaking to me.  I told him this was the last time I would go there.  He flung my coupon at me and said:  "Let the time before be the last time."  WOW.  I guess the don't need the business.  It's good that they have a lot of followers...because I will never go there again.  Café Antonio is much better anyway.
