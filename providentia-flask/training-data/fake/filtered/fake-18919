I don't know what all the fuss is about I mean the pizza does taste amazing so 4 stars for that. But does it taste 20 min on a long line amazing. Not really and it also does not make up for the poor service I have never seen a more unhappy group of pizza men. You would think if people were lining up and paying 5 bucks a slice your staff would be happy making some dough! right? oh well def worth a try for taste other then that most NYC pizza is of the chart as it is so have fun.
