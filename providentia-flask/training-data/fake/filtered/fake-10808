The majority of people I've seen comment are tourist and you got to be to think this place is good. My boyfriend and I decided to go to the Reading Terminal just for something to do. We walked around for awhile and then he saw Dinic's and decided he wanted food from there cause he saw the travel channel show that features them. I love a good roast pork sandwich with brocoli rabe and sharp provolone so I agreed. We sit down and order our food and patiently wait for it. Well first off they have this one idiot that works for them who is loud and obnoxious. Oh yea and did I mention sells drugs cause he definatly passed off a bag of something to another guy who works within the Reading Terminal as well who looked like a stone cold crack head. I'm not even kidding. Anyway this guy continued to sit and talk loudly about random stuff and make an ass out of himself all the while looking at my boyfriend for approval I guess cause he thought since my boyfriend is black and so is he and everyone around was white he would agree with him but he just looked back at him and shook his head. Not sure what part of town he's from but I never came across anybody like the guy that works at Dinic's before. Not to mention the manager was standing there the whole time just watching this stuff. So we finally get our food and I was so disappointed! After sitting through the dumb@$$ who works there little routine our food sucked! It was cold and just horrible. I knew there was a reason Â why I only get my roast pork sandwiches from Tony Lukes. At least there it's always hot, good and the employees act like they have some type of home training. And to the tourist who go to this place and see this kind of behavior from the employees please dont think that's Philly cause it really isnt.
