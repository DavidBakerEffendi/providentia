We live locally. The first time we went there, we figured it was because the place was new. We go back every 3 months or so, just to see if it has changed, IT HAS NOT! The meat is the lowest quality, usually with tendons running through, never cook to order, Sometimes you don't get the cut you order. The dining area has way to many tables with walking room between Â and is often smokey from serving an undercooked cow slab on a hot stone (that may over cook or undercook your meal), without pproper vents -only ceiling fans to move the air around which also makes it extemely cold while dining. There is also no sound buffering. It is extremely loud. You hear everyone's conversation and are forced to talk over the other voices. Parking can also be an issue. A used car sales lot shares the parking. The same family owns the car sales and the steak house. I would not believe the hype all these other reviews have given. I been here 20 times and at least 2 individuals at my table have been disappointed with their meals.
