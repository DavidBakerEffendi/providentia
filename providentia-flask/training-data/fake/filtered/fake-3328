I was excited to see a new burger joint in the neighborhood.  But turns out it wont be my new favorite.  Actually I don't plan on going back.  I was just really put off by an inattentive waitress, we went for the $5 basket of fries to share (because nothing comes with any sides) and when they came were limp and cold but the waitress never came by for us to say anything to about it.  It almost seemed like there was one waitress and a water boy and like 4 other people standing around near the kitchen doing nothing. The fries came with two little cups of special sauces- a curry ketchup and something else called special sauce, which I liked, and asked the water guy for more of, and was charged $.55 for a extra tablespoon of sauce.  WOW.  I think that was the straw that broke the camel's back for me.  They spent a ton of money on the interior decor.  It's over done.  They tried so hard to make it hip that its just nauseating instead.  Sorry I guess I just wanted a good burger.
