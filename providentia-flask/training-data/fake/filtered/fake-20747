Highly enjoyable experience! The hostess and staff were very friendly. I am a huge French onion soup fan,and  this was one of the best I have ever tasted!  The mussels with garlic, bits of  bacon, tomatoes and mushrooms in a red wine sauce was the most definitly the highlight of our meal.  I loved my filet mignon and my husband raved about his hangar steak.  We were both impressed with the presentation of the vegetables, I only wished that would have been served at the same time as our entrees.  By the time the veggies arrived, I was half way done with my meal.  The only reason I cannot give this restaurant a 5 star rating is because the desserts fell a bit short.  I suppose because our meal was full of rich flavors, I expected the dessert to be also, that was not the case. The fondant chocolat,   ( chocolate volcano with white chocolate ice cream) was my quite sweet enough for my rich palate.  Yet, my husband thoroughly enjoyed his carmelized, almond, merainge concoction her ordered for dessert.  Overall we really enjoyed our first visit to le sirene, and we will absolutely be returning on our next trip to NYC.
