We have a great local in the 'hood. My spouse and I had dinner tonight with friends and their children and it was great. The selection of beers and the menu is wide for a small place and the atmosphere is family friendly and the wait staff courteous and helpful. A calamari starter was shared by 4 adults and we all commented that it was tender and the spicy aioli a nice touch. The draft beers were all perfect temperature unlike most places in Burlington and the surrounding area who think all drafts are supposed to be freezing cold. My cod fish and chips were lightly breaded and tasty with as good a side of slaw as can be had in the area. The chips are hand made and everyone at the table said they are excellent. My spouse and one of our friends had the Portobello Panini and both said it was excellent. I thought our other friend was over reaching with expectations when he ordered the Hangar steak but it looked great and he said it was a fine cut and well prepared. The children went through Mac and Cheese and Fish and Chips and then had dessert on top and everyone at the table remarked on how good the brownie was as we kept sneaking pieces while he skipped around the restaurant and entertained himself with the darts at the other end of the room. Like I said the place is family friendly and a great atmosphere for a local. After reading the only review on Yelp, I expected the worst and expected high cost. The entire meal cost about the same as it would to eat in most pubs/taverns in the area but the selection, ambiance and friendliness of the place and the fact that its LOCAL will make regulars out of us. I so hope the Town Tavern succeeds. We have needed a good local in S. Burlington/Shelburne for a long time. We have one now.
