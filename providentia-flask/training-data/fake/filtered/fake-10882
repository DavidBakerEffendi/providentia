This visit was a complete letdown. For appetizer we ordered a fish dish (Fish Apollo) and it was very ordinary with lots of unhealthy food color (red). Then we ordered boneless chicken biryani and it was below average. I do cook better biryani at home. The 2 star is only because the price is reasonable.
