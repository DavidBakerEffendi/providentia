Wish I could have tried the sushi but when my friend and I went there this past weekend they told us we had 30 min to eat and had to leave. Whats with that? We saw several tables that were empty and a few seats at the sushi bar and they actually limited us to the time we had to eat. I was pumped to go to this place until that whole episode
