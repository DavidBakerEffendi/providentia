Eataly is obviously a great restaurant and grocery shopping place, but I had one unfortunate episode there. On a week night, the place was going to close in about thirty minutes, it was aound 10:30 pm, and I was checking out some grocery items I had purchased in the front part of the store. I was instructed to place the items on the counter (the front section), which I did, and abruptly the two front cashiers (one of them was a female supervisor) became rude to me, saying that "it is not the right place for such heavy items". They were argumentative and sort of arrogant. Actually there was no sign stating the contrary, and I had purchased similar items and checked them out at same counter before. I thought, these people showed no concern for my loyalty as a customer, and offered no other option for me to check out the items that I had purchased. It was late, and I was completely left on my own, I scrambled around and got lucky that another counter was still opened in the back section of the store ( close to 23rd street). That cashier was actually nice and helpful!The place itself is terrific, but hiring the wrong people will tarnish its reputation.
