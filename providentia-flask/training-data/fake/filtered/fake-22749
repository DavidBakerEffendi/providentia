This is a fabulous Tunisian  restaurant in Williamsburg Brooklyn. Whith incredible dishes and sandwiches. A great suggestion was the "La Goulette Special Falafel sandwich " with hand cut fries seasoned with parmesaan cheese inaide the warm pita. To wash it all down try a natural juice. The service is amazing, you feel at home  and always want to comeback to try a new plate. Muy bueno :) I Loved :) Brasileiros que gostam de falafel ou Pita vale a pena exprimentar. Fica a dica :)
