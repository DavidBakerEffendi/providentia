I have to disagree! Â First, there is a lot of parking and is very convenient for Bloomfield residents. I have been waiting for this place to open and have had a great experience. The people are very friendly and have even given me a tour of their establishment as well as how they make their bagels on premises. The pizza is great. I had ordered 4 pies the other day for Christmas Eve and was very pleased. They even made me a grilled chicken caesar's salad pizza, pizza bagels and garlic knots. I have yet to eat anything from them that is bad! I highly recommend this place!
