I adore it! Quite an experience. So crowed, but so many goodies to choose from; from wine, to spices, to chocolates, to gelato, to a sit down restaurant, to pasta, to cookware. Very impressive. Very pricey as well! The set up seems to be that of multiple vendors/stalls sell their own products, but you can check out anything at any register!
