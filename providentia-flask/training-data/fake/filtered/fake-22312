The owners of this establishment pretty blatantly like their patrons dead.  How can I make such an outrageous claim, you may ask? Well, one frigid winter evening I took public transportation to this bar as I knew I would be drinking.  At the door, a large bouncer checked my ID and asked me to remove the hat that was keeping my head warm on my walk from the bus.  I respectfully obliged and proceeded to place the hat in my jacket pocket.  To my shock and chagrin, the bouncer said that this was not acceptable and I had to move my hat to my car.  I was a bit perplexed by this request as I was not quite sure why a hat that was not on my head, no one would see inside my pocket, and was, to my knowledge, not underage, was not allowed inside the bar.  I proceeded to explain to the bouncer that I did not have a car to move my hat to, but the large man explained to me that there was nothing he could do per club policy. This leaves me to conclude that the proprietors of Whiskey Cafe want their patrons to either 1)  store their hats in their cars which, at the end of the night, they can then proceed to drive drunk and crash or 2) be responsible and take public transportation, but not wear hats and contract potentially fatal pneumonia. So, if you value your life, or just simply don't want to patronize a Jersey shore wannabe bar with an absurd and senseless hat policy, stay as far away from here as you can.
