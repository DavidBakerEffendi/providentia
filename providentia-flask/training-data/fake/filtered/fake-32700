The food wasn't bad but that's not why I'm giving it 2 stars. The food was ok (nothing spectacular) but the place was WAY too noisy. I took a girl there for a 1st date & it was VERY hard to hear due to music blaring. The m'adtre asked me if I had a reservation but I told him that I called to set 1 up & I left a message (their vm says to do so for reservations) & no one called me back. I was still seated. The ambiance was nice but just too noisy & because no one ever called me back on my reservation message, I got stuck at a table near the front door that always swung open & wind came in.
