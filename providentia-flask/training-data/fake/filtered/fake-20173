Great place! Nice ambiance, amazing food. I esp. liked the emmenthal sausage with dumplings, and the braised beef special. The cherry on the pie however was the desert for me. We got the warm chocolate with sour cherries and whipped cream cheese and it was to die for. All in all a great place with reasonable prices. We were lucky and got a table early on but as the night went on there were many people waiting. So that limits the time one can spend sitting and recovering from this amazing and rich food. So if you like sitting down for long at a table, this is not necessarily the place on a Saturday night.
