Just went there last night, and I must say it was one of the best bar experiences I've ever had. The ambiance, atmosphere, and service were excellent.  Apparently it is pretty popular as Yogi Berra was there and is supposedly a regular.  Our waitress was knowledgeable, very patient, and accomodating as well as friendly and sweet.  (I was with a party of 19, including 9 children, so she definitely gets high praise for dealing with us!) The food was delicious.  I started with 2 oyster shots, which were very good.  My dad, who is the pickiest Italian eater ever, ate the mussel appetizer in 5 minutes flat...this is high praise for him!  We also ordered the pot roast nachos....different, unique, and amazing.  I got the 'soup of the moment,' which was a spicy vegetable based soup, and it was also very tasty.  In addition, my family got 2 orders of the calamari & truffle fries, both of which were gone in a few minutes.  For my main meal, I got a house salad with chicken....I know this sounds boring, but my salad came with about 2 orders of delicious grilled chicken, which was a lot for the money.  Many family members got the strip steak, which looked delicious.  The kids also ate every last bite of food. Overall, this place was very good, and like I said before, the atmosphere was like an upscale bar, which is my ideal spot to eat.  I'd recommend this restaurant, and I definitely will come back!
