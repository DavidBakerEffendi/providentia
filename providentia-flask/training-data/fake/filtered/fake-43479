Good food. But the service was disappointing. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs. One of the meatballs was burned, and hard as a rock. I let the waiter know, and there was no apology, he just took the meatball away, and said sometimes they were fried on one side for too long. No replacement meatball was offered,  and they still charged me for the burned meatball.  Very disappointing.
