Welcome to the Greek Applebee's. Meatballs were a strange consistency. Octopus was eggy and the cornstarch ridden avgolemono was flavored with bottled lemon juice. The tzatziki tasted like the plastic container it live in and the fried calamari had no flavor. Sausage was good. I wish i knew the butcher that prepared it. Hype is hype, but then there is BS. I'm Greek! I know Greek food. and I don't know what this is. I don't write many reviews except when necessary. Like the nytimes wrote "I wouldn't travel more than a block or two for a meal like that. But I'd go back to Astoria."
