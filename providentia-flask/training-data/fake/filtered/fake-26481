OMG what can be said about this restaurant.  Everything is fresh, clean and beautiful. My husband and two daughters (20 and 18) had researched restaurants prior to our trip to NY/NJ and we found this one and it look interesting.  Well it was more than that.  The food we ordered was cooked to perfection and my steak was the most delicious steal (Top Sirlon) that I had ever had.  There was something for everyone.  My husband and daughter had a speciality fish meal, my other daughter had a speciality chicken pasta meal.  Frankie was our waiter (make sure he waits on you).  He provided that extra spice to make the meal fun and we felt like part of the Chateau Madrid family. Will be come back (YES) everytime we travel up north we will stop.  FYI: We live in Laurel, Indiana
