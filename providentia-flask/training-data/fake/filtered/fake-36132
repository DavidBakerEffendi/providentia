Had breakfast there this morning. I ordered the homemade granola with Greek yogurt. It was fantastic. Although they did put a little bit too much granola in the yogurt so I would recommend asking for the granola on the side. Nevertheless it was absolutely delicious.  The coffee was freshly brewed and the service was excellent. Definitely a good breakfast stop or anytime of the day stop. Very friendly with families. I saw a lot of young families there.  I will definitely go back there and I recommend this to everyone.
