Great service, great atmosphere, great food. The chef really cares about every dish sent out. I have never been disappointed and we have eaten here at least 6 times. I've had escargot, hangar steaks, snapper, cote de boeuf, you name it. Even the brunch is delicious, everything is always hot and perfectly seasoned, and comes out fast. That is more than I can say about many many brunches I have had in the city.     Dinner is even better though, and this place deserves every positive review. They even have their liquor license now! Dangerous, considering we live so close by. It has replaced several of our favorite local joints for date night. Not even to mention the service is outstanding. Overall it is not priced too much for the quality of the food you are getting, especially when compared to other local restaurants it is a huge bargain. And truly up to the best of French standards, much better than Belleville or Moutarde ever was. Olivier himself is a great host. -TG
