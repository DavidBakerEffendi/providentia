One of the worst bars I've ever entered. I ordered a dirty Girl Scout and the bartender gave me the wrong drink. He claimed I ordered the un-minty drink I had in my hand. Later that night, I went to the bar across the street.  I checked my bank statement and realized I was double charged--the bartender swiped my card twice for the same amount. I went back to the bar and confronted them.  They brought out the manager and she insisted it was my bank's fault that the bill showed up on my statement twice but she also gave me forty dollars in cash while saying this nonsense. Not to mention, I was waiting for the manager a few feet away from the kitchen door, and as a chef walked by, he snatched my phone out of my hand. I was totally not having it that night. I went up to him and he handed my phone back but when I asked him why he grabbed my phone out of my hand, he said he did not do such a thing.  Also, this chef claimed he was the manager and the owner of the bar. I didn't buy that bull crap because I talked to the manager prior to this new incident. Also, they dramatically escorted me out of the bar because they didn't want other customers to know about the incidents above. And there was a lonely, old man (customer) who said something very nasty to me. Overall, this place is horrendous . I would give this place 0 out of 5 stars if I could.
