Unlike what it looks from outside, the place itself is pretty cozy inside, equipped with a long table by the window for people who eat alone. It is definitely a bonus point for those who work around the area who want to have a quick bite but at the same time don't want to feel guilty for taking a table for four while there is a long line behind you. I've tried their karai (spicy) and miso ramen. Both were pretty good, although I'd recommend karai if you have some amount of tolerance for spiciness. The broth is very rich and silky, and chashu is cooked perfectly. The noodle can feel a little undercooked, but not to the annoying extent. Nomnom still has not reached the level of its New York counterparts (ex: Ippudo), but is still a nice addition to Philadelphia restaurant scene that severely lacks the supply of Japanese ramen. I took two stars off because you have to pay extra to get an egg in your ramen, which was unexpected, and also because the broth tastes a little greasy, which makes its miso ramen not that appealing. I'd return to the place to have karai ramen.
