Absolutely disgusting. We ordered the soup and two cocktails, which were not bad. Good start. Then our mains came out, short ribs and flat iron. The short ribs were so dry and disgusting, neither one of us could stomach two bites. So I gave my partner my steak, which I hadn't tried. Well that was just as bad. Completely oversalted,you needed a glass of water after every bite. I sent both mains back, but "management" said that they would only take one main off the bill, even though both were inedible. I would never go back and I would never recommend this crap food to anyone. Stay away!
