My friends and I were visitng from out of town and made dinner reservations for Sunday, 9/6/09.  When we got there they couldn't seat us right away  so we decided to get a drink at the bar.  The bartender ignored us for a good 15 min. VERY rude, wouldn't acknowledge us when we were cleary in his view and ready to order.  He was obviously more interested in talking to his friends than wanting to serve us.  We ended up ordering from a very nice gal behind the bar who was very helpful.  I mentioned all this to the manager  and he gave me a lame excuse that they trying to kick a customer out for belligerent behavior, hence the ignorance of his bartender.  Seriously?!    He looked a little drunk but not belligerent.  I hope Mario finds a more experienced and mature manager to run this establishment.   Dinner was great and our waiter was awesome.  1st bartender and manager lame!
