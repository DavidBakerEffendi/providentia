While having breakfast on long island on Sunday...we saw this place mentioned favorable in the Post....so we scooted on down to NYC and had lunch there....very Parisian...which I adore.  I had my dish I rate all French places by...the Salad Nicoise...although they dont call it that...and it was good....the baguettes were fresh and crunchy ......and the crepes...were just fabulous.... we sat in a window seat...it was just charming...with the planters....the service was great, and very friendly.  Can't wait to go back and try some more...
