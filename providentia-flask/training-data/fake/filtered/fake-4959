The food here is really good, definitely one of the really good feijoadas in New York (I know my feijoada from frequent visits to Brazil with my wife, who is from Sao Paulo). The service, though is horrific--truly a disaster and disrespectful to diners. We had to practically beg for everything--it is no exaggeration to say we ordered every round of drinks and plates at least three times. I will give them a break that everything took 30min to an hour arrive because it was packed for the final of the Confederations Cup and Brazil was busy beating Spain 3 to 0. After we'd already spent over $250 and waited for the closing 20 mins of the game, the waitress came and said 'you either need to consume more or I'm closing your check and clearing your table.' of course they showed up promptly when it was time to cash in and get our bill, which only suggests the lousy service was more a choice than anything. When the check arrived, they'd mischarged us for two pitchers of caipirinhas (adding $15 to the total) and then charged us for four instead of three pitchers (bringing the extra charge above what we consumed to $45). When I brought it to the waitress's attention, she even tried to argue with all 5 of us, which was, obviously, insulting. I've never had such terrible service anywhere. It's a real shame, as the food is good. We won't be going back.
