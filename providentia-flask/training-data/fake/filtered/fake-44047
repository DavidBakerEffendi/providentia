I order for the 1st time N was completely and utterly disappointed. I know Italian zeppole what they sent was not that, I called and was told they cook "miniature" zeppole; they were hard as rocks with very little powdered sugar the rocks zeppole coast $8.00 way overpriced and uneatable. French onion soup had so little cheese it might as well had none and the soup itself was not "French onion" more like chicken broth with a few drops of onions and the wrong kind of bread. N like I said not real Italian zeppole, I go to little Italy in New York they know how to make Italian food especially "Zeppole". Not recommended unless you don't mind imitations Italian foods and low grade French onion soup. We order two French onion soups medium size; if they came any smaller you might not have room for the bread overpriced as well. If the food was up to standard and real Italian food you don't mind paying for good food. I will never ever oder from them again! they need to use real Italian cook book with real food no GMO's or imitations, I know Difference
