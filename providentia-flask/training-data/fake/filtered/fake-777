Every single last time I've been to Tom's Restaurant, I've been satisfied. I live in the area, and I always make sure to drop in when I get the chance. It is amazing how much food you get for the price! I enjoy the service as well; they have been sweet as cherry pie to me and they never fail to seat me with lightning quickness. They get your food to you in no time flat! I really love how consistently friendly they are. They reassure you that it's okay to take your time, even when the line stretches out the door! I've been on that line, by the way, and they give you coffee, cookies and fresh fruit to snack on. The food is amazing! They make a killer burger, but what I really come for is the pancakes! Apple cinnamon, pumpkin walnut, blueberry and ricotta with lemon zest - the possibilities are endless, and all very yummy! All in all, a lovely experience every last time.
