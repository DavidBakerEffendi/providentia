Jose Tejas is the go to place for a fun night with family and/or friends and great eats. It is unapologetically loud which adds energy to the natural gas lit dining area.  Generous portions are served up promptly and piping hot.  Expect to wait on a Saturday or Sunday night, no reservation and no take-out.  The all day menu is priced just right, you'll bust a gut before you bust your wallet.  Arrive early and enjoy some great drinks and fresh made tortilla chips with salsa while you wait for your table.  This place is packed for a reason.  Free cerveza mañana!!
