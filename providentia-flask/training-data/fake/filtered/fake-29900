4.5 Stars - I had the opportunity of dining there with a few friends after work and was pleasantly surprised.  The food all around was excellent and the service was good.  Also, for warm weather they have a small outdoor area.  Apparently, the restaurant has just recently 'changed hands' and they brought in a new executive chef.  The menu was not a typical 'northern NJ' Italian restaurant menu, but not 'over the top eccentric' either.  I would go back if I had the opportunity again.  My only criticism, however minor, was the selection of music playing - it was not offensive, but didn't seem appropriate for the atmosphere.  The music issue will probably be easily remedied as the new owners fine-tune things.
