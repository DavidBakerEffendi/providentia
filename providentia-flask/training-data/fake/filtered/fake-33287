This wasn't my first time at Dig Inn. I've been to the one on 17th street but you guys are so much more fun and welcoming. Kay Kay was very helpful to me. She helped me on getting more food for my money. I've always gotten 2 sides but she explained that if I get a veggie plate I can get 3 side with a base for the same price of the 2 sides I always get. No one has ever explained that to me before but Kay Kay did. She also suggested that I eat in the sitting area downstairs. Which is awesome I might add. I went downstairs to sit in the eating area and before I left Kay Kay came downstairs and asked if I enjoyed my visit and I did. You guys have such a homely feeling. I will definitely recommend Dig Inn to friends and family.
