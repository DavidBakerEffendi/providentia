This is the kind of place we dont need.  High prices, small portions and mediocre food.  Kids meals listed as $7 for buttery noodles, the portion was LAUGHABLE.  And then they tried charging us $8. I think for $4 you can get Bacon Candied Almonds that were great, but thats it!  Thanks, but I will be taking my business elsewhere.
