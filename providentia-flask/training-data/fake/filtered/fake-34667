Sanford's food is fantastic.  My friends and I love going in for brunch and dinner, and are always super thrilled with our orders.  The problem I have with Sanford's is placing delivery orders. In the past month I have placed two delivery orders, and have been very rudely spoken to by whoever takes the orders both times.  The first time, I was on the phone for over 15 minutes because I was placed on hold over and over - and then lectured about how to run a business because I said that I was growing tired.  The second time (tonight), I called and waited on hold for over five minutes when I said I wanted to place an order.  Finally, not wanting a repeat of the last time, I hung up and called back.  When the same man answered the phone, I again stated that I wanted to place an order for delivery and he said very brusquely "Fine, don't hang up this time, ok?" and put me on hold again. I hung up.  For the last time.  Sorry Sanford's, if you're busy - that's fine.  I've worked in restaurants too, and I understand.  Just say "I'm so sorry miss, we're very busy and this may take a minute.  Would you like to hold on?" It's totally not worth it.
