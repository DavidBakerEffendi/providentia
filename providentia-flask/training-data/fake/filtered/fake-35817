The best part about this place is lamb tibs and the price. I've eaten ethiopian food all my life and have been coming to this place for over a year now. I came at the being of this week and the service was appauling. It ruined my whole night. There was only one other table in the restaurant but the awful waitress acted as if I was invisible. It took forever to get injera, longer than the waitress even knew!!!!! I never received a couple of things I requested and left there feeling full and satisfied with my food (although I wanted spicy tibs and got medium with no jalepenos). Food is okay for ethiopian, owners are friendly, the waitress is DREADFULLLL! The fastest thing to come out was my check!
