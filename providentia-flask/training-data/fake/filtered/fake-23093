worst pizza i've had in my life. we first ordered a white pizza, it was awful. the mozzarella looks and tastes like the caulking around my bathroom sink! chewy, tasteless, like plastic. we thought maybe white pizza isn't their specialty, that the regular ones might be to die for, coz, after all, grimaldi's got itself famous with pizza. so we ordered another, regular, pizza. turned out it's the same thing -- caulking, with tomato sauce this time. one word for grimaldi's: yuck!
