So, I wasn't too impressed.  I likewise was a bit upset by the service.  My father and I stopped by for lunch only a couple days after I moved here.  What a nice welcome!  Not.  We walked in an hour before closing and there were only two other occupied tables.  The waiter was cold, and when I asked her for a coke she rudely said, "We don't have sodas."  I timidly ordered an ice tea.  I got pad thai and my dad got something else.  I don't remember either of us being to impressed by the food, it was good, but it was really just the service that stunk up the place.
