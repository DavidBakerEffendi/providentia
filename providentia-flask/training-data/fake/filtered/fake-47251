I have been hearing great reviews about Luca's for years now.  I finally had dinner there and the experience was fantastic.  The staff was very warm and accomadating and the decor is beautiful.  More importantly the food was outstanding. For appetizers we had the buratta which was an extremely fresh and creamy ball of cheese.  It just oozed onto the plate and it was accompanied by the most delicious prosciutto, arugala, and fresh fruit.  We also had the fried calamari which may be the best calamari i have ever had.  For out entree's it was difficult to choose from so many great options.  We wnt with the veal parm which was so delicious.  The veal melted in your mouth.  We also tried the  risotto pescatore which was amazing and the seafood that came with it was so fresh!  Overall it was a great experience and I plan on comming back again this weekend.
