Some friends and I went here for dinner last weekend, and had such a mediocre, overpriced experience I felt I had to write a (rare for me) yelp review.  I'm giving two stars instead of only one just because our cocktails were very good. We went to the pines feeling excited, ready to have a nice dinner, based on what we'd read online about the place. We were sadly disappointed. The charcuterie we ordered came with two tiny pieces of bread, a joke for the four people we had at the table, it would have been enough bread for a fifth of the meat on the plate. The duck leg we ordered was five bites, not even a half of an actual duck leg, just peices strewn around the plate. Very small portions, and even though we expected that, and ordered six plates for the four of us, we were all hungry, and upset about the money and time we invested in the dinner when we left. Nothing we ate was especially good, our dishes varied from 'not bad' to 'actively gross'.  Not recommended at all.
