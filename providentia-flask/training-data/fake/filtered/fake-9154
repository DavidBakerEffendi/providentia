Came here on a Thursday for dinner with 2 friends. It was pretty empty but still felt cozy. We were seated quickly and our waitress was really great, giving us lots of good recommendations (mac & cheese and kale salad were amazing). The drinks we got were about half and half - I didn't love the bartender's Old Fashioned but his Manhattan was excellent. One star off for the lack of vegetarian entrees. To be clear, their appetizers and sides had lots of options and were delicious, but if you're doing a farm to table concept you need to have more than one option that's on par with your meat dishes (no, mac & cheese doesn't count). Otherwise really great!
