My husband and I were visiting Philly for the weekend from the NYC area.  We'd heard about this place from colleagues in NYC, so we ventured there with an old friend of ours from Philly.  The place definitely reminded me of a chic NYC dining establishment.  I thought the service was excellent and the entire staff was really quite pleasant... from the host/hostess you greeted us and made conversation (not always the case in NYC, because they tend to be too cool for school up there)... to the waitress and wait staff who consistently refilled glasses and kept our table spotless. The food was excellent.  We had the truffle guacamole which was TO DIE FOR... It's not on the menu, but if you like quac... you've got to try this... and it was in line in terms of price... $12, I think.  I also enjoyed the Mango Martini, which was fantastic... it was a nice fruity reminder of summer in the dead of winter.  We tried a 3 taster of ceviche - the shrimp, fluke and yellowtail.  I thought they were all really well done.  The fluke was my fav and the shrimp was our friend's fav... so I'll assert there's something for everyone's palate.  I wasn't feeling great, so I didn't have an entree, but my husband and friend both loved their choices. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes to enjoy good food and good service.  It will probably be between $80-$100+ per person if you're having cocktails, so be prepared.  If you're not drinking, then you can keep it under that... even with dessert.
