My wife and I celebrated our 14th wedding anniversary with simply the most pleasant restaurant staff we have ever encountered!  Salute was highly recommended by a variety of friends and from the moment we walked through the door we were treated as if we were regulars.  The garlic bread was every bit as delicious as we were told and the calamari was excellent.  Our entrees were perfect (I had the Rose Pasta and she had the Divers Scallops).  The Lava Cake and Espresso Martinis capped a perfect experience.  Despite the fact that the restaurant was full, we were never made to feel rushed.  Raphael made us comfortable with his pleasant attitude and it was obvious to us that he loved the restaurant.  I strongly recommend Salute for a wonderful dining experience!  Joe, Newington CT
