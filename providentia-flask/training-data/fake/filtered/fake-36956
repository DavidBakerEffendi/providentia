A pizza lover's dream. For the rest of us, a few hours of wasted time. I really could care less of what pizza company was doing the best in New York 50 years ago. If you're in New York, pretty much every pizza place you walk into is amazing compared to the rest of the world. The tour noted a few places that perhaps are slightly a cut above the rest, but the price also jumps with quality. If you're extremely bored and you're looking for a somewhat fun day talking about pizza with a guy who really knows his stuff, I guess this is the tour for you.
