Don't really understand the hype with this place. The food is is A-OK. It was worth a try Â and if your a tourist wanting some pork sandwich go for it & have a try. Is it worth the hype? I dont know. Is it good, its okay but I'll rather just get a cheese steak. Pork sandwich is just isn't my type of thing. But if your a fan of it, go for it.
