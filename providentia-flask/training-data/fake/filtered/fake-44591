I recently made a reservation for my wife and daughter for breakfast. I had requested that they be seated in the court yard since they both really enjoy dining outdoors. I had spoken to the restaurant on 2 occasions to confirm the reservation and was never told that the court yard was reserved for hotel guests only. Since the court yard was the main reason I had chosen the restaurant it was very disappointing when my wife and daughter arrived and were not allowed to sit in the court yard. In addition the hostess was rather rude in the way she told them. While the food was pretty good the over all experience was a lot less then expected. There is just no reason to treat any guests in such a rude fashion.
