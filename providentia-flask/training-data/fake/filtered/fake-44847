Just had  a great lunch!  My lunch partner and I received a friendly greeting and speedy service. We were quite pleased with the pulled pork sandwich...great flavor with just enough "kick."   Salad was very good, too: fresh crisp greens.  Perfect portions.  Looking forward to trying more from the appealing, widely varied lunch menu.
