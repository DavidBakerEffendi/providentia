this place is expensive and the dimsum are note good. mediocre! a can of soda for $3 dollars?!?!?!?! watch out also for the receipt (especially during dimsum) they write everything in chinese. all i can say is, remember very well the number of dimsum and other oders that you make and check the receipt very carefully!!!
