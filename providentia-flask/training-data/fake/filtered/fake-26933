Butcher Bar is fantastic! We had a dinner there for a low key wedding, and we could not have been happier with everything. The food here is delicious (oh those burnt ends!), and the service was great, too! Kathy was great to work with and definitely helped make our event run smoothly. She was very responsive to our questions and flexible about everything we wanted to do. She even called me early in the day to see if we wanted to move our party to the back garden, since the weather was so nice! We would definitely recommend Butcher Bar, either as a casual dinner spot or to host an informal event.
