I'm in a lucky position where I'm out on the road all day, so when the hankering for lunch comes along, I always find myself driving to the same place, Deli on a Bagel Cafe in Pennington, NJ.  I always go in thinking I want their Sanoma salad which is a huge portion for a great price, but second guess myself because the menu is so extensive!  It's funny to walk in and see each person in line stare up at the menu board memorized by the different options, all of which are prepared quickly.   The atmosphere is a great mix of people from high school kids on their lunch to the working crowd like myself who enjoy a quick bite to eat without the fast food feeling.  The system of ordering, getting a number, sitting at a table, and then having the food delivered to you is wonderful but I also enjoy the do-it yourself fixin's bar for the independent eater.   From bagels, salads, smoothies, breakfast, and gourmet lunches it's a plethora of food at a great price in a great area of town.  I would highly recommend stopping in a grabbing a bite, but it could take a while for you to actually figure out what you are going to eat because there are so many delicious options!!
