This is really the best sit down pizza ever.  There is always a long wait but well worth it for delicious pizza.  Good selections, tasty sauce, just the right cheese, and a nice thin and crispy crust.  You order it by pies. Pro:  AWESOME pizza.  By far, one of the best in the US.  Authentic and they put a lot of passion into it.  Good selection Con:  Long wait, not the cleanest/nicest decor.  It's nothing fancy here.  The prices are fair. Overview:  Would go back.
