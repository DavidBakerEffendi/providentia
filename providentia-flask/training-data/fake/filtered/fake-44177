I was visiting Stella Rosa in Downtown Philadelphia. I was extremely disturbed and offended by the customer service I experienced.  I entered and asked where I could find the prosecco tasting.  The response was 'Prosecco is a sparkling wine.'  I said I know what it is, I am interested in knowing where the tasting is.  The reply was 'It's not free tasting.'  I replied that I didn't ask if it was free, that I simply wanted to know where it was.  I speak with an accent and am I a woman of color.  I feel that I was disrespected and assumptions were made about me because of my appearance/accent.  I was prepared to purchase items at your store, but did not because I was treated very poorly.
