if you want to hear journey and kid rock on the jukebox and get dirty looks from guidos, not to mention potentially risking an unprovoked fight during football season, this is your place. the food is whatever typical frozen bar stuff (except the pizzas that aren't bad), I personally have seen roaches (small ones, but roaches nonetheless, on the garbage cans RIGHT in the back dining room, feet from the dining tables) and the atmosphere is nonexistent, barring loud tvs and worse jukebox music. I have to say though, the bartenders are almost always friendly as long as you don't want a mixed drink w more than 2 ingredients. I shouldn't have to tell a bartender how to make a Tom Collins. Do yourself a favor and walk down the street to Obal's Inn.
