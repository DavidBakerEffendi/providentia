The propreiters of this place are incredibly sweet.  We were seated promptly and our side dishes were whisked out and kept us entertained until the main dishes arrived.  We ordered the Bi Bim Bap (the one with beef & veggies) - quite good.  I've only had Bi Bim Bap at one other place which was better, but because they are completely different, I can't make a good comparison.  Either way, it was very good for a cold blustery NYC night. We also had the spicy stew - #37.  It was a bit too much for my palate, but good and nourishing.  I didn't think it was that phenomenal, but I think it's because my preference is for savory rather than spicy. I'll admit it:  I was only going to give this place 3 starts.  However, they gave us FREE onion/seafood pancake bread.  And let it be known that my reviews are not unbiased and yes, I will gladly be bought.
