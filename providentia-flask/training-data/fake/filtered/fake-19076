I love their pizza, I love it, but why do they play hard to get?   When you are craving a Neapolitan slice of the highest quality, and you know that you have to make a trip over to Artichoke, be prepared for the possibility of disappointment.  The hours are fickle, and when they are open for business, the lines are long and slow.  Of course, if the slices weren't so incredible, would we put up with the hassle involved?   There is something interesting and unusual about how they operate.  Maybe its the total disregard for efficiency and predictability.  For those of you who like predictability, calling ahead of time would take the guess work out of it but being a romantic, I prefer the great disappointment or triumph of an unannounced visit.
