I was not pleased with my experience at bucos at all! The food was decent but the service was not. The waiters were so rude and I had to ask for them to bring out bread and water because they were too incompetent to bring it out on their own. My utensils were dirty. There are so many better quality Italian restaurants in the area that I would go to instead of this one. In fact, I probably would have received better service at the Olive Garden. So disappointed!
