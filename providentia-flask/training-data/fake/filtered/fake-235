Why would anyone go to this place is beyond me. Â We went since this was recommended by the show man v food. We were disappointed. The food at any Subway is better. The service is better at a street vendor in NYC. The whole support the military is a gimmick. The staff is primarily losers who did not make it in the military. When I pressed one for his last unit, the faker was exposed and got angry. I am in the military and I am miffed that they use the 'support the military' to get customers Stay away from this place and go across the street or any place else. I am sick and tired of people using support the military to get business They are not pro america, they are just liars
