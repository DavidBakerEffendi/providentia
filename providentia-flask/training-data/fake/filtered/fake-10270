Charming staff, very nice food, great ambiance, though quite tiny.  If you're dining with a loud friend, take him/her elsewhere. Only complaints: 1. The plates they use are way to large, taking up half of the table, which is annoying when you want to share a bunch of small dishes.   2. The music borders on terrible; contemporary adult Italian cheese.  They're not understanding the music-snob Williamsburg clientele.
