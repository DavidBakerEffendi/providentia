This is one of those special places that makes me love living in Bloomfield. They are very friendly and genuinly interested in their customers. I started out as a Lunch Box customer years ago when my kids were at the high school. Now with the Washington Street location, there's more to love. Â The daily specials are like having a personal chef...you can taste the love! The cheesecake is unbelieveable. It's totally addictive. The best ever!
