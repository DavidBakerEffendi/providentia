Very bad home delivery service. They come late. Even after emphasizing them that I need sufficient white sauce in the parcel, they gave me only 2 small containers of sauce with 2 rolls and 1 chicken biryani. The chicken Biryani does not have any chicken in it!! So expensive food but no value for money. My friends have the same experience. Don't believe in the good reviews, they are all fake and made by the owner himself. Very bad experience. Needs improvement.
