We go to Nevada all the time. The food is pretty standard diner fare, it's not world class but it's tasty. The menu itself is huge, they have a lot of interesting salads and omelettes. I don't have a standard go to, I've tried a bit of everything. They have an extensive dessert selection, including a lot of yummy cheesecakes. Staff is friendly for the most part, the waiters and waitresses are always nice. There is one woman who often works the register and has a bad habit of totally ignoring you while you stand there waiting to pay. I suspect she's dealing with other things but she doesn't even acknowledge you or apologize for the wait, which I always think is odd. Do you not want my money!? Other then that, though, really like the place.
