LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, this place. not only was the vibe, trendy and upbeat. Restaurant filled with beautiful ppl and the food was awazing. Â Did have to wait 45min, but that was on a saturday nite, and they have enough fun drinks on the menu to keep u occupied while waiting for ur table. Cant wait to go back!
