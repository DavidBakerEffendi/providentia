This place is so over-rated. The service is so awful beside the put the service charges on the bill without telling their customer. Â The food is OK, nothing different from most Chinese places. What turned me off the most, the expect you to order as soon as you sit down and want you to leave as soon as you done ... Rip off...!!!
