This place used to be my favorite Thai restaurant but lately the service has gone bad.  The food was horrible don't know if the chefs have changed but the food did not taste right.  We had to send the dish back twice because it was just unedibly salty.  The server never paid attention and we had to wait for awhile before he took our order.  Went again thinking maybe the chef had a bad day the last time but the food still tasted bad, not like it used to months before.  Too bad this was my favorite Thai restaurant but no longer is...
