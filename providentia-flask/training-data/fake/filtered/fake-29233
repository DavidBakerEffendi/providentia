I just had the worse falafel ever. By the way, I'm from Israel so I had some good ones in my lifetime. I almost broke my teeth while chewing what was supposed to be chickpeas, but felt more like rocks. The pita itself was very small and had hardly anything in it, for $3.50 it was no bargain. Don't know who's writing those other reviews, but if you doubt to me go ahead and try.
