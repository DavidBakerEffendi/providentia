This place is perfect for what it is... a small cozy bistro.  I live nearby and go often on sunday for brunch, its never too packed at that time and i have always been immediately seated (don't sit at the table by the door, the door will hit you each time).  The food is amazing and prepared with such care, everything about the food is perfect.  i always get the scrambled eggs with bacon or the croque monsieur, both are simply delicious and come with an tasty salad.  My girlfriend has tried most of the menu and she says everything is absolutely great, which is not her typical response.  The bread is as fresh as fresh gets and awesome.  The portions are modest (although not small), so if you are a big eater, get sides.   The service is so friendly that its clear the owner takes customer service very seriously.  On of my top five places in NYC.
