The food was good but not exceptional, I have certainly had better! Price and portion did not match: our entrees were an appetizer size. I sat at the counter for lunch watching the action of busy cooks. During the course of 45 minutes I witnessed the chef licking his cooking/serving spoons more than 10 times. I have read many great reviews about this place but I wondered how no one seem to have noticed this. I do not appreciate sharing the chef's saliva!!!!
