I can not believe the good reviews I read in yelp about this place...are you out of your mind?  and with all the good restaurants in NY you put so many stars to this one?  unbelievable.   We were a party of 7 and tried almost everything.  The food was mediocre to say the least.  There is nothing that I could recommend you to order.  I tried a libanese wine that was spicy, and awful, and expensive.   Service was ok though
