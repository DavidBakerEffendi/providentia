I hesitate in writing this 5 star review because Doma is still a little undiscovered.....but, it is clearly TOO GOOD to keep quiet! The Sushi is amazing. My favorite is the Yakuza roll, and the Spicy Tuna pizza....the pork tacos with sweet pickle kimchi are amazing as an appetizer. It is expensive, but I don't think there is better sushi in the city.
