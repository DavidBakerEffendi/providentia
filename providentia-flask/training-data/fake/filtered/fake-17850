People who eat here have reported having spiritual revelations regarding their purpose on Earth, the true nature of the universe as well as deep insight into how to be the best person they possibly can. This is viewed by many as a spiritual awakening and what is often described as a rebirth. In addition, it is often reported that individuals feel they gain access to higher spiritual dimensions and make contact with various spiritual or extra-dimensional beings who can act as guides or healers,  take your order,  or just crack open the coldest Budweiser this side of Wyckoff..  I'd take a star off because of some mega babe model waitress that refused to swaddle me into a papoose and have me sleep off the rest of my meal strapped to her back, but I ALSO refuse to be defeated, and will be back.
