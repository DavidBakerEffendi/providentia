The food is absolutely delicious whenever your able to get any.   I've never heard of a restaurant running out of food in the middle of their business hours.   It's happened to me 3 times.   Once they told me they were completely out of food and 2 other times they didn't have the sides I wanted.   Food is good but they obviously never owned a restaurant before and don't know how to manage it and unfortunately they have lost my business.
