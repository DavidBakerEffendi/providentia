This place was mentioned in a New Yorker article years ago, before poutine had become de rigueur at more establishments. The restaurant's name proved memorable and as someone who had wanted to experience poutine, I made sure to visit. The poutine does not disappoint! As other reviewers validly point out, Â the gravy may be a bit salty but the dish is large enough to compensate. I took a hungover friend there to experience it and it has been declared the cure! I sadly can't speak on many of the fries or their sauces since I always get the poutine but what I have tried was delicious and affordable.
