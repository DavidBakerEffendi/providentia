WHAT THE HELL AS HAPPENED TO GOODFELLAS PIZZA IN BAYONNE. For the past two years I have brought pizza from goodfellas on and off and I never complained about it for it was super good and hell GOODFEELAS has won several world pizza title. But in the last several months the quality and quantity of what a person gets for the price has gone down that all you get is either pizza dough or pasta and nothing more. Well as of 12/23/2013 I will never buy anything else from GOODFELLAS. IF I WANT DAMN PIZZA DOUGH I WILL GO TO A BAKERY AND BUY A LOAVE OF BREAD.
