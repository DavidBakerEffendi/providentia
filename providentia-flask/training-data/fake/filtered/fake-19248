A couple of friends swear by this place... so after a lot of talking and not much tasting they finally took my girlfriend and I..... Oh man, not what I expected at all! The kind of place where everyone at the table doesn't say a word. Only coming up for air to say 'thank you' as your water is being refilled as soon as its about two notches from the bottom. Great service, nice decor, AMAZING FOOD!!! Craving it ever since, as I live in Miami, FL. Why? I 'm now a believer (not that I ever really had doubt but you know)!
