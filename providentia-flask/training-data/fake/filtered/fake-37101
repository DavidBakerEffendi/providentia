The owner apparently doesn't understand the meaning of the word "reservation".  Not the place to go if you don't want to wait for a table, even after you've reserved it.  When I asked why we had to wait, although we had made a reservtion, we were told tht you have to wait in doctor's offices, so it's OK to have to wait in his retaurant.
