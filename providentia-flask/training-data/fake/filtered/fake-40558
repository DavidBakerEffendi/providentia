I went in for brunch the other day (which was delicious, but not what this review is about!) and saw adorable custom Halloween sugar cookies for sale. After chatting with the waitstaff, I asked if I would be able to order and customize them for my parents wedding anniversary, and of course, they didn't hesitate in helping me out! We Â were/are SO IMPRESSED with the quality and taste of the cookie, that I can't wait for my next get together to have an excuse to order more! Allison and Dana, you really helped me turn my family's get together in to something really special, thank you!
