Once you taste the sushi here, you will be spoiled for life.  Seriously. You have to make reservations for lunch and it is always crowded.  We slip in once in a while because we get there when they open and sit at the sushi bar, promising to be out before the reserved guests arrive. We generally do not sit at the sushi bar, but I think it's the best seat in this restaurant: the sushi chefs are amazingly knowledgeable about suggesting sushi/rolls to you based on your likes/dislikes.  And *do* listen to them because they will not steer your wrong. The menu is unusual because they only list the fish that are available that day.  And the tastiest fish, ever.  All other sushi restaurants pale in comparison. Service is very efficient: they have roving runners who immediately clear your table as soon as you finish your meal, refill drinks, etc. Sushi Yasuda is not cheap, but worth every penny.
