I went to Desi Food Galaxy this morning with my husband. We had a very tasty pesarattu (moong dal dosa), masala dosa and soft idlies served with two chutnies and sambar from Dosa Bytes. The poDi they served with idlies also was very tasty. I make these dishes at home a lot, am very particular about the taste and freshness of the food served and I am very happy and was well satisfied with the food prepared at Dosa Bytes of Desi Galaxy on Route 27. The Sambar could use a bit more tamarind though. I am looking forward to going there again whenever I do not feel like preparing these dishes at home. We also liked the mango lassi and potato kati roll from Bombay Spice stall there.
