I absolutely loved it. I've been to some really fantastic ramen places in Tokyo, and the ramen here definitely transported me back. The taste was completely authentic and worth the wait to me (but I will allow that thanks to my friend's knowledge of the wait, we showed up BEFORE we got really hungry, and then walked around for a bit). I've only been the once, so it may not be as consistently amazing as my experience, but it was exactly what I was looking for and more. I'll definitely be going back any time I miss Japan too much!
