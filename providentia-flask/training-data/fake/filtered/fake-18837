Bier good.  Food BAD. Great selection of beer and nice atmosphere to sit and enjoy in the evenings.  However, do not waste your money on the food - our sandwich was expensive and inedible.  I rarely make comments to the waitstaff, but this "gourmet" sandwich was so bad I thought they might want to avoid serving it to other patrons - and also perhaps offer me something else to soak up some of the booze. However, when I told the waitress how awful it was she responded with, "yeah, I know - I had that sandwich once and it was pretty bad."  She shrugged her shoulders, dumped the check on the table and walked away.  Even decent food would work for me since the selection is so nice.  "Gourmet food" it is not.
