So...unless you plan to lose your hearing, you're high on something, or planning to get extremely drunk you do not want to go to this restaurant.  The atmosphere I'm guessing, is supposed to bring you into the heart of Cuba, but the music is so loud you cannot help but scream your order to the waiter, whom you will only see twice, after waving your arm off.  Your screaming, mixed in with the  screaming table next to you, the loud music, and the waiters who are running a marathon doing matrix moves so they don't knock each other out, was just a horrible experience. The food is not worth this huge headache you are left with. What a shame... The owner of this place got money hungry, they are clearly under staffed, and they try to cram in as many ppl as possible... Never again!!!
