Food was okay (my friends and i ordered a couple pizzas & a brunch plate). The tables & atmosphere = nice. And I like the Brooklyn Grange farm-stand. (I actually went there for brunch, because I was picking veggies up from the farm stand). but NEVER AGAIN. the service was SOOOOOO BAD!!! Horrendous! So bad that my friend penciled on our check "you are a bad waitress". Our water was empty the whole time (and it being 90+ outside, water is a must!!). I would've ordered a second drink, but our waitress NEVER CAME BACK. She stood at the back, chatting with people at the bar. It was not busy!!! There is NO EXCUSE for such awful service. We had to flag her down for the check, at which point she just dropped it on the table, saying nothing. I don't care if you're trying to be a hipster, and are "too cool"--- to me, it's just plain bitchy, and unacceptable in the restaurant industry. Won't be eating here again.
