Absolutely the best place ever in the city for amazing food - smallish menu but well enough choice and everything is cooked and presented perfectly (and its so reasonably priced, too). Its compact to say the least, so be prepared to sit in someone else's lap!! but this only adds to the atmosphere. The staff are friendly but I would imagine they wouldn't tolerate Prima Donna's - come here, relax and don't show off or demand immediate service. They have nothing to hide here - you even have to walk through the kitchen to the bathroom. We can't recommend this place enough !!
