This is one of my current favorites in the city - I've never had a bad experience here.  I prefer the less expensive small plates to the entrees, but I still never leave hungry.  The corn on the cobb is awesome.  My only complaint is that they always try to take away your appetizer plates too soon - not the appetizer, just the plates.  No biggie though.  Highly recommended.
