I have been here twice and decided to write this after my second visit. I went a couple months ago right after they opened and it was good but was not a totally functional restaurant yet. I went back in expecting a more finished product and my expectations were blown away. The food was delicious and my waitress was knowledgable and friendly. It seemed like they had been open for years. Started with a caesar salad and it was amazing. Fresh lettuce and a great dressing topped with anchovies. Best I have had in a long time. Then, I got the corn and speck pizza and it was really good, my waitress recommended it to me and she was spot on. It was salty, sweet, and had a wonderful cream sauce. They had good beers on draft, started with a Fiddlehead and then went for Veritas own long trail called the Cuatro. It was a really good beer. Also, was cool having the owner stop by at my table a couple times. He has been there both times I have gone in. He loves his pizza. I will be back for sure.
