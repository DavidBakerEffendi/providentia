Been there a couple of times since they opened. Ideally more frequently but I do not wait more than 30 min at any restaurants. The best time to get a seat there quickly is 1-2pm on weekdays. If I cannot get a seat Â there, I usually satisfy my urge to slurp a ramen at alternatives in the city - Kambi (my favorite), Minca, Setagaya (spicy miso ONLY), Lai lai ken, Naruto, Terakawa, Totto (superb esp aburi pork chushao), Menchanko Tei (spicy chanko ramen), Riki (miso, 45th), Santouka (everything is good here @ NJ Mitsuwa - try miso ramen w/rice topped w/scallion and grilled diced pork), Batten Ramen (NJ - ok level), Asahi (NJ - BIG portion spicy seafood ramen is best) Hide-chan (East Village) etc. Hope Ippudo will eventually open more joints in Gotham and in non-NY States - hear screaming voices from west coasters here Plus pork buns are available at Zaiya in midtown too, All said, Ippudo is THE best so far.
