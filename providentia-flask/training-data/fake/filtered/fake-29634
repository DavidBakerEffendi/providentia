Per Guy's recommendation on Food Network, our family had our first brunch last Saturday. All four of us ordered the waffle and wings and we really enjoyed it. The waffles were presented warm with a touch of cranberries and cinnamon butter cream? The chicken was fresh and seasoned just right! Was worth the drive!
