Leave the gun take the garlic.  When it comes to family style home cooked Italian food, as if there is any other way to put those words together, you either got it or you don't .  Don Peppe's got it and in a big way.   They have been at this location for 45 years, and any night you go you will over hear someone talking about playing cards there in the 60's or being a regular for 20, 30 or 40 years.  People just was to be attached to this place in any way possible.  Much like the Menu, only written on the back wall, you want to be there not to miss anything. Start with the clams, then get some more clams, yes they are that good.  The salad might be the only thing not to drive home a 10, but it is salad, what are ya gonna complain about a 9?   The lemon butter chicken is so good, I am drooling now thinking about it.  The Veal Marsala, and the garlic pasta are right there too.  You need some Bill Gates brain to figure out what is better then what.   My suggestion is to round up a group of calorie counting, stomach ailment suffering, pickiest eaters you know, head to Don Peppe's and that just means more for you.  If you go with anyone close to normal you are going to fight down to the last clove of garlic, and if you are with me it is war. ENJOY!
