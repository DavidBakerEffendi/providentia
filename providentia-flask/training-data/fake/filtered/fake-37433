Introduced to us as a private dining club several years back we went with a large group and signed in. We have been back at least once every year to celebrate or just enjoy a long evening talking with friends while each course is brought to our table over a span of about 3-4 hours. You never feel rushed at this place. Although a bit pricey at $90.00 per person, it is an amazing dining experience. It is a BYOB so you do save some money there. If you didn't know what you were looking for you would never find 15 Fox. The name is the address and that's all there is. No signage that a restaurant even exists here. Because it doesn't.. Imagine going to a family home for a holiday meal and get together because that's what this is. The home is decorated with family photos, furniture and nick knacks. The bathroom has a shower, no upgrades here. The food is cooked on a stove in the kitchen right off the library. Close your eyes and pick your favorite family get together and you are there with the smells and hospitality and of course your party of guests who came along with you. Just like a big Italian dinner, the food starts coming at 7:30 and doesn't stop until about 10pm with the offering of some homemade lemoncello. Go enjoy 15 Fox Place...you won't regret it.
