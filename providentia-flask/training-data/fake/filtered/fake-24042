I truly wish that I could give Kim's a lower rating than even one star. My family and I went on mother's day for dinner and it was a chaos. We arrived and waited 45mins to a hour looking at empty dirty tables. The service was disorganized and they were simply confused. They were confused from setting the table, ordering drinks, and little commodities like lemon, dressing, utensils, etc. We literally had to constantly ask for forks and knives. They had way to little staff for the amount of people that was there. They focused more on the take out orders than the people waiting in the restaurant. We waited for our food for two hours. We thought about leaving twice but we had no other arrangements unfortunately and we fell weak to their delicious cornbread. We also thought about just leaving a dollar for the cornbread. When we got our food it was decent however the waitresses didn't know whose order was whose because they took so long and was way too busy to remember. We had about three waitress and they would all forget what we ordered. We asked for drinks about four times and didn't get it until the fifth time. I said to my family that this reminds me of the game dinner dash and they were losing horribly. Some customers that were sitting next to us just left. It also took them thirty minutes to get together the bills. As you can see I would not recommend to anyone not even my worst enemy. If you see Kim's on the web RUN!!!!
