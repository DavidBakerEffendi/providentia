I have come in here a few times, more recently with very important clients and then my boss. I have to admit, I didn't expect the food to be as great as it was. I had perceived this to me more of a "bar scene" type of place, but I thought the food was excellent. In fact, everyone in our party loved everything they had. Â I eat out quite often and consider myself somewhat of a foodie, and definitely a picky eater. I was really delighted. I had an outstanding fish dish and the last time, the ahi tuna appetizer which was perfect. Drinks are perfectly mixed and creative. We were able to enjoy the rooftop both times, which was outstanding in beautiful weather, with great energy. However, the dining room looks really fabulous as well when I passed it on the way out to the rooftop, and I am planning to try the dining room soon with a Groupon i just purchased. In short, this place won me over and I will be back again and again!
