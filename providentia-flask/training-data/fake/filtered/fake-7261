A big disappointment. We arrived at 6 PM when they opned and had a reservation. However, our table was terrible and even after we were moved we got a cold blast of air everytime the door opemed. The waitor was extremely rude and forgot orders. The Boulliabase (special of the next) was a joke. A poor sauce and almost no weafood. I had one shrimp, one mussel and a piece of lobster. The reminder of the dish was potatoes and veges. This was $39.00 - what a joke! The best things on the menu were the bread and the desserts. Our bill for 4 people with an inexpensive bottle of wine was $400.00!! There are far better ways to spend your money in New York !
