This is as close to authentic Italian food and ambiance as it gets outside of Italy.  It is an intimate and charming restaurant but the real wow is the food.  Don't let the fact that it is all 100% gluten free scare you, although it is perfect for those who need to avoid gluten.  Everything is delicious.  We started with the fresh pear and avocado salad and then had a funghi (mushroom) risotto and a carciofi (artichoke) risotto.  Both were creamy and so full of flavor and delicious taste. Then we topped it off with a cool and chocolatey sweet tiramisu.  We've been back twice since then to try other risottos and each one is better than the last.  A definite destination restaurant in the east village.  Enjoy!
