Overated!! Bland and inconsistent food. No AC on a summer nite when the restaurant and bar was packed with people waiting to be disappointed. Seating and tables are uncomfortable and our server gave us the check before we received our dessert. I live and eat in NYC and this place will probably last till the winter. I cannot put into words how disappointing this restaurant was. Myself and my 3 dining companions all had severe stomach problems the next morning.
