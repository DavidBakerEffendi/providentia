This is the best street meat in the city!!  $6.50 and you get a huge plate of chicken or lamb or steak with rice and a salad.  I have heard rumors that the tomatoes are from Tony's own backyard garden at home. Seriously its a street cart so dont talk about the service or the people or the ambiance cause it doesnt matter.  Go and stand in line, give them your order, get it and leave.  You will be amazed at how good the food is here from the platters to the burgers and everything in between. If you are looking for good, inexpensive food in a hurry this is the only place to go in midtown.  warning tho his line gets crazy at lunch time as all the office people around there go here to eat.  So sometimes the wait gets really long, like down the block long but dont get discouraged or impatient.  The line moves really fast and the food is more than worth it!
