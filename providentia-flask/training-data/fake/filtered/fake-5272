I walked by this place and saw a stool available at the bar. Lucky man! I was promptly seated though the place was very busy. Ordered the guac and chips (watery - I like my guac thick - but tasty) and steak tacos (delicious and lots of meat: Yum!)... Had one drink and a sip of another. My first drink (jalapeno infused margarita) was great. Got my second drink, had a sip, and dropped my slippery glass. The waiter, who had just given me the drink, promptly cleaned my mess, turned around and left. I didn't even get a drop of another drink... That was soooo f"$%#@ tacky, man! I head out to lots of cool spots for drinks and food. What happened here is soooo stingy, classless, and low. Elsewhere, I would have been given a drink, a shot, something... Thus, inconsistently good food, good drinks, tacky service... The place needs a little finesse.
