I've been twice.  Lovely room, sweet people, a bit disorganized: their system, where everyone waits on everyone, means that I was always being asked if the food was good, and if I'd given my order.  A pain.    The food was mixed: duck bins absent both times, the dumplings good but the listing is for six different kinds and only one came.  The gha soup terrific, ditto the beef salad, but the mango sticky rice awful: the mango hard as a rock (not like a papaya salad, even: HARD) and the sticky rice hard and stiff, not fully thawed, certainly not freshly made and wonderful as it can be.  Still I'll go back; the food is serious; only the serving is bad right now.
