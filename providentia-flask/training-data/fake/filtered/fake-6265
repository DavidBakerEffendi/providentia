I have been to Race Street Cafe a handful of times, for lunch, dinner and even for a baby shower. The food has always been top quality delicious, the servers and bartenders are very propmt & friendly and the atmosphere has always been comfortable. I would definately recommend visiting.........a gem in Olde City.
