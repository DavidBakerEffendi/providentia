The title says it all, "Perfect Pizza".  I ate here last Sunday.  It was seriously "that good".  It was everything I wanted in a pizza, and everything I wanted to feel in a NY pizza place.  I walk in, say "gimme 2 slices of cheese", he yells to the guy handling the oven, "two cheese".  A couple minutes later, hands me the pizza and says "two cheese boosss".  It also felt great to get out of the busy Time Square crowd and step into this nice warm, garlic smelling pizza joint.  Anytime I'm hungry in the theater district, you can bet, I'll be stopping by. Was this review ...?
