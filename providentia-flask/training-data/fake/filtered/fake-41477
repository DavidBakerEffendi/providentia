Fuji used to be a favorite treat but after the glacier waitress experience had  tonight (directed at college age guests referenced by other yelpers) I won't be returning. After ordering banana tempera ($4) I saw on the check it was listed as $8. When I looked over the menu, our waitress explained the ice cream was extra. I enjoyed it, so was willing to pay for it. However, I remarked to my boyfriend  that an 8 dollar dessert wasn't really in my budget, and I didn't understand it was an extra charge since she said 'what kind of ice cream do you want?' rather than 'do you want ice cream?' Our waitress returned, after overhearing me, and offered to remove the 4 dollars, but said so in a condescending and slightly confrontational tone (complete with eye roll) that made me feel uncomfortable. I declined, but leaving having made felt unwelcome, I asked for a manager on the 1st floor to let them know. When no manager was available, another waitress heard my story, while the first waitress stepped in and (while her tone appeared softer) continued to quite blatantly,  argue with me. In the middle of this, she took a phone call, and after a few minutes of ignoring me, we left. The added ice cream wasn't the problem. The problem was the experience afterward. 1. Being offered to take the charge off in a belittling manner. 2. Not being able to express my displeasure at 1. then adding insult to injury by taking a phone call. It's too bad one waitress' ego is costing Fuji a 2+ year customer.
