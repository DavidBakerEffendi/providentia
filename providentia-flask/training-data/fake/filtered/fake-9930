Love this place. I was turned onto Turkish food a couple of years ago and was a fan instantly. Grilled meats on a stick, whats not to like. Â Its more than that, the food has tremendous amount of flavor. I always get take out, so I never dined in their restaurant. Another favorite of mine is the cold appetizer sampler. I wish this place was closer to me.
