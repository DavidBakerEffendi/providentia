If you are like me, you've had your share of just so so Thai food. Since my fiance and I discoved this about 2 months ago, we've been there about 5 times and taken friends with us. Â Great, fresh, and really tasty. There peanut pork dumpling appitizer is a great starter. Nice food presentation, service is good and i like the ambiance. Sometimes the music can get a bit loud. All and all... great experience at a great value
