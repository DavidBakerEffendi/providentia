the first time i ate here i couldnt believe the level of class..i was always going to smith st and park slope to find places that took food and food service this seriously ... a few had so many different chefs u never knew what was up,,,,,russsian roulettte time...how the owners got this smallish place to become my new favorite place to eat is testimony to their professionalism dedication intelligence and elan...there is to me such a fine distinction between service that is perfunctory i mean sometimes its obvious but even w meticulous staff it sometimes feels like u have zombies robots delivering the food to you....the hostess and co owner here is no college kid....she is a  a real beauty and her skills at what she does--are so apparent -   for me it was a new level of professionalism i have truly never witnessed...and ive eaten in some of the the best restaurants in the world....as i think about it i had a similar exp at lutece the first year it was opened when the chef came over to our table and the food was a revealtion esp to a kid who grew up eating string potatoes out of cans mostly...but the hostess waitress nicole at petit oven was not like any other anywhere...if she were serving me shoe string potatoes out of cans id still eat there !!!! but she turned out to be only the first of many pleaures dining there..kat  is the cook chef ! i mean-- shes is polish trained at the fr culinary institute she is modern and organic as she can be and uses local fresh fare....her plates delivered by nicole w a brooklyn no bullshit  flourish which can only be experienced to be believed--further the joy of eating here...i had  an amzing duck breast  in some delicious sauce - a real thrill..they have incredible wines n beers and make great suggestions  and were so personable.. it really was one of the most intimate and special dining experiences  i've ever had...
