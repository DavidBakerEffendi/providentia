This is a fast-paced buffet restaurant. Lots of people, vacationists and families visiting. The food, the place, and the service are fine. Its floor service care taker, whose name is Carol is very courteous, efficient and most of all helpful. Try to look for her when you come. Unfortunately, there is one snag...the woman in the counter upon entering is unsavory and unappealing. She spoils the day. Sonny J.
