Its a small place, hidden behind a convenience store.  When I first visited after we moved to the area, I didn't have high expectations.  What a surprise to discover a great breakfast and lunch place less than two miles from our house.  Their breakfast burrito is one of my favorites, and I have fallen in love with their spin on the english muffin breakfast sandwich.   Great burgers as well.  My only complaint is the occasional lag in coffee fills from the often overworked wait staff.  But otherwise, its become one of my favorite breakfast stops in the Trenton area.
