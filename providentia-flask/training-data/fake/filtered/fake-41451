I would recommend this place for dinner. the food was good. I had the pork chops, which were juicy, with rice, beans, and sweet plantins. I would of liked a few more sweet plantins. My friend had the thin steak, but he said it was a little dry, but overall it was fine. The service was good. Someone was celerbrating their bday there and a guy came out with a hat that had flashing lights singing happy bday. it was funny and cute.
