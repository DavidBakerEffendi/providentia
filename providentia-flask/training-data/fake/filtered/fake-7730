Just went here today for breakfast with my fiancé after reading good reviews. Nice little place with indoor or outdoor seating. Unfortunately took really long for our meals and I got the special which was the lobster tomato and cheddar omelet which was bland and not great at all for $11! Also as soon as it was placed in front of me I was shocked to see a hair on my plate! I didn't return it due to such a long wait. My fiancé asked for a sausage and egg sandwich on croissant which came as ham instead of sausage. Needless to say we will not be going back!
