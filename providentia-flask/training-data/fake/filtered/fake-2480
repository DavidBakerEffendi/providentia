Pingala is a welcome addition to Burlington's vegetarian and vegan restaurant scene. I love that they can make anything gluten-free as well! That is sometimes hard to find, as many gluten free breads have egg in them - but they sourced a wonderful vegan gf bread (Sami's) for all of their sandwiches. They also have gf pasta for their pasta dishes, and corn tortillas available for quesadillas and such. I've been 3 times already, and I have never been disappointed. The kale pesto pasta was fantastic, as was the tempeh tacos, and tempeh salad. I do wish they had a gf wrap though. If you're a vegetarian or vegan, Pingala is an all around winner in Burlington!!
