when i approach the counter, im not sure whats going on.  whose in line, is it my turn, etc.  then they only accept cash, okay its 2011 not the 1970s, if you wanna do cash only give us a free atm in the corner.  when i walk up to the counter i expect to be greeted with a hello, do you need help.  last but not least, you should put some ice in your smoothies.  drinking warm smoothies in the summer time is whack.
