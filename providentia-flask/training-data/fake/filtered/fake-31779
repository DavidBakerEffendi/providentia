I'm a regular at the Montpelier location. Love that place. Had to come check out this new offering. It was okay. The atmosphere and decor was nice. I was disappointed with the waitstaff. The male servers were very attractive, but obviously not experienced servers. Very inattentive and lazy. They weren't rude, they were happy to get me another pint glass when I pointed out the huge crack in mine - lol, as well as swapping out the mashed sweet potatoes for regular when my meal came as it wasn't noted on the menu that it came w sweet potatoes (yuck). Overall an underwhelming experience. I'll stick with my beloved McGillicuddy's in Montpelier.
