The food was OK but should have been better.  I also felt that we were nickel and dimed on some items, which at these prices should not happen.  Monkey Bread was good BUT with $30 plus entrees there should be some bread that you don't have to pay for (Colicchio and Sons at the same prices has the same type of fresh baked bread for free as an example).  Also, we were grossly overcharged for gin and tonics $15 per gin and then $5 EXTRA for tonic (which was cheapo Seagram's tonic) - $20 for a gin and tonic is not cool ever especially when its flat and nothing special.  The lamb I ordered as an entree was cold.  It did not say it was a cold dish.  The veggies were hot on the plate, but the lamb had obviously not been made fresh.  I told the waiter that the lamb was cold.  It came back lukewarm and the plate was burning hot, obviously they just stuck it in the oven.  It was inedible.  So while some may have a great meal here, beware that they may cut some corners and they to charge you more than they should.
