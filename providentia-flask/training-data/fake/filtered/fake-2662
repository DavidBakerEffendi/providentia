This place is ridiculously small with poor service.  We had reservations at 9:30 and did not get seated until 45 minutes later.  The staff hardly looked at us and definitely did not apologize for the wait nor did they comp us a drink or appetizer.  You literally have to ask permission to use the restroom because it's located through the kitchen (a little countertop), and your trip cannot coincide at a point when food is coming out.  The food is flavorful, but there are plenty of other restaurants in NYC with flavorful food and decent service.  However, the lychee martini is awesome.  I'm not sure why Mehta opened another restaurant, Mehtaphor (also a disaster), instead of enlarging this one.
