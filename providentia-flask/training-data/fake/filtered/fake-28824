Bar Tano is a nice place to go. the food is good, the pizza awesome, the price is right and even the beer/wine selection is pretty decent. it's great for a date or a small party and in the summer there are seats outside the street is a bit noisy but all in all it's worth the visit I give it 3stars try it yourself
