Really tasty fried dumplings. What makes it unique is the dumpling skin that they use. It is really thin yet crunchy. The meat inside is also delicious. I do worry about the cleanliness of the place. It is just dirty! But their dumplings are so good...I don't know which to choose sometimes. That's why I give it three stars...
