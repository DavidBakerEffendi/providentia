I had Pho from this place about a week ago...it was DELICIOUS. If I had reviewed it on that day it would have gotten 5 starts immediately!! The broth is not greasy, very light and flavorful but not salty or too "beefy", or "gingery", or "cinnaminny". It's just a smooth broth, the noodles are nice and tender but not soggy. Vegetables are crisp and delicious. Well...I went back today for lunch and had a small beef again. It was delicous! 5 stars again. Why did I give it 3 stars you ask? Well...I went up to the counter to pay and as I was paying I watched the server (younger/teen girl) bring up a plate of leftover bean sprouts and thai basil from a customer who had just left. She picked the leaves from the thai basil stem and put them in a bowl, then she grabbed the bean sprouts (again, from the customer's leftover plate, customer had just left and she had just cleaned his table) with her bare hand and tossed them into a large bowl of bean sprouts. Then I watched as she grabbed a new dish (bare hand again), grabbed a handful of bean sprouts and Thai basil and served it to a newly seated customer. I was so grossed out. People sit there and talk over their plates and once in a while you might spray a little of your Pho while slurping it up so I just thought this was disgusting and had to take 2 stars away for sanitition and cleanliness. I wish I could say I will never go here again because I really do love the Pho but I tell you this...I will NEVER eat the bean sprouts or Thai basil again......
