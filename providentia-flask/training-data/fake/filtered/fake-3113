"If you're ever depressed, come to Cuban Pete's".. this is what one of my friends said about the restaurant, and I took another friend there yesterday. The waiters wear yellow shirts, straw hats. If it's your birthday, they come out with bongo drums and give a hoot and holler- the Cuban artistry and knick knacks are cool- I love it.
