How do i start, Delicious, Mouth watering, Heavenly, Awesome, Two thumbs up, Better then a Snickers. Done. These are, but a few words that can express how amazing the empanada mama is. Their empanadas pack so much favor that you just forget about everything else. Except the bill, these empanada are pricey, but their worth it. If it wasnt for the price, I give them five stars.
