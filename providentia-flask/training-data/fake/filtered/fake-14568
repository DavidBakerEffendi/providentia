I love burgers. And I wanted to love my Plan B burger but I didn't. Perhaps my expectations where too high? I've had better burgers almost everywhere else I've been. The Burger: I ordered the bacon cheese burger, no pink with fancy fries. The burger arrived cooked incorrectly with a pile of cold caramelized onions on top of two of the thinnest bacon slices I have ever seen. When I looked at the patty I could see where the cook gripped the beef when they formed the patty and tossed it on the grill. I envisioned the cook grabbing a handful of beef, tossing it on the grill, heartlessly flipping it once then topping it with cheese, some sort of cheap bacon and some onions that had been sitting around. I couldn't even eat it. Fancy Fries: not the type of fries I enjoy. Thin tasteless potato twigs. So what did I like? I loved my appetizer, American nachos. Basically house made chips with cheese and toppings. Great twist on nachos. Service: we had a good waiter. I don't send food back but if I said how disappointed I was with my meal I'm sure they would have done something to make it better. The Place: gorgeous, great looking restaurant. Overall: I read many if not most of the reviews for this place. I'm hoping that my experience was an anomaly. I would give this place one more try. Maybe a cold beer would help. Perhaps the cook was not working when I came in and a waiter cooked my meal? Vinnie Out
