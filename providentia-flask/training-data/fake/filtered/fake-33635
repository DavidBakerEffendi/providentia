Lady at the entrance had bad attitude. We were seven of us and we were asked to take a table of 6 and we were ok with it no issues. When our buzzer we off after an hour we went to claim our table at that point we were only six and 7 th person was joining bit later. There lady there was mean she was like you can't have 7th person come in late for a table of 6 and she said call him and tell he she won't allow him to sit with us. Food and drinks might be good be if they have bad attitude it wont go far. We just walked out.
