This sort of place is ultra appealing to me. An officially "green" restaurant with a pleasing aesthetic and what sounds like a pretty great basic menu. But I have to say the fare was mediocre. We had the cinnamon bread french toast, the Vermont omelette, and the gluten free almond pancakes. With each I'd have to say the flavor and presentation were such that, if it were made at home, I'd have said, "I could have done better, sorry." I'm not sure if it's the chef on hand or the recipes, but it lacks vivaciousness and flavor. The almond pancakes were presented very plainly and a bit gooey and undercooked. I had to ask for butter to liven them up. Â However, the service was very good--the people warm, attentive, and quick. I'd hoped for more, but I don't know if I would return. The fact that it is local and organic, and that the ambience is so nice, are factors that would draw me to return, even if the food doesn't taste stellar.
