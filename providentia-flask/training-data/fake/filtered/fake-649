Horrible experience! So against my better judgement after hearing very mixed reviews from people who are from the Montclair area I decided to give this place a try. I would have to agree with the other posts on here that this place is nothing more than hype. I wouldn't be surprised if the good reviews that are on here are from relatives or friends of the owners. Â What a waste of a Saturday night! It was an over priced place with very bland food and small portions. I will not be eat there again!
