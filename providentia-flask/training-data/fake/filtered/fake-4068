I've been to Caseus a few times - the food is hit or miss. When it's good, it's really good. When it's bad, it's really bad. REALLY BAD. There doesn't seem to be a standard for consistency at all. The last time we went, our waitress, ( I think her name was Heidi) seemed very disinterested in being there although she was very knowledgable. Smile!!! I also have to say that I'm suprised by The owners response to Rebecca K's post. I've heard the same things as well - that they don't feed their employees. Come on, that's no way to treat the people who work so hard for you!!!!!
