I have to caveat this review because I feel like rustic italian seems to be the norm in the neighborhood these days. I love the charm of Peasant, and the cuteness of Epistrophy, but I'm starting to feel like there's so many rustic, vintage inspired Italian places like Gemma and Civetta. With that said I like the front area of the space near the windows, and it's a nice respite from the shopping. I don't like the back area as much, but I do think the space is quite comfortable. After heeding the advice of several friends, we ordered the margherita pizza, and unfortunately it was very disappointing. The crust was bland, and the cheese looked and tasted worse than what one could get at Ray's Pizza. It made the crust soggy, and a bit messy to eat. I thought that since the atmosphere was comfortable, we could just have some drinks. However, after sampling every red wine on the menu, I wouldn't say I would go back even for the atmosphere. Overall, I would come if other places in the neighborhood were packed, and maybe after they get an alcohol license rather than just beer and wine.
