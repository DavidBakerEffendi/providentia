I was surprised for my 'special' birthday with a reservation to go to Zahav by my hubby for al 3 of us, my husband, daughter and myself.  I must preface by saying our daughter has been there and has raved about it.  After looking at the menu, I have been really wanting to go for a very long time to have this fine dining experience. Last night I got to enjoy  this amazing establishment. It was every thing I dreamed of and more! Every morsel of our 9 plates we ordered were just terrific and bursting with flavor. Kudos to your entire staff......especially, Okan Yazici, who went above and beyond to make my dining experience that much more special for my 60th celebration! Also all of our desserts were incredible! Hope to see you again very soon !                                                            Fran S.
