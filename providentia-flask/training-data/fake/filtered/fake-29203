Way over priced. Over rated and not all that great over all. Their bread is old just toasted and served as if it's fresh. Ordered their lamb soup(shourpa) came with two pieces of lamb bones, for $7.50? Their rice pilaf is somewhat the only item that was just (OK) will never order again. I definitely do not recommend this place to anyone who is looking for quality.
