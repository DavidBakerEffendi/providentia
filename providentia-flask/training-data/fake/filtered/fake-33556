I have to say that we have loved New Socials from the first time we ate there never had a bad experience until last night. My husband and I made reservations to celebrate our anniversary when we arrived we were seated promptly but I was hoping because it was our anniversary we would get a nice quiet table but we did not! We ordered our food and although there was a little bit of a wait we were okay with that. My husband and I both had the ribs with fries. The ribs were cold and overcooked because we kept getting strands of bone marrow in every bite. The ribs were also placed right on top of the fries which we could not eat because they were all soggy. We made mention of this to our waitress (who was very polite) and she said she would let them know. She came back and told us she mentioned it to the kitchen staff and they would take it into consideration. She asked us if we were interested in dessert which I was but was not going to pay another dime there because they did not make good on anything not even a dessert on us considering it was our anniversary as well! One of our favorite appetizers was the crab Rangoon dip which they had changed and now put this sweet and sour sauce on top of it which was nasty. What use to be our favorite restaurant is not anymore and will not be going back anytime soon!
