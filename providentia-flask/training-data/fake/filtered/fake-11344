This is a great place that I read an article about it and decided I needed to try it. The neighborhood is a little run down , but that's because the fish market closed down in the area. Small place but I am going to say it "cute" place. Service was incredible and the everything we has was worth tring it again. Belive it or not it was also nice the next time I went to have a glass of wine outside and at the bar.
