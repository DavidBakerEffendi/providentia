This is a charming little neighborhood spot tucked into the side streets of Cobble Hill. We happened upon it while wandering around Saturday night and decided to stop in for a glass of wine and a snack. The service was friendly and knowledgable. I was a bit intimidated by the Italian wine list but the bartender knew the wines well and recommended a great bonarda? We tried a few of the bruscetta and split the pizza special. The pizza was a  little  small and but delicious.  I look forward to coming back and exploring more of the menu and trying some of the cocktails. They had surprisingly interesting looking cocktail list.
