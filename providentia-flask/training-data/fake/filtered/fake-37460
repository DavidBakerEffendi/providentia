Delicious sandwiches. Highly recommend the Bulgogi sandwich with friend egg. The place is also very neat although very small (if they switch the bigger tables for smaller ones they can probably utilize the space more.) Maybe make it a little bit more creative? It has lots of potential. I also like the fact that they have a bulletin board. Great for freelancers in the area looking to promote themselves! I would have given them 5 stars compared to what the rest of the area offers (Quickly and Elmhurst Pizza is another go-to for me) but they forgot to give me my free bubble tea after my fifth sandwich! I'm coming for you next time.
