This is the 4th time I have dined at this restaurant and it will be my last. The first time it was good but it has gone down hill everytime. Now it is at a point that I feel like it is a big rip off to spend money at this establishment. The last time I went I made reservations for 8 people. We arrived at the restaurant and all the windows and doors were opened instead of having the a/c on. It was muggy and in 70s. I told them to put the a/c on but it still didnt help. Next was the service. The guy (with tatoos up and down his arm) was nice but did not know the menu at all. Everytime I asked a question about the menu, he had to run away from the table to find the answer. this happened 5 times. we had to ask for bread. He did not clear the table until the next course was ready. In other words, the dirty salad plate was left in front of you for 20 minutes and then removed when he brought out the entree. This tells me the lack of training and limited management on the premises at the time. Â He brought out the wrong entree for my father and we had no choice but to accept it. what else are we going to do? 7 of us eat our food while my father waits? Also the food was just tasteless. We have eaten here before and noticed that the love is just not there anymore. For example, I ordered king crab legs and they brought it out to me in aluminum foil. Aluminum foil?? this is not some crabshack place. The desserts were horrendous. This should be somewhat fine dining and presented properly. We have spoken to friends who live in the area and they all felt the same. I want to contribute to local business but to spend $400 and not be satisfied with the basics just leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Not going back.
