Wonderful wonderful wonderful. We had a fantastic time at Eno Terra. The restaurant itself is beautiful. The atmosphere is a mix of upscale-rustic that works really, really well. Service was great -- our servers were attentive without being intrusive, warm, and knowledgeable. Here are some of the high points versus the low points of our visit: Pro's: - Wheelchair / Handicap Acessible: One of our party members is wheelchair bound, and there was not only parking for his specialized van, but room enough for him to maneuver within the restaurant with his large, motorized wheelchair. Bathrooms were also fully handicap-friendly. - Grilled Octopus: One of the best preparations of Octopus we've ever had - Wine List and Cocktails: The cocktails we had were delicious (Mint Juleps for the Kentucky Derby) and the wine we picked was both moderately priced and stupendous. Con's: (if you can even really call them that) - Portion size: Some of the dishes we ordered were very generously sized -- the risotto entree, the seafood stew -- while others -- Salmon entree, Tilefish entree -- were moderately sized pieces of protein with not much in the way of side dishes. I would have been fine with the protein being sized the way it was, but the scarcity of the promised vegetable accompaniment was a little surprising. - Dessert: Dessert was good-but-not-excellent. We got a wide variety. And while they were all enjoyable, none of them were knock-your-socks off, the way our appetizers were or even the way some of the flavors of the main courses were. - Noise Level: As the night wore on and the place filled up, it got increasingly loud and hard to hear. Overall: I would HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend Eno Terra to anyone. If I could give it 4.5/5 stars I would, but the rating only allows 4. For some of the above mentioned reasons I hesitate to give it a perfect '5', but for all intents and purposes it was a fantastic evening at a fantastic venue.
