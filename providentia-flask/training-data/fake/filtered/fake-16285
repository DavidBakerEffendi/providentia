I have lived in WH all my life and always ate at other chinese restaurants. My husband and I were sick of the grease and inconsistencies. We decided to try Sings. And OMG we had no idea what we were missing all this time!!!  Food was amazing and DELICIOUS.  Best Chinese food in West Haven. Definitely our new pla e to go
