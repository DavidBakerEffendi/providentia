I've been a fan of Bella's for years now!  Besides the fact that I met my husband there :), I LOVE their weekend brunch menu.  The best brunch around for miles!  Bella's has something fabulous for those with a sweet tooth and amazing choices for the savory lovers.  Heck, why not get both?  That's what I do!
