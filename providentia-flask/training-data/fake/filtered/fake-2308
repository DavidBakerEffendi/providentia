Truly impressed with the food and service. the cocktails are awesome. we had a basil one and a bourbon infused with bacon. as far as the food the mussels were huge and so good. steak frites was the best I had in a long time and the tarte tatin with creme fraiche ice cream was soooo gooood. this is my go to french place from now on.
