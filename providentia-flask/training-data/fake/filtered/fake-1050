Celebrating the completion of my husband's engineering degree at the Canoe Club was a relaxing and delicious experience. Our courses were timed perfectly. We enjoyed every bite of our meal. The wine list suited our needs. One of the best aspects of the night was sitting next to the pianist, a talented musician who created a fantastic atmosphere.
