Thank you very much for the wonderful lunch that you catered yesterday for our Office staff in Bridgewater. Everyone I talked to LOVED the food. One of the Indian physicians said that, of all the catered events she's ever attended, yours had the best selection. And several folks commented on the mouth watering Paneer Tikka and the yummy Dessert- Mango Shrikhand - to die for!! Thank you
