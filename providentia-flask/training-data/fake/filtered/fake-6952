I have now been here twice, and all I can say is to STAY AWAY. I went on the opening weekend and the service was terrible. They mixed up orders, forgot some food, and it was so so at best. I gave them the benefit of the doubt, and figured it was just opening jitters. So I went back again last night, and it was a HUGE mistake. Their food is just not special at all. Everything is bland, and lacks seasoning. I was served loaded potato skins on old dead lettuce, and nothing else. I had to ask for sour cream, and the plating just looked pathetic. The hamburgers had zero seasoning, and they mixed up how they were supposed to be cooked. The fries had zero seasoning as well. The buffalo wings are mediocre at best, and just have a very simple buffalo sauce on them. The only positive this time was that our waiter was very helpful, and pretty much apologized for the food being terrible. That was a nice step in the direction service wise. If you are looking for something cheaper its an okay place, but you aren't even getting what you pay for. I'd rather go to any other place in town.
