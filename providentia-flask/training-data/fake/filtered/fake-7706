Living in the city, it's difficult to find affordable Italian restaurants that provide a combination of great food and ambiance.  Since the first time I tried Zavino, I can say that it has become one of the more regular places I go to eat.  I appreciate the tapas style because I can sample a lot of different things during the same meal. The specials are always great and the dining area is set up to be very private.  Service is always great too and I've never had to wait longer than 15 minutes for a table. I'd recommend Zavino to anyone looking for a great Italian dining experience.
