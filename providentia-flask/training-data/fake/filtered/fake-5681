All I can say is that Penang is OUTSTANDING! I can't name a food here that I don't like. First of all, it is always packed: it's popular with people who live both within the city and outside. There are a ton of possible options for dinner in Philadelphia's Chinatown, but this one is in the top 2 or 3 without a doubt. To start off, the Indian pancakes with the curry sauce is a great pick. For the meal, which is normally family style, I absolutely recommend the curry chicken, peaking duck, the seafood lo mien, and for your vegetable, the watercress with garlic sauce. Also, if you're a soup fan, I recommend the wonton me (one of the best soup and noodle combos I've ever tasted). White or brown rice comes with most of the dishes, so you'll have plenty of that. I recommend going to Penang if you have a big group to go out with, because then you get to taste all of the different sauces and spices and flavors of this Cambodian-Malaysian hybrid. If you're in Philadelphia on a trip or are just spending a night in the city, I DEFINITELY recommend Penang.
