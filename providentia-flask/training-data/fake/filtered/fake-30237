Newington Center has always had some trouble drawing in people but GoldBurgers has done much on its own to change that.  This place is great.  My wife and I always take our families when they visit from out of state.  They all love it.  Once. her sister came up late on a Friday night and was so disappointed that we had already eaten at GoldBurgers, we called in an order and went back a second time.   We also went back on Saturday for lunch. Goldburgers is consistently awesome.  They also have a great handmade veggie burger so the vegetarians don't get left out.  You can customize it however you want to get the full GoldBurgers experience.  I have taken my parents, in-laws, brother, friends from out of state, and they have always had a great time.  Its nice to have a local place that makes such high quality food!
