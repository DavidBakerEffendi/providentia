I went with the reviews on this one and hoped for awesome mexican food and I was WRONG. Something with this brooklyn mexican food is so plain and lacking condiments. There is too much cilantro on the tacos, no sour scream, no guac, no cheese, the meat doesn't taste good and the rice was even bad. How can you mess up rice? My tortilla chips were as hard as a rock and I am not even exaggerating. I ordered chips with guac too hoping for that authentic guac taste. So the guac tasted fine, not great but fine. But the chips ruined it. Get some fresh chips people!!!! It was expensive and I felt bad after the meal. I live in Sunset Park and was told they have the best mexican food but I don't agree at all. This is not the first place I tried. For me to live in such an ethnic neighborhood and feel chipotle tastes better is just plain SAD. Also with fajitas I expect sour cream, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and guac on the side to fix up my fajitas with. All I got was shells and 2 tiny green sauce tubes and 1 red and the green hot sauce is disgusting. I threw away their menu here and I will not order again.
