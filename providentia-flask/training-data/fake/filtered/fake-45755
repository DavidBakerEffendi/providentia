My advice: Eat in and don't order the sandwiches I ordered the fresh mozzarella, vine ripened tomato and fresh basil panini. I thought that it was bland though the bread was decent. The fries had foreign, non-potato substances in them. My friend ordered an American hoagie - no ham. It came with ham. We ordered delivery so after we discovered the errors and gross fries there wasn't anything we could do about it. I will not be dining there again
