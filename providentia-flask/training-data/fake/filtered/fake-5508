The best place to have lunch in Astoria. Its fresh and reasonable and it has great atmosphere. It has a great menu. I love going to this place I know I am getting excellent quality food and a unique menu that I crave. My favorites are : CROSTINI: the rosemary infused something with basil and the truffle egg salad and speck. There are two great SALAD the shredded carrot and the beet,goat cheese. I have been here a million times & love these items so much I start craving them before I get there and have yet to try something new. Great old fashion service. The place is run right!!! I love the owner, thank you for making me a little happier! MAPLE MILK &COFFEE ARE RELIABLY GREAT !!!
