I have found my new Ikea trip meal, and it does not involve meatballs or daim cake... Hallelujah I can finally eat lobster rolls somewhere on the east coast now. I know you weirdos do them with mayonnaise over here, but that is just WRONG. It is also a violation of the rights of all lobster as they prefer to be eaten with butter. I have it on high authority. As such the lobster pound with their Connecticut style lobster roll have made hommage that you can be proud to eat. And that is before we talk about their rolls... They were reasonably priced (especially if you got the blackboard eats deal!), and seriously what is not to like about butter, lobster and roll?? Come summer time I see lobster roll runs (yes like running there and back) in my future!
