I love the interior of this restaurant.  It's bustling but still manages to feel like you're in someone's chic but down-to-earth, beige-themed west village townhouse.  It's very busy during weekend brunch time. The food is awesome, the menu is well priced and the service is very friendly. My only complaint is that the bloody Mary's are amazing but they're a little small and a little overpriced (12 bones a pop) - it is the West Village after all... Try the breakfast sandwich, poached eggs, and Grapefruit Brule. Would definitely recommend to others and go back for more!
