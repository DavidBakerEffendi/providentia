Stumbled across El Almacen after a recent haircut in W-burg.  This place is just 3 weeks new and sure to be a neighborhood hit right off the No 7th drag,   So happy to have found this cute little Argentine Bistro.  Reminicent of dining in your old world grandmothers kitchen. Super friendly staff.  They dont have a liquor license yet, so running it speakeasy style of BYOB in water glasses.   We had: Empanadas....yum Spinach and Beet salad with almonds...delish Rabas(super crunchy fried calamari)....some of the best calamari I've had and I've had lots and lots Pork Asado...super tender pork with black beans, jalapeno and mango salsa.....soooooo good in my belly! Now Go!!
