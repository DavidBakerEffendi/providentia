This is our new favorite sushi joint!! The entire staff here is amazing!  My fiancé and I went here for dinner tonight and had the most amazing meal!! We had the kimchee fries app, and they hit the spot! I was a little hesitate at first to order them bc I didn't want to get fries when I was trying to have a nice light, low carb dinner, but boy was I impressed! Then we got the Ten Street Roll, Temple Roll, the Rittenhouse Roll, and another roll that we kind of created on our own! Creating your own roll doesn't usually fly in a sushi restaurant, but not only did they not mind us creating it they joked about it being "our roll!" Everything was amazing, fish was fresh, each roll has the perfect balance of fish, crunch, and creaminess!! The owner/chef Hendra is the nicest gentleman, he came to our table and shared several stories with us about his life and about his experiences in the restaurant business! It truly was a great spot and we really enjoyed meeting him! Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu! -Scott & Courtney
