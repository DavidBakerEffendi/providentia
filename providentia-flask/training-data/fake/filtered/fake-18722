This place is nothing short of amazing.  I have been for dinner a couple of times, and have come in the afternoon and sat at the bar for lunch.  It doesn't matter where you sit or what you eat or drink, it is nothing short of perfect.  The quality of the food and drink is diverse and second to none.  The service goes beyond both pleasant and knowledgeable to almost transcendent. The people there are friendly and know what they're talking about, but also have a way of moving and carrying themselves as though it is a true performance.  I highly recommend coming here.  It is a world class experience, but without the pain of a pomp and circumstance that otherwise might make it stuffy.
