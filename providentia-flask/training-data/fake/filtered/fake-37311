Having recently moved to Philly, I have to say that Sidecar is a great place for anyone to check out. Got dinner there once right after I found a place in the area and had a really good time. The food is great, decent selection of beers and friendly staff. The only not so great thing about the place is the size. It was pretty packed even on a Wednesday night, so I had to wait for a table. Fortunately in roughly 5 weeks the bar will expand to the second floor, so lack of room will not be an issue :). Will definitely be coming back!
