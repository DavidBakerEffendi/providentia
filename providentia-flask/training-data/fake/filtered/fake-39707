The latest iteration of the Oyster House is a little edgy, modern, inviting and just a little evocative of the seaside. Owner Sam is unassumingly welcoming at the door, and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the food, specifically, oysters. My friend and I sat at the bar and had pemaquid and skookum oysters, the former eastern and the latter northwestern. Both were perfectly chilled, fresh, lively and different enough to provide a lovely contrast. The diverse crowd included an all-age, all-race demographic, add a great beer selection and decent music and the effect is welcoming, interesting and entertaining. I recommend this place without reservation. Try it.
