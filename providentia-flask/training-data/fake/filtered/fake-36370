Went here after a musical on a weeknight, late, place was still packed but only had to wait briefly (plus there was a glass of wine in my hand before i even thought to ask for one). Everyone working that evening was authentically French and/or authentically wonderful. Dishes were delicious. Wine displayed interestingly on a chalkboard by region. Definitely would get the streak tartare and the prosciutto tartinette (?) again. Would maybe skip the brussel sprouts, not because they weren't great, but only because I would opt for something more unique to Buvette next time. Apple tart - rustic and not too sweet. Go with someone who is down to try new things and share all of the plates. Summary: I wish I was at Buvette right now.
