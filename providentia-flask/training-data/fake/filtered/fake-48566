great middle eastern food. everything's good, the salads, lamb sandwich, homemade Zaatar Bread and DELICIOUS Vegetable Pitza. When you first enter the oven and working counters are up front almost like a pizza place but then it opens up to a nice dining area. Just wish they'd redo the bathroom which is in desperate need of renovation. But its one of the best middle eastern restaurants around here.
