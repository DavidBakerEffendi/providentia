OMG yuummmmmm! Recently I feel like chicken and rice has become a huge thing. When I finally tried chicken and rice at this 53rd and 6th halal cart I understood why. For $6 you get a heaping plate of food that includes rice, chicken or lamb, pita bread and lettuce. What really makes the dish is the sauce! Sauce sauce sauce! Make sure you are generous with the white sauce. If you like some spice add the red sauce, but be very careful because a little goes a long way. I don't live in NY so when I get chicken and rice cravings I go crazy... There's usually always a long line no matter what time of day you go, but it moves pretty fast so just be patient and wait. Someone please express mail me some chicken and rice!
