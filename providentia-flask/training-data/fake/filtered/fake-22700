There are few restaurants I'm willing to wait in line for and this is one of them! I've only been to the Brooklyn location and usually Brooklyn restaurants are easier to get into but everytime I've gone here the place is packed! My favorite dishes here are actually the SALADS-they have a great fennel salad as well as a brussel sprout salad, you can really taste the freshness. Of course the entrees are delicious as well!
