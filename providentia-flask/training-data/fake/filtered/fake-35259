Going to Gaia is like going to your mom's Italian kitchen.  All of Gaia's food is amazing- and I'm really picky.  Gaia herself is lovely, and always takes the time to ask how you are, etc.  Everything is fresh, wholesome, and delicious.  i have tried two salads ($7)--both of the dressings were lip-smacking- and the greens were fresh.  She makes her own bread for the sandwiches.  All of the sandwiches are tasty.  My favorite is the Milanese ($5).  The white lasagna with pesto was out of control ($5).  It tasted like fresh, homemade ricotta.  Now let's discuss the baked goods.  Biting into one of them transports you back in time, away from any stress you may temporarily be experiencing- and puts you right in Italy.  Her desserts are not too sweet- which, sometimes can be the case.  Finally, the prices.  This place is a steal.  You absolutely can't go wrong here.  You will be running back for more.  The only downside that I can think of is that can be slow at times.  But, that is kind of the charm of it...
