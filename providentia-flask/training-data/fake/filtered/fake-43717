Love love love Five Leaves. Great early in the morning for coffee/breakfast and in the evening for dinner. Everyone who works there is super friendly and the place is beautiful. Some of my favorite things to get are: the Sticky Date Pudding , Beet Ravioli and the Fried Oysters. So happy to have found it!
