MALAGUETA [it ought to be in capital letters] is the best Brazilian restaurant in New York City. I have tried every single item of its menu and they are all superb. Herbert is a gifted Chef and a gentleman. As I work in the restaurant business I have recommended it to a variety of people from all corners of the world and they all praise the restaurant for the excellence of its food and its delightful ambiance.
