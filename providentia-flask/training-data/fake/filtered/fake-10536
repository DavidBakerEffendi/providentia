I went to this restaurant with a buddy of mine a few weeks ago...coming from Korean ethnicity, I know a little bit about Korean food...been to a bunch in New Jersey, NYC, and Seoul (the Korean city, NOT this restaurant)...by far and away this was the worst and most disappointing...where do I start? 1) VERY OVERPRICED: the $40 bulgogi meal for 2 was seriously for one person...literally a handful of bulgogi with two small heaps of rice...I could literally get the EXACT same amount in the H-Mart food court in Hartsdale, NY for $9 or $10 with similar quality...other restaurants I've been to at Palisades Park, Flushing, NYC, etc. gave significantly bigger amounts for similar prices...this restaurant probably figures people who are not too familiar with Korean food won't know the difference and figure people are willing to pay the price for it since extreme scarcity of Korean restaurants in CT...as a CT resident, I will NOT be going here again. I also like (and I mean this sarcastically) the way the "Ajumah" (those that know the language knows what I'm talking about) kept trying to sell me the $50 Kalbi for two instead of the $40 Bulgogi for two because "it is a more healthy & satisfying dish". 2) EVEN THE SIDEDISHES WERE DISAPPOINTING: they gave 3 pieces of kimchee for a meal of two...need I say more? 3) QUALITY: the food itself was not bad nor was it that great...actually hard to ascertain how good/enjoyable the food was when there was such little of it to eat in the first place. 4) SERVICE: not the most important category here as long as they are not rude, which they weren't...however, after giving us the bulgogi, they pretty much ignored us till we asked for our check, though...my water was never filled and left empty all the way till check time..could not necessarily ask for more water when they were not around for me to flag down 5) OPTIONS: to get decent Korean food and decent prices, there are no other options for CT residents other than NYC (a bunch there, especially in Koreatown) & New Jersey...few half-decent ones in Hartford, CT & the Edo restaurant in Norwalk gives you a little more for the same price but nothing to write home about. I'm writing this review because it's important that people get decent value & service for their money and I don't want people thinking this over-priced Korean restaurant represents what all Korean restaurants are like, because there are some truly phenomenal ones in NJ and NYC. I usually try Korean restaurants out before I decide to bring my Korean wife (who is picky about Korean restaurants) and well, even my non-Korean buddy said two-thumbs down.
