The new Paesano's in the Italian Market will be open this Wednesday on 9th and Christian.  Heard this location will be adding more sandwiches to the menu, have seating for 40 plus and might even be open on Sundays.  So now I have more sandwiches to try, not wait in the cold and get a sandwich 6 days a week. WOO freakin HOO
