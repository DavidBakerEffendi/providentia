I have been going to Cuba for YEARS now, and figured it was time for a review. Cuba is an experience complete with live music, cigar rolling and fun atmosphere.  The food is consistently excellent - and the specials add a unique seasonal variety.  Clearly I've kept coming back and its been great for groups, drinks, all of the above - the only compliant is the service can be lacking and reservations are not consistently kept ie - make a res for 8:30 on sat.. you can be waiting till 9:00.... but with the mojitos flowing, you may not even notice.
