Was hoping for so much more but was disappointed. Sat at the bar in the far corner to have a drink before the rest of our party arrived.  I had to ask for a stirrer for my cocktail. Could not hear my partner speak, as it was very loud.  Great to see 4 bartenders working on a Saturday night but they were stepping all over each other.  Our bartender came right up to us and proceeded to cut a lemon slice with a butter knife, using no cutting board...using his hand to peel the flesh from the rind.  It grossed us out a bit...why were there twists already prepared...why did he come down to us.....we opted for NO twist on our next round...yuk! Hostess never told us our party arrived, even though we told her we were the first to arrive and to come and get us.  The rest of the party was seated at the table in the back of the room.  We were the first to arrive and last to be seated!   We were surrounded by children....some crying, some laying down on the banquets with the pillows all over the floor.  Lights were hung so low that we all hit them.....most had bulbs missing and one didn't even have the beaded shade on it or the bulb.  It was hot near the window of the kitchen.  And so LOUD.  Could hardly speak  to the other guests. The waiter was good, he hustled and was pleasant but water was not refilled, ever!  Silverware was missing and we had to ask for it.  The food was ok....but I was distracted by chipped plates large portions of the pasta, mac and cheese and cold fries served in cute wire baskets. Oh, and my not so hot tea was $3.25 and was just run of the mill "Bromley".  What a rip off.  We paid over 125 per couple and I don't think we got our monies worth.  Will not be running back anytime soon.   We were in not in NYC or Philly....I expected so much more.
