This cozy Thai spot is on another level from the rest in New Haven. Its very refined, wholesome and yummy! It's not your typical Thai place around here where it's doused in sauce to make a quick sale, when you see how vibrant the vegetables are and the goodness of the ingredients, and hot damn the spicy soups are like therapy! I kind of want to keep this place a secret but I want this place to thrive more. (Try the coconut custard with sticky rice for dessert!)
