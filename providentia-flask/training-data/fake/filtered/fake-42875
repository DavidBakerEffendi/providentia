i will say this is a hidden gem in montclair..having lived near montclair for about 2 years, never heard about this place... got invitation from a friend on lunch and had nice experience.... interior was good if you compare to other indian restaurants :) went for lunch so i was thinking of getting buffet but they said they dont keep buffet..... but they offer vegetarian/chicken/lamb lunch which didnt sound good but had to chose something so chose vegetarian lunch... and let me tell you it was delicious!!! you had to chose 2 veg entree and that was awesome.... better than stale buffet food, they make it for you fresh!! even if you are 2 person you can choose 4 different dishes and can taste all!!! the staff was good and helpful. naan was of good quality too...lunch also include fresh pakoras, salad, pudding, papadum, rice and it was just 8.99!!!!!! i highly recommend this place...enjoy
