Great Thai food and definitely worth the trek if you want the real deal Thai! I'm not a big seafood eater so my options are a but limited here but I still always get something new and yummy.  The papaya salad is amazing BUT be careful about asking for it spicy unless you actually want it really spicy.  No gringo-fication of spices here folks they give it to you the way it should be. They also sell some desserts and other delicious goods in the freezers by the front.  Take some home with you! If you go for dinner on weekends be ready for a wait.  I try to go early so I'm not stuck staring at everyone eating their delicious food.
