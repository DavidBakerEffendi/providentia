After all the positive reviews, we gave it a shot, and were underwhelmed.  The salmon dish was tasteless, the chicken equally boring.  Burger very dry.  Overall, the food is unimaginative and bland.  There are just a few vegetarian options. EXTREMELY LOUD dining room, we had to shout (over tasteless and loud music) to speak with one another. Worst of all, the meals took over an hour to arrive.
