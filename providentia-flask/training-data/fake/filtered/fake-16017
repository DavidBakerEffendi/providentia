Cute decor, very sweet and friendly staff, BUT food was ridiculously OVERPRICED. Not the best food I have ever tried (and I am Ukrainian myself). Van'ka Vstan'ka in Brooklyn is so much better! I understand that location forces management to charge crazy prices per tiny appetizers, but you need to be reasonable! Also be aware that your tips will be INCLUDED in your bill. Not 10, not 15%. Pay all 20%!!!!! I think that was little bit too much! I always tip, sometimes even more than 20%, but that "addition" to my food bill, left me speechless! Who said that I was obligated to tip at all?! Sorry guys, don't be that greedy next time!
