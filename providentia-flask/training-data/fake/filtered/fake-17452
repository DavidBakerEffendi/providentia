This was out third visit to The Abbaye for Sunday Brunch.  It is the best one we have ever been to.  My husband being an Executive Chef does not usually spend his one day off sitting in other restaurants.  But all he talked about for the whole week before we went was he was getting the Texas eggs benedict.  It did not disappoint.  We took some other family members with us this time as they had never been.  They also loved it.  The restaurant is in a nice section of Northern Liberties, It has a real neighborhood feel about it and also caters to veggans and veggies.  The food is the best we have had in a long time.  They also have the most extensive off the wall beer brands we have ever heard of.  So next time your looking for a great brunch at a great price head down to The Abbaye.   Thank you for making my birthday special.
