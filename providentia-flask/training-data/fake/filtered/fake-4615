We chose this Spanish restaurant mainly because of longing for food from last year's trip to Barcelona.   Salinas didn't disappoint, although the food wasn't entirely what I expected.   It was good, no question, just some of the descriptives in the menu didn't exactly match the dish.  Still, everyone at our table (4) enjoyed the food very much. The Chef made a point to visit the table and ask how things tasted, which is a big plus in my mind.    My biggest complaint was that one of the appetizers never made it to the table yet showed on the bill.   The waiter, red-faced, took it off without issue but it still should have been noticed. Salinas is popular...very crowded on a Thursday evening with no special events in town!   Book early.
