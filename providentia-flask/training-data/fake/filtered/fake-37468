You gotta have the crab BLT with avocado. It's sufreakingpurb. All the parts come together perfectly with the bread and $2 sides. I'm tempted to get one of their crab taco sauces in it next time like the lemon aoli or wasabi mayo. Nice owner Fifi and good chowder and buttery crab rolls too. Already naming the next visit.
