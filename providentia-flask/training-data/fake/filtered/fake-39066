I was so disappointed with Basso 56. It was one of my worst restaurant experience in NYC for the last 7 years. I've been to many good italian restaurants in NYC. I went to Basso56, based on good reviews, but there was nothing special at all, actually much worse than Diner. The food tasted like frozen food, and server was rude and snobby. I ordered Mista dela casa as appetizer. This salad was not fresh and dressing was too greasy. The Filet Mignon was overcooked and dry. My boyfrined's home-made pasta was soggy and salty. I and my boyfriend regreted going to Basso56 and we don't want other people to waste money. I would go to much nicer restaurant with the same amount of money. I can't understand how Basso 56 got these good reviews. I highly recommend not to go this restaurant.
