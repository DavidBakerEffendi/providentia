Marrakesh is a hidden gem located in an alley off of South street. You wouldn't know it was there unless someone told you about it. A seven course meal consisting of fresh fruits, chicken, foreign salads, baklava, mint tea, and a kebab entree will leave your stomach so full you won't be able to move. The atmosphere is cool and it's a great place to take your friends or family. I would tell you more but you should go there to experience it yourself
