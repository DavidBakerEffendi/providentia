I live in Iselin and knows all the restaurants around this place.  I use to drive by Urban spice number of times but never had been there.  On account of my job, I travel a lot both in US and International and a restaurant geek.  Today, after watching a movie I thought I will check Urban Spice and let me tell you it is a sub-standard hyped up restaurant.  I walked in at 9 pm and had to wait for 10 min.  There was no usher and I went inside and asked someone to give me a table. I was seated after 15 mins.  I ordered two glasses of house wine,  Murg Dum biriyani, Vegetable Kadai and a Chicken entree. Inspite of my wait,  I would have given good rating if the food was reasonably good ins but let me tell you,  the food was abysmally of  poor quality.  I paid around 77 $ and left very disappointed.   I would never go there again.
