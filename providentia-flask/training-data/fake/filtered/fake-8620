The roast pork italiano pizza is amazing! However, when I ordered it by mistake they gave me an italiano pizza.  I called and explained it may be my fault since I called on a cell.  They said they would fix it.  After a few minutes they called me back to make me feel stupid saying "Well its a big difference".  "No kidding genius that's why I was upset and now I'm just agitated" I thought to myself.  Nice right? When my boyfriend went to pick up the correct pizza and just say "no hard feelings" the guy at the counter said "yeah yeah yeah I'm busy".  My boyfriend looked around and saw no one but the whole staff hanging out upfront. If that's how you treat people that order there 1-2 times a week ... I'm good.  South Philly has plenty other places that wont talk to you as if you have no self worth.  I'm posting this on all my networking websites.
