If you are a vegetarian and you travel north to a ski resort or live in the area - this is the place to make a stop. It's a grocery with a little kitchen at the back - clean and neat. Just one table. But wow! it's a real paradise for Indian food lovers with incredible prises ($1.99 -3.99), huge portions of home made Indian delicatessen from a great cook - wife of the grocery shop owner. My wife and I were so happy we took the wrong exit  (42) from route 95 in the attempt to find something edible at 9 pm on the way from JFK that night. They said If we call them in advance  they will make any special order for us. Thus, an enormous container of biryani that holds two regular portions will only cost $8!  We will definitely plan a trip there just to enjoy our favorite food at incredible prises and to see these wonderful people again.
