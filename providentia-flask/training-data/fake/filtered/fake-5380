Probably the best Chinese food I have ever had. The owner, Tony, makes his sesame chicken and general tso's chicken with full pieces of white meat chicken, not mystery meat covered in breading goop. I usually stop by when I am in the area for work, I only wish I lived closer as he puts my local Chinese food restaurant to shame.
