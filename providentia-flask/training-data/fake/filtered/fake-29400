My wife and I had a very nice meal there. Oops, that is not quite right. We had a great meal there! We loved everything we ate. The service was personal, friendly, and very helpful. Although it was a bit busy, our server took the time to answer our questions and made some great suggestions! Other establishments could and should learn from their example. We will absolutely be back!
