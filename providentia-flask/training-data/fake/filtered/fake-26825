Okay, let's talk tacos. When was the last time you had a taco that took less then 1 minute to make and actually tasted delicious? I know for me it had been a while until I tried Dos Toros Taqueria in Union Square. These tacos are beast. One bite into the chicken taco with additional hot sauce and my mind is forever blown. If you haven't been here before, you must go.
