Last night we (a party of 5) dined at Casa Mono. We were utterly surprised to have such a bad experience. After settling in to our table, we began to order a bottle of "House red wine" and  a round of tapas to get the dinner started.  This is a Spanish restaurant, and my husband is a native of Galicia, Spain, and so we couldn't think of a nicer way to start a family dinner. The waitress told us that the chef would not accept a partial order and that we needed to decide on the Main dishes. Really? What restaurant in Spain would ever do that?  I was  embarrassed and upset, considering we wanted to start feeding  my 82 year old father, and we wanted to enjoy several rounds of scrumptious Spanish food. During the course of the meal, all the staff brushed up against my father, because the restaurant is TINY.He tried to pull in his chair, but after a few too many "bumps" without an apology, he gave up and felt there was a lack of courtesy extended to him by the passing waiters. Lastly, the bill came and I was truly surprised that we were charged $60.00 for the "house red wine."  We felt that was excessive and when I asked the waitress why it was so expensive, she remarked "it's the cheapest bottle we have."  If that is the case, and I am surprised to hear it, we would have greatly appreciated to have been told the price for the "house" wine beforehand. We are seasoned diners to know that this should have been pointed out.   We would have ordered the wine anyway. So, we left without enjoying our final round of food - desserts and coffees. Sadly, this isn't the experience of a "Mario Batali restaurant" we had come to expect -
