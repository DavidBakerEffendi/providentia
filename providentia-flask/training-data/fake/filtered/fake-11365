This place is an ingenious eatery. The food, the aromas, the service, the selection, the ideas, the concept are pure food heaven! I had "to die for" Cannelloni's at Le Verdue restaurant within Eataly which was excellent. I can't wait for my next trip to New York City (or Chicago) to visit again. I hope they expand this concept nationwide beginning in Denver! You'll love this place!
