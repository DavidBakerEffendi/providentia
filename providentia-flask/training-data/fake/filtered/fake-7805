I've seen the negatives reviews listed here on Yelp - and had to give my opinion.  Geronimo's is GREAT!  If you are in the New Haven area - and looking for a restaurant which has great food,  amazing drinks and a fun, trendy atmosphere ---- Geronimo's is  MUST!  I grew up in Connecticut, and now live in California.  Whenever, I am visiting family and friends back in New Haven - I always stop at Geronimo's for dinner at least once during my visits.   The staff is ALWAYS professional and accommodating, on the weekends --- It can get noisy.  However people ---- ITS A BAR! If you are looking for quiet place on a weekend night --- you should probably head to Starbucks, not a place that is located on Crown Street in New Haven.  And.... every time I go there, the food is AMAZING!   I will admit that I am spolied with some amazing southwestern food here on the west coast. However, Geronimo's never disappoints --- Amazing food every time I'm there!!! Can't wait to get to Geronimo's in Fairfield during my next visit to the east coast!!
