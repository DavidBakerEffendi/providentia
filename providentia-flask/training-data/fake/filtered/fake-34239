Easy to sum up: Pretentious, terribly curt service, incredible fish.  The decor is beautiful but like the rest of the experience, sterile. Not a "fun" experience, and not for big groups, but the fish and the rice is the best I've had.  I didn't venture to try the cooked dishes (I think the eel backbone is supposed to be great).   Full disclosure, I haven't been there since Yasuda left.   If you're looking for something more relaxed and less pretentious with excellent fish, do Gari or Seki.  Kanoyama and Sushi Azabu downtown are also excellent.  If you want something less expensive with many types of fish, I like Blue Ribbon at Columbus Circle (though the rice and service can be variable).  If you're a tourist and want something trendy, go somewhere big and exciting and fusiony with a bar like Morimoto or Nobu.
