Good, but not great. Would I come back again? Possibly, but it would mainly be for the brunch menu. I ordered the Middle Eastern Eggs, and I have to say, they were pretty good but nothing too exciting. The environment of this place is really great. It's quaint, the location is good, and I appreciated the interior decorations. However, I had a bad experience with the server. She was very strange, rarely came Â to the table, spoke very quietly, and she really rushed my friend and I to pay our bill. My three-star rating is completely based on the food. Not my whole experience. It's definitely a place to try but I'm not sure if I would want to go back anytime soon.
