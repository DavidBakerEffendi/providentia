Went with my parents for Friday night dinner. My mom had a Living Social deal that had expired a few days before. Yes, her fault for letting it expire, but we thought we would give it a try anyway. The place was completely empty. EMPTY. They would not let us use the expired Living Social deal, so we left. I don't think it was smart of them to turn us away when their restaurant was EMPTY. We will not be going back.
