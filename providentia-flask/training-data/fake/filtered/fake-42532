New Year's eve at the Moshulu....... NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!  The food, while well presented, was mediocre at best. Our server was congenial but was unable to serve appropriately because of the back ups in the kitchen, at the bar, and apparently at the coffee pot. I had researched the website, called and spoke to them personally, and had been promised an evening to remember. We had been promised Deckside dancing in heated tents. There were no tents per se, it was freezing, and the music was practically nonexistent. It will not surprise you to read that there was no energy up there on the dance floor. All you had to do was walk upstairs, see what was in store for you, and you walked right back down. The bathrooms were crowded, messy, and also freezing.  It is sad to say the only thing superlative about my night at the Moshulu was how much they charged me.
