Where do I begin to express my gratitude! Since the day I called to locked in the date for our Engagement Dinner everyone was really attentive, especially Lance the restaurant manager.  I would describe myself as a very detailed oriented person.  Lance was very friendly and cooperative and answered all the inquiries I had leading up to our big day.  Our dinner took place in the private room in the rear of the venue.  A few days leading up to our dinner, my fiancé and I encountered some car trouble and were stranded Upstate NY, we had to rent a car and run a bunch of errands. Day of the dinner, I was exhausted and running late, of course! What else can go bad.  As our guest patiently waited for us to arrive, I texted Lance, explaining that my fiancé and I were late and exhausted and were not in the mood for celebrating.  He kept me calm as we pulled up to valet.  He asked to speak to the Valet Attendant, they validated our parking and he let us enjoy the private room for the entire evening!!!!  All of our worries were immediately blown away! The wait staff and manager on-site welcomed us with comp shots and made us feel at ease.  We were ready to celebrate! Our guest raved about the view, service and most importantly the food and cocktails! Our menus were personalized and our waiter was so personable and friendly.  I had the pernil and my fiancé had the salmon, we could have licked the plates! I am forever grateful for Lance and his staff at Blend on the Water! I look forward to visiting again soon! Thank you so much Lance for making our Engagement Dinner so memorable! -Tenelle
