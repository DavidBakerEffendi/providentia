I visited Enoteca Maria and the first issue that I noticed was the awful wait time. I was schedule for a 9PM reservation but I was not admitted until 10:25PM. This put an immediate bad taste in my mouth. We were shoved into the corner of the restaurant at a table in front of the wine rack that forced one of our guests to move each time they needed to access said rack. After finally getting our food, we were very pleased with the experience. The waiter was very friendly and accommodating and there was an excellent menu. The appetizers and food were both excellent and I would definitely go again, albeit the awful wait time.
