Recently, I was asked to plan a very special surprise birthday dinner party for a very special lady. I knew I chose the perfect place from my first inquiry. I met with Jordanna, the Capital Grille sales manager, who could not have been more gracious and knowledgeable.  She customized the menu for our group of more than 20, so that  everyone would have many delicious choices.  The room was most attractive, and the waitstaff, Martha and Mark, were professional and efficient.  They anticipated our every need and made certain the party flowed seamlessly. The manager, Lee, was most welcoming...and a surprise visit to the birthday gal from Chef Nick was great fun. The food was beautifully presented, and the whole experience was as good as it gets. Don't wait for your next "special occasion" to dine at the Capital Grille.....life is too short !
