I go to Marco Polo pretty much every day. When I'm in a rush, I usually just order a couple of pizza slices to go, and those ought to be the largest, tastiest slices I've ever had. However, when I have some extra time, I go for the pasta. For some reason, not a lot of people know about their pasta. But as someone who's lived in New Haven for over five years and has been to every restaurant here, I can say that this is the best pasta in town. What I like about Marco Polo is not only the quality of the food, but the diversity. There are like 12 different pasta options you can pick from. I've tried them all, and they're absolutely amazing.
