My friend and I tried the hotpot only, but we will come back for hotpot and korean bbq soon. The price was reasonable , the hotpot was great. I am usually picky on the cleanliness, it was comfortable enough for me to stay. The service was great! The waitstaff made sure the A/C was on the right temp for us. I hope this restaurant will continue the level of food quality and service, i highly recommend this restaurant to all!
