My new favorite neighborhood bar.  The atmosphere is really cool: the fish tank is mesmerizing and I cannot wait to hang out back in the garden once the weather warms.  Amazing food, the burger is so tasty and the pork sandwich is crispily perfect.  And a clam roll!!  The selection of beers is pretty staggering.  This place knows their stuff.
