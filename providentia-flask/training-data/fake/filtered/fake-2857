cannot offer honest review of food or service. booked a room for a surprise party.  when we tried to arrange a menu we were told the room wasn't guaranteed and we may have to settle for a large table in the main dining area. we offered to pay for the minimum amount of guests although we were 7 guests short. the catering manager still wouldn't cooperate and after a heated discussion she hung up on her client. the catering manager called later and left a message suggesting we go elsewhere. very unprofessional. if she booked two parties for the same room at least have the respect & courtesy to tell the truth.  will never do business with them again.
