This bar isn't what it used to be when it first opened up.  They have raised their prices, and stopped doing buy backs.  I feel it's a bar too caught up trying hard to be something.  Its always jam packed with hipsters and you can never get a seat at the bar.  The food used to be amazing when PJ was back there in the kitchen running the show, now it seems it has fallen off a bit. This bar to me now is MAYBE a brunch spot, but forget about going on weekend night, unless you want to wait a half hour for a beer, and be looked at as a dollar sign instead of a person.
