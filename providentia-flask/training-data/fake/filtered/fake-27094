Mamma Rosa's is not only the best Italian Restaurant in Mercer County, but also the whole state.  The food is excellent, reasonably priced, and the portions are huge.  The different gravies (or sauces if you'd like) are all tasty.  Favorites include their lasagna, chicken formaggia, riggatoni with olive oil, sundried tomatoes, and mozzarella.  Gino is an excellent chef and always has time to greet the customers.  The waitresses are friendly and the service is excellent.  Can't say enough great things about this restaurant.. We love it!!!
