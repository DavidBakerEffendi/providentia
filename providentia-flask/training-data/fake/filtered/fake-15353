I totally agree with the poor reviews. The management thinks they are doing you a favor being open for business (ie they are not friendly), the food portions are little and average quality, and the service so-so. What I really disliked was that everything is kept to such a small portion - the owners/management seem to be really cheap and stingy with the food but not with the prices. No wander it's cash only . I will certainly not return. As nice and inviting as it looks from the outside that is how disappointing it ts. Skip this place.
