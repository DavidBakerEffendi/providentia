My family and I have been frequenting Baja's for years now and I can't say that we've ever left disappointed. They don't necessarily have the most extensive tequila selection which is probably the only negative aspect of the entire dining experience, and is a fact I can certainly overlook. They have a salsa bar which is highly original. It has six different salsa selections, ranging from very mild to quite spicy, so there is an option for everyone. The nachos are always delicious, topped with pico de gallo, cheese, and guacamole. The chile relleno comes with two stuffed poblano peppers, beans, rice, Â and guacamole. It's a huge portion and more than likely you'll be taking some to go. All in all I've been very pleased with Baja's over the years and look forward to frequently returning with my family
