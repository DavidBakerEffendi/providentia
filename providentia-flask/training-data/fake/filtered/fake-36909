I went with a group of friends last week and I had forgotten why I stopped going to this place. The reasons : the food mediocre at it's best and the options boring. Once I saw the menu I remembered why i had stopped coming in .The menu has not changed in years! What is it with restaurants that do not grow or expand their menu ?? The same o'l boring items as if time had stopped. Now I promised to myself : I will not be back nor put my friends through the mediocrity.
