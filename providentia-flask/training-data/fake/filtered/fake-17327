My secret favorite place is not a secret anymore. Best food, service and now they have a bar. This place is family owned and you know it and feel it when you walk in. The owner/family is always there and you can tell they care about their food and reputation. After going here for more than 3 years, I know the owner and his wife now. Because they see me in there frequently they know me by name and always give me a warm welcome. This place is no joke! signed, an honest customer non family member lol
