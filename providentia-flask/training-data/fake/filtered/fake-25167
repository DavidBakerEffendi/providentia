This place is horrendous. DO NOT believe any of these other yelp reviews - this is the first  review I've ever written on yelp and its only because of how awful the experience of going to this place was - from the interactions with the guy behind the register, to a ridiculous $35 bill for a burger, a sandwich (which don't come with sides) and fries, to the absolutely mediocre food (bland, totally unremarkable, and served cold), to the laughably disrespectful and impolite service (I've never seen a manager or owner make an experience so unpleasant - epic douche!) , to the uncomfortable accommodations (sitting on a metal bar stool at a counter where the room temperature inside was maybe 10 degrees warmer then outside), to the 25 minute wait for the food (there was a 15 minute wait in between a cold sandwich and a soggy hamburger...I could go on and on about how this was a complete disappointment on every single front. There are so many great places to eat in the neighborhood but  this is certainly not one of them. PS if you want a burger go to Dumont - the 'Kobe burger' at Bistro Petit was revolting... Avoid this place at all costs!
