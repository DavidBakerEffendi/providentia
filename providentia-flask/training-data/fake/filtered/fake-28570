My daughter and I LOVE this restaurant so much we come at least every week, and have been doing so for years. So I thought it was about time to leave a review. Despite some of the other reviewers, I find their service excellent. It is a very clean establishment. The choices of dishes are plentiful and the Mango Lassi is fantastic! Everything is made right there and is very fresh. I especially like the lentil curry and the Tandoori delights. The vegetable soup is so full of yummy ingredients that it is a meal in itself. The choice of different naans is delightful and comes out steaming hot. They have won awards which one can see when entering the restaurant for at least 10 years in a row, so its quite obvious that a couple of sour folks reviews should be ignored. This is one fine place to go for a wonderful meal.
