Meh. Great selection of burbon and beer. Though they sell burbon in "3 fingers" and it was only 2 of mine. Friendly, knowledgeable, and fun wait staff. The burger was bland. I just had a burger - nothing on it but lettuce tomato and ketchup. My wife's tasted better, but that was because of the blue cheese and carmelized onions not the beef. It's a big burger but I wouldn't go back. FYI people compare it to Prime 16. I'm underwhelmed by both.
