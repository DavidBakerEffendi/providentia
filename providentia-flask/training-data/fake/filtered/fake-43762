I love this restaurant. I made a very last minute reservation for 7 people, and was told it would be 30 minutes, and were sat in 10. The entrance is covered with ivy, and you have to walk down a set of stairs to enter into a dark and authentic looking bar. The amount of tapas to choose from is very large, and I would say I loved pretty much every tapa that I ordered. The Brussels sprouts are to die for! Seating is placed throughout the restaurant, but they have one dining space that you have to walk through the kitchen to enter ... very cool. One thing to know - They only accept cash or american express.
