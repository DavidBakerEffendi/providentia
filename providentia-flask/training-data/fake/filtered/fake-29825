I like the food of this restaurant, however you might have this few things in mind before you go there: BAD THINGS 1. Automatic Gratuities: I've been going to this restaurant for years, but lately I was surprised that they now include the tip in the bill. For me, this was not good, since my server was very rude to my mom. So when i received the bill, I noticed that the gratuity was included ( a good amount of money) We were only 4 dining. 2. Dirty Bathrooms: The women bathroom consist of 2 stalls, and is dirty, all the time!! As I said, I have been going for years (mostly because of the pulpo ghrellado or octopus) and I have never seen the bathroom being cleaned. 3.Small Place: Let's say you are 4 dining that day..They will sit you on a table with 4 more people, complete strangers, because the place is so small that they try to save space my putting tables together....I don't like to have people I don't know eating with me.... 4. Deserts: Bad, bad, bad, they only have a few selection of desserts that are not too good for the price. 5. Drinks: They don't have a wide selection of drinks. They do have wine, beer, and such, but if you want a fancy drink, they don't have it. The margaritas, are bad, and serve in a small glass. They don't serve pina coladas either. GOOD THINGS: 1. Large meals: The meals served are big portions. (but have in mind that the price is huge too) 2. Delicious food: Overall the food is good and fresh....but don't try the lobsters which is days old and expensive. 3. Good Sangria: The sangria is tasty and sweet.
