The Islands restaurant Is the best, I only really ordered Jerk Chicken, but I'm certain that everything else is as good...Ate upstairs once...Kinda cramped, but you can eat right outside In front In this great weather and people watch, especially since its directly across from the Brooklyn Museum...They treat you like family and they cook like family...Trust me, it's an Island feel and Island taste.
