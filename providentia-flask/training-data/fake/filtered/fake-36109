Have you ever been to a dive bar?  This place is the restaurant equivalent of that.  We came in here last week and the first thing that we noticed was that the place doesn't look like it's regularly cleaned.  The waitresses don't even wear any uniforms (not asking for much, just a shirt so we know who's working there like most restaurants), not to mention that they are beyond useless.  Our waitress spent more time talking to her friends than paying attention to her job.   To top everything else off, they don't accept credit or debit cards!!!!!!  Are you serious?  Did I accidentally go back in time to 1990 on my way there?  Does the owner of this dump know anything about running a business in the 2000's?   On the plus side, when we actually got our food it was okay, but it wasn't worth the wait or the bad service that we had to endure to get it by any means.  It was nothing that I couldn't make myself at home, and at least then I wouldn't have had to deal with the horrible attitude.  I'd recommend staying away from this place.  I've had a better service experience at the Dunkin' Donuts down the street.
