we had a wonderful time.  yes, they still have the blowfish hanging from the ceiling and the canoe with the plants hanging way up in the center of the room, but everything looked cleaner.  even the bathroom looked better.  they were 6 of us and we ordered pu pu platter (appetizers) for 4 people and it was delicious and plenty enough for each of us to sample about 3 different pieces.  the appetizers were served in a platter with a fire in the center so that we can heat up our food.  needless to say, the fire was hit with our kids.  we each had entries which were very good.  the adults ordered drinks.  the menu didn't have a description of what was in the drinks and i asked the waiter and i didn't like the liquor that was used and the waiter offered a different alcohol.  he asked me what i wanted.  that's a first for me.  anyway i didn't want to mess with the drink and ordered something that i liked the ingredients.  the waiters were very attentive and they refilled our water and tea often.  i like that the staff is older because i get tired of young college kids who are inexperienced, don't care about the patrons and don't know the menu.  it looks like this staff's been here for a while and i am happy to see older folks working.  it is not the cheapest but it is nice when you have a large group and want a special place to eat.
