I have never been so excited about fried chicken in my whole life, and Black-Eyed Sally's didn't disappoint. The chicken was so tender, juicy, crisp, and extremely flavorful. The Mac and Cheese was the best I have ever had, and the greens were cooked to perfection. I have never had fried green tomatoes before, and I will defiantly be ordering them again. The only issue I had is that because we had it delivered it was kinda cold. I can not wait to try everything on the menu.
