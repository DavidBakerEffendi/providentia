This place is great.  Nice atmosphere, always crowded with people.  Expect to wait an hour to get a table but there are a few places close by to have a drink.  The manager is a great guy and will actually go to the bar and let you know that your table is ready and they will let you bring your drink.  Not a bad program.   Food is really good, small menu but at least they feed you, it is all good.  Desserts are great, service is great.  Wine is reasonably priced as well as the menu.  I have gone 2 times already, the second time was better than the first and i will definitely go back again.
