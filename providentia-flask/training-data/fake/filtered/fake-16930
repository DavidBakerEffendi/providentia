Munchie's is very close to my office and so I stop in there frequently for coffee or for lunch.  They make the most delicious grilled cheese of any restaurant, and the sandwiches come with a side of some kind of pita chips (as long as you are eating in.)  If you get the sandwich to go, they do not include the chips.  The coffee is good, and they have hazelnut available.  They do not restock their shelves very often so sometimes you can't get a candy bar, bag of chips, or certain drink you might be looking for.  Their many breakfast options are good, just make sure you have about 10-15 minutes to wait for it, even if it's only a bagel with cream cheese.  I recommend Munchie's for the grilled cheese, the smoothies, and the coffee.  Other stuff, I would go down the street a little further to the corner store.
