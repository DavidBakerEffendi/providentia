My Boyfriend took me to The Fountain based on it was listed number 1 on the Zagat top 10 of Philadelphia. We have since been there two additional times and plan to add them to our regular dinner rotation. I have no doubt why they are listed number 1 after my first dining experience. There is a great vibe, great service, they even integrate the use of iPads for their wine list! We did the tasting menu every time and just switched out a few items to suit our fancy. Considering there are 7 courses in the tasting menu the serving portions are much larger then you would expect! You are guaranteed to leave here more then full and very happy! You really can't go wrong with anything you order, one of personal favorites is the lobster tempura soup with carrot broth, it is absolutely delicious!
