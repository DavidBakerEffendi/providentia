I took my wife for a nice dinner and was absolutely the best food ever service was great.  The Manager always came around to make sure everything was ok with our food (which was very tasty by the way) and asked if there was anything he can do for us even though he knew we were having a wonderful time.  I have never seen service like that before.  And the prices are very reasonable especially for Olde City.  I recommend this place to anyone...
