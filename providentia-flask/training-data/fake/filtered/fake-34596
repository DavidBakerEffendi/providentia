I've walked passed this place for so many months and on my last day in Philly I see someone unwrap a delicious looking wrap (can you see the shortage of words..haha!)...I just had to have it. So in the blistering cold, I walk a couple of blocks for my last lunch in Philly. WELL WORTH IT! I had the curry chicken Dosa with mango and curry chutney. It's much larger that one would expect but also extremely light...AND only $8. Highly recommend this place...must stop by if you're in philly.
