The food was OK. I could most likely re create these dishes in my own kitchen. I was hoping for something that would be special. Food was good, but the bartender was rude and a bit full of himself. I would have stayed for a second drink but he was up on his high horse and I didn't want to bother him. He looked a bit old and probably needed a nap.
