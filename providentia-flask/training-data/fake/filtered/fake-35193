I'm Italian and I'm currently living in New York: I found out about this place and decided to give it a try. The food is very good for the value in terms of quantity and quality, even though not all the ingredients are imported from Italy and the ones that are imported are not really first quality italian products. Anyhow, 5$ for a sandwich with imported prosciutto or mozzarella is really nothing and the focaccia is really good. The problem with this place is the service: very, very, very slow and disorganized (and it's an italian guy who's saying it!) compared to the NYC standard. It took 10 minutes to have our table cleaned (we were nicely sitting in front of a table full of left overs from the previous customers); even when the guy decided to clean it the job wasn't done properly... long wait for a sandwich and one antipasto (at least 30 min). Of course they manage to keep prices down by lowering service quality, but that was a little to much: anyway, you get what you pay for... Very unfriendly italian owner and staff: it's quite surprising, considering how kind usually Italian people in the hospitality industry are (at least the ones I've met so far in NYC). Will not go back, ciao!
