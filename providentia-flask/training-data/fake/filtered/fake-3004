Above average local Italian restaurant. They do pizza and pasta very well and have surprisingly good steaks for an Italian joint. The negatives are the place is very busy on many night especially weekends and the service can be slow and the food take long when they are full. Definitely make reservations for the weekends or you'll wait a long time to sit, but weekdays you'll be fine. The stuffed rigatoni and gnocchi marinara are my personal favorites and the grandma pizza is excellent. Â Huge plus is the large parking lot they have which is private and it's only shared with a convenience store so you can usually get a parking spot even when they are busy. Staff is friendly and the owner is usually there walking around checking on tables which I personally really appreciate.
