This is the worst restaurant I never seen in New Jersey, I had a very very bad experience today with this restaurant. In my life I wont visit this again and not suggesting/referring to any of my friends. This is the only way I can express my feeling about this restaurant. Food is not at all good. Every item is not reaching very basic taste.
