Wow, this place is good! The service is good, the people are nice, Â the food is amazing. I ordered Pad Thai and my girl friend ordered mussels and both was delicious. The service was great, our server was super friendly and best of all the price for what you get is unbeatable. The only downside from this experience was the wait for a table was a little too long and the waiting area crowded.
