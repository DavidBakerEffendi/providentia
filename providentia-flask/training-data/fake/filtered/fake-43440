It seems it's this restaurants practice to close early. Their normal hours are till 11 pm EST. I went to order at 10 pm a large pizza and wings and was told that wasn't possible in a rather rude manner. It seemed I was in the wrong for ordering during normal business hours. Â The sad thing was it was for a pick up order because they don't deliver. I have had their pizza before and it is nothing compared to their neighbor Joeys pizza. Unfortunately tonight, I didn't get home till after Joeys was closed. I will not attempt to order from park lane again.
