This is the best Indian Restaurant that I have ever been to. I was very disappointed when I came to USA as I couldnt Â find a decent tasting Indian food corner. I would try out many places with a hope perhaps this is better than the one I tried before. Now i can gladly put an end to my search after having tried at this place. I can guarantee - you pick any dish from the menu it will be super duper yummy. Bottom line "A MUST TRY!"
