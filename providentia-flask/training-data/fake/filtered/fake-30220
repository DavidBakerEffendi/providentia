Ting Ho is no longer Ting Ho. They underwent a huge renovation of both the premises and the menu, and the restaurant now called Ginger. The prices went up and the menu choices have changed so they no longer have a typical Chinese take-out menu. They now make some classic Chinese dishes, as well as some Japanese and Thai dishes. I was a big fan of Ting Ho before and they were my favorite Chinese take-out in the area, but since things have changed, I'm not as impressed. My favorite thing to order from Chinese take-out is the steamed dumplings, and Ting Ho had the BEST that I've ever had. Now they make them differently - they're smaller, thinner, and you don't get as many in an order as before... yet the price went up. They're still pretty good, but not the same. They also had the best boneless spare ribs in the area, but now they're not even on the menu. If they were still Ting Ho, I would have given them 5 stars. But now as Ginger, I think they deserve an average rating of 3. Though I must mention, the inside of the restaurant looks really nice for a take-out place!
