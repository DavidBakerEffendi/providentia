Ridiculous management here!  I ordered a roasted cauliflower sandwich.  Someone else had ordered the same thing in front of me.  I watched the cook squirt on about a 3/4 inch high mound of mayo all up and down the bread. So I asked the person who took my order a question. Me: Actually, could you go easy on the mayo for mine?   Them:  NO.   Me:  You can't? Them:  NO. Me:  Why? Them:  No substitutions. Me:  OK, fine.  Then no mayo at all for me please. Them:  We can't do that. Me:  But that's the guy who's going to make my sandwich, right? (He was standing about 2 feet away from me.)  He hasn't put the mayo on yet. Them:  No substitutions. Me:  So you're telling me that he hasn't put the mayo on yet, but he's going to put mayo on it right here in front of me, even though I don't want it? Them: Right. Me: So after he does that, I'm going to have to stand here and scrape it right back off? Them:  (I don't think they said anything back). For some reason, I was so taken aback that I didn't request a refund.  Then I noticed a very obnoxiously worded sign, saying something like, "Absolutely no substitutions!  This food is meant to be enjoyed as is."  Well, I didn't enjoy it.   I won't go back.  I hope people don't patronize a place that is so nasty to customers.  Sounds like others have experienced the same thing and have posted great alternatives close by in the neighborhood.  Looking forward to trying those!
