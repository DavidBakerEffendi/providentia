Loved: The music and atmosphere, wasn't over packed and small enough that if I got separated from my crowd it was easy to relocate them, there is also no cover charge and drinks were moderately priced. Dis-Liked: Wait of service at the bar and the live band (which wasn't bad, they just didn't play anything you could dance to).
