I will start off by stating, unlike a previous review, the desserts were good and actually on the large side - with the berry crumble being excellent - the fruit tasted so fresh and the crepes were also excellent.  My family had the lobster roll sandwich, burger (which was excellent a "5"), the chicken pot pie (a special) and the 1/2 chicken dish.  The cost relative to the portion size was good and overall I give North End a rating of 4 - service was attentive - off the street parking was a pleasant surprise for Princeton  - the retaurant's food is cooked to order so the kitchen was a bit on the slow side - but certainly we will be back.
