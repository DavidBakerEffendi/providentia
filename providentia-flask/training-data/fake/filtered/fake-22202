Went to this pub after work on a Thursday with a friend and we both ordered a smoked beer. The waiter brought out the wrong beer but since it seemed like a busy night, we casually accepted them and thought nothing of it. However, when the 2nd round came along and my friend ordered a Chimay, the waiter brought him the original smoked beer we ordered the first time. It seemed like the waiter was almost screwing with us. Anyways, when the 2nd round came out I flagged down our waiter and asked him what the deal was. He stupidly stared at me and continued to say that it was what we ordered. I told him it was not and he continued to just stare at me and argue his point instead of fixing the problem. As I reached for the bottle to show the waiter it was knocked and fell to the floor but didn't shatter and my friend picked it up. We continued to argue for another whole minute to which the waiter then gave me a quick flash of his middle finger then stormed away and returned promptly with the check. I don't go out to a bar to be treated like this by anyone, so I picked up the check and went to the floor manager. She was very nice and went and talked with the owners.  5 minutes later the owners, 2 Irish women and an Irish man, came out and told me that I "abused" their wait staff and that their "cameras" caught me knocking the bottle to the floor and that "their is no room in our bar for someone who knocks bottles over and abuses wait staff". They asked me to leave and I did, but not before making sure that I paid my bill; which I did. Thinking back I should have just walked out.   So morale of the story, don't go here because if they miss-serve you, they will just tell you its your fault and make up some crazy excuse involving "cameras" and "abuse". This is how they run their bar. :/
