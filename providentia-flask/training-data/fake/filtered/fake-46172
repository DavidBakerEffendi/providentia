Ordered: Wasabi Shoyu Ramen    $14 The ramen itself was not that bad. Definitely had better ramen before. Walking into Ippudo for the first time after hearing about it from everybody and always seeing a massive line coming out of the store with up to an hour waiting time I had very high expectations. I think it was way too overrated. I probably would have given this ramen a better rating if people didn't over advertise and tell me it was the best ramen they have ever eaten. The soup of the wasabi shoyu ramen was way to sweet and the wasabi just didn't blend very well with the soup at all. Overall this was a very bad ramen choice. But I'm guessing that all the other ramens on the menu cannot be THAT bad because they're just the classic ramens with unique names that you can probably eat at any other Japanese restaurant. I obviously decided to try something different... but I guess I should just stick with the traditional shoyu, shio, and the tonkotsu ramen. The atmosphere was all right. Because it was super busy the waiters tried to cram as many people as possible in one table. Me and my party of 5 were put all the way in the back corner. It was way to stuffy in the restaurant. The waitress was surprisingly very nice and attentive. Although it was busy and way too hot the waitress made every effort to serve us well.
