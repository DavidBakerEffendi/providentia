Where do you go to order the best sandwich you've ever had, anywhere? I go here, to Salumeria in Reading terminal for the roast beef hoagie. It is the perfect blend of ingredients and bread. They have their own tasty base coat that sets up the experience, and they put artichoke hearts on, if you wish. The advantage of a busy place like this is in the freshness of its offerings. Salumeria's ingredients are always excellent, always fresh. Prepare yourself for a line. It's the cost of greatness.
