found a moth ( insect) in my delivered food this evening. after discovering the disgusting gray creature in my soon to be consumed food i called the "restaurant" to inform them that i had a "moth" in my food. the man on the phone didn't know what a moth was and turned the phone over to what i can only assume was a manager or someone who understood the english language slightly better. she too didnt know what a moth was until i explained. all i wanted was my credit card to be credited for that nights order. ( on average spending $500/month at this establishment). i was told to bring the portion which contained the insect to the "restaurant" in order for them to take the dish which contained the "moth" off our bill upon inspection. when i refused and said i was going to cancel the payment with the credit card company she informed me she was going to call the police. this was my experience with chengdu 1 in the pilgrim shopping center in cedar grove, nj. please think twice before ordering from here.
