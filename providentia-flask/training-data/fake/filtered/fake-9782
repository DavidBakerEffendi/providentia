After been going to Gold' gym for a year, I finally noticed that they had an Indian takeout in the same strip mall. So, I decided to give it a try. I am fairly fimilar with Indian food since I work in the city and always try different ethnic places out with my friends. In my opinion what sets this place apart is that the food is so much less greasy here!. You can actually taste the flavor and not the oil and chillies. I asked for a Mild which was good for me. I tried their Chicken Korma boneless and the sauce was just out of this world especially with a Nan bread. This place does not have a dine in ambience because of the fact that its setup as a takeout. I highly recommend it for a meal take home. I know I will be visiting them often.
