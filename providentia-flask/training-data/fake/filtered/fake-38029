Just got back from a trip to NYC and still thinking about this little gem! I was expecting great drinks but the food was some of the best I had the whole trip. Highly recommend the pizzas and wings. They had a special burrata salad when we visited. It was one of the best I have ever had. The calzone with ricotta and chocolate was questionable but ended up being pretty good--very fun to try! Yummm.
