My initial thought of this place wasn't too great because it was rather small and quite popular. But then I was led into the backrooms which were had a very hipster-atmosphere. The unique style of mismatched chairs and coffee-can flowerpots gave the place it's unique edge. Okay, I don't quite remember what I ate there because of the huge food coma I suffered afterward. All I know is that the thighs were amazingly good. The chicken are all free-range (which made me feel good) and just the right amount of crunchiness and juicyness. The pies? I ordered one of each. And to anyone, the banana cream pie is a MUST! I have never eaten a pie as good as that and I've been searching for pies that can beat it, but I can't! I always come back for more.
