An incredibly disappointing experience. Started out with a pissy bartender that made you feel like you have to apologize for inconveniencing her with your presence.  Progressed to a 35 minute wait for a brunch order for two comprised of essentially eggs, biscuit, home styled potatoes, ham and sausages. What was most disappointing and downright surprising is that one of the dishes wasn't just cold, but judging by the dry oxidized eggs and ham, a rather poor attempt at 'reheating' must have been made.  Looking at the dish, you know exactly what you were in for before you even dug in. Although generally the flavors were good (the eggs could have used A LOT less salt), the overall experience made me reconsider this as a favorite spot. Sad when great spots allow for such a poor experience that could have been easily avoided.
