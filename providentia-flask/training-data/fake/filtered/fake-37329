Wow, are they rude. Unbelievable. I read some of the negative reviews and I couldn't agree more. When I asked how much a coffee refill cost, they replied that if I wasn't going to order food, I could leave as they were "losing business" by me drinking one cup of coffee. Oh, I'm sorry...I thought this was a coffeeshop! Silly me. Ironically, not only was no one waiting to be seated at this "coffee"shop, Â the couple perched in the corner, who had been there long before I arrived, were sipping coffee without food with no similar reproach. Overall, rude, hypocritical, terrible customer service. I will not be returning, although, with this type of treatment, I highly doubt this place will even be around to snub in the future.
