We are very happy to have this place just a block away you can find us here at least once a week! Every plate has been great but my Husband an I can't seem to stop ordering Noix de St Jacques a la Provencale! Oh it is so good. The staff is friendly and on top of everything without being annoying. They are quick to replenish our drinks. The only down side would be the space at the tables they are small but not uncomfortable.
