What a great spot. I walked in to a full house solo and asked about a seat at the bar...which was small (3 seats), and full. He offered to call me when they were moved to a table. When I returned to eat I didn't very much on the menu but really enjoyed what I had... 1)Chopped salad with a simple olive oil and lemon dressing. My favorite. Loved it. 2)MEAT SAMBUSAK - Three good sized pastries came out. Fried perfectly. Meat had great seasoning and the dipping sauce was perfect. This plus a glass of Pinot makes for a good light dinner.
