I went there with my family although they served water in sippy cups they were very unfriendly.  They made us wake our sleeping baby as they would not allow strollers in the restaurant.  When the baby woke up we placed her in a highchair and were cursed out (yes in front of the kids) by the owner for not moving her fast enough. Then there was an actual altercation as we left the establishment. The waiters seemed trained in holding the owner back. I would never bring children there it is not a safe environment for young children let alone adults.
