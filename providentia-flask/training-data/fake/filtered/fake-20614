Hype does strange things to NYers.  At 6pm on a recent Friday the place was absurdly packed with customers with main courses spread in front of them,  eating... and not just at the tables but at THE BAR. Every single bar seat was taken.  (A couple friends & I, who had dropped by just to grab a couple drinks, felt a very eerie sense of dislocation, as if we had suddenly walked into a suburban restaurant in, I don't know, Ohio, or something.  Since when does anyone eat at 6pm in the Village??!) (When it's a new-ish Keith McNally joint obviously....never mind the tavern in the name.) That said, when we were finally served, the drinks were superb.  (And at $14 a pop they'd better be too.)  I love rye drinks & had an excellent & refreshing Murray Sour, followed up with a yummy Maple Leaf Sazerac.  (The place deserves 4-5 stars for the drinks alone).  The bartender was professional & friendly as well. I will add that i probably won't go back for some time (and certainly not during the obviously extended window of dining hours) given that seating is nigh impossible...There are lots of other places to go for yummy cocktails in NY. But do try the cocktails if you're already planning to stop by for dinner; afterwards, you'll be happy you did.
