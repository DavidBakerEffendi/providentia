I really don't know what all the hype is. We went to this place for a surprise birthday for a friend. The menu was pre fixed since their was 10 of us. Don't get me wrong, the food was good. I just felt like I was at a taste testing in a fair. We all had to share the food that was brought to us, one piece of rib, one donut, one karat soup shot, etc. Asked for a drink about 10 times until finally 30 minutes into us eating we finally got water for the table, while we clearly ordered something else. Its not really comfortable to sit in this place, really tight. I ended up leaving this place being still very much hungry, we ended up going to another spot to finish eating. Worst part about this experience was the $900 bill that we got. WHAT $900?? for what?!?!? If you like eating samples, and end up paying your monthly rent, than this is the spot for you.
