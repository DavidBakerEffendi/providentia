This place actually has great food.  I have been there several times even though there are no windows and the facade is sketchy. The steaks have been perfect for a like a 4 star joint. scallops great salad fresh and potatoes flavorful.  the big drawback is the way it looks from the outside.  I suggest giving it a try. and FYI I don't offer that often
