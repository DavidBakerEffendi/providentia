Tony and Lucille's  is The Best Italian Food in the area, if you want real Italian food.  This is NOT the  cookie cutter, froufrou, made up Italian dishes that you would get at Olive Garden.  This is made the Real Italian way, with the heart and soul  and utter love of food that only someone who grew up knowing and watching these dishes being made can understand.  All else are second to Tony and Lucille's.  it is an honor to eat there as you feel you have been invited to their home, make yourself comfortable, relax, eat and enjoy!   Thank you so much!
