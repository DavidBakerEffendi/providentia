Finally had the chance to go to this place. The dumplings here were amazing! Nice and juicy :) It is extremely cheap. I would recommend getting the fried pork dumplings and the sesame pancakes. The place is a small shack and there is minimal seating to eat it (a few stools). The place is usually packed so you will have to wait a bit (not long since they have extremely fast service).
