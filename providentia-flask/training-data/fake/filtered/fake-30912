Went their for my birthday....what a huge mistake...the chicken cutlet over day old linguine was soaked in the water from the pasta, (my dog wouldn't even eat it when I took it home), which covered the whole dish.  YUCK.  The oil used to fry my husband's shrimp and fries was rancid as we could smell it and tasted even worse.  Service was also disgusting.  OH WELL, live and learn.  Stowes, here we come if we want fresh fish!!  Anywhere but Jimmy's.. Can't rate it, it was that bad.
