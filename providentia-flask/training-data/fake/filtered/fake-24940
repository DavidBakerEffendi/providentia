My partner and I have been coming to this restaurant for years.  The food is excellent, the service is superb, and the decor is lovely. There is a great selection of food, from vegetarian fare to lamb and kibbee dishes. The baklava is simply to die for. Everything is very reasonably priced and the wait staff is the best that there is. You will feel like a member of the family.  My partner is of Lebanese descent and this is the only place we dare bring her family. You will be very happy to share a meal at Sahara.
