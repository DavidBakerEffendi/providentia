My husband and I are in Burlington for the weekend and decided to give this place a try. I have crazy-severe allergies, so I can't eat just anywhere. The staff at Boloco were awesome about making sure my food was not accidentally cross-contaminated. They took my allergies seriously (unlike some other restaurants in the area). The food is really good. I can't remember the name of the salad I had, but it contained quinoa, arugala, beets, squash, and goat cheese. The flavor combination was to die for. My husband had a Mexican bowl with pork. His was also delicious. Bonus: they serve beer! My husband and I were both quite happy with the food, service, and the price. We will definitely stop by in the next time we are in town.
