Took the wife here last night for an anniversary dinner.  Overall, I would highly recommend this place for dinner.   We'll certainly be back at some point and will bring friends. Its small so I would imagine you def. wanna make a reso for Fri/Sat nights. The drink menu is broad and theres some different stuff on there, which is nice.  Same thing for the dinner menu.   We liked the variety and the fact that it wasnt the same old stuff on the menu. For apps, we had the Lobster Cobb salad and Tuna Tartar.   Both were excellent.   Cant go back without getting the Lobster Cobb salad -- thats a real winner.   For dinner, I had the Rib Eye and the wife had the Skate Wing (which is a fish, specifically Stingray).  Both entrees were excellent.  I loved how the Rib Eye was prepared and served, it was sliced up, which was a nice change.   I got the Cippoloini as a side, which went really well with the Rib Eye.   the wife really enjoyed the Skate Wing with the risotto.   She loved it. For dessert, gotta have the dirt tasting.   Its relatively small, which is nice cuz u dont feel gorged when you leave, but it will satisfy the post-dinner sweet tooth.   Nice new place for something different if you are looking for that.     I recommend it
