I have been a loyal pommes frites customer for years but I believe in the last year there was a change in owners and the flavors have not been the same. The fries are now super oily and the sauces are less flavorful. My usual sauces are the mango chutney and the tomato basil. Considering the price of fries here are not cheap I really expect a non oily fry. Hopefully they get back to the way they used to be.
