I was very impressed with how nice it looks. Great atmosphere, first-rate design. Sat at the bar and had delicious glass of Torrontes for $8, and the salmon sandwich for only $9, and it was off the charts. I think they haven't been open too long, so I'm happy with how good the food and service were for a new place. A great addition to the north slope, and I'm definitely going back!
