I went to Gallos this afternoon and thought it was so good I would write about it.  It is a small family owned place.  The owner/server/head chef/cashier was great.  His english was very good and no one should feel intimidated going there not speaking spanish. The food was spectacular.  Torta de Pollo Milanesa, was great.  Huge and delicious.  The chicken is often dried out at other places, not here.  The beef tacos, good.  Simple, but if you wanted extra toppings just ask.   Just walk in past the convenience store part and find a table in the back.   They deliver, the food came out quickly and was great.  I will eat here on a regular basis. Lunch for two under 15 bucks. Worth a trip down south.
