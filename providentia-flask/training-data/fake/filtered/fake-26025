You can't miss when you eat at Petisco.  Everything I have tried on their menu is always remarkably delicious and their wide variety of selections can please a variety of diets (veg/meat eaters/pasta lovers).  I've brought many friends and they all returned on their own.  It's a cozy setting and the staff is a delight.
