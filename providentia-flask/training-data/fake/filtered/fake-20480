I watched a segment about Zahav on Fox and was impressed by the Passover menu, which appeared to be an interesting variation on the traditional Seder meal. Since it was the first night of Passover, my wife and I decided to give it a try. My wife was not interested in the contents of the Passover menu and decided to try some of the a la cart items.  She ordered first, and then I told the waitress that I wanted the Passover meal.  She told me that we both had to order the meal. We explained ( I don't know why we had to explain) that my wife was not interested in it.  She told us that it could only be had if we both ordered it.  Since the Passover meal was the only reason we were there, we should have paid for our drinks and left.  But the weather was terrible, so we stayed and were literally forced to order something else, none of which lived up to the hype of other reviews. Besides the bizarre menu requirements, the food was just fair, and the prices were high for what we got.  I doubt we would have gone back in any case, but forcing us to adhere to their ordering requirements is a no-starter.  By the way, we were given no explanation for this absurd requirement.   Next time we want a Passover meal, we'll make it ourselves or go to the local deli and get better food for about 1/3 the price.  Two stars for this place is generous.
