This was an unexpected pleasure for my wife and I. We got caught in a rainstorm and before we could get to the restaurant we intended. Wonderful penne bolognese, outstanding asparagus ravioli. They make their own desserts. The basil vanilla ice cream with strawberries & a balsamic reduction was amazing! The chocolate mousse/granache was perfect! Good wine list, great service and a sophisticated atmosphere make this an exceptional place to eat in Burlington.
