I was there again the other night and it was great.  I love the brunches but have to be in the mindset to eat "diner" style. Its cramped, rushed and fast-foodish.   Dinner service is much more enjoyable (they have actually started hiring some older servers who seem to care about your dining experience).  But, the night menu is changing often now and the specials are getting better. Keep up the positive changes-maybe you'll win best dinner!
