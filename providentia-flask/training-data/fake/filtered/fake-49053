I went to Nikko for my birthday a week or so ago. Usually the hibachi places I have gone to in the past are always crowed and the wait is way too long. When I went to Nikko, as soon as I walked in I could tell this place was different. The atmosphere was fun, and there was no wait at all! The service was great, and the food was even better! I absolutely recommend everyone eat at Nikko's!
