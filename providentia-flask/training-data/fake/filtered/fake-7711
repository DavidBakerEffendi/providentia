This might be my favorite place in Philly. I guess it's just the combination of everything they offer that has me obsessed. I get the same thing every time I go-vegan beef nachos, frozen margarita. I don't know what they put in that vegan beef sauce, but it's good enough that every meat-eater I've forced to share with me (the "small" is more than enough for two people for a meal) has enjoyed it. Vegan beef nachos, margarita. That's all you need to know.
