There is no place in the world like L & B (or Brooklyn!!). Their square slices are amazing and the best you can get in nyc. If you are looking for a place with tons of pizza toppings or specialty slices however, this is not the place to come to. Their round slices are very good, but nothing compares to the sicilian ones. The spumoni is also amazing! L & B is the place to come to if you are looking for a true Brooklyn pizza experience!!
