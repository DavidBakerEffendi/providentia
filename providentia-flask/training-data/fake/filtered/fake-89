Nice little place I used to live across the street from.  It's got a small menu for food, but most of it is really good.  If you're feeling adventurous and don't mind eating something with a face, I recommend the pig's head.  Make sure you eat it with a friend because it's a huge portion.   Definitely go there for brunch and try the testina hash poutine or the polentu.  And they even have a bar with lots of unique beer choices and a friendly staff.  The prices can range from economical to expensive.  It all depends on your taste.
