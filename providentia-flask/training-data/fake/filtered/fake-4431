The appearance of the bar was clean and hip.  Very inviting. Young staff, young patrons.  Very laid back. The narrow layout didn't bother me too much, and instead created an intimate feel.  My chicken sandwich was delicious.  But it did take a while to come out. My biggest dissapointment was with the attitude of the bar tender and some servers.  We sat at the bar so the bartender was our server. He hardly acknowledged us, rarely asked if we wanted more drinks, and didn't apologize for the late food.  Even worse, he and a server engaged in long personal conversations right next to us like we didn't exist as our drinks lay empty. Overall, the place was great, food tasted great, but the employees were too dissmissive and unattentive.
