Excellent pizza, insulting service. My party made the mistake of ordering dessert (a passable cannoli) after we had finished our pizza. What happens if you linger, for any reason, after they have arrogantly whisked your plates away is that you are immediately of no use to them as clients. Grimaldi's business model is: get them in, get them fed, get them out. So after about 2 minutes into our cannoli, our (Serbian?) waiter shoved new place settings and silverware in front of us as if the next party was already seated. Their tables are small so there isn't a whole lot of room to maneuver at this point. A minute later, he dropped our check in front of us. We were miffed but were intent on enjoying dessert. A minute after that he dropped 2 large menus in front of us. At this point there is no room whatsoever. We reluctantly gave him a credit card at this point but made it known to the manager that the service was a joke. I live here. I am used to rushed service but Grimaldi's is ridiculous.
