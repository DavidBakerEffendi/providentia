i actually live around the corner from Claire's and keep wanting to give it the benefit of the doubt, because i am vegetarian and my options in New Haven are limited, but it surprises me with how terrible it is time and again. the food is overpriced, greasy, flavorless and strange (in comparison to Red Lentil, for example, which is a far superior veggie restaurant in town). the service is customer-unfriendly (e.g., they look at you like you have three heads if you complain about anything) and the only redeeming thing until recently was that some of their cakes are decent. but even that is no longer worth it, because they have now been 'retrained" to cut incredibly stingy pieces of cake and still charge over $4 for it. literally the ONLY reason i step foot in Claire's is to buy entire cakes for parties, etc. - they are way fresher and more economical. so unless you're going to a birthday party and need a cake, seriously...you can pass on this place.
