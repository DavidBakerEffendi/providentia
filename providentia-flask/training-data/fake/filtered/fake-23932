I have been eating at talk of the town now for over a year. The quality of food and service is great and has only gotten better and better over time. Â The place is clean all the time. The best thing is no foam plates are used here. I'm happy that this place is close to where I live and i don't have to drive a few miles. I have been and will continue to happily recommend this place to my friends. Good job 'Talk Of The Town', keep up the great job.
