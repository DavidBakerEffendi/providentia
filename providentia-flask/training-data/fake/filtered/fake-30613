I'm a lover of Mediterranean food and walked by Gila's one day. I am also a fan of healthy fresh cuisine and this looked quite promising. I stopped in, sat down, and ordered a heavenly Chicken Shwarma: a platter with moist flavorful chicken, hummus, and caramelized onions. I adore the Israeli couscous dotted with fresh cranberries. Falafel balls were hot, fresh, and delicious. I finished my dinner with one of the best hot chocolates around. The family staff couldn't be more gracious, inviting, and generous. I cannot wait to walk through their neighborhood again. I will be a regular visitor.
