Yes...yes, and yes again. Everytime I come to Smorgasburg the very FIRST thing I do is search for these guys. The triple pork saltena and raspberry soda is to DIE for...literally. I'll just die. That's how good it is. It's slowly baked -- not fried -- and it's like a pork stew inside this fluffy cake. Add some mild hot sauce and cheese and you're done for the day. And let's not get started on the freshest sodas I've EVER had. They make their own, and they are so fragrant and healthy. A top notch thirst quencher. I went there with my dog today and boyfriend and these guys are just so nice. Gave my dog water, had a conversation at their little bar, and even gave me a free soda. Such a great business, great food, and awesome people. I'm coming back guys!
