I Â have never written a review before, but I felt compelled to write one about New Kitchen. I have never been so frustrated or upset with a restaurant in my entire life. Their rudeness on the phone when placing an order is one thing, but then to deliver the wrong beverage not once, but twice, even after SPECIFICALLY SAYING "Hey, last time you messed up. Don't do that again," and then the next order is literally the same mess up as the first. The food is mediocre at best if you're in the area and just need something to fill you're stomach, but at this point, I'm done. It's not worth it to me. Would not recommend eating here if you value restaurants with integrity, quality, or customer service. Because New Kitchen lacks all three.
