This is my first time doing a Yelp review. I loved my experience so much that I felt I needed to share my experience and give this place 5-stars. I came to Bleu Sushi for dinner because of a Groupon. The service was great. The atmosphere was nice and welcoming. The servers were very attentive and gave me some good suggestions. I loved the food and the presentation. At the end, the chef came over and personally thanked us for coming in for dinner. That made the experience even more memorable. I will definitely come back to Bleu Sushi and would recommend this to anyone that's in the mood for some good sushi!
