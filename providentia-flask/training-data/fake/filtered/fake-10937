Just went there 5/15/11.  The service was terrible.  The wait staff had zero personality and were rude.  Someone in our group ordered spaghetti and wanted meatballs and sausage, but they would only do one or the other.  Cut me a break!  They only have two things on the menu as it is. My wine had a bunch of cork pieces in it.  The pizza was just fair. The far better choice for thin crust pizza is to dine at DeLorenzo's or perhaps just skip a meal.
