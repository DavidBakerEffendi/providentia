Dos Segundos was a very good eating experience. I had decided earlier in the day that I needed a margarita and looked on line for a suggestion. When we walked in and I looked around I realized that the place was packed and it was 4:40pm on Friday afternoon. After finding a table close to the bar, our waitress got our drink order, a pitcher of Lime Margarita, which we were told were on the happy hour menu for $15 a pitcher. I can still feel the smile on my face when she said that. The bowl of chips with two types of salsas was a nice touch as they took our drink order. I got the tilapia tacos and my wife got the chicken quesadilla and they were both very good. As we enjoyed our dinner and I ordered a blood orange pitcher of margaritas I knew that this was my type of place. I would suggest getting an early table if you don't want to stand and wait because the place looks like it runs a very good weekend dinner business. We liked it alot.
