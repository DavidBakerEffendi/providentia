I have been coming to this restaurant for five years and I have come to enjoy sitting outside and watching the most beautiful woman in the city pass by, while enjoying a  glass of wine and a delicious meal.  The owner whom I have gotten to know is a warm and personable man.  I recommend this restaurant  to anyone that loves to sit  back in a relaxed atmosphere and watch the world go by.
