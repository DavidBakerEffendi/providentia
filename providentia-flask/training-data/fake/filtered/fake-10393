The first pizza I ordered was great but something has changed.  Not only was the pizza not as good as the first but the delivery person did not have any change on him at all so I paid $20.00 for a $14.00 pizza.  Yes theirs only a $6.00 difference but I live literally 2 minutes down the road and that doesn't constitute a $6.00 tip.
