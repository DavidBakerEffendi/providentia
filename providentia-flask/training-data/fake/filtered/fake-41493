I don't really yelp or write reviews but I felt like I had to share about my experience here. I live in New Jersey but needed a place to eat with my boyfriend late this past Sunday night. We googled a bunch of places and even though it was across the bridge, we decided to give it a try. The first floor was closed and kind of dark but as we went up the looooong flight of stairs we arrived to the second floor. There was dim lighting and beautiful oriental Â decor. The server greeted us with menus and brought us waters right away. I had many questions about the drink list and she recommended a very delicious bottle of cold sake. I had asked a lot of questions but she was friendly and attentive to them all. We started the meal with miso soup, agadashi tofu, and vegetable dumplings. Everything was really delicious and fresh! I do not really eat meat and had many more questions about the menu but our server was so sweet and she recommended a bunch of things for me to try out. I had the vegetable tempura which was crispy out the outside and so warm and fresh on the inside. I ate a few of the vegetarian rolls and it was all really exceptional. I didn't think that I would be able to enjoy such delicious food or a menu that would be so friendly to non meat eaters at such a late hour. I would highly recommend Fuji Mountain to all the late night owls looking for exceptional service and high quality food. The service was absolutely perfect and even though it was late and there weren't that many people upstairs we were welcomed to stay for as long as we wanted and didn't feel rushed at all!! I will be back again for another wonderful dining experience!
