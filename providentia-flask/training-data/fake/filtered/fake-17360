Loves: --Fantastic service. They offered to hold the wine we brought while we went to another bar during our wait for a table. Both the server and host were extremely friendly, and the host was fairly accurate about the wait time. The kitchen was a bit overworked on a crowded Friday night, so the server brought a bowl of soup compliments of the chef during the wait for our appetizer, which was a nice touch and did the job! --The food: The aforementioned soup (gazpacho) was fresh, light, and perfect for summer. It had a slight kick that was not overpowering in any way. The short rib flatbread was probably my favorite part of the whole meal. The meat was perfectly cooked--juicy, flavorful, and tender--and with the mushroom, cheese, and truffle oil . . . I think I'm still recovering from the happy experience. Note: the flatbread is a plate-size pizza, not the smaller flatbread size we expected (*no* complaints!). The seared brussel sprouts with parm were on-target. Mains of potato-crusted tuna and duck breast were beautifully executed--clean flavors, both meats cooked to the right temperature, and the perfect serving size where you're full but not stuffed to the brim. Meh: --Noise level. We were at a small table for two, but it was difficult to hear what my companion was saying. There's no question that the restaurant was brimming with energy, and I liked the friendly, neighborhood vibe, but the noise level kept me a little bit on edge the whole night. Would return for many reasons, but probably on a less busy night or earlier in the evening.
