I lived in Midwood for 15 years, and I've been to this pizzeria plenty of times, and I have to tell you, it's overrated.  You need to eat here more than once to give it a true review.  The bread part is good, but the sauce is overly rustic, and too many different types of cheese are used, but it doesn't stop there.  I wish you can order the pizza without all the extra olive oil dumped on there, but I don't think anyone will risk their life by telling Dom what to do.  Too much olive, which creates this cheesy soupy pool, which makes it hard to eat.  It's a hit or miss as far as not getting a crust that's burnt.
