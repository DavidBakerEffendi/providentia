Delicious!  I live around the corner and go at least once a week.  Everything is amazing, from the pancakes to the burger to the salads.  Just typing about the pancakes makes me want to go tomorrow for brunch.  Very cute inside and great crowd of relatively chic, good looking people.  My one complaint is with their take-out coffee.  It tastes good but takes FOREVER.  Expect to wait outside at the window for 5 minutes for a simple iced coffee.  Overall though it's an amazing place and I highly recommend going there.
