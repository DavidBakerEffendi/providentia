This was the coziest (but still pretty classy) restaurant!  The lighting is perfect for intimate conversations (with good friends or lovahhs), and the decor is simple but charming.  Our waitress never stopped smiling, and the bathroom WAS great (Sara C., I know what you mean, it's like icing on the restaurant-cake).  The food was really tasty, and the tapas menu only enhances the cozy feel of the place... Sharing is caring, folks. *One thing:  If you're going to get a real "Greek" experience, this is not necessarily the place to go.  It's a mix of cuisines, and when I went with one of my girlfriends (who's VERY Greek), she was disappointed that they didn't offer a bigger variety of Greek fare.  But that's just her.  I liked the place.
