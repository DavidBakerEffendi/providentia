First of all, I think atmosphere was very nice. My husband and I were sitting by the bar. Waiter was extremely nice. One of drinks I liked to order was not available, the waiter found a half bottle and asked the manager if we can get the drinks by glasses. Sashimi were fresh and price was reasonable. My husband is Japanese, he enjoyed it greatly. I think it's nice place to hang out.
