This is a neighborhood "red-sauce Italian' restaurant with a pizzeria in front and a full restaurant in the back. I had been here a few times on and off for dinners; and this week I had a buffet lunch for about 20 guests. The owners and servers were as friendly Â and accommodating as could be. We had five buffet trays set up, along with fresh salad. Baked ziti - sausage and peppers - baked flounder - chix Francese - eggplant rollatini - yum! The food was all tasty and passed the test of the real Italian grandma in attendance. This restaurant does what it sets out to do exceptionally well. I recommend it!
