Pizza is mediocre if you eat it in the restaurant, gross if taken home or delivered.  I ordered spaghetti and meatballs and they delivered dry penne with burnt meatballs.  I called back to say they got the order wrong and the guy was rude and hung up on me. I tried eating what they delivered and kept biting bits of cartilage. They must use the cheapest meat, completely inedible.  Never ordering from them again.  Unprofessional staff and disgusting food.
