Excellent food. Hostess does not know her job and hangs up the phone immediatly after answering question without asking if you need anything else. Food runners never seem to know who gets the food they bring out, so basically walk back and forth until someone notices and claims the item. I saw them place it on a table then walk away only to have left the wrong item then the food sits on the wrong table until someone comes by and takes it to the correct table. Very untrained staff. Very loud bar music does not allow for much dinner conversation. Go for the food but font expect much else. Better yet get it delivered and avoid the aggravation.
