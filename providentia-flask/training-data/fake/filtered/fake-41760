I've been to the Bakehouse many times because I like the food and the atmosphere. However, I invited my girlfriends for brunch yesterday and was appalled how condescending the host was and hostess were. They made us sit at the bar after we finished our meal claiming they needed our table despite the fact that the place (which is huge) was empty. This was a major turnoff!
