Two words:  AWE. SOME.  Perhaps the best sushi we have ever had and we have had a lot.  Chef/owner Kelvin came around to converse with the patrons and we commented on the freshness of the food - so essential to good sushi.  Kelvin mentioned that he gets deliveries every other day, unlike many other sushi restaurants that receive their deliveries every 5 days.  The food was inventive, exquisitely fresh and sublimely delicious.  The prices were surprisingly reasonable and the service was supreme.  They offer take out and delivery which we will definitely be taking advantage of.  Kelvin also told us that he is considering offering sake tasting and sushi making events, and we encouraged him to do so.  Ninja Sushi is definitely our new favorite.
