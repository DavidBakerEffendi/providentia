Best HK style wonton noodles and congee in Chinatown. I would not recommend ordering the non-noodle, non-congee dishes. The ingredients seem to be fresher and higher quality than other Chinatown restaurants (and supposedly MSG free), so expect them to be lighter on the oil and salt and slightly smaller as well. They are far from bland.
