I heard about this place from health conscious friends of mine that live in the City and I wanted to see what the fuss was about so my family and I ventured into Philly from the burbs.. FANTASTIC.  It has a pretty cool vibe from the moment we walked in...kind of rustic but kind of trendy at the same time.  The employees were all very friendly and took the time to talk with us about the restaurant and menu items. As others have said, this is kind of like an upscale, Mediterranean, organic version of Chipotle.  It is also BYOB, which is nice.   I read a review that complained about the portion size.  That person must have a tapeworm.  We actually found the portions to be huge.  More importantly, everyone's meals were outstanding.  The choices (proteins, sides, etc.) offered were really interesting and created some incredible combinations of taste. In addition to the great entrees, we really enjoyed a delicious kale pesto dip appetizer served in a really interesting portobello mushroom cap! Lastly, not that we needed dessert, but we sampled a couple of their offerings and they were really interesting and delicious as well. We will be back for sure.
