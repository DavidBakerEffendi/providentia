I love Rira's and my friends even say it seems like its the only place I go. Today was the third time this week that I was there and this one experience makes me not feel welcome or comfortable to go back. There were two games on TV today. My plan, go to the end of the first game and order a drink. After the game order lunch(cause theres an hour in between). When the second game comes on, order more drinks and appetizers to enjoy during the game... However, before I could order I was basically told I was unwelcome and needed to leave by the bartender. During 25min of the end of the first game the bartender had come up to us only twice once to ask what we wanted to drink and the other time to ask if we wanted food, to which I replied not yet, thanks... Not yet implies that I intend to get food. But the third time she came up (with us only having been there 25min) she said, "If you dont pay for food you need to leave" I was about to explain I was waiting for her to come back so I could order food now that the game I was watching was over... but she cut me off and really really rudely said, "this is a business you cant just sit here"... so I left... I did not get to order my burger, I did not get to order any drinks, I did not get to order appetizers. and they will not get the $30 I was going to spend there and leave a nice tip like I always do. But now they've lost my business and I'm really disappointed in them and shocked by how rude someone was. ***AND I'D LIKE TO SAY A THANK YOU TO THE MANAGER. AFTER THIS POST I WENT BACK FOR THE MENTIONED SECOND GAME WITH A DIFFERENT FRIEND. THE BARTENDER WAS STILL THERE, AND SHE WAS VERY NICE AND DIDNT MAKE SARCASTIC COMMENTS LIKE I HAD BEEN BRACING FOR. THE MANAGER APPROACHED ME AND APOLOGIZED FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WAY IT WAS HANDLED AND FELL BETTER ABOUT GOING BACK***
