One of my favorite spots for music and jazz without paying Hudson River tolls and NYC parking to hear jazz in NYC.  Lots of big name, headliner acts come out here to Trumpets and the music charge is always  much less than hearing same at Iridium, Blue Note, or other NYC clubs.  They also feature lots of local talent on weeknights that is worth hearing.  Very good food.  A little pricey, but lots of things in Montclair are equally pricey, as it is an affluent community, and again,  a nice dinner for much less than you would pay at an NYC jazz club of the same stature.  Bistro style menu, but I highly recommend anything on the menu ITALIAN, as the owner is from Calabria and they do Italian good!  That's saying a lot, since Essex County boasts some of the finest Italian food in the U.S., IMHO.  I'm so glad this place is here, it makes me feel much better about life in the burbs!
