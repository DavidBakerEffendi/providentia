We had a bad experience at Little Fish. First, although its not the fault of Little Fish, there is no parking anywhere near the place.   After driving around for 35 minutes we finally were lucky enough to find something several blocks away.   So, if you're planning to drive there, be ready to waste a lot of time finding a parking place.  Otherwise, find a garage near South St and take a cab or walk quite a few blocks.  The menu is limited but interesting.   The prices are high for the limited atmosphere.   There literally is a curtain that keeps the cold air from entering the small room.   While waiting for a table several diners  had to huddle between that curtain and the front door to stay out of the cold.  It .   For starters, I have never been to a place that literally serves one slice of bread per person.  For the bread they provided a pesto oil that was not much more than a tablespoon - for 4 people!   The tuna appetizer was extremely small and very salty.   Two of us ordered the tuna entrée and the other two the monk fish.   Portions were very small and almost devoid of fish.   Both the fish and vegetables were EXTREMELY salty and unfortunately almost inedible.   You could see chunks of sea salt all through the fish and veggies.  At $35 and $37 for these two entrées this place is a rip off.    We left hungry.   Yet, although we counted only 24 seats, they were all filled.   I'm guessing a lot of these people won't be back.  I know none of us will.
