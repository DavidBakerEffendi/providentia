Tappas Tuesday, that is all you really need to know!  All tappas are 50% off.  I've been here numerous times and I can't get enough of their tappas and sangria.  Great food, but don't expect great service..there are times where I had to walk up to a waiter myself just to get him to come to our table.  Plus they would not seat you until all your party has arrived.  You can't make reservation so I don't recommend going in a large group on Tuesday because you might not be able to get a table until an hour later.
