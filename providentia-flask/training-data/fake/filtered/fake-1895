Let me begin by saying one word, "Disgusting!!" Â  The food arrived, at first glance we spotted a long crusty human hair engulfed in batter....after removing the contaminated item we attempted to choke down some food....The spring rolls were great..chicken was rubbery..fried rice was flavorless....as for everything else I am without words...not a good place to eat..
