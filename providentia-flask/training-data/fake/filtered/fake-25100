This is one of the best "authentic pizzas" in New York City. I am a native Italian and I know what authentic Italian food means. This pizza has it all: it is cooked in a wood fire pizza oven shipped directly from Naples, it is skillfully handcrafted by a consummate native Italian chef, and the ingredients are super fresh and tasty - I believe, imported from Italy.
