I was extremely happy with the service and food. We were a party of 6 and everything went flawlessly. We often go out to restaurants between 6 to 8 of us and it is hard to find a restaurant that can get it right. Getting it right means to have everyone served at the same time. From appetizers to entrees, all was very good. It is very difficult to please all the guests in your party but this place managed to do that. Thank you. The majority of the people had the Filet Mignon special and they couldn't say enough good things about it. All were extremely pleased. One had the shellfish special which included Lobster, shrimp, and clams. Again, very tastey, and one had the Chicken Parm. Well, if I had to say one negative, it would be the person who got the chicken parm, actully ordered shrimp parm. He said he tried it and it was so good he didn't want to take it back. We will be back. And be sure to BYOB. No liquor, which I love.
