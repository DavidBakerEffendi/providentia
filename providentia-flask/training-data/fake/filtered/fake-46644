The worst service I have experienced in a very long time. From the extremely rude, uninterested reception to the nowhere to be found waitress to the lazy bus boy who only picked up our plates when we asked -- 15 minutes after eating. The food is good but NOT WORTH IT. The service is so bad. Go somewhere else.
