Ducked into Yerba Buena enroute to meet friends in the LES on a treacherous snowy evening.  I'm in a wheelchair so everything from sidewalks to the subways are challenges on the best of days and absolutely brutal in these conditions.  The words "should've stayed home" crossed my mind often. And yet, Yerba Buena changed all that and made it more than worthwhile to get out this evening! We were greeted at the door by Giovanni, who ushered my party through the bar area to a table in the restaurant.  Our server made sure I was comfortable, adjusting the tables to work perfectly for our 4 top.  That's just the beginning, drinks were excellent (Azteca & Pico Sour), and food was delicious (ceviche, black cod, and ribeye)!  Everything tasted so FRESH!  Servers and Giovanni were VERY attentive to our needs and accommodated us throughout the evening with bright warm smiles and laughter.  They certainly made us feel like special guests!  All around amazing dining experience, a gem in the LES!
