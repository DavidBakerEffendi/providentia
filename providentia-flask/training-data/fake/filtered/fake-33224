The best 100% Gluten-Free bakery (and maybe the only one) around!! I needed a very special traditional French wedding cake (called a croquembouche - a tower of delicate creme puffs held together by strands of caramelized sugar) for a small anniversary party I was throwing for my parents. I was told about a year ago that I needed to stop eating gluten for health reasons. I have never had this cake before and it meant the world to me to be able to have it with my parents on their 30th anniversary. Marilyn, the owner, was not only able to make the cake, but to make it so good that everyone at the party said it was one of the most delicious pastries they have ever had. I can't even begin to describe how special it was!! People were asking me for her business cards at my party!! Beyond the specialty cake she made for me, I have stopped in multiple times to try the pastries in her shop and some of the lunch options. I've had the pizzetta with quinoa side salad, I've tried her cookies, bread pudding, brownies, danishes and baguettes. I find that some of the pastries that have sat out all morning can be a little dry (which tends to be the nature of gluten-free baking) but for the most part everything tastes just as good as if it were made with wheat flour. When you are strictly gluten-free and you stumble upon a place like Marilyn's Wild Flour Bakery, it's like striking gold. She is a gifted baker. I will definitely be a loyal customer, if not for the variety of creations that surprise me every time I come in, then for the yummy fresh bread that you can't get from the supermarket. I'm so happy I found this place!!
