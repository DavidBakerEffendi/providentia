The service here is beyond terrible. They had the slightest rush and the spaced out bartender could not handle it at all -- and she was really rude about it. People were 3 deep at the bar for no reason other than an inability to bartend competently. All I wanted to do was spend lots of money and we couldn't even get a drink order in. Â It even took 20 minutes just to ask for a check. Imagine if we tried to order food. Skip it.
