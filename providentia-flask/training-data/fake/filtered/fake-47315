What ever you say, this restaurant is improving every day.. Food is fantastic and waitstaff is friendly from the hostess , bartenders & managers. All seem to be working in unisone with smiles on their faces. Salmon is the best around as is the jumbo lump crabmeat pasta. The bar has a warm feeling with large tvs a plus. 24 draft beers and many interesting bottles. We had agreat time talking to the knowagble bar tender about all the beers. He let us sample a few before we decided. We are glad they are open...
