This place is definitely overrated. The food is OK, but since I do not eat pork, I ended up not having choices, which is unexpected for such a place in the center of Manhattan. Also, it was very loud, we had to scream at each other, and the waiters were constantly shouting the name of the dishes, as if anyone would recognize it was his or hers order?!?!, it is totally unnecessary and very annoying. So Ippudo is a big disappointment and does not deserve the 1h30 hours of waiting.
