Cracker Barrel can only be described as safe when it comes to their food selections. Nothing they serve is the best Ive ever had. Their wait-staff while always friendly, varies in quality. Experiences vary, sometimes there have been no problems with our meal. Other visits however, we've received the wrong order or orders didnt come. One time, my friend ordered a burger and the waitress immediately noticed the mistake, that cheese wasnt included. She took it back to the kitchen to be remedied right away. After a few minutes, the burger hadn't returned. My food and our other friend's food was getting cold, Â so we ate. After finishing, the burger still hadn't returned, however, our waitress did with our bill. We advised her that we were still waiting for the burger to return. She was very embarrassed and immediately left and returned with the burger. It was very awkward. The store part is very nice and has an interesting selection of seasonal and non seasonal items but its very crowded and not always easy to browse at your leisre. I also do not like that you have to pay your meal's bill at the register in the store rather than with the waitress at your table.
