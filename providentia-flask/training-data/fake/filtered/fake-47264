A group of 10 of us went last night (had made reservations since I knew it was a small place).  We were seated immediately.  Ambiance is very nice, not what you would expect from pulling up to the strip mall.   Our waiter, Charlie, was awesome!  He was friendly, attentive, helpful with food suggestions and accommodated our request for a candle in a gelato for a birthday we were celebrating. All the food was delicious - from the appetizers to the entrees to the desserts & coffee.  The bread in the basket was delicious.  We ended up being there 4 hours so we really enjoyed ourselves! I spoke to the Chef/Owner at the end, who was very nice and helpful.   We'll definitely be returning again when we want to celebrate a special occasion and stay local!
