Love love love it. This is what Philadelphia is all about. I have been to Audrey Claire a few times now and have yet to have one bad experience. I am a very picky eater as well as someone who has been declared as a pain in the ass diner by my friends and still have never left there unsatisfied. You cannot go to Audrey Claire and not order the seared brussel sprouts with shaved Parmesan. Sad to say it, but I have been a vegetarian for going on seven years and I have never had a sprout up until I went to Audrey's and now I am the biggest fan. The sprouts are perfectly done. The seared part of the sprout has a little bit of a smokiness to it and the fresh Parm just completely melts in your mouth. The last sprout is the best and the absolutely worst. Why? Because at the bottom of the bowl is a little bit of butter and oil which has been marinating the hell out of that last sprout and cheese and now your mouth party is over...until next course. Everyone I have ever taken to the restaurant ends up falling in love with it. It is casual but sexy, due to the candle lit room, and has a homey feeling, due to the ruckus of the enthusiastic diners. All I can say is anything you order will be cooked with such mouth watering flavors that you and your fellow table-mates will be sharing everything and coming back again a week later. The only problem is there are no reservations on the weekends so plan to be seated and hour after you arrive. No big deal. Stop at their sister restaurant across the street "Twenty Manning Grill", grab a drink, and wait for them to call. The wait, taste, and price are so worth it.
