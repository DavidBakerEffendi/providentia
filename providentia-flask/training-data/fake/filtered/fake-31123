This place used to be flavour of india , located @ the corner of the strip mall. We went for a  friday dinner , it was crowded. The waiter gave us a round table and we ordered Nimbu soda which was served very quick. The quality of food was extremely increased good  from the previous management . The waiter (Varun) recommended us gobi manchurian (dry) from their indo-chinese options which was  excellent. Service was very good, polite and quick. Biriyani and the Gulab Jamun was also good. Breads were soft and we found they don't use egg in NAAN'S. At the end the waiter (Varun) served us coplementary masala chai which was very kind of him. He gave us a $5 coupon for take-out. Over all Food & Service was excellent than the previous (Flavour of India) management. Keep up the good work and thank you for taking care of us.
