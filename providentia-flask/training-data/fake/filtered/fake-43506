i so much was looking forward to good cuban food well  didnt find it service was horrible  had to ask for menu fork napkin plates for appitizers which the empanadas were cold on the inside the pernil was  a little old rice was alittle crunchy  the steak was overdone on the ends and raw in the middle . i so much wanted good cuban restaurant in the area but oh well. lost $60.00 today
