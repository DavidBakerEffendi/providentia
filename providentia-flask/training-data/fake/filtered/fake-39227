I stopped by RTM while in Philly on business.  Salumeria caught my eye.  Thanks Mat for taking such good care of me.  You really made the experience memorable.  I appreciated you carefully choosing cheeses I might like and spending so much time making sure I had a just the right cheese selection.  Also purchased olives, crackers, chocolate and Blackberry jam.  Looking forward to my al fresco dinner.  Thanks again for your help and care.
