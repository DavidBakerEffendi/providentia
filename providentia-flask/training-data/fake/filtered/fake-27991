Although the other reviews make some good points, they seem to miss certain things: You see, this restaurant has a history that dates back almost a decade. Moving from Franklin Ave, Nutley Â to Montclair and back to its rightful home in Nutley, this restaurant has been serving happy customers for many many years. The restaurant is a mom and pop place so you cannot come here and expect the fanciness of a 5 star restaurant or American chain restaurants like Applebee's or Olive Garden. What you can expect is great food at decent portions for a good price. The food is very authentic, take it from a native! I will agree and say the service is a bit slow, depending on the day. If you come on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday evening, expect to wait. The restaurant is small and can only accommodate so much at once. My advice is to come between 3-6pm on weekdays or any other evening; the restaurant is normally slower so you will have the place all to yourself. I also have to give a lot of credit to the servers. The young men who work there are extremely polite and if they don't know an answer, they will tell you truthfully but do their best to get an answer for you. However, try asking for Christina. She's the best! A tiny waitress with a big personality, she is simply adorable. Do not be afraid to strike up a conversation with the servers, for it will only make your experience better and their work day happier. After all, being a waiter is a tough job whether or not we customers realize it.
