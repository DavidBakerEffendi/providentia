We were dropping our freshman off at PENN and staying at a nearby hotel. This restaurant came recommended by a foodie friend. Well i have good news and not so good Â news. First the not so good. Service was a bit too relaxed, we were there late and only a few other tables were occupied. The Greeting by our waitress was slow even to ask for drink order. She brought water to the table at room temperature, i had to ask her to please get us cold water. My wife's first wine came also un-chilled. Our main course took too long to arrive, and when i ordered a second glass of wine with the arrival of our main course, the wine took so long to get my wife popped up to track down the waitress. Now the good news. Food was excellent. Starter Bib Salad was so fresh and tasty. i got the heirloom tomato salad. We actually combined the two salads into one tasty tasty tasty treat. Loved the spicy yogurt sauce that came with the tomatoes. The main course was the scallops with corn mushrooms and candied bacon.... really tasty and a good size portion My wife and son shared the Hamburger which was tasty and done to perfection. They also got the Mac and cheese, now this was my favorite dish of the night rich and creamy full of flavor. This place is worth a try, creative and fresh food, nice atmosphere, just hope you get more attentive service. I would recommend this restaurant
