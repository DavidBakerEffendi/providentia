The food (especially the Red Onion sandwich) is delicious, if a little overpriced. However, the employees are rude, unkempt/unshowered, snotty hipsters who never smile and are often so high as to need the order repeated. Seriously, fire them, and you'd get better ratings (I'm clearly not the only person who thinks this) and much more business.
