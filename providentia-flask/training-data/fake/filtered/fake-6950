At this point, if I go back to Bagel Box it's my own fault-I should know not to expect the right order and not to expect friendly service. This has happened the 4x I've been there-you're probably thinking-why do you go back? They are close by and it is convenient. At this point, I will be happy to drive out of my way to Manhattan Bagel where they never get my order wrong, appear to be happy ( unlike the girls at bagel box who curse and moan the entire time you are there) and I am pretty sure the prices are better. Not going back again.
