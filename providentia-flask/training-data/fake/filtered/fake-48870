Went to barrel house on its first Friday open. Very busy. We did get an awesome table for our large party after waiting not too long. Beer list was excellent and the bottle list extensive. Service was good considering how busy it was and it being the first week. As for the food, I was most disappointed with the size for the money. The French fry appetizers were tasty but they could have fit many more fries in the serving dishes. Or they could have used smaller dishes! The burger was tasty but I didn't understand the double patty especially because it was not covered in cheese. Lettuce and tomato would have been great or at least made the plate appear more full. Or they could have given more fries! There are many places nearby with more impressive burger plates. Hopefully they will improve. Also the falafel burger looked more like fried fish than falafel. Overall great beers and food that needs some work or at least some super sizing.
