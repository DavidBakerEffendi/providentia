Worst fish and chips I ever ate. I have had better fish from a Gorton's freezer bag. Whatever fish they used it was a very light white fish that was not hearty enough.  It honestly felt like tilapia. I also thought I ordered french fries with a side of fish. There was three times more fries than fish. They do come with a coleslaw that tasted like mayonaise with a crunch.  Absolutely no spices were used to make it. My wife got blackened chicken sliders that were as blackened as a boiled hot dog. No spice or flavor on those either. Not sure why but all dishes came with dill pickles even when it wasn't warranted but that was the best part of my fish and chips. Will avoid eating here as much as possible unless I am forced to be here when I am hungry.
