is it the best pizza in nyc?  i liked it, but i'll let you be the judge.  coal fired pizza is pretty cool, though i was starving at the time and we waited in line for an hour...so just about anything would have been fine.  i'd go back again though the line kind of turns me off.  if it were closer i'd probably do take out.
