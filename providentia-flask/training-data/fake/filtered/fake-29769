This is such a lovely place. Friendly, homey, light and open atmosphere, wonderful yummy healthy options, interesting beer menu. Specifically loved the roasted chicken, the beets, stuffed zucchini, brussels sprouts and kale. Basically, we loved it all. The owner was there and took time to speak with us, make recommendations, tell us about her vision...her energy, spark, and enthusiasm is contagious. We LOVE this place and will definitely be coming back.
