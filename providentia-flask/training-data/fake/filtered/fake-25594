Came here for breakfast and the place is a decent size restaurant. There was no wait as I had read in previous reviews but that is mainly due to us coming in for breakfast during a weekday. Don't see the issue with waiting as a good restaurant will always have a wait. I had the french toast and a side of potato which was great. My girlfriend had the housemade granola and said it was one of the best she's ever had. She also liked the coffee and she's a major coffee snob. I read someone didn't like the coffee but I've driven around just to get her coffee before and if she says the coffee is good than I believe her. Overall it's a good place with great food. Service was pleasant and it was all very easy in my eyes.
