Wow my experience was nothing like the first reviewer. Angelo's has opened and I have been there two times now, the first for lunch, we ordered the grilled chicken/mozz/arugula sandwich with a personal 4 cheese pizza. Delicious! We then brought our parents back with us for dinner. We brought our own wine, which is always nice. Ordered apps, small portions... each a dinner and then dessert/coffee. The food was great, again. They did forget to bring out salads and the food took a bit long to come out but we did have a party of 6 and the restaurant was full. We have also ordered the french onion soup as a pick up and it was perfect, will order again!! Try this restaurant, a real treat!!!
