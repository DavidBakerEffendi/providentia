First off let me say I've lived in Philly my whole life.  I had them all Geno's, Pat's, Tony Lukes, Jims and just about every other place in the city.  Dalessandro's IS THE BEST.  The idiots who stand in line at the other places for hours are tourists who don't know better. The only line I would stand in line for hours is Dalessandro's.  If you are from Philly then you know to go here.   They did change owners but the meat and cheeses are the same from the ORIGINAL owners suppliers. The new owners owned it for two months, changed it, lost most of the customers then resold the place to the current owners.  The current owners knew the original owners who made it famous and went with the original suppliers  The only difference is the new owners added cheese whiz. The guy working the grill been there for years and still makes the best cheesesteak.  They have every bottle of beer, the service is great and the employees are the best. They treat me like family everytime, unlike most places in Philly.  Bottom line is they're the best, always busy, always consistent and always tasty.  If you want a REAL CHEESESTEAK go here. The place is always packed for a reason... they're the best!
