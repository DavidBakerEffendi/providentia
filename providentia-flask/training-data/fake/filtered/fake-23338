This place is horrible!!  The food took forever to be delivered and it was definitely not worth the wait or money.  The 'Soup of the Day' was awful.  It had absolutely no taste just pure oil and cream.  The Shrimp Marinara was edible at best but they gave like 4 shrimp.  It was a complete rip-off.  I am never ordering from this place again.
