Went here for taco Tuesday and was very pleased.  The waitress was very nice and friendly.  We had the taco Tuesday special which was unlimited tacos for around 10 bucks.  The tacos were great, they were made to order and brought out promptly every time.  The tacos came in many varieties and I wish I had enough room to try them all.
