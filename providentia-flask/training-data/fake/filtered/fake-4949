I used to go to the Montville Diner regularly years ago. The food was quite acceptable then. But my husband and I went back one day last week, and we had the worst food ever! I had stuffed cabbage, and their was no liquid in the stuffing. It was just dried out cooked beef and rice, with no seasoning. It was absolutely awefull! My husband ordered a side of spinach and rice, and it smelled worse than dog food and tasted worse. I had to spit it out. Tasted like old canned spinach mixed with dried out rice. Needless to say we will NEVER go back there again!!
