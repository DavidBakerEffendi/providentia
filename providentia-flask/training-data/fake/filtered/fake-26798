Who doesn't love the Smith? It's a classic beginner New York restaurant -where you come when you first move here or take your friends visiting from out of town on a weeknight or for breakfast - but the food is so yummy that it doesn't matter. Randomly, their shellfish dishes are exceptional (mussels and oysters), but lately I've been getting the Bibimbap with vegetables, rice and egg. NYU students, rejoice!
