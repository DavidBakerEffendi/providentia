I Â went based on previous reviews and was disappointed. The salad dressing was spoiled and the place was pretty dirty. The bathroom was downright disgusting. Hey Honeys, How about hiring enough help so the waitstaff isnt cleaning up dirty dishes and garbage and then handling food? Just a thought. The reviews had to have been written by family and friends. Pure fiction. Had better at IHOP.
