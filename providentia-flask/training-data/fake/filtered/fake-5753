The food and service is excellent. I had the penne a la vodka as someone here recommended and it was the best pasta I have had! The waitress was really friendly and when we were finnish we were offered dessert on the house, amazing ice-cream! I'm really glad that we followed the yelp reviews and found the great restaurant!
