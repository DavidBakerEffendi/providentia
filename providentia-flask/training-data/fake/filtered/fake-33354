Audrey Claire is amazing. With amazing entrees, a simple but cozy ambiance and the best mussels Philadelphia has tasted, Audrey Claire can guarantee a wonderful evening. The service is top-notch as well; the waiters were knowledgeable, helpful and very friendly. I could go on at some length about the mussels - most restaurants neglect the sauce, choosing to restrict themselves to simply serving fresh mussels. The magic behind Audrey Claire's mussels is in the zesty tomato based soup that the mussels come with. Light but plentiful, the mussels make for ideal appetizers. We order two entrees - the penne arrabiata with the grilled tiger shrimp and the roast duck. The penne and shrimp were superb but the sauce stole the show again. It was similar to the soup that accompanied the mussels but that was hardly reason for complaint. The duck was less than perfect however, it was little too tough and a little too dry for our liking.
