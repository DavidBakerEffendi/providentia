I love Indian food and have eaten at many Indian restaurants;  Kochi is one of the best Indian restaurants I have been too.  It offers a unique, savory and authentic menu.  The people are very nice and accommodating as well.  The prices are on par with most other establishments.  The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and has ample parking in a convenient location.  I recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to have great food, served by nice people in a nice environment.
