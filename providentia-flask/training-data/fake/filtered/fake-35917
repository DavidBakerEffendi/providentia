Please do not  order for takeout.  We ordered the special calzone and the Martigan pizza. Pizza was not done, soggy with black burnt crust (gross!). Calzone was barely filled, completely charred on the top and absolutely soggy on the bottom. Not only was the taste sub par, but the food made us completely sick, probably due to it not being cooked thoroughly. It is a shame that such a well known establishment thinks they can get away with serving something so charred and undercooked.  Will never order from there again.
