I love this place during the warm season! Tasty margaritas, amazing tacos and sweet corn, great crowd/vibe, and a commitment to environmental justice and sustainability, Habana is a real treat. During law school, you could catch me here at least every other week, and now I try to make it at least once a month. If you haven't been, you need to go PDQ, before it gets cold out and they close up shop for the winter.
