If you are in New York and you do not make the time to go here for Pizza you are seriously missing out on somethying special. There is a reason on Friday and Saturday night that there are lines. The pizza is amazing. It is old school, thin crust, hand made, fresh toppings heaven. You are literally crammed into the restaurant on busy nights. When you get your food, you are happy to be knocking elbows with a stranger next to you. It is a great atmosphere every time I have been regardless of how busy it is. There are just so many happy people enjoying the fantastic pizza. You are right by the bridge and can go for a walk before or after eating on a date. Parking as well as the lines to get in can be a pain sometimes. This is one of the only places I will wait to get in and feel like it was worth it when I leave. You must go. It is that good.
