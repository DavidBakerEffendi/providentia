You can't be too picky, as this is one of the only Indian food options in the area. But compared to other restaurants, even in other regions in Vermont, it's just ok. The decor is a little shabby, and some of the dishes are just edible (mulligatawny soup on our last visit, for example). If you've got a hankering for Indian and are not too choosy, this is your place.
