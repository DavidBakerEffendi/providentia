Great place to walk around on a lunch break. TONS to look at, bread to sample, and such good focaccia when I'm in need of a quick, cheap lunch. Arancini at the panini counter are always a good choice, too. Never actually bought the cured meats or cheeses they sell here, but they have an insane selection and the prosciutto is priced about the same as it is at my local grocery store.
