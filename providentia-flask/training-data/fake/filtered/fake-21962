Absolutely love this place and have been going since I was a kid.  Lunchtime is pretty hectic but they have such a variety of vendors that you don't mind the crowds. I started a tradition with my granddaughter and she and I travel down the day before Thanksgiving, pick up some baked goods, have lunch and then hop back on the train.  I love when family comes to Philly to visit because this is a place they always want to stop at.
