I was charged $10 for a burned, greasy so-called extra large side order of Mac n Cheese which was stuffed into a Chinese food container. They charged $5 for a side order of disgusting potatoe salad that made my child naseated. Did I mention the 5 inch steroid induced porkchop that was raw inside? I will NEVER eat there again. The wait time is crazy, I wasted nearly $35. I threw the food away! They don't even have paper menu's! The woman at the register is wicked, evil.
