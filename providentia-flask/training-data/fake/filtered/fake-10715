Went out to dinner last night - in a group of four women.  We had a 6:30 reservation.  We ordered appetizers, dinner, and desserts with coffee.  Even before we were finished with the desserts, our waitress dropped the bill off at the table.  Less than five minutes later - and before we were done with our coffee - the manager came to the table and picked up the billing and asked us if it was done because he needed our table.  Really?  The food was outstanding but this experience left a very bad taste in my mouth.  You do not rush people out of your restaurant the moment a meal is done and expect a good review - or repeat business. Bottom line is that the food is outstanding but I would order it take-out next time.  I like to be able to finish my coffee/dessert before getting rushed out.
