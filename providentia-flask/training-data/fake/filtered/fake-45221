SAKE BOMB BUFFET is the BEST.  It has a ton of sushi, great Chinese food and a lot of dim sum.  Also they have to die for soft-shell crabs and chicken feet.  If you love Asian buffets this is the place for you. Sake Bomb has great food, great prices, and great people. Also they have a sweet hibachi section where you can choose food and they will cook it for you.  ALSO THEY MAKE CREPES THERE WHICH IS GREAT AND IS SOMETHING THAT MANY DO NOT KNOW.  Sake bomb is the bomb.
