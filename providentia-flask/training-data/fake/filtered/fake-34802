Omg with few words...the best food I ever had in the last three years. I went to this amazing restaurant few days ago with a friend. We had the appetizer of roasted artichoke with goat cheece and the cups of tuscan bean soup, but this pleasure of the velum would not stop there...The sea scollips were simply amazing with the red wine ginger sause and the fresh green beans on top. The owner gave us a little bit taste of their delicious tyramisou, so kind of her. The service was on time our waitress was so kind and pleasant. The prices were reasonable and we could also bring our own wine and this made it for us more affordable. Great Place for those who know what to eat and enjoy their meal!
