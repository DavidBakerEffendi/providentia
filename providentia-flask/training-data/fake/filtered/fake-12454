So Parisian chic. These macarons were delightful. The line wasn't too bad, and once I got in, I was greeted by an adorable scene. The walls and furniture were all pastel green. It looked like my ideal fairytale; it was whimsical, playful, and elegant all at the same time. There was something about the decor that told me what I was in store for. I almost (almost) felt like I was in Paris myself. I bought a box of 12. The boxes are really pretty themselves. Some of the ones I bought were: Salted Caramel Chocolate Vanilla Pistachio Rose Petal Lemon Coffee Raspberry Black currant violet For some of them, I bought doubles. My favorites out of all were the salted caramel, the lemon, and the vanilla. My least favorite was probably the rose petal. I heard great things about it, but in the end, I wasn't so pleased with it. Maybe it was too hyped up? Macarons themselves aside, damn! They were expensive. The consolation was that they took a while for me to finish. I ate two, and put the rest in the fridge to enjoy later. For macarons, it's better to enjoy them sooner than later, I believe. My macarons tasted the best straight from the store. A day after, they were still yummy, but a little less than the day before. Laduree macarons are the perfect way into my heart. If a man bought me a box of these (or you know, a trip to France), I'd marry him right away.
