I'm not sure what all the fuss is over this place. The food is so-so. Basic, bland Mexican. A little pricey for the size. Service is also average.  I will admit they have an extensive margirita  selection, which are pretty tasty.   Nothing horrible, but certainly not worth the sometimes 1.5 hour wait.
