Yummy. Truly one of the best pizza's ever eaten. This place is tied for me with Modern Pizza. I went on a weekday afternoon so no waiting in lines for me :) They also had a booster seat for my one year old (kid-friendly!). The pizza was amazing of course and if you're ever in New Haven and don't want to wait in a long line, go on a weekday early afternoon. :D
