Bistango is a casual trattoria that hits all the right notes. The staff is welcoming. The decor is clean and uncluttered. The food is exceptional. I had lasagna - it was covered in gooey and chewy mozzarella and a meaty Bolognese sauce that was out of this world. Dining companion had capellini with shrimp and spinach, and she did not leave any on her plate. Other dining companion, who has gluten intollerance pigged out on pasta with Bolognese sauce - most of menu can be prepared gluten-free. Prices are more than reasonable. This is a place you want to return to again and again.
