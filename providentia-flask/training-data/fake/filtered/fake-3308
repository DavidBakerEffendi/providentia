We visited Enzo's last night based on the sterling reviews we read on line.  I can't tell you how disappointed my family was.  We arrived at 5pm last evening which was a Sunday.  We were the first table seated.  The waiter promptly took our order.  We got the salad which was nothing out of the ordinary.  In fact I have had better salads at the local diners.  Then the four of us proceeded to wait one hour to be served our entrees.  If the food was extraordinary or even good, it would have been worth the wait.  But it was mediocre at best.  My daughter opted for chicken piccata.  It was rather tasteless but the chicken was tender.  My husband, chicken with mushrooms which he described as Ok.  My other daughter ordered the eggplant parmesan which tasted good with the first couple of bites but as she ate it, she liked it less and less.  I had the same experience eating my chicken capri which was chicken with eggplant, capicola and cheese.  As we ate our food, we liked it less and less.  For me, there was an odd taste to the tomato sauce.  I could not recommend this restaurant to anyone.
