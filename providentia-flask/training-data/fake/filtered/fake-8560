I recently went to this rest. for lunch with my friends. And have to say this place is decent in terms of food, quality and quantity. Everything we ordered was good. Esp. the chicken makhani with the naan. And have to try the Chi. noodles which was for starter. Overall we had great experience In short good food for great price.
