Came here for a late lunch (perfectly timed for their sunset menu). The guy at the bar that seated us could've been more polite but our waiter made up for it. For the sunset order I had their sesame mushrooms, beef pad thai and their awesome milk tea. The ice cubes are frozen tea so it doesn't dilute as it melts, genius! Â Also, I appreciate that our waiter kept refilling or glasses of water, he was very attentive. Downside is that it is tiny and a bit cramped. I highly recommend coming during sunset hours
