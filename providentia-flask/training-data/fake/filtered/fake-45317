I have had an opportunity to attend Rizzuto's on a number of occasions with friends and have always found it a great place. Â The staff is friendly and very accommodating. I had the Organic Arugula Salid with goat cheese the other night with chicken and it was great. I've tried the a number of the homemade Pasta dishes and enjoyed them all. My favorite might be the Salmon. In addition, there's a long bar and a number of tables and Chairs for viewing your favorite team on one side of the restaurant. The atmosphers and the food is great. Bring you own bottle of wine for a $15 corking fee.
