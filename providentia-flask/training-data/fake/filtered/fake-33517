I love this place. Good food at good prices, what else can you ask for. There must be a reason there is almost a line to order. The ambiance is early Brooklyn Pizzeria, and the food lives up to it. The pizza is dependably tasty and is always hot and cheesy. I especially like the chicken parmigiana sandwich, which I could eat three times a week. If you are looking for good food at affordable prices, this is the place. Right across the street from Rutgers.
