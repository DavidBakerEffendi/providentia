The food is high-quality, well-cooked, and tasty, but the value ratio is low.   My wife and I just had lunch and it cost $42 for a bowl of soup, one smalle crab cake (my wife thought they must have forgotten to put another one on the plate), and an ice cream sandwich (no drinks).  We are very small eaters so it was sufficient, but there are other quality place like the Ferry House where the value ratio is better. The place was packed, so obviously this is a minority opinion.
