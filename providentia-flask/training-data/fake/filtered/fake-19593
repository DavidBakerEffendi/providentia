Absolutely love this place.  Miss livin right around the corner cuz you can't beat the lunch special.  Nobody believes me downtown that u can find great sushi at a great price here.  And honestly that's fine with me and my girl cuz we never have to wait for a table.  We have had some offerings from their american chinese menu and were happy with it.  How can boneless spare ribs be bad?  The secret is the maki rolls and sashimi platters.  Always delicious and the presentation is beautiful and well thought out.  Servers are always friendly as well as the chefs.  I have one complaint after 2 yrs of goin here.  I stepped in dog poo while outside smokin last week, but that wasn't even in front of their place.  We try to go here atleast 3 times a month and they always take care of us.  Keep in mind I'm a server downtown and have been in the biz for 12 yrs.  This place is amazing and definetly a hidden gem in the neighborhood.  They recently stopped sellin beer and wine and are now byob.  Which for me makes it even more cheap and delicious cuz I can get another roll or sashimi instead of a kirin if I bring my own.  Great staff, great food, clean place, 5 stars all the way.
