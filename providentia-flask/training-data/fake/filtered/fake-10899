We're fans of Vietnamese food in our house. Tonight, a Tuesday, we went over to Huong Viet because my son's favorite, Binh Duong, is closed on Tuesday nights. He wanted his Phô Tai, and we've enjoyed the food before, so off we went. Well. As other reviewers have said, this is not the place to go if you want good service or ambiance. In fact, the waitstaff (and possibly owner or manager?) did not make us feel welcome at all. We were not asked how things were, we were not asked if we wanted anything else, we were not given the proper amount of dishes, and it took eons to get our check. I'm giving Huong Viet 3 stars because of the food (the service was so bad that I felt like giving it 1 star, but that wouldn't be totally fair). The food is delicious. I am a big fan of the crispy sweet potato nests with shrimp (really, should come in an entrée-sized portion, they were so good). My son liked his Phô. We also had a fish red curry - amazing sauce! - and a shrimp with lemongrass dish. No complaints about the food. However, the service was so off-putting, and we prefer Binh Duong (which is more conveniently located anyway) that we don't really feel the need to hurry back. I mean, maybe for take-out, but probably not. The one semi-saving grace for me, and I was alone in this, was the very, VERY loud couple dining by the window. They were so belligerent, and so loud, and so indiscreet, that it actually became entertaining. The guy seemed practically apoplectic! So thanks, loud couple, for providing comic relief during our lengthy wait for the check.
