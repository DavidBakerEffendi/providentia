I went to eat today. i ordered a salmon manakeesh it was disgusting. i had to throw it out. the salmon actually looked like throw up. also it was just salmon nothing else on the flatbread. i think you should have a complete meal like a leaf vegetable. the bakalava was delicious. i would just go there for that.
