A new and fantastic addition to Hanover, this makes picking up dinner or lunch on the go easy. Pick your noodle, pick a sauce and pick your veggies and protein and off into a pan it goes. Minutes later a filling and tasty meal for 9 bucks. From what I hear this is the same family as China Station, so I am already impressed.
