I've been there more times than I can count, so clearly I really like it.  I'm always happy with the quality of the food - especially the burgers, nachos and fish and chips.  The basement seating is a little strange, but the ground level has a lot of charm.  70% of the time I have had great service there.  It's only the other 30% that keeps me from giving it 5 stars.  If you're unfortunate enough to get the one/two crappy servers it can put a damper on your experience.  Luckily, I almost never get them!
