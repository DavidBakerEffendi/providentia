I am heartbroken to write this review. This place was awesome the first two times I went there, but last night sucked royally. An hour and a half into dinner they came to the table and said that they switched my mom's talapia out for cod which subsequently made the service late by 45 minutes. We were there for 2 and a half hours, had to flag the waiter down for bread because we were starving. I guess the other issue is the food, while it is good even though my wife and dad hated theirs (he had a puny Filet Mignion, she had the Short Ribs) it's just not exciting. It's the typical fine dining restaurant where there is more plate than food on the dish, it was a very Nicholas in Red Bank empty experience. To boot, on a Saturday night there were no specials. No matter where we go, we usually choose the specials because they are supposed to be the freshest. They covered desert and they also took 10% off the bill due to the wait. It was an experience that I was looking forward to and it really fell short. For the money ($145/couple) and the drive (1hr), it's just not worth going back to a restaurant with a very small limiting menu and no specials that is at this point not consistent with the food. Should have gone to Basil T's in Red Bank, at least they are consistent, and right down rt35. Restaurants have to know that consistency in standards are number 1. Now that they are no longer consistent, I don't feel like taking the chance or the drive and the money to have a shitty night out. This place is now a gamble for me and my family.
