It doesn't look they need another good review but I'm going to give it to them.  This establishment is wonderful.  They are not only 100% vegan, but use and promote sustainable practices in every which way.  The food is yummy, the coffee is great, and the staff is kind, knowledgeable, and cute. They always have special in-season drinks/food which cannot be missed. Some carnivores get scared approaching a vegan establishment like this as if they'll get burned at the stake, but you won't feel that way here. If you ask for skim milk they kindly point you to the array of non-dairy milks like almond, soy and rice oh my! There are also pamphlets available to learn the truth and a whole library in the back so you can sit with a good read. I love them and they are a reason I wish I still lived in Philly. PS Dogs are welcome!
