I would liked to have rated them 5 stars but could not consciously do so.  The food is amazing, and brought me back to my childhood.  The physical atmosphere is great, plain and simple also bringing me back to the days growing up in the burg.  The main issue is the way the owner yells at his employees.  You can hear him into the dining area, it makes me feel uncomfortable and un easy.  This guy needs a visit from Steve Irvin or the other guy from Kitchen Nightmares.  I could never work for him, and do not know how these young kids do work for a man constantly yelling and berating them.  As much as I love their dogs, and trust me they are the best and exactly like the originals I will not go back unless he gets a dose of humbling reality and treats his employees better.
