I am not from the area, but I've had an internship down the road from this place, and I decided to give it a try after reading the first review. I must say I wasn't let down at all. I initially went to Giulio's for my lunch break which is like 5 minutes further away. But after trying out Mom and Pop's I never went back. The calzones are mcuh bigger, and in my opinion, much better than those at Giulios, and they are less expensive. On a side note, when they got my order slightly off once, they gave me my next meal for free. Unfortunately I am finished with my internship this week, but I thought it my duty to spread the word. I joined this site for the specific purpose of rating their restaurant. Again, very friendly workers, great taste and great value just about sums them up.
