This will be my birthday party spot next year. I like this business because it's good if all your friends have to work and you want to bring the party to them. I think they offer moderate prices for shots and I like how they keep the interior. You can take some good pictures with friends throughout the night and the DJ will put on your music and let you guys dance. It's a great place to mingle and as a model I love to hold celebrations and go out at night so spending time at the lounge is a must. This venue really has style and it's a location that's close to my heart. I can get here on the bus if I have to and my friends have no problem finding it in the car.
