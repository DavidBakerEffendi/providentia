There is nothing wrong with a $6 plate/platter or $4 sandwich of chicken over rice or combo(gyro/chicken over rice) with the white and spicy red sauce. There is always a line though. Today, I waited around 30 minutes in the 20 degree weather to get my food and it was well worth it! Even if you are a vegetarian, they do have fallafel over rice too! I would highly recommend this food cart to all tourists and of course, the native New Yorkers know about it already!
