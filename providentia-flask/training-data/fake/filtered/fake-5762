This was our first time to Little Italy... And our first time to this quaint little Italian gem! The owner was making meatballs when we walked in.  It truly doesn't get any more fresh! We ate so much, they had to roll us out the front door. We really enjoyed speaking with the owner about his family history. The menu is HUGE! We tried several different dishes and each was DELISH! Very authentic! Sizes were perfect, presentation very nice as well. This is a VERY SMALL place.  I'm guessing during dinner hours there must be a long wait! If you are visiting NYC, I'd put this place on your must try list!
