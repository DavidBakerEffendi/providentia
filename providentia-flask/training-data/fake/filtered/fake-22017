By far..this is the worst place in the city for me to visit. Decision runs amok until I ultimately make no less than 2 choices -one for lunch, then one for dessert. Lunch- fresh roasted turkey...or mexican...or sushi....or falafel. It's ALL here!! Dessert is usually the to-die-for apple dumplings at the Amish bakery. The buzz and atmosphere is always a joy.
