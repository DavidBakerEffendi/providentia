Grew up in Woodbridge and used to go there after I played high school basketball in the early 70's after every game, and my team always got butt kicked.  I would sit by myself in a booth with a burger and be livid we lost, and the rest of the team and cheerleaders didn't care and were in the other section laughing it up. Forty years later, I am no longer in NJ, but come back a few times a year to visit family, and go back to the Reo to sit in my same booth eating a burger.  Burgers are very good.  Their slogan used to be, "We doze, but never close."  Never had anything other than a burger there.
