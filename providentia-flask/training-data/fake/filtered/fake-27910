It's been almost 2 years since I've been here but I was happy I stayed local for a quick Friday night bite. Easy parking, good service & great food.  Clams in white sauce were devoured in mere seconds.  The stuffed long hots were good, but beware the heat definitely caught me a little off-guard. The strip steak was cooked perfectly and the veal saltimbocca was very good as well. Overall this is a solid BYOB spot where you can get 2 apps, 2 entrees & 2 desserts for about a $100.
