If there was a way to post a negative billion star review I would do it. I was sitting alone saving an extra chair for trivia when a man came up to me and asked me if he could have the chair I was saving. Â There was no one else at tables in the bar. I said that I was saving the chair for trivia and pointed out all the empty tables. Next thing I know the man is screaming obscenities in my face and challenging me to "go outside!" I then learn that this person owns the place. Wow. I will never again set foot in this psychopath's establishment and encourage anyone reading this to avoid the Ivy at all costs. The Tiger's Tale has trivia on Wednesdays and the owner never once challenged me to a fight.
