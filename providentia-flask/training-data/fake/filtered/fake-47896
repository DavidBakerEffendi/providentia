We have been to Skara at least 6 times. Each time was a truly wonderful experience. The menu is varied and very reasonably priced; the food is delicious. The host/owners and all of their staff go out of their way to make your visit exceptional. We especially enjoyed New Year's eve this year. In addition to a regular menu, the selection included a wonderful selection of desserts. We were offered a complimentary Greek specialty - a special cake which has a coin in one of the slices. If you find it, you are assured good luck for the new year. Unfortunately, no one at our table found it, but it was great fun trying. Our favorites are the "chicken chops" and the bifsteka served with spinach rice or Greek lemon potatoes. This time, however, we tried the lamb chops and they quickly became one of our new favorites. If you like great food authentically cooked, along with wonderful hospitality, Skara is a must!
