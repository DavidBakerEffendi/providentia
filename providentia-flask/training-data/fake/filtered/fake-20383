We popped in one night to ask if they were showing the major network TV UFC fight (happens ~1/10 UFC fights). They weren't aware of the event but were happy to put it on for us. Before long, they'd put it up on several screens so more patrons could watch. Our server was friendly and perfectly attentive without being intrusive. We commented amongst ourselves on the much better service at Just Jakes than we'd had at one of the more upscale Montclair eateries earlier the same day. Finally, there were several vegetarian and healthier options on the menu, which we have never seen at another sports bar. We had the veggie burger: Â southwestern patty, kaiser bun, and dill pickle spear were delicious (our visitor from Iowa commented how much better the burger was than what he gets at Buffalo Wild Wings) and the price was competitive. Fries were yummy and the side house salad was made from very fresh mixed greens. We had a fun night with good food and friendly service and will definitely visit Just Jakes again.
