I've read both good and not so good reviews about this restaurant so I made it a mission to try it for myself!  I'm a huge seafood lover and love cajun/creole food, especially seafood boils.  I went way out of the way to find this place and I was not disappointed!  It was so good that I had it 2 days in a row and I was only in NY for 4 days.  I ordered the "boil special spicy" with crawfish, snow crab legs and clams.  OMG just writing this review is making me drool!  It delivered on all aspects.  It was fatty buttery spicy goodness!! Don't bother asking the locals where to find this place cuz no one seems to know that this restaurant even exists...not even the cops!  If you do find this place it kinda looks like it doesn't belong there.  Inside is a very cool vibe.  Dim lighting with limited seats. There were only a couple of quoms I had with this place...1 is that they only take cash but they don't tell you on the phone when you place a take out order and 2 is that the prices on the their website (or lack there of) does not match what you actually pay - I think its been a long while since someone updated that site.  All in all you have to try this place if you are a seafood lover!
