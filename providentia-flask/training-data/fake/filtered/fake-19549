We had our Dad's 90th birthday at Angelo's. Our party had 65 people. Upon arriving the owner, Angelo, greeted us warmly with a wonderful smile. He told us if there was anything we wanted not to hesitate to ask.     The room looked simply beautiful! The tables were elegant and arraigned  beautifully and all 65 of us had plenty of room!       The staff were superb! They could not do enough for us! They catered to our every whim with all smiles!        The food was excellent! The white fist was the best I have ever tasted! Moist and fresh it literally almost melted in your mouth! The roast beef and ham were excellent and the salad was fabulous! Actually everything was wonderful!          Because of Angelo's we had a PERFECT party.           Thank you Angelo's.
