Been to Kafe Neo about 5-6 times - have had both dinner and dessert there and tried several different coffee drinks. Food/drink is always good and no issues with service ever. Maybe a teeny bit slow but I think it's more of the atmosphere being casual and laid back - not bad service. The wait staff is always very friendly. Like the decor, especially the slate floor in the ladies room. My only issue is that they need a better exhaust system as the cafe has that greasy cooking smell which also sticks to your clothes and hair. Other than that, it's one of my favorite places to go. Keep up the good work!
