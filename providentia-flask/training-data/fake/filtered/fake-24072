So happy that this restaurant has reopened.  It is perfect for a celebration for dinner with my son attending Penn nearby.  Great casual atmosphere and beautiful row house.  The dinner was  creative and far more refined than my last visit about a year ago.  We were served 14 courses.  All were imaginative and intensely flavored. Favorites for our group were french onion soup in a spoon, foie gras, eggs Benedict with dippin dots, duck negamaki, squab,  I didn't love the tofu but others at the table did.  The rice pudding was truly awesome,  I can't wait to come back and try new things.  One problem that kept me from giving 5 stars was the pacing missed. Dinner took 3.5'hours and the lulls between courses were occasional annoying. Go and try the place.  Given the fact that we were there on the third night since the reopening I imagine things will get a bit sharper.
