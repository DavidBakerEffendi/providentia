If your white, do not got go to this establishment. There were six of us and the bouncers continuously harassed us for being in the lounge area, According to them, moving  a foot or two to let us into the dance floor  was an inconvenience.  I haven't  been this harassed  by black staff in a long a time and will stay far away from this place. If you like to be treated like a paying customer and do not to be cursed  by black staff, go to somewhere else in the city.
