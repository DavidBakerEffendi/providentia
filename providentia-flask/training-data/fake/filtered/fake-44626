It is a solid, but not transcending dining experience.  The ricotta cheese appetizer was very good, the lamb sliders were good, but not so much that I understand all the raving about them, the artichoke appetizer was interesting, but a bit small and bland.  The two pastas we ate were very good, but one had some starchy residue left on the noodles, showing a kitchen rushing a bit too much. Finally, I ordered the biscotti desert, my husband got the semifreddo (which was very yummy)  I only ate a few of the cookies and asked the the remainder be wrapped to take home.  Imagine my dismay upon getting home, when I realized many of the cookies were not packed up for us, including both chocolate biscotti that I had been looking forward to trying!  Check you doggie bag before you leave!
