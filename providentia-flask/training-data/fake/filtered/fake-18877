I don't know what's wrong with me.  I'd been hearing raves about this place and saw the looooong line of hipsters every night at 2am.  I figured this pizza must be phenomenal.  Well, it wasn't.  It was like artichoke dip covered in ricotta cheese.  I like artichoke dip!!  But not covered in ricotta cheese.  Blech.  Maybe I should come back at 2am after 16 coors lights.  Maybe it'll taste better.
