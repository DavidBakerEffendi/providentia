So I usually use yelp only to browse reviews (I didn't even have an account before this one), but I had to write a review for cafe gaia after going there today. When you enter, it seems homely, and the fact that gaia is behind the counter serving customers herself does nothing to dispel that image. The food itself is extremely fresh (not something that you always find in the mcdonalds age), and the prices just can't be beat. I paid $5 for a panini, which was a steal. I also ended up chatting with gaia for a while, and before I knew it, she gave me a free pastry (puff pastry with nutella oozing out from the inside, and powdered sugar on top). Unreal. My only regret is that I live further uptown, and so I don't think I'll be here as often as I'd want to. For anyone living in the LES, this is a neighborhood gem.
