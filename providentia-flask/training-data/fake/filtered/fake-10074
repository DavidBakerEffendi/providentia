Food was OK, service/delivery was terrible.  Ordered carry-out in the store (3 plain fingers, 1 general tso, 1 buffalo/maple, 1 salted caramel, truffle fries and 2 sauces).  When we arrived home, the 3 plain crunchy fingers were missing from the bag.  Called to request they be delivered (I live 2 blocks away) and they promised to send them.  Over an hour later, nothing has arrived, no phone call, no refund.   The 3 fingers we did receive were OK, but not amazing.  Way better cheap eats in the area (is it still cheap when you pay for two meals but receive 1?) with better service--highly recommended to look elsewhere. UPDATE:  Manager contacted me the next day to apologize, commiserate and offer a refund/credit for next visit.  Two more stars for great follow-up!
