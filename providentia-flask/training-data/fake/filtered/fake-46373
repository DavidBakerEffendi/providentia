I just love drinking green tea out of those little cups! Who doesn't! But this place has some great ramen and the spicy pork is my personal favorite. The fish is also great that's what my boyfriend says, but I don't try it since fish isn't my favorite! Friendly and attentive staff also this is a must go!
