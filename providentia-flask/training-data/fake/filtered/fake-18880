???? What is wrong with you people? Taste's like Creamy Spinach Dip on crust? WTF is that about? As what happened to NYC? This was without a doubt the foulest pizza i've ever had in my life, line out the ass, full of douche hipsters, and that artichoke slice, you're all right, it tasted like creamy spinach dip on crust, but, you know, if i really wanted that, i'd go to au bon pain and get soup in a breadbowl. Â Just absolute foulness
