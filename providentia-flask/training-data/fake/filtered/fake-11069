I've been hearing so many great things about Taqueria so I was glad when we finally made it over. Fish tacos have really been on my mind and what better place to sate myself than the famed Ricky's Fish Tacos? So I went to this place yesterday and ordered three fish tacos and one shrimp taco for Chris and me. They were out of shrimp. Part of my soul died. I guess it's four fish tacos for us. Add a Mexican coke and an horchata to drink. The tacos were out in maybe a minute. Like an actual count of sixty seconds. Super quick. Though, I guess with only one available menu item that kind of stuff happens. We loaded them up with the sauces (I used all three salsas and the crema) and made our way to a nearby table. This place is as casual as it gets. Fold out tables under a pop-up tent in a small parking lot. It's truly sensational. Why add any frills when you're churning out a fish taco that's so gorgeous? And truly - it was a gorgeous taco. The fish literally and sincerely melted (as in it liquified) in my mouth. It was absolutely amazing and tender and perfect. I was the happiest lady. I would recommend this place.
