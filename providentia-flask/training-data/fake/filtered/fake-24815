This place servces Japanese fast food ramen, which is quite unique to find in Philly. The ramen is tasty but can be a bit oily and salty. Prices are a bit expensive, and the menu doesn't have many options to choose from. Overall, the food is good, but if you are watching your sodium/caloric intake and budget, you might want to go somewhere else.
