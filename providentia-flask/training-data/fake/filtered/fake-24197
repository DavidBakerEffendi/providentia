Yes, I had no choice but to eat almost everything on my plate because the portions were small. I wanted desert, but, I was a dollar short when paying for the cheese in the macaroni. I did find an extra five to tip the waitress, it was not her fault. I always try to patronize my people, but a lot of them want to bend the rules of commerce. It was a bad policy. Here is a suggestion, I'm sure you have heard by now. Include the cost of the cheeses n the side order or use a different cheese. It tasted the same anyway no matter how you slice it. Remember a good business person notes that the customer is always right. It makes a lot of sense, 100 cents to be exact.
