We have lived in New Haven for many years, and The Terrace has become our favorite moderately priced restaurant. It is somewhat more expensive than the typical New Haven Thai restaurant, and this is because the menu is original and the food is exceptional. We've been told that Jeff's wife studied under the legendary Paul Bocuse, which seems credible given the quality of her product. We've recently returned from a trip to Thailand and find meals at The Terrace comparable to those we enjoyed there. The King of Thailand is also a jazz musician and Jeff has a neat CD of his performances. Â Business was badly hurt when Jeff became the object of widely publicized allegations. The charges proved to be absurd and have been dropped, but the damage has been severe. It's not clear what motivated his accuser. We love the place. We eat there all the time, not only because of respect and affection for Jeff but for selfish gourmet reasons. We hope that it flourishes.
