I am telling you that you shouldn't go here even though I know you will simply because of who the owner is. I had never heard of this place until my trip to NY City last week. I have too agree with many of the other people here who say that this place is OVERRATED. It is not overrated due to price though, I am from SF and am very used to overpriced food, but rather due to how good the food is. We started with 3 orders of deviled eggs, and a plate of Bouchot Mussels with Tomato & Herbs. The eggs were not as good as what you can make at home, even if you have never made them. They had no flavor and tasted like parsley or whatever they had sprinkled on them. There were like 2 little millimeter chunks of bacon on each half egg. The muscles were in a good sauce and tasted great. For dinner I got the burger, my girlfriend and her sister both got the Crispy Pork Belly in Broth with Fall Vegetables & Pumpkin Fritters. The burger was cooked the way I asked, but it is no better than what you will get at burger bar or jenny's giant burger. The fries looked cool, but were hella oily and super salty, which I did not appreciate. I tried some of their pork belly, which was not crispy at all; it was actually very soggy and chewy. The portion size of the crispy pork belly is a joke. Look at all of the pictures of the burger posted here now imagine that burger cut into fourths, and that is the portion size of the pork belly. Not enough. If you go here, my advice is just load up on the muscles.
