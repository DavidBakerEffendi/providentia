Sweet Jesus, this place is amazing. I discovered the place when a few mates of mine took me there after a lacrosse game. First time I saw it, I had some serious doubts considering the place looks like a literal hole in the wall. But after I got my 5 pork dumplings for a dollar, I couldn't care less what the place looked like. Went back for a sesame pancake with pork, and wow. The dumplings were easily the best I've ever had, and the pancakes should be classified as an illegal substance. Add the fact that you can have an entire meal here under 4 bucks, and I never fail to visit this place whenever I'm in the neighborhood.
