This place is terrible. The service is absolutely awful. I came here about 2 years ago and can still recall everything that occurred. We had a party of 4, and 2 of us ordered rotisserie chicken- 1 dish was served with cream over the chicken and the other was not. When i asked the waiter why my dish had cream on it, he responded, that the dish was served that way (uhmmm ... my friend's dish did not have cream). He took it back and brought out a "new dish". Upon closer observation, I noticed that he had simply wiped the cream off of the chicken with god knows what. I was disgusted- i imagine it's a health code violation. We immediately asked for the check, paid for our appetizer and LEFT!! My suggestion- STAY AWAY!!!!!
