Best Brunch and Dinner in soho - super cute interior, cafe vibe. Staff is laid back yet attentive. Best brunch item - shakshuka. For dinner, make sure you try the cauliflower and specials! I guess we got lucky the first time we came in, and got seated with not too long of a wait. We have been there a few times now, and after the third time we already felt like regulars. The two owners are usually there and super nice and accommodating.
