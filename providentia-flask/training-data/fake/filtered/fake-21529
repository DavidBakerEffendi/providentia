I went there with my girlfriend on a Monday night pretty early. The place is neat and classic french bistro style. We had oysters and snails as appetizers. Oysters was fresh and salty like they supposed to be. The snails were tinted with pastis...Yummy! For our main, we got the hanger steak and the mussels. Steak is a great portion, meat very tender, homemade fries are delicious...what a deal for the price. I can't wait to come back again. This little bistro 'ne paie pas de mine' but it is such an exquisite Â french food addition to the neighborhood. Thanks Olivier.
