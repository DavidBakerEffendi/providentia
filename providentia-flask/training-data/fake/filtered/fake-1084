If you're looking for a different bar experience in Philadelphia, you found it. It's easy to find parking here, a great place to meet up with friends, and the brews are to die for! The menu is your typical overachieving bar menu... what you'd expect to find with some unique items thrown in ($1 pack of smores for outside!). The atmosphere is really incredible, and not what you'd usually find in Philadelphia. I go here frequently on solo dates with my husband or with friends.
