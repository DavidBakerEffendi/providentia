Let me begin by saying I'm a Chinese, which means I am very passionate and picky about food. If you think McDonald's is OK food, stop reading now. I live in the area and today some errands brought me passing Edo's. I've never heard of it before, never been there before, and I've lived in the neighborhood for over 4 years. That says something already. But it was lunch time and I thought, heck, give it a try. I ordered Teriyaki chicken. I waited for about 20 minutes for my takeout, during which time I did ask the hostess how much longer I needed to wait. But that's OK, I can live with that: they seemed busy and hostess said they are shorthanded in kitchen. I got my food, back to my office, and started eating. Best thing in the package: steamed white rice. Well cooked. And that's all I can praise about. You'd think after hostess hastening their chefs to do things faster, the chicken has a chance to be undercooked. Oh nooooo.... the most overcooked, toughest and rubberiest chicken I have had in years! Teriyaki sauce? Are You Kidding Me? It's simply reduced soy sauce with some sugar in it. And it is not even thick enough to hang on the meat. I can go home and spend 5 minutes to prepare a Teriyaki sauce that beats the hell out of what I had in the bowl. They do have different chefs for sushi. But after having what I just had, and reading all the reviews before me, I had no interest going back there whatsoever. I might be wrong about their sushi since I had no experiences with it; but I don't want to spend another $20 to find out some truth I cannot care less. I'll shoot it a 0 star if I could.
