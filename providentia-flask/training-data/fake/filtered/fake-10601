So I went here for lunch today with a group of coworkers. I had the fried chicken, mac and cheese, greens mixed with cabbage. It was delicious !! The chicken was hot and moist. My coworkers and I ate from each others plates. One girl had the blackened catfish with jumbalya (sp?) another got a side of okra and lastly the roasted chicken, candied yams and potato salad. EVERYTHING was good. Completely off my diet. I can't forget that the honey buttered corn bread and iced tea was excellent.
