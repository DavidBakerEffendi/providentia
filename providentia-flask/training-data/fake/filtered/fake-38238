Such a great place. Waitress Samantha was amazing in relaying my dietary requests to the chef, who made a meal that could be bland into a satisfying tasteful meal. Worth the cost in my eyes! The atmosphere was unlike any other that I have been to, and made for a great evening- and was able to enjoy the beautiful sunset!
