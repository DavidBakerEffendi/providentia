love this place! atmosphere is great. service is great. (there's this really sweet girl that works behind the counter, she always has a smile no matter how rowdy it gets) this piping hot pizza is so wort the line. although i wish they expanded their beverage selection. nonetheless end your saturday night with a visit to artichoke. you won't regret it.
