Totto Ramen is superb! I really like to go to this place. I could eat their noodles every day. I have been there twice and both times the place was packed. Usually I get there just before they open so I can have a lucnh in the first round. Try the tuna sashimi and the tuna with avocado is pretty awesome too.
