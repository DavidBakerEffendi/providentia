The food is very good, however, the service is AWFUL!!!   There are only a few tables in the entire restaurant, and yet we could not get water.  Then they forgot to put the order in, leaving me waiting over 1/2 hour during my lunch break. Someone at the table next to me actually got up from his party, to tell them to bring them and us water.  The they had to wait for sugar, before someone got up, again, to fetch it.
