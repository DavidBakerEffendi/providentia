Met up with some friends at Percy Street BBQ. We were seated immediately (on a Friday night! we had reservations). Ordered a couple of drinks, which took a bit of time, but nothing overly bad. We were seated by the kitchen. I caught myself glancing at everything that passed by on a plate. The three of us ordered the combo. 1 app, 1 entree, 1 side for EACH person @ $21. Of the dishes we ordered, I will give you my top favs of the night. First off, the appetizer: Brisket fries! The meat was tender, fries were fresh. Its everything I could have ever hoped it would be. I was quite impressed. The main entree that really spoke to me was the Pork Belly Sandwich. While the rootbear-chipotle glazed beef ribs were tender and tasty, the Pork belly had something magically delicious about it. Juicy, tender....AMAZING! The sides were good. They complimented the meals well, but nothing really stood out. The focus, to me, was still on the entrees. Expect me returning with more people, as there are plenty of items on the menu that I still can't wait to dive into!
