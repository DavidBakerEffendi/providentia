Extremely over priced for the quality of the food, service and atmosphere. I ordered the Crescent Farm Duck Breast and My boyfriend went with the Loch Duart Scottish Salmon. The duck was cold and they left out the Salmon Caviar on my boyfriends dish. Overall, the food was okay and the portion sizes were way to small for the price.  Also, we drank soda with the meal and the soda had a strange after taste. For our appetizer we ordered the Thai beef lettuce wraps. They forgot to put the lettuce on the plate. Our waiter was very pretentious and tried to push us to order something off the wine list.  We've had better experiences at Olive Garden and the food was half the price. Dine at own risk.
