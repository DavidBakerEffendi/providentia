I rarely write reviews but had to since my dinner and overall experience at Gramercy Tavern was excellent. My boyfriend took me there for my birthday last weekend and we both agree that the overall experience is one of the best we have ever had in a restaurant. Our server was excellent and had back-up to make sure our water and wine glasses were always filled. We sat in the dining room and ordered the prix fixe dinner. We shared everything and both agreed that the Lamb with Hen of the Woods mushrooms was the best lamb we have ever had. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. Dessert was also excellent, especially the Chocolate Bread Pudding.They also brought us a third dessert (chocolate cake) for my birthday! There were also three amuse bouches throughout the meal and they gave us homemade crumb cakes to have for breakfast the next morning. It was such a wonderful touch. If you have the opportunity to eat here, definitely do so and make a reservation. I can't wait to go back again!
