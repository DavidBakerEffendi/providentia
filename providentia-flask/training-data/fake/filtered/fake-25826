Had heard SO many great things about the variety of the menu and quality ingredients so HAD to try it when we were visiting from Kansas.  FRESH, fresh, fresh free-range chicken kabob was tender and delicious as well as the baby roasted potatoes and salad.  Not your 'usual' Greek food but a nice mix of traditional yet modern and light fare.  Loved the Greek wine and the kataifi cream dessert was light yet yummy.  Staff was great and service wonderful.  Coffee is top-notch, too!
