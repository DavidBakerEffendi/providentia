My wife and I recently found this little neighborhood gem.  It is a wonderfully simple restaurant that executes the bistro concept very well.  We have been back several times and enjoyed it immensely.  A simple but well executed menu, flavorful food and a nice selection of wines accompanied by genuine service.  What more can you ask for in a neighborhood bistro?
