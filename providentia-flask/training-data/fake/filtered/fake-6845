The food here is excellent.  The chicken is killer, Ribs are excellent and shrimp and grits are divine.   The wait staff is super friendly and food is always served promptly.  This is the fourth time I've been here and I would go back in a heart beat.  I'm not sure why some were so many were disappointed but their loss and my gain.  There is usually a wait for brunch so go early.
