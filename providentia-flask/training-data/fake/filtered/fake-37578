Come with cash and about an hour to spare...you won't be let down. This  small, difficult to find underground room in the corner of an industrial park complex off of Pine Street is definitely worth your lunch break. Although I was caught off guard the first time I went here because the listing of sandwiches did not explain what they were made of, I realized that this is why Four Corners works so well. You have to put your faith in the chef's hands and let him/her make a culinary creation for you. The chef buys bulk loaves of Italian bread and cuts individual slices for the sandwiches. This gives each sandwich even more character. Great for vegetarians as well (half of the sandwiches are sans-meat.) It gets very busy around lunchtime and 5:00, but it is absolutely worth the wait.  Try the Thai Chicken (it has a little kick of curry to it which balances well with the peanut butter) or the German Sauerkraut, my boyfriend's favorite (tangy, yet moist!) My goal is to try the whole menu at least once!
