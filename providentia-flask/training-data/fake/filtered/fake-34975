I've now been to Agricola five times - three for meals and twice just for drinks.  I hadn't written any comments because it's new, and I thought it fair to wait several months until the kinks were worked out. Bottom line:  It isn't worth your time and money. The food is not special, many of the ingredients aren't local at all because they're out of season, and there's nothing on the menu that is unique or can't be ordered elsewhere.  Every restaurant needs a few "can't touch anywhere else items" and Agricola has not a single one. The service is cold, absent and uncaring.  There are many people, but they mostly are talking to each other or standing behind the bar doing nothing. There are too many great places within a block to spend time here.  The atmosphere and design are OK, but not enough  to offset the kitchen.  And, while I usually don't weigh quality with price, Agricola is extremely expensive, even if it were great.  You're paying for superior service and extraordinary food; you're getting something worth a lot less. I'm sad about all of this, because I like businesses to be successfully, especially locally owned and operated ones. But I really hope the owner and chef are reading these comments and does a makeover.  The general buzz in town is turning negative, time is short, and people have a lot of options.
