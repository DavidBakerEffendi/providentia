After starting a job in the East Windsor area a few months ago I have managed to find my way over to Dabuscos on a very regular basis.  The staff and the food are outstanding.  I started off trying out their plain slice which has a nice thin crust style.  I moved on to their specialty slices which range from a basic buffalo chicken to my personal favorite the eggplant with vodka sauce.  I have yet to dive completely into their dinner menu mainly because I work during the afternoon, but based on my experience so far I would expect nothing but the best.   And finally...Last but not least, my favorite menu item this far is their pasta fagioli.  Great broth and loaded with pasta and vegetables.  I would highly recommend it.
