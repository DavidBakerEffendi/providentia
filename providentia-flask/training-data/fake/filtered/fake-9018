I didn't expect to find such a beautiful cafe in such an industrial block. It is a true gem. I had the cheese omelette w/ sauteed onions,mushrooms & peppers. It was delicious. I followed it with a passion fruit dessert that was heavenly. I noticed that they were installing the outside fire pit which is surrounded by a wrap around bench. I'm looking forward to coming back with friends & enjoying a cup of hot chocolate with one of there many appetizing pastries.
