This is a good place to eat if you're a masochistic hipster who's used to paying a lot of money for so-so food and being served by an ill mannered waitstaff.  We arrived on time for our reservation and the hostess said there would be a 5 minute wait - 20 minutes later, after I inquired myself, we had our table.  Then, I was in the middle of a conversation with a dinner guest when one of the waitstaff interrupts us, reaches far over the table to clear a plate, sticking her bare armpit right into my face - it was as if we were not even there - That's not the kind of rude insensitive service I expect when I plunk down 300 bucks for dinner - and then, she did it again!    I told our waitress about this incident and the waitress abruptly disappeared - never to be seen again.  Our waitress was replaced by a waiter who was curt, distant, and never looked at you in the eyes - where do they get these people from?  Freemens Restaurant waitstaff is a disaster.   I had the tiny filet mignon which came in two pieces, one was good, the other was rubbery - overrated!
