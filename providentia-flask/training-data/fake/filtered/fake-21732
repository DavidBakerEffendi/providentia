This is the place to go if you've got someone in town who you want to impress for  pre or post theatre meals. I've never had a bad meal here. Sounds crazy, but my favorite things is the iceberg wedge salad and a burger and fries. Yep- the burger is fantastic!!! Fortunately, I've been going  long enough to have tried just about everything on the menu and have always LOVED the meal. My only complaint is that the menu does change and there have been times I've craved my wedge salad and it's not on the menu. That's okay...everything here is great! Not only will the food impress your guests-you might run into someone who looks familiar....it's safe to say half the time I've been I recognize some celebrity-often someone performing in a Broadway show. I literally bumped into Chris Noth on the way in the door the last time I was there.
