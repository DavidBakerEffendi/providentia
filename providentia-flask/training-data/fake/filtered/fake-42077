Well, the pizza was fine, but the so-called Caesar Salad had no dressing at all, and was chopped up romaine with Â a slice of cheese and a few bland croutons. The pizza was good, but it was the check that got me; $75 bucks for two pizzas, two salads, one glass of wine and a soda!! Save your money: Go to Artichoke around the corner and take home the Sicilian or go to Il Posto on 18th and 2nd. NY Pizza should never cost 75 bucks for two people!!!
