My husband & I discovered this place during restaurant week 2012 & have been going back at least 1-2 times a week! The food & its presentation is very good. The price is reasonable for what you get. Even the sides they serve with the sandwiches are home made. We brought our friends there for dinner & it was great. Â I hope they start dinners again:) The deserts? I can't say anymore then the other posts. Anthony & Phil and the rest of the staff are always friendly & helpful. We are going tomorrow as they are donating 50% of purchases to the Red Cross for the Oklahoma tornado destruction.
