The owner was extremely rude.  My party was going to a show next door and he was not accommodating for us.  He basically told us to go elsewhere if the entire party was not there.  I tried to explain that others were coming from the train and i would order for them but he hollered at me and then told me to leave.  I tried to explain to him that i would purchase the 5 meals but he again yelled in front of numerous patrons.  In my opinion he was extremely unprofessional.  He was extremely confrontational as well, getting right up in my face.  From reading other reviews, I now see that this is common practice for him.  He seemed to think that he was doing you a favor by allowing you to dine there.  You could all do better taking a ride to Hudson County and going to a real Cuban Restaurant.  Save your money.....Cuban Pete should have stayed in Cuba!  Go to any corner restaurant in Hudson County and get the same meal for half the price with people who appreciate your business.
