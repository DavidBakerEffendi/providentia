I have been trying ramen in several countries (except Japan). Through all the experience, Ippudo and Totto, both in NY, take the top places with slightly different styles. Totto seems thicker in broth. I visited this branch only at lunch time, and waiting is unavoidable but seems less than the other Ippudo in lower Manhattan. Possibly, due to tables, this branch fits better with smaller party (1-2 people) and the other fits better with larger party.
