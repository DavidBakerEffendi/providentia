Went there once for dinner. It was awesome, the owner was so nice and charming. Amazingly knowledgeable wait staff, great wine list, and a hunky waiter who looked really into yoga. Went back for drinks about a month later and the owner recognized us, which was so nice. Amazing place, great food, good local ingredients, great wine list and an amazing staff.
