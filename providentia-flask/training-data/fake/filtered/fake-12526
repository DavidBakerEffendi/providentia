I have eaten Mancinni's pizza twice and it has been outstanding both times. The restaurant itself is very small and narrow; it reminds one of a small Manhattan sized eatery. The d√©cor is dated and not fancy at all, but on the weekends Mancinni's is always busy and always full, because of its terrific pizza. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I strongly recommend Mancinni's to all pizza lovers.
