Went to order sandwiches for lunch today and requested that they not put mayonnaise on the one for my wife who is lactose intolerant.  The counter woman told me "no substitutions".  I was asking for a deletion not a substitution.   Glad business is so good for these people that the robot at the counter can rudely repeat that it is the owners' policy that no substitutions be made -- even for those people who can't tolerate dairy.
