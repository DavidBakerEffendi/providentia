As soon you enter this place you feel you are in chennai, the place was crowded even at Â saturday 4pm. the waiter didnt bother even to bring water the food came after 45mins. But the food was awesome, they have a variety in their menu, try the natu kodi pulusu/Fish curry/shrimp biryani, of all Mutton keema paratha was the best. If you have time and dont bother for the ambience this is the place for delicious food.
