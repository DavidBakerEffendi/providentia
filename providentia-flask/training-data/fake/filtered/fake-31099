I thought this place is really cool. Sardines are really not my dig but damn thier sardine sandwiches are the tits. The rest of the food is pretty standard comparable to S. Philly Tap Room. The bar is well stocked and for all you craft beer junkies they have a very nice selection. The hood isn't the best and mainly why I only go in the day time for brunch. I only see one bartender there and he is a cool dude. Check out thier Sunday brunch.
