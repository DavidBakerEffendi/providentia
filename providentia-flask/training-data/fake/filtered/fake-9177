Party of 15 went to get together to eat before a show at Shubert arriving at slightly different times. After putting in orders & requiring silverware, nothing was delivered untill over an hour had passed. Party requested to talk to manager, who seemed rude & curt saying that "go to the kitchen if you want to see how busy we are." Food came at different times, silverware never arrived.  When reapproached, the son of the manage came out & said "told us not to come back" in a loud voice. The people who had not received their food after this incident were afraid to eat their food. Even after we paid & left a tip, the son saw fit to come out & walked by one of our party & make a comment "you're on my shit list"  The food was good but we wouldn't recommend this restaurant based on present staff's behavior.
