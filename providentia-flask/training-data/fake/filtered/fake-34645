Went there on a Sunday afternoon.  Seemed like only one waitress was working.  We waited 15 minutes, no one came to serve us even though there were only 5 tables occupied.  I finally talked to the waitress who brought us menus, then disappeared.  After another 15 minutes we left.  Service absolutely atrocious.
