Wow an amazing little Italian restaurant with the most delicious home made sauces I have had. The bread dip is filled with fresh herbs served with hot herb seasoned rolls out of the oven. Appetizers are unique and really wonderful--artichokes, shrimp and tender calamari....Soups home made and hearty...dinners include salad or soup.....Lasagna is the BEST. -homemade dripping with melted cheese and a meaty hearty sauce! We are new there and have been there at least 6x in the past 8 weeks! (And we are about 30 min away) Gino is charming and friendly and makes sure he visits you every time you come in....Patio in summer is comfortable and inside is very cute..
