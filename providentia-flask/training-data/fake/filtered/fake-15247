I've ordered here at least 5 times since they opened.  I thought I'd write a review... The first few times I had the Teriyaki platters, which were really good.  They had a fair amount of vegetables, good portions of meat and the food came quickly.   The third time is when I ordered the spicy tuna roll.  The fish was great, so I started ordering sushi from here pretty regularly.  I think the place is definitely solid- and if you live in  Philly you know how many sub-par sushi restaurants are lurking around. If you're looking for something new in South Philly- I'd definitely try this place out.
