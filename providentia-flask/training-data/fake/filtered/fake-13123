The ONLY reason to go here is because it claims to be the Birthplace of the American Hamburger.  People pack into it and it is often so overcrowded there is hardly room to lift your hamburger to your face.  And the burgers?  Historically accurate I guess is the best thing you could say.  Served on toasted white bread and served up with a dose of "eat it and get out" hospitality.  Unseasoned and undercooked, my burger was warm and bloody. Now dig this: You take your trash up to the counter to be disposed of...The Same Counter Where You Pick Up Your Order.  I guess this violation of basic restaurant sanitation is simply overlooked or perhaps folks are too busy soaking up the experience.  I'm glad I went, checked it off my list, and was equally glad to leave.
