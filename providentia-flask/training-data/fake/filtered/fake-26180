Everytime I go there the pizza hits me in the yummy spot... I am so grateful to have found a pizza place as thoroughly good as this one right in my backyard.  I've been to just about every pizza place in Burlington, and was impressed with a couple, but after tasting this place I don't even bother with the others.  Great service, friendly faces...and their eggplant parm sandwiches are perfect!   Might I recommend a jalapeno and pineapple pizza?  It's freaking fantastic.
