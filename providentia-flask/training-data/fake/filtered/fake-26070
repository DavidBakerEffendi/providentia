I think this place must have changed owners and chefs. My family and I went for brunch a few weeks ago. Service was slow. Servers generally huddled in the kitchen, emerging only to quickly take an order or throw down a meal, then disappearing again. My eggs benedict was inedible. Two nearly hard boiled eggs on top of soggy english muffin halves with a side of reheated rubber potatoes. I figured that maybe they had a bad day and gave them another try. This time I got one of their signature burgers. A patty covered in a white goop, topped with wilted greens that probably came out of a bag. The bun was so wet from the white goop it fell apart when I tried to lift it. The side of onion rings was cold. My companion had the crab cake burger, which was equally awful and, I think, made with the same white goop. This place should save on the billboards and hire a competent cook and some servers.
