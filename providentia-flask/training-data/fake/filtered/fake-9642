Having been to most of the Vietnamese restaurants in the area, I have to say this is my favorite.  There is no one thing that is outstanding about this, except that they do everything very well.   Fresh ingredients, fairly quick service (when there's not a line), and reasonable prices. Also, take a look through the serving window into the kitchen.  It's really clean, which puts my germaphobe concerns at bay.
