I love Saraghina. They make great breakfasts, lunches and dinners. Their pizzas are some of the best I've had. It has a unique and eclectic atmosphere- a converted garage/repair shop turned edgy & shabby chic restaurant with a lovely back patio. It has however become super popular over the years and you will get better service if you arrive before peak hours. They also have a great (small) bar and bakery attached to the restaurant. I highly recommend this restaurant.
