Stopped by again for a late night meal. Front of house was empty so wasnt sure if kitchen was still open but after checking with the waitress we were welcomed in.  Sat in the back patio to enjoy tonights cool summer night air. As before we ordered the mixed salad which was generously portioned with a nice variety of fresh greens and mini tomatoes in a mild vinigarette dressing. This was followed by a pulled pork sandwich and sweet potato fries and the wonton noddle salad.  Pull pork was tender with a slightly spicy sauce which enhanced, not overpowered, the meat. Fries were crisp on the outside and creamy on the inside just the way I like them. The wonton noodle salad was equally delicious with a mix of vegtables and mushrooms mixed throughout the lightly sauced noodles. A great alternative when youre in the mood for lighter fare. The chef, Tom, cam out to chat and as others have stated he clearly loves what he does and has a true respect for the food he serves. As we had come later in the evening some items were no longer available. This was due to Toms approach to buy as much as he can local and fresh and keep as close to his daily usage as possible. This means some items may run out from time to time but it also means what is served is as fresh and flavorful as possible. In my view a worthwhile trade off.  He  also generously treated us to a portion of steamed mussels  which were cooked just right, tender morsels with a slight bite and melt in your mouth freshness,an absolute must for seafood. The sauce was seasoned well and there was plently of freshly toasted bread to sop it all up. As Ive stated before this is a real gem where its not about the scene, but it is about the food. In my view its well worth a visit or two or three or.......
