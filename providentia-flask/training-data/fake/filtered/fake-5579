When we first got there we were really looking forward to our meal. After we sit down, I had a bad feeling. We weren't waited on for entirely too long. When we were finally able to order the food was pretty good but we just felt like we were waiting around for an eternity for our server to come take things away so we could order dessert. When she finally finished taking things away, although mine was still sitting in front of me, she finally asked us if we would like to order dessert. The three of us who did want dessert began to order and she stopped us to "get a piece of paper." She actually went and served another table their order and bussed their dishes away before finally returning to our table with an old receipt to take our dessert order on. This was by far the worst service I have ever experienced, I was offended and felt incredibly neglected. I tried an Italian thick hot chocolate for my dessert, it came in something called a "hug-a-mug" which was entirely too hot for me to pick up. Before today I was desperate to try Max Brenner, but after today, I won't be returning.
