This is a place worth the wait for seating. There is a reason you have to wait. The place has great atmosphere, good food and very reasonable pricing. Lines of people are to be expected. Still, If I had company from out of town, I would not hesitate to bring them here. I found my server to be very friendly as was the owner, who came by the table to see that all was good. Seating was comfortable. I really enjoyed my first time and will be back with friends very soon!
