As a displaced southern boy, I was a little dubious as to whether the food would measure up.  Steve assured me my order would be everything I wanted and more.  I placed a large order for the overnight crew at a local hospital and the food was simply incredible.  I had the blackened catfish with fried okra and potatoe salad.  I also ordered hot wings and hush puppies as appetizers, and banana pudding for dessert.  From the ribs, to chopped chicken BBQ, to pulled pork, and tilapia,  Everything was great and the team raved about the food.  The BEST banana pudding I have ever had (Sorry, Grandma!).
