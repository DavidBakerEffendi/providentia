I have been here a handful of times with my boyfriend, and each time I am blown away by the food and the nonnas who make it!  The included appetizers always vary but are fresh and tasty, the menu varies with the nonna of the night, but is always authentic.  As someone who has spent a summer in Italy, including large family dinners, I can tell you that it is right on with what you would have there: fresh, light, flavorful dishes.  The wines are amazing, of course (I suggest the Sicilian Scurati) and the desserts have always been great.  Recently I had a cake made with Nutella that was heavenly!  The stuffed lobster is always wonderful and a bargain at $25 As for the music, it depends on the night.  Occasionally the owner, Joe, turns it up and rocks out (well, not physically).  But the food is so great, we really don't mind!
