BYOB, helpful service with a low key atmosphere.  All the tacos are great especially the tongue taco and lamb taco.  The sopes and the chilaquiles de pollo in red sauce (#51) are phenomenal as well.  The latter of the two would be something ideal for a hangover or when you are splitting a meal with someone as it is super rich, but great comfort food.  They have good sauces and I recommend this place to as many people as possible.  Not many places serve authentic corn tortillas with their tacos with fresh chopped onion and cilantro, and they do such a great job with all of their food.
