We live nearby, stopped by for dinner on a Friday night.  Everyone was very nice, our meals were truly excellent, but the service was very, very slow. Specifically, we waited forever between dishes and it took so long we gave up even trying for dessert.  The couple next to us had the exact same experience - we saw them order, and wait a very long time. It became almost unbearably long between courses, and despite the great food it unfortunately wasn't worth it. Even the check took them forever to get back to us. NYC is a very competitive market,  and one expects both great food as well as prompt, attentive service at a truly top tier restaurant.  Ai FIori has some serious work to do to improve in this respect.
