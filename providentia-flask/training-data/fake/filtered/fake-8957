A great experience, a little crowded in the bar area but was forgotten once we received our food. I wasn't that hungry so I had the grilled cheese with parmesan fries, then I wished I had some more. Hung out with a few Australians and had a blast, dancing and drinking in the dining area. I would definitely revisit. Thanks for the awesome memories!!!
