Great find in downtown New Haven.  Thai Taste has delicious food at very reasonable prices and the location is excellent.  My personal favorites are the curries; I've had the yellow curry and massaman, and both were excellent.  The combination of super-fresh vegetables and pineapple simmered with chicken in their yellow curry sauce is amazing!   The pad thai was good, nothing extraordinary.  I usually eat about half of an entree when portions are big- no exception here- and bring the other half to work with me for lunch the next day.  If you also treasure your leftovers, you won't be disappointed, although I don't recommend re-heating the pad thai.  It's not as good on day #2. Appetizers are ok.  Thumbs up to the vegetable roll and dumplings (light, good consistency, good flavor), but the chicken satay was a bit tough and tasted too salty.  Even the beverages here are priced well- I believe the Thai beer was around $4 a bottle?  One of my buddies really liked the Thai tea.       This place seems to be taking a lot of blows regarding its decor.  I found it to be clean and comfortable with the appropriate amount of light, which I tend to value more than the wall coverings and fabric selection when dining at a mid-priced restaurant.  I really like the cool green sign outside, too.  It sort of glows at night and beckons you in!     The parking can be a bit tricky, but I've always had good luck on the side streets off of Chapel just west of the restaurant.  Also, note that they only accept Visa and Mastercard, $7.95 minimum.
