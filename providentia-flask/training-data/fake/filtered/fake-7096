All I have to say is....please open up in Houston, Tx!!!! My husband and I came to visit my sister in NYC and she got us hooked!! You can't go wrong with any of the rolls, they are ALL amazing (my personal favorite is the aloo roll) !!! Great service, fair pricing and awesome food- what more could you ask for!? :-)
