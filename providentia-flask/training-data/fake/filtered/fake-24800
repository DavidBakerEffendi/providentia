It would be hard to a find a place with better service. I couldn't find a moment where my water glass wasn't filled. Decent quality pasta, but some of the apps and entrees weren't that exciting/fresh. Stick to the special as they are based on seasonal freshness. Very cozy. Mr Giogio will most likely be watching you enjoy your meal which is a good sign.
