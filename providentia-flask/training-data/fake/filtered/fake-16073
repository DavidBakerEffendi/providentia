Rude, dismissive hostess and a too-cool-for-school tired atmosphere. If you don't like children then you won't care for this review, and I understand that. However, I needed to put in my two cents. My husband and I walked in for an 11:30am lunch on a Friday with my 14 month old and were meeting another couple. We paused to figure out if the couple was there, and the hostess listlessly looked at us and stated "We don't have highchairs." She wasn't polite, apologetic or even just the slightest bit diplomatic. She seemed to have the same disdain that the restaurant owners must have for children or need to put up the same hipster front that they must be going for in the place. We dine out for lunch or dinner perhaps 5 times a week with our super sweet, chill, adorable girl and have since she was a few months old. This is the very first restaurant we have been in all of NYC or anywhere in the country where they didn't have high chairs. Really? Okay, cool kids. You go on with your bad selves. This 20 year resident of NYC has written her first restaurant review.
