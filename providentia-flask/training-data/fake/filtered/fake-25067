Our group of 5 ended up here after attempting to go to the Farmers Diner, which was closed for "reorganization," I think the sign said. A lucky change, I say. I had a perfectly tender omelet with really crisp, well-seasoned homefries and really hearty (homemade?) toast. Two others at our table ordered the Vermont burger which had carmelized onions, some type of horseradish sauce and bacon. It looked fabulous and both enjoyed it very much. The portions were good and the service was excellent. The next time we're driving through Quechee, we'll definitely stop by again.
