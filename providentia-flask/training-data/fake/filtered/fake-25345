PLEASE DON'T EVER EAT HERE! I recently went to brunch this past Sunday. What I saw after I finished eating left me traumatized. I had the chicken sandwich which was really good. All of my friends enjoyed the entrees that they ordered. However, during the entire time that we were there I kept seeing a shadow pass back and forth over the section where we were sitting. The ceiling is made out of some kind of yellow thin cloth material and you can kind of see through it. I never paid much attention to it because I was so hungry and was having a great conversation. It wasn't until we finished eating and were waiting for our bill that I saw the shadow again and looked up. What I saw was feet walking across this cloth on the ceiling. And then I saw the tail!! OMG!!! It was a freaking RAT!! Even my friend saw it. And what's worst is that it was headed in the direction of the kitchen. I was so digusted, appalled and freaked out! Please, if you are one to be concerned about the cleanliness health conditions of restaurants, DO NOT EAT HERE!! I know that pests can be an issue for restaurants, but its one thing to actually see live rodents in a place where food is being served. Not to mention, how did the rat even get up there?? I mean it has to come out at some point, right?
