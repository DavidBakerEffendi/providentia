Food was decent when served, had a 9pm reservation however got seated at 930 (understandable). Ordered food right away, seafood tower, and main course, received seafood tower around 950 which was OK at the best, waited about 45 minutes until the main course (the people seated next to us sat down and paid their bill before we even received our main) talked to our waiter who tried to explain to us that 45 minutes isn't long (I went to the washroom and he was downstairs serving a private party, may have been too busy?) 2 minutes later food came out, ordered the cod, which was cold, asked the waiter who said the whole thing is supposed to be served cold, they forgot our side dishes, WTF? Manager came to talk to us, the waiter didn't even have the decency to say he was sorry, will probably never go back. Thank you for a waste of 3 hours.
