This is a great unique place where I always seem to start my Friday night off at. Despite always being busy I have never had bad service.The drinks always come out consistent and in a timely matter. The food is also very fresh and tastey. The outdoor area is also very laid back and the bartenders are always more then friendly enough and have a smile on there face with enough time to say hey how you been? despite being busy, A rare quality to find.
