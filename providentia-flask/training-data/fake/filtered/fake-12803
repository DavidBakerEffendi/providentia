I live in the neighborhood and was intrigued when I saw this restaurant had opened. I am not vegetarian, but I tend to eat 90% vegetarian food. I love Indian food, so I decided to check it out. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I ordered a Rava Masala Dosa (and requested it be prepared with mild spice) and my friend ordered a Poori Bhaji. We shared the two dishes so we could each try both. You get a lot of food for the price! It's very affordable. I also ordered a Masala Tea, which was lovely. Both dishes were delicious. The dosa was the best I have ever had! I will definitely be returning to this establishment.
