Really a great place, we had the tasting menu that was $36 (  Please note though that everyone at the table needs to get the same tasting menu.. One person can't just order it alone or a different one) because they ran out of the lamb or just have it on weekends or you have to call ahead or something which I would do for the next time but a few dishes really were amazing: Turkish hummus, fried haloumi (sooo good), and the smoked sable w/ egg on challah... I'm generally a big meat type of person and despite that, those were the dishes that really stood out.  The only downside is the super close seating next to other tables.  Service was unparalleled! I recommend it with a call ahead to make sure you can order the tasting menu that has the lamb.  I'm going to try raw lamb next time!
