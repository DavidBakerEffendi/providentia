We LOVED this place!  We were staying nearby at the Essex hotel, and stopped here for breakfast...it was after 1p so we decided to grab lunch instead.  I got the fish tacos, and hands down the BEST fish taco I have ever had.  This is definitley a huge compliment since I'm a bit of a food snob!  My husband had some type of steak sandwich and he said it was phenomenal!
