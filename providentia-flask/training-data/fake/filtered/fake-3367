The other night me and my family ordered a pizza some wings and a couple grinders and it was delicious we've been ordering from Lena's for years but we seen there flier in the mail and we gave them a shot we excepted some plain pizza and wings that you can order anywhere but surprisingly it was very good I recommend it to anyone!!
