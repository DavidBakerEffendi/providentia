Excellent place...met my wife there on our first date...fell in love with her eyes...  Food is homemade and excellent, reasonable prices... Weekend they have live music, good looking waitresses.  Only issue when nice weather there are alot of flys!!!    Also just upgraded to WIFI!!  I love the old Yankee memorabila...Dont sit in the booth by the window its my table...reserved for the DON!
