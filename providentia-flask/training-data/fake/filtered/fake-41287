I started to work part time in the Princeton area near Big Fish so I decided to get take-out one night. I ordered the farm raised blackened Catfish. It was pricey at $18. Fish only came with some steamed veggies and rice. The catfish was a little tough and the rice was very salty. I need to try some other dishes before I give the place a final verdict. However, farm raised fish shouldn't be $18. I understand it's the Princeton area but I expect those prices for wild caught fish. Place has a nice decor inside.
