This restaurant literally stole my money. The bill was $54.62. I paid with a hundred dollar bill. I received $45 in change. Where's my ¢38? I felt embarrassed to bring it up. I don't really care about the ¢38, but are they allowed to keep it? I asked one waiter and he said that they do that as a matter of course. If they do this to everyone, how much does that add up to in the course of a week? I certainly will never go there again and am considering filing a complaint with the state Attorney General.
