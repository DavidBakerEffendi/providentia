Went to DUMBO for the first time for work and was told this was the BEST spot in DUMBO to get pizza.  So myself and 2 friends decided to check out all the hype!  One of my friends and I split a large cheese, which was $14 plus tax & tip.  All l can say is I would have been better going to a place where I can buy by the slice and spend about $4.  It was so NOT worth it!  There was absolutely nothing special about the cheese, the sauce or the way it was seasoned.  I did like the thin crust, but other than that, I am totally confused on why THIS is one of the best places... Also, their food rating is PENDING, which usually means they failed their inspection or looking to get a better grade! So, just be aware.  I will say, out side of the food, the ladies restroom was an absolute disgust, which we did tell them.  Next time I'm in DUMBO and I want pizza, I won't be going there!
