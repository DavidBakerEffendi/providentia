Coming back from NYC and going to PA... I came to Pastosa Ravioli because I read amazing reviews at yelp! But, the place succeeded my expectations! I had a prosciutto sanduich, my husband a chicken sandwich and my sister a turkey sandwich! We LOVED! I knew it was going to be good but didn't expect it to be amazing! My sandwich was by far the best prosciutto sandwich I have ever had!!! Fresh and delicious! And huge! I ate half and it was enough! Â Great place, fresh products, friendly staff! I'm already dreaming about my next visit! :)
