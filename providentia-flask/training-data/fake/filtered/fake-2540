Overall a terrific restaurant and the kind of place that is sorely needed on the upper east side. Great energy. Noise level can be quite high in the main dining room, but it is much quieter on the terrace and in the downstairs room. Food is generally solid, though chicken salad was uninspired and the chicken dry. Fish was fresh and well prepared.
