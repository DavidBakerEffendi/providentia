OMG!!!  The absolutely best sushi, I have ever had!  I had the Lebanon Roll....so good, I would definitely recomend that to anyone.  Tried a bite of the Farmer's Stir Fry, the sauce was fantastic and the portion size was huge. Also tried the sides they brought out for us and they were very good.  Tried a bite of another dish, it was deep fried chicken in a spicy sauce, it was amazing!   Staff kept coming over to check on us, which was very nice.  When you see the place, you might think "This place is a dive", but the experience and the food are worth it.  The food is what I consider to be reasonably priced.  Will definitely go back again!
