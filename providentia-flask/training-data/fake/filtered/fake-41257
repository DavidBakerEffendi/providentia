Been there twice...once for brunch and another time for dinner. The brunch was what you'd expect, modest portions and fairly priced.  The place is usually packed on the weekends, so you might have to wait a few to get a table. (2 1/2 stars) The dinner was, well, what you'd expect for a place known for it's brunch.  I made the mistake of ordering the pork-chop.  It isn't so much that it was woefully overcooked and tasted like grill char that bothers me.  It's when the waiter tells me that that's how the chef prepares it because it's pork and it "can't be bloody." While I do prefer bloodless pork, I have to imagine there was a point between bloody and shoe leather that might have been a reasonable compromise.  The waiter honestly looked at me as if this is how everyone eats pork... which (loosely translated) means "I'm not taking that off the bill."   The 'free' dessert was an attempt at redemption, but we didn't eat any of it.  I'm not letting someone off the hook for a horrendous meal because of $2 worth of puff pastry, a grill pineapple and some creme fraiche.  (1/2 Star) I can't recommend the restaurant after this experience, but if you do go, go for brunch.  (and don't get the pork)
