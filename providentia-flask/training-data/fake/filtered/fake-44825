The Godfather also owns the Seafood Bar & Grill right beside it (share the same entrance).  We opted to have some seafood since it had a nice full bar. The seafood restaurant was decent, but the main attraction is the full bar and TV. So, we sat down and ordered a round of drinks and appetizers (good raw oyster). So far, so good. So, we decided to stay and have dinner. HUGE MISTAKE! Second round of drinks came our way after we followed up on it (15 minute wait to pour beer, wine and soda, really?).  Worst - our order evidently never made it to the computer, according to our waitress. It was 'lost' in the cyber order world. Waitress comes back and says our order was lost and it would be a few more minutes. NOT! She came back and said - oops, probably 20 minutes. At this point, I couldn't deal with it anymore. I talked to the manager - another big mistake. He couldn't care less!. First of all, instead of walking to the table and apologizing - he did nothing of the sort. Second, he didn't know there was a problem. I told him - that's between you and our staff. Third, he asked me what he could do to rectify the situation. Now, I don't want freebies - I guess I should have said "FIND A CURE FOR CANCER!!!'  Finally, he comes to our table to hand us a pen to sign our charge for our 'reduced' bill (we cancelled our order). Didn't even apologize to the members of my party. So, if you want spend your Sunday evening in a restaurant for 2 hours waiting for a meal that never comes - this is the place to be!
