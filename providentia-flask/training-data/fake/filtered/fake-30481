Coming from the Empire State building it took as a little while to find the place, and we had to wait 15 minutes for a table, but it was worth the waiting. Food was great--I love Korean food, but am somewhat particular about it. Everything was prepared fresh, service was good, great food for the price. Atmosphere was nice, clean facility. Very convenient to Hilton Garden Inn and Hampton Inn on W 35th. Much better food and prices than Brendan's, which is across the street. The food was delicious, especially the Bulgogy! The place was packed with locals, which is always a good sign for outstanding places, and the service was excellent! Certainly...
