AMAZINGGGGG !!!! My sister and I have eaten at so many restaurants in CT and have concluded that Oaxaca is the best !!!!! We go there alllllll the time, we are obsessed regulars ! We love love love their nachos and guacamole ! The food is so good that it makes us wanna try things that we've never thought to order before! Everything is good, I will absolutely have their entire menu eventually !!!!
