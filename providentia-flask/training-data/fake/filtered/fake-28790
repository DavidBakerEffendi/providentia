Great funky place for uncomplicated American food.  We had drinks in Bettibar and then dined on the third floor.  Good service, great food, awesome happy hour drink specials - $5 beers, wine and well drinks.  Don't miss it for pre-theater dinner.  We had the chicken fetuccine and shrimp catalina and both were well prepared and tasty.
