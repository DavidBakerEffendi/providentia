I was so hopeful and excited to see this being renovated after years of being closed. The excitement was quickly crushed. We ate in the 'Snug', which had a nice enough ambiance. Nuf said. The menu is all over the place, as if they have no idea who they want to be. Chef 'Nic' (we were told he insists on being referred to as such, obviously watches to much Gordon Ramsay) needs to figure that out. Too much for a 'tavern'. I ordered one of their burgers, my friend; pork belly with blueberry reduction (sounded horrible to me). The PB was so poorly prepared and not allowed to render properly that it was mostly luke warm fat. I love pork belly, this one was the worst I have ever had. My friend had one bite and shoved the plate away. The burger: I was suspect when I saw it, and confirmed on my first bite. I knew it was the 'Stoney's' crew. Sadly, the balance between bread and meat is so off that the meat is lost. I absolutely LOVE the bakery they use, but the choice to use this XXXL bun on a burger has kept me away from Stoney's since they opened, other than a handful of times. Here at Ricaltons, they took it to the next level and toasted it to the point that you could barely get your teeth into it. Ordered medium rare, got well done. Not worth $16, McDonalds does better. I hope they work their kinks out, as it's a great addition to SO, but I won't be going back to eat their until I start hearing good things. Too many people have told me similar stories, and I can get better food at half the price. Good luck guys, I do wish you success.
