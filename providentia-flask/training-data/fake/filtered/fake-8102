This is the only restaurant in town with a fresh salad bar, crusty bread waiting to be cut and a huge barrel of cheese with asst. of crackers ....this can be a meal in itself!  This is one of our favorite places to go. The Salmon is excellent  and we love the Prime Rib (lg. portion you'll need a "doggy bag").  Service has always been good.  The wait can be long on weekends but take the time to wait it is really worth it.  This one is a "keeper."
