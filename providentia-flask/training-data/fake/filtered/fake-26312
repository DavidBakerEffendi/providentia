Favorite banh mi place hands down. I pretty much bleed pork belly- it's that good. It's small and closes early but it's always busy. They are fast though and you can order online. The service is smooth and the employees are nice. Clientele is mixed. I always order the kakuni pork belly sandwich, which is more than enough. One sandwich can feed two people. They are VERY generous- the sandwich was half delicious pork belly and half veggie medley. I ordered a fried egg one time as an extra and struggled to finish it. The bread is good- standard fare, but obvious quality was present. There claim to fame are their loaded fries. I ordered their kimchi fries which was a basket of fries slathered in cheese, kimchee and cilantro. It's a meal itself. Delicious of course. Their wings are ok. I ordered their soy garlic wings and there was a bit too much sauce. I suppose I could enjoy them elsewhere but wasn't a fan. They also have a variety of special drinks. The Vietnamese coffee is good. I have yet to try any of the milk teas. Bring your friends and engorge. Easily one of my favorites, and it kills me that I can't go everyday. Prices are good.
