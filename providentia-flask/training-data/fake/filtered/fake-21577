The food is delicious as i heard and the menu is very unique. Everything is made fresh with quality ingredients. Its perfect place for breakfast or lunch for great price.   I had to try Memo burger, Its AMAZING!!!! Its perfect amount of house ground beef patty w caramelized onion, fontina cheese on brioche roll...And the fresh cut fries are very delicious as well.. The coffee is Excellent and they make it  the way you like..It look like they fresh ground beans too.. The service is great with very friendly staffs, The  space is small but its very cozy and cute. I will definitely be back to try everything on the menu!! I Love the place and the food .
