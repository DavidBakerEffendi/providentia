This was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had! Upon arriving the  host was incredibly rude when I didnt know the party size(usually nicer places go by the last name), turned out to be 16 of us. My wife and I went to the restroom before our party arrived and the punk host was bad mouthing me to a coworker when I came out. Classy. The restaurant and music is loud so bring your outdoor voice and don't plan on having much conversation. As for the beverages,  my wifes mojito was very small but well made. The food, portion sizes are tiny so that bill can rack up really quick. The beef and chicken tacos were actually disgusting. The beef tacos were drowned in some strange teriyaki sauce and  tasted as bad as they looked. Many tacos went untouched as you looked down the table. The corn and guacamole were the only good item I had there. Needless to say, I had to eat when I got home. Do yourself a favor, walk across the street to Ichiro, more bang for your $100!
