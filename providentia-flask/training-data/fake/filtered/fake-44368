Just had a small BBQ chicken dinner with rice and peas from the Veronica's Kitchen food cart on Governor's Island.  As a Carribean-American who has plenty of Carribean fare that's easily accessible in the Flatbush area of Brooklyn, I think I'll pass on Veronica's Kitchen next time I'm on the island.  I've never experienced more attitude and rudeness in a single financial transaction. Um...if you don't want to work at the cart, then don't do it.  I was very disgusted by the rudeness of the woman serving the food and the cashier at the cashier table. Next time, I'll happily pack some Jerk Chicken and sides from Fisherman's Cove or some other Brooklyn spot and avoid your nasty attitudes.
