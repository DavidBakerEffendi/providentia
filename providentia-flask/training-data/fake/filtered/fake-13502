Over all, this restaurant was not bad, but I found the food very bland. I went with my boyfriend and we had the tamale combo and the chicken Baja deluxe burrito, California style. I lived in central Texas for 11 years and I know the difference between "Tex-Mex" and real Mexican food. As this restaurant billed itself as "authentic Mexican"  I was not expecting spicy food. However, I was expecting flavorful food and I was disappointed. In addition to the overall blandness, I have three other main complaints. 1.  The tamale/enchilada sauce tasted like a sweet tomato sauce you might put on pasta. 2. The burrito (which was described as containing guacamole) had only the faintest traces of guacamole in it. 3. No where on the menu did I see the option of ordering guacamole or queso as an appetizer or side dish. Our favorite thing was the black beans, which were very well seasoned.The portions were very large and my boyfriend and I both ended up taking food home, which, after additional seasoning, was much better.
