My husband and I ate here our last night in New York and it was our best meal on our vacation. To start we had their La Rachelle mussels!!! I'm in love with their curried broth!!! Next I had their duck brest. Their sauce is rich and divine. They were able to maintain a crispy skin on the duck breast with the sauce poured over. The texture and flavors were amazing. We finished with a chocolate hot fudge on what was like puffed pastry, and the dessert show was stolen by their coconut ice cream. My husband said that it was the best thing he put in his mouth. The food is amazing and your experience is topped off with wonderful service.
