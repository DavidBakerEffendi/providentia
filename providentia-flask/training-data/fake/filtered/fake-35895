You would expect a BBQ place to have the aroma of BBQ but not this place which was my first warning. I tried the rib/wing combo $10. The ribs had no flavor & had the texture as if they were boiled.  The rib sauce was more like ketchup & stayed on my tongue for another hour after the meal. The wings were not much better also flavorless.  I ordered spicy which was not the case. Hands down me & my buddy agreed these were the worst ribs we ever ate. How can they call themselves a BBQ joint?
