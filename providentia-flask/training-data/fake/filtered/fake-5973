I don't need to write as long of a review as the people below, we just had bad food and atrocious service, and we were charged a lot of money for it. We got the pre-fix: - were seated 45 minutes late despite having a reservation - courses were brought completely out of order - we had a party of 9, received our courses"family style", but got fewer than 9 portions for each course - two of our courses were under-cooked - the drink pairings showed up late--we'd get the pairing after we finished a course and were on to the next one - at no point were made to feel like this was anything less than business as usual, and totally reasonable. The food that was cooked was good, so it was a shame.
