Algarve restaurant is by far the best Portugese place around. Chicken and Ribs with rice and fries always hits the spot. Cheese steak sandwiches are always delicious. Fried calamari garlic shrimp salmon the choices are endless and all are great I recommend this place to anyone and everyone I meet. Plus everything on the menu is healthy so you won't feel to fat after you eat.
