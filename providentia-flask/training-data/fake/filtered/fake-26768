I truly like this tea house. It is very Japanese, well kept, clean and private. I mostly go for lunch and you have the choice of a daily special or set menus. Anything you choose will be good, freshly made, and delicious. I personally like the set menu but it always depends on how much hungry I am. I have been to Japan several times therefore I have an idea of what is authentic and Cha An is. Only downside is that it is a bit expensive,
