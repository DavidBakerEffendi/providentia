I wish I could give this zero stars. Last week 5 Of us went here for restaurant week - and I wish I could say we had a good experience. Before we had even ordered anything or got introduced to the menu etc our waiter felt he needed to 'school' us on what proper eating out ettiquete is and by that I mean he reprimanded 5 girls. He said that after a few girls hadordered drinks at the bar with 5 credit cards that "we should know better- and it wasn't a good look". No joke exact words from him. Now maybe we should all have cash but between work fulltime and making out reservation time we did not have time to make an ATM stop- but honestly we are spending our hard earned money at your establishment and you think it is ok to yell at us? Our tab was over 225 so clearly not a cheap night out. I wish I could remember name of the waiter but we were so disgusted and uncomfortable we got out of there as soon as possible. Don't go here cause honestly who spends money then to have your experience ruined.
