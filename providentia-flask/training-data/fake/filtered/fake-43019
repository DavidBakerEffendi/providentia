Five-star food, three-star service. Great sushi and soups. Good cocktails. And during happy hour it's all even affordable! I've never had to wait too long for my food, but the service has never been spectacular, and once was dreadful. This is the only place I've had sushi in Hartford, and it's kept me coming back.
