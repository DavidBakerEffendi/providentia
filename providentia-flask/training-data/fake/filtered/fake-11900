It is hard to decide whether we liked the fast and friendly service or the food best about this dining experience.  Our server, Jordana, was very helpful when we had questions about the ingredients on a couple of dishes on the menu (I have a food allergy).  The Veal Marsala was amazing, and the Tiramisu is the best that I have ever had (and I order it as often as I can when we dine out).  Tony's will definitely be on our "To Do" list for all future trips to NYC.   Big party?  Theater tickets?  No problem...I watched them "turn over" a "30-top" (greet, serve, and send 30 people on their way happily full for those of you that have  never waited tables) in about an hour and 15 minutes without even breaking a sweat.  I was equally impressed with the fact that the staff appeared to like one another, worked as a team, and enjoy their jobs.  This, unfortunately, was the exception and not the "norm" during our one-week stay in the city.
