As a born and raised brooklynite I know l&b like the back of my hand. The BEST sicilian you could get, although the last few times I went there it was just...meh. I know they've changed hands several times so that could account for the decline in flavor but I'm a little dissapointed. i still go for nostalgia reasons only and to get cremalata ice. If it's not jam packed with tourists (yes, there are buses that bring them here!) it's a nice place to sit outside,eat, and feed some pigeons a bit of crust.
