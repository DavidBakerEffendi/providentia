Hugely disappointing.  I get the distinct impression this place used to be second to none in the Upper Valley, but even a reasonably-tasty pizza doesn't offset the poor quality of service.  When you have to repeat yourself a fourth time, it isn't a case of "can't hear," it's a case of "don't care if I hear."  The staff (and more to the point, management) just isn't making any effort, and it shows.   Head on over to Ramunto's --the parking may be trickier, but the pizza is every bit as good (and there's frankly a far better selection), the atmosphere is a little more inviting, and more importantly the service is 100% better.
