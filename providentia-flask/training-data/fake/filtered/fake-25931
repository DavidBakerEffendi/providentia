I go in and the place is empty.  I wanted to sit by the window, but the hostess/register lady said i couldn't.  You'd think you would want people by the window when its empty, gives the place a good vibe from outside. I finally get seated outside.  The waitress took like 15min to come to the table and i get greeted with "ya know what ya want?".  No specials, no welcoming, no tableside manner really.  I ask her for a berliner weisse in bottle and she had no clue what that even was.  I ask for a list of bottles and she say i have to get up and go look for myself.  I order a ceasar salad with chicken and shrimp and get up to self serve myself a beer. Large and impressive selection of beer.  Everything was nicely organized and thoughtfully placed.  I grab myself a 1809 and sit down. The salad took 30 mins to come out.  Nothing too great.  Very standard fare.  The rest of the menu was unimpressive as well.  Kinda wished for a higher caliber of food with the excellent beer.  You'd think with the competition in the Bella Vista area, they'd step it up a lil. I ate my whole meal without being checked up on once, and made my way to the counter to cash myself out.   Overall the whole experience was sub par.  Hope they shape thing up soon.  The place is beautiful and in a great location.
