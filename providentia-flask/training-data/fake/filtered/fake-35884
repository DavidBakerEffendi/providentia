Service is excellent - the staff are so friendly and warm. Food is also terrific.  We are vegetarian (no poultry, no fish) and they have many delicious options for us.  The Vegetarian Pear Salad and Veggie Gyros are great! We bring our kids there and they are completely family friendly. They have vegetarian specials every week. We do to-go orders to eat at home too, all the time! It's beautiful to sit by the canal and eat while you enjoy the view. Can't say enough good things about this place - it is on our short list of go-to local eateries!!
