Decent food, decent price... but absolutely horrendous service... we got served by someone (probably the owner's daughter) who clearly does not want to even be there, let alone serve customers (maybe because we somehow interrupted whatever it is she is doing in her computer)... she gave us an attitude as soon as we got in and only broke a smile and acted reasonably when I expressed my dissatisfaction to her.... if you can take the aggravation from servers like her in exchange for an okay food, then go for it.. otherwise, there's plenty other places in nutley where you can dine in... there's a better vietnamese place 5 mins down in bloomfield.. they are fast and definitely professional in dealing with customers and in my opinion, has got better food than this place. Honestly, do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.
