I love their soup dumplings! Many would argue that it's a tourist trap but what is a tourist trap if it delivers good, consistent food? I got a plate of the cold dishes...sliced beef and jelly fish. That was tasty!! I love jelly fish. It was $5.99/cold plate which I thought was kind of pricey. I recommend sticking with the traditional pork shiyoronpo.....crab, not so Â much.
