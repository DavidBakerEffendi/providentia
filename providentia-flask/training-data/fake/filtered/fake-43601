This is our go to place for some good noodles and Shanghai Buns. Food is great, but the waiting staff can be better. Very slow to refill water and take our order. They seem to be overwhelmed, even with minimum patrons. Only time they come quick to your table is to collect the bill. Recommend for the food, but don't expect great service.
