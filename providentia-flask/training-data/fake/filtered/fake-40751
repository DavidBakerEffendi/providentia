Weird that I like Hancos better in the new location.  I don't know, the last few times I went before they moved I was underwhelmed -- the bread was soft and weird, and the ingredients seemed just blah.  But the other day I was walking down Smith and decided to wander into the new location (it is a nice and relaxing design) to satisfy my bahn mi craving and was very pleased.  The bread had just the right amount of crustiness, and the ingredients burst with flavor.  Well done Hancos. My wife says the pho is great too, but I haven't tried it yet.
