Really enjoyed the Urban Deco style of this place.  We had one of the pizzas.  It was very good and loved the thin crust.  The service was fast and courteous.  We were there late in the afternoon and the sunlight coming in made it a very nice afternoon stop.  There were a lot of healthy looking choices on the menu and am sure we will be back.
