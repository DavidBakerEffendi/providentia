I ordered Chicken Seekh Kababs and roti from the Halal shop 2 days ago. When we came home and opened the box the color of seekh was red for chicken. Anyways when we started eating we got BEEF mixed with chicken. One of the Roti had some kind of fly or cockroach in it. Being hindu's BEEF is a big NO NO for us. We are not coming back to this place or any other place which sells BEEF and chicken. MADE A BIG MISTAKE.
