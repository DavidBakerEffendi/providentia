I was very excited to go to Taras Bulba when I first heard about it from friends.  We went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch.  It was not busy at all.  There were maybe 3 other tables occuppied. Service was very slow.  The food is good but portions incredibly small- if you order the $12 borscht- be prepared to be served only 1/3 of a small bowl.  The vareniki, while tasty, also very small and very expensive for what you get. I grew up in the city so I understand prices and realize that it would be expensive.   Probably the most annoying/upsetting  part of it all was there beverage charges.  They barely give you a  6 oz glass of flat soda and if you order a refill they charge  you - $5/glass- 2 adults and 2 kids - $40 in non alcoholic drinks?- really made me angry. I heard they offer a free vodka- never got that offered as well.  The food was ok, atmosphere was nice and traditional but not sure if I  would go back - feel like I was ripped off.
