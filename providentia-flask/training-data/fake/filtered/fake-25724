My husband I have been coming to Katz's for a long time and love it.  BUT - ever since they renovated the restaurant, the service has been terrible.  We sat at the counter last week and watched the young waitresses try to match the prepared food with the receipts - it was ridiculous.  The dishes sat on the counter for quite a long time - very poor service.  The newly renovated restaurant has been open for two months now - the service should be up to par, but it isn't.  Maybe the new wait staff are too young?  We will not go back for a long time, if at all, even though the food is wonderful.  Too bad.
