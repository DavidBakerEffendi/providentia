We did the plate with meats and cheeses at the Piazza. It is a stand-up at a table and enjoy wine and some snacks kind-of situation. It was a great stop-through while shopping. Saw Joe Bostionich when he walked right past my table, (it was Food and Wine weekend). Fun stop over. Didn't buy anything at the markets but would recommend it. Neat concept.
