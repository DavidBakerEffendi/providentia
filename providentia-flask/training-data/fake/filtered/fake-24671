I think I'd probably be understating myself if I were to say I've been here 20 times, but I always do my best not to exaggerate. Where does one start with this place? First of all, a seven day a week happy hour from 4-7, that should never be over looked. The Korean BBQ Beef Satay is a dish everyone should try. It's so juicy and tender, and anything with kimchi is an automatic win. Their Kobe beef hot dogs and sliders are to die for, and same with all of their bao bun dishes. Their dumplings are also all fantastic, but if you had to pick just one, go with edamame. If you are feeling a salad, go with the mushroom salad, because the truffle dressing is enough to make you think being a vegetarian is actually possible. Their tuna rice cracker is to die for, as is the kimchi fried rice. If I had to label the best dish on the menu, which isn't very easy, I'd have to suggest the veal over Saracha rice. So tasty. And everyone should have a scorpion bowl at the graffiti bar. It's really a hard place to beat.
