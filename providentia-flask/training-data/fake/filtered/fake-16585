I have eaten dinner at Cafe Colore about four times and have now hosted two events here.  I am beyond happy and impressed with the service and the food.  The manager worked with my budget and I was able to throw a fantastic girls night out with sixteen women.  Everyone loved it! They are extremely accommodating and generous with portions. The food was scrumptious and I have only great things to say.  Many of my friends did not know about this place, which makes me feel like it is a hidden gem.  I am looking forward to going back many times in the future!
