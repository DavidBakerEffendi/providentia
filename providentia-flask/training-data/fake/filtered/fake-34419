The food was good, but I wouldn't go again. I also wouldn't recommend going. Our waiter was very nice. He would constantly refill out cups and bring us refills of chips. On the other hand, another one of the woman servers was very rude. We did not realize that the paper plates at the salsa bar were just used as signs, so we grabbed two, not even noticing they were written on, and used them as salsa plates by accident. It was a silly mistake, but an honest one. Anyone who was just going along an not entirely paying attention could have made the same mistake. The woman came up to our table and rudely says "If you want salsa, you need to use you're dishes." and then without even asking takes the paper plates away from us and throws them out. We apologized and she just kept going on about how those are only used to write on. At this point we understood our mistake but she kept embarrassing us. She walked away from our table to the bar and proceeded to give us a dirty look. For the rest of the dinner we felt very awkward and as if we had made a huge mistake, jeopardizing the business. We were unable to eat our food in a relaxed manner like we had already planned. When we left she looked straight at us and turned her face. She didn't even day thank you. ( Especially after the expensive dinner we payed for.) It was incredibly rude of her. I work in the food business myself and if I ever spoke to my customers like that I would be fired in a heart beat. Her rudeness and inconsideration puts people in a bad mood. It was my fathers birthday and to be honest, she made it a horrible birthday dinner for him. It just goes to show you never know what you can be ruining for a person by being rude and how regardless of how good your food is, one person doing one little thing can ruin it all. I hope her rudeness was worth losing the customers and any customers we would have recommended otherwise.
