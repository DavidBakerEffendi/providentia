My new favorite! We are so lucky to have this place in downtown Burlington, Vermont! The salads are fantastic, my favorite is the "Rocky" and I have had the Melenzana pizza and loved it. Although there are a few others that I love as well. You just have to get there and try it... just great. No reservations for a party under 6, so the wait can be long especially on the weekends, but worth it.
