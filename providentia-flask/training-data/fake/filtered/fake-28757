With much anticipation, I came here with my girlfriends on Friday night. This place is awesome. The interior is modern and has a cool vibe. We shared three specialty roles and they were all amazing! We also had a Korean appetizer called ddukbokki and the chewiness of the rice cake went very well with the sweetness of the sauce. The octopus ceviche had the perfect texture and was very refreshing. For dessert, we tried their home-made strawberry mochi that the waitress recommended and it was delicious! It came with a sweet dipping fudge. Mmm. One of my friends commented on how the bathroom even reminded her of the W hotel. Can't wait to go back soon!
