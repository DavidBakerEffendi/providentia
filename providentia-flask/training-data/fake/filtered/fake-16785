Okay, I'm a little biased since I have owned New Wave since 1985, but I'd like to set the recordstraight about some of the reviews I have read on this sight. Mallory P. is mistaken, a miller high life is $3.40+tax. Cliff C.:New Wave is a name taken from what in 1981 was one of the best fast-pitch softball teams in Philly. We played in front of crowds numbering in the hundreds with vendors and fans, when the bar opened in 1985 we drew on that popularity to get us off the ground, my apologies to the B-52s.Marie R.: Finding a hair in your food IS gross and I wish you had brought it to my or my brothers attention, we truly hate to disappoint anyone who takes the time to come to our establishment. Emily: I have no idea as to what you are talking about, and I don't think you do either. Brie: The policies about food consumption are what we agreed to do with the neighborhood association to get tables in the first place. An easy fix is just orderind a plate of fries. We have no agenda to gouge people, we still sell quarts of beer at a 50 cent profit.Joe: no locks on the mens room is designed to prevent drug use in our tavern. The unisex bathroom locks and unless you are quite fortunate no one can see your stuff in the men's room either! Sara and Sal: Once again, I wish you would let me know if you have been disappointed by our food, you still can and I will make it up to you any time, just ask for Sam Lynagh when you come in. My thanks to all those who come to New Wave, we know you have many other choices and strive to make New Wave better all the time!!
