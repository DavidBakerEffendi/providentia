TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!  made yelp account just to make this known. went here sunday afternoon (10/21/2012) with out of town guests for lunch.  the one star isn't about the long wait or the price.  it's because of the worst customer service i have ever experienced in my life!!!!!!!!!!!! decided to try something new and ordered the wasabi ramen (don't remember the exact name).  there were bamboo shoots in the ramen.  when i went to eat them, they smelled and tasted like they were not fresh.  i was going to just eat it, but really felt funny about it so i told the waiter.  he took the ramen bowl away. then the manager (haru) came back with the bowl, threw it down in front of me and told me that it was fine and i should eat it.  i explained that the bamboo was not fresh and asked if i could get something else.  he told me to eat it.  if i wanted something else, he would have to charge me because there was nothing wrong with my ramen. i was humilated in front of my guests and very upset.  how could a manager treat his customer in this way?!  he threw me back the bowl and told me to eat it as if i was a dog.  i was boiling with rage.  couldn't help but feel that if i had been a white customer, i would not have been treated this way.  totally disrespectful.  totally outrageous.  can't support a business like this.
