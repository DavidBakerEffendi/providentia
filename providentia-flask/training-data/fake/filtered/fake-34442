Umai Umai is a must-try place in my opinion. Quality has always been consistent and service from the servers is so friendly and welcoming. If you like spicy and seafood, give the Seafood Paella a try. It was sooooo delicious! Also, we thoroughly enjoyed the tuna bibim. it made the whole restaurant smell good! From the rolls, id have to say Pingu is a constant favorite. With it, king kong roll compliments it well since Pingu is pretty much fried (but oh so delicious). Anyways, i always look forward to going back because I have yet to try everything on the menu! Oh, dont forget to make reservations on the weekends.
