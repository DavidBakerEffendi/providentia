wow....ubu, i think u are just intent on bashing sushi hana, which happens to be my favorite place in town, I mean sure their service can get slow on their off days, but definitely overexaggerating. I also saw your review on baristanet and uhhh....hello, copy and pasting a comment from months ago to this site? Sushi Hana is a great place to relax and enjoy a meal whether with friends or family, they are welcoming and even have a fish tank that kids love to stare at. Food is wonderful, and always fresh, if u even suggest that their food is not at the level it should be or if they get an order wrong, they are quick to offer apologies and offer something else in its stead. The miso soup is best in town, I love mine with a little bit of white rice. Rock Shrimp tempura is amazing and one of my favorite appetizers. Â  Nori, Nouveau, and all the rest in town are either mediocre or overpriced. I've been to nori and its really not all that great...usual fare but waiters were cold and stuck up, as if they were doing us favor by taking our order. Sushi hana is definitely better than most city places i've been to. Must try regardless of what others say. Its all subjective so its worth it just to see what you think of it rather than blindly trusting someone else's opinion
