Best burger in the city (500)! Both the truffle and spicy fries are also awesome. They even have a very good ice tea from the fountain machine. The owner/manager is extremely nice and thoughtful. Went out of his way one day and made a batch of fries for us to try which was not even in the menu and he wanted our opinion on it.
