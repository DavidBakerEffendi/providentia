must say i was very disappointed in the service i received on sunday, 1-6-13.  and not to mention the  food.  i ordered an superman breakfast and the waitress brought it out with 2 strips of bacon on it when i request sauage.  well, she grabbed a napkin and took the 2 strips of bacon off my plate, and walked awayk then came back with one, mind you one little piece of sauage.  now come on, is this superman or what.  i asked her, you only get one piece of saugage and she stated yea, that's it.  we cut back.  so i said the price didn't cut back so what's up with this one piece of meat.  she said that's its.  i vowed then never to come back again.  the breakfast included an cheese omelte, potatoes and one dam piece of sauage for $10.49.  i've never been so disappointed before in my life for a meal.  i would have been better off just ordering eggs with cheese and potatoes.  what the hell did i pay for.  never again will i eat there
