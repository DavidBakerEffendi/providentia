I went there with family and kids at Xiao Long Bao for lunch, and we all love it. We have a mix of spicy and non-spicy dishes. Â We ordered a few noodle soup and from their set lunch menu. Potion size of which is just right, with just rice and the dish plate, and nothing of the nonsense stuffs that I wouldn't even touch. We also order the Kung Fu Xiao Long Bao, and pan fried dumplings, to share. I'm quite impressed by the xiao long bao which is juicy in the inside, and the bao skin is thin yet strong enough to hold the juice/soup inside. Service is friendly and attentive. Prices are very reason, with set lunch menu under $10 ($7.95 per), and noodle soup, xiao long bao, and dumplings all under $13. We were in the neighborhood and just walk. Public transport (metro) is convenient enough, though I wouldn't drive into the area just for the meal. But if I'm in the vicinity, I would surely try it again.
