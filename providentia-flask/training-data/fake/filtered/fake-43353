The food is amazing here. Despite the weird combination of chicken liver and pomegranate molasses sauce i have not had anything close to as amazing as that (if you are a liver fan of course). Also the brussels sprouts with fig jam, walnuts and mint yogurt will make you a brussels sprout lover if you have not been one. Their "Tabbouleh" salad is also a must try, very refreshing and tasty with hints of parsley and mint. Over all i was very satisfied with the food selection, and all the above is Gluten free if you are sensitive such as myself. It is a bit on the pricey side, but what isn't in NYC....
