As good as everybody says it is.  Very seldom do these types of places live up to the hype.  This one does.  In the summertime, this place is almost magical, with families enjoying pizzas and memories at the tables outside.  In winter, you won't wait as long. The pizza is heavy on the bread and sauce (um, yum!) with a light dusting of cheese. Slices are always fresh out of the oven, and two of these bad boys are plenty for dinner (and will leave you enough room for spumoni for dessert). Get a mix of all three flavors (pistachio, vanilla and chocolate). It's a really good thing I don't live near here, because if I did I'd be eating this pizza all the time...and probably be obese. Next time you're in Brooklyn you have to have this pizza...it's incredible.
