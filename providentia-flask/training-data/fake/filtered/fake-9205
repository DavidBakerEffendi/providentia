Park on Widley or Allen Street on either side of the mini playground. Great Service, and Great Food. We had a blast the first time we went, and the second time and... well, you get the idea. Normally when you go to a restaurant for the first time,it is not quite what you were psyched up for. This was the total opposite. It was one of those experiences where you find yourself thinking "This would be perfect if only they had... " and then you look and realize they do. I can't say enough good about PYT. Try the Chicken Bacon Waffle Sliders.
