So very bad.  Eataly is Italian cuisine vomited up by good taste.  The idea is interesting enough to bite, but the execution pains the soul.  This place is an offense to all senses.  It is logistically confusing, the food is sub-par for cuisine that should have been created by some of the industry's most recognizable chefs, and the vision is too scattered.  To read the poster that explains Eataly prior to entering is to be perplexed; to try to navigate the strange design of space, crowds and stressed out employees is to be gravely annoyed; to taste foods that are not worth the time spent on long lines and expensive prices is to be utterly disappointed. For the prime real estate that Eataly has, New York deserves better representation of Italian cuisine.  Mario and Lidia, my heart has sunk and my respect for you, deteriorated.
