I've never written a Yelp review but had to rave about this place. I was with a party of 12, and we had booked a reservation at Empellon Tacqueria across the street and they screwed up our reservation so we couldnt be seated till 2 hours later. Instead of waiting, we wandered into Ofrenda. Best move we could have made! We have never been here but this is officially our new spot.... The place was busy but the hostess, Laura, said she would make it work for our group and 15 minutes later we were sitting down! She was accommodating, warm, sweet, just perfect! So appreciated! The food was great (love the fish tacos, bf loved the asada), drinks were great but more than anything, the level of service at this humble, unassuming Mexican restaurant was better than I've ever experienced. Thank you to Laura (hostess), Dara (waitress) and Jorge (owner) for making my boyfriend's birthday so much fun and for saving our night! We will DEFINITELY be back! Z (the group of Israelis :)
