Being a huge fan of the Standard Tap, in Northern Lib I was very excited about moving to Fishtown down the street from their sister bar. While it is a compatible venue, there is definitely a different vibe with it's own ups and downs. The bar has an early to mid twenties hipster crowd mostly, but you see quite a variety of people in there. Like the tap, the beer is all micro brews, however they don't rotate their selection much. The kitchen is pretty good and now that they expanded the place, there is actually room to eat. If for one reason and one reason only you go to JB's; go to see a concert here. They have an incredible venue for music upstairs. If all you've seen is the downstairs you will most likely will not be very impressed. The biggest downfall of JB's is a few bad apples in the staff. Recently this had gotten better. I think someone finally realized that snubbing customers is bad for business. I used to literally order a round every time I saw the bartender. because they would disappear in to the back for a half hour at a time. Then, when they came back they would play with their cell phone for another ten minutes ignoring everyone at the bar. Like I said though. It seems like the past few months the bar as undergone a night and day change. I see a lot of new faces in the staff, so perhaps this is no longer an issue. 5 stars for the upstairs, three stars for the downstairs. All in all, 4 stars.
