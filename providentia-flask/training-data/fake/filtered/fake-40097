I'm not one of those people who need to give a place 5 stars to justify waiting 2+ hours for pizza, and because there's a big crowd standing around.  The pizza is definitely original, but not mind blowing or best ever.  The bread and crust are tasty although sometimes burnt,  and way too much olive oil is used which makes me use a knife and fork to eat the pizza sometimes.
