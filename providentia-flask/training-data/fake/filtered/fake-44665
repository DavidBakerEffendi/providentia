Oh LaVa! This quaint little neighborhood cafe is just the bees knees. The food is pretty good, the prices are very fair, and the help is just great! A cute little barista made me latte, and it was darn good! I love the comfy decor and the owner is such a sweetheart. In my book of cutie pie cafes Lava gets a 10 out of 10!
