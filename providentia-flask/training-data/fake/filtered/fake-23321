This hip, unassuming little joint is exactly what I want in this neighborhood.  The food is delicious and extremely reasonable.  Surprisingly, the side dishes are crazy good, which makes it an easy stop for a drink and a snack to unwind on the way home.  The corn is one of my top 5 dishes in NYC.  And how can you go wrong with avocado fries?  The beers are great, and the wine cocktails are unique and delicious.  The service is great, the manager is adorable and professional.  This place has staying power.
