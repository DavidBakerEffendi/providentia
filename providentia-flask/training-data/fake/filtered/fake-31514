Came to NYC for my 21st birthday from Cali and my boyfriend found this restaurant to surprise me, he made a reservation and got seated pretty quickly. Our server was nice. Our food was pretty good. The ambience was very nice and the view was amazing. Really like the vibe there. The manager even came and asked us if the food was okay which was nice. They didn't have the birthday cake shot anymore so that sucked, and my boyfriend had told them to surprise me and sing me happy birthday but they forgot so my boyfriend had to tell them again. Nonetheless very good place and a definite recommend! I will definitely go if I ever return to NYC !
