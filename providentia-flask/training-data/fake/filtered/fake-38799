My native NYer's opinion is that this bar is what I imagine homey Midwestern pubs Â feel like (is it that transplants want to recreate their cherished watering holes here so they don't feel alienated by us jaded Yawkers? probably) My friend (not a Midwesterner- in fact, not even an American, so his opinions are always valued since he has no regional bias) kept going on about the pulled pork sandwiches so we went as soon as they opened. It was cozy, there was a little baby snoozing in a car seat (the owner's, i think), and there were free pretzels and hershey's kisses. Not to mention the bartender is really friendly and made me a michelada (delicious! i dont know why im on a tomato juice-beer kick,but its good). the pulled pork sandwiches we ordered were no frills (smoky meat, hamburger bun, crinkle-cut pickles, bbq sauce in a squeeze bottle) but man they were delicious! and cheap- two for $5! did i mention that they have a good selection of beers from all over (including two dollar carlings if you're really skint) and that nothing seemed more than $7? this place is the end.
