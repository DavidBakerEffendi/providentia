Good solid comfort food in a classic diner car. We stopped in for lunch and the place was packed. We waited about 20 minutes for a table which was just short of "way too long for lunch". The place wasn't the cleanest, but the wait staff was helpful and accommodating. The booths were on the small side and counter stools were close together. I would like to bring my whole family of 5 here one day, but not sure if there is room for such a large party. I foresee kids, elbows and the end person getting shoved off the seat. I wouldn't eat here everyday, but it's a fun change.
