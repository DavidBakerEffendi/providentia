The building looks like a remodeled fast food joint. I had the Oxtail and Beans, Curry Goat, and Jerk Conch. The Plantains were nice and crunchy, but the Soursop was a bit over ripe. WOW, the Scotch Bonnet and Irish Sea Moss made my palate quiver. The Smoked Sloth Knuckle was a bit chewy, but the wood came through nice. Hen of the Wood and Nika will make good options when they open on the other side of the mall this spring.
