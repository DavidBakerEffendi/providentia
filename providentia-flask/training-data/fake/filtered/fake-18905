Sorry to all the fans, but I don't quite get what the big deal is here.  After hearing so much about Artichoke, I finally tried it last weekend and I wasn't terribly impressed by their pizzas.  I guess it would have been ok if I hadn't heard anything about that place before, but in this instance, I feel like it's more about hype than substance.  I've had better slices on Avenue A, without having to deal with the crowds.  The place is tiny too.
