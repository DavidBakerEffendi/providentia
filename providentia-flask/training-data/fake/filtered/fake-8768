I use to love this restaurant, the drinks were amazing the food great, the wait staff is great and there managers were great too. But something has changed dramatically, it's clear that the people who own the restaurant are treating there staff horribly, and cleaning house. I loved seeing my regular bartender and my favorite couple of managers. But they are gone now. People are no longer happy working there and it shows. What used to be one of the best restaurants in Park Slope now is one of the most unhappy places to eat. I'm not sure what is going on with them but I use to be met with a smile and now it's pure Â frustration.
