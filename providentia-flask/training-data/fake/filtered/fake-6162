I am a huge italian food fan, I sometimes tell people i should have been born italian because i like the food so much. the food here was very good and I enjoyed my good old spaghetti and meat balls very much. as well as a mixture of appetizers shared between my friends and I. the only reason I did not give a perfect five star rating is because the service was a little slow. I come from a family of waitresses and I have grown to appreciate a good waiter and i felt that we could have been checked on a bit more. when we needed refills we found ourselves all trying to flag down the waiter. I would still go back just make sure to drink your beverage slow.
