I stopped in with a friend for the oyster happy hour, then the rain started, so we decided to stay for dinner. I'm very glad we did. We sat at the bar and began with the octopus appetizer, very tender and an unusual preparation with chickpeas, nuts and basil, definitely a must. Pate with pickled radishes were also a nice surprise, I think it was the bread that did it. It had that slightly sweet and nuttiness that complimented it so well. My friend then had the Thai mussels, generous portion, dipping the bread in the broth was addictive, he couldn't stop. I had the market fish with greens in a bacon broth, it disappeared in front of me. Could be because I'm a little bit of a bacon addict. I also tried the bacon infused bourbon cocktail, I will stop by for more of those in the next few days. I sincerely recommend this place to anyone who wants to treat themselves to a great meal without breaking the bank. It was very reasonable. Bartender was friendly and knowledgeable. It was a terrific evening.
