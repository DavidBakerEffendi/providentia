I dont see the hype with this restaurant. I had a good sampling of the menu, and I was not impressed. For antipasto, I had arancini, which my nonna could make better, fried ricotta which was nice, salumi which were Â disappointing. For pasta, I tasted all of the dishes that had a tomato sauce, and the sauce for all was not very good. I also had the pasta with mint and fava beans which was unappetizing. For the main course, I had pollo alla diavola which was moist but not spicy at all. I also had roasted potatoes on the side which was overly sweet. Overall, if you want to spend alot of money on small portions and roman food that is not very good, then come to maialino, because you will leave with a empty wallet and a empty stomach
