Located in the front of an enormous shopping center, this restaurant has the availability of hundreds of people who march in and out in flocks before and after their shopping extravaganzas. As my friend and I walked in, we were told of the 45 minute wait for a table, so we scurried to the bar in hopes to find two adjacent seats. Luckily, we did. The food was of course, superb. I started with the egg drop soup, a nice classic that never fails here. I moved on to the beef lo mein, which wasn't greasy or over seasoned.The portion was more than adequate, but not Cheesecake Factory sized (thank god). I finished off with the banana spring rolls, which weren't as aesthetically pleasing as the other courses, but overwhelmed my senses with delicious flavors that contrasted its appearances. The main thing that I noticed in this PF Chang's compared to others was that I felt like I was in a herd of animals, being ushered in to quickly eat from the trough and then leave in one mass together. When I go out to dinner, 3 things matter, like they do for most people. 1.) The atmosphere is nice. (PF Chang's - CHECK) 2.) The food intensely delicious. (PF Chang's- CHECK) 3.) I can take the time to enjoy myself, rather than not being able to remember the experience. (PF Chang's - FAIL). I was able to have great conversations with my friend, which reminded me that I had little to no conversation with the bartender, minus the ordering of our items. The poor gentleman had barely a chance to breathe let alone speak to his guests to form any rapport whatsoever. Overall, I still love PF Chang's as I always have. Just not this one.
