This was my default brunch spot until it got reviewed in New York magazine, now we need reservations, but it is still worth it! Between my hubby and I, we have tried almost everything. It is even good for parties, as we had 12 people come here for his birthday brunch/lunch. The french toast is my favorite! Â The doughnuts can be a bit dry if you don't get to them early enough, but they are donughts so of course they are good! They make their own sausage here and the eggs are from a local farm. You can taste the freshness! WE LOVE IT! Still haven't made it here for dinner, (usually dinners are further uptown where my hubby and I work) but we will go soon....I hear the pasta is out of this world!
