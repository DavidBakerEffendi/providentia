We had a tasting menu here recently and it was fabulous, with lots of unexpected ingredients (sweet potato, asparagus, smoked trout, quinoa, wrappings of potato skin and trout skin, others too numerous to recall, though the waitress did in very helpful detail, and all delicious).  Menu also highly entertaining.  I'm normally a pretty traditional sushi eater, but this place won me over.  I also like that the owner has the nerve to keep tuna and shrimp off the menu because they are unsustainable.
