Stopped in Kamal's a few years back to try the lunch buffet after trying a number of Indian buffets in the North Jersey area. I was glad I did. They have some of the best Indian food I have ever had next to that place in Amsterdam. I dont know if it is Norhern or Southern, I just know I like it. The buffets are small but they seem to make the food as needed, unlike other places where they plop it in at 11 and it still sits there at 2. Small selection but delicious. Best chicken tikka I have ever had. Several other selections, the names of which escape me , that  I know by sight, and all I know is  I like them. I have eaten there for regular dinners as well. Tried the chicken Vindalu and Korma and found both very good. Tried the Goa fish: delicious, awesome sauce. Had some of my girlfriend's lamb, the style I cannot remember, but good too. Staff is quiet but attentive. Parking can be tough since the lot is small but just park on the street, usually enough space. Kamal's is across from the Auto Zone.
