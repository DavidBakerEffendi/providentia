Definitely my new favorite in PS. I've been there a few times for dinner and once for brunch with plans to go back again. I nvever feel disappointed and neither have friends who enjoy sharing plates. Â Haven't tasted anything yet that I wouldn't order. Positives - BYOB, friendly staff, quality ingredients, great menu. Negatives - can't really think of anything.
