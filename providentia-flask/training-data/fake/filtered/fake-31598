Upon arrival, I was greeted with a smile by cindy (i believe her name was) an sat shortly after my date arrived. Our server, Felicia was fun honest & upbeat, (hard to come by in this biz) recommended the nachos; which were rather too crispy for me but delish nonetheless... We wanted a bottle of Malbac with our entres, felicia saved us some money by switching to glasses because of the amazing happy hour deal going on at the time... $4 glasses of all wine ! cant beat that! (THANKS!!) We had the pollo & the churrasco; the chicken had a rich zesty sauce to compliment the dish, the steak was ok, could have used a steak sauce of some kind... the table aside from us had the pernil and salmon which looked and smelled better than our choices... next time we will be trying those instead! =P A lot of birthdays with some scrumptious looking desserts i wish we saved room for, on the next visit we will be sure to try something sweet before we leave... Overall, everybody was very friendly, the ambience is vibrant, the view is breathtaking & after looking at some of the reviews, im glad Cindy, Felicia & the rest of the staff made my first experience one i cant wait to repeat! (My birthday is coming up!) See you soon, hungry for moree! =) PS: get a blender for pi√±a coladas ! (Ironic how doesn't blend have a blender ? Lol)
