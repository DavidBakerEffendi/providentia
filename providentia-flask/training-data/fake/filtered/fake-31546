I was a bit iffy about this place bc I heard the place wasn't all that but I beg to differ! It was a slow night and we were seated quickly with a nice city view. I came here for dinner but I also heard they had great drink specials. Steph told us to get sangritas if we wanted something strong and she was right. We had three and we felt nice. We had the arepas and the Majorca corn. The corn was ehhh kind of messy to eat for dinner but the arepas were banging. It had short rib Guac pico de gallo. So good . For dinner I had pernil. The meat was so tender and just fell off the bone. It did need a little bit more seasoning but u can tell that the quality was very good. Next time she told us to try the burger! Will def be back
