This market is so awesome. It was my first spot after checking into my hotel and I spent almost two hours exploring this amazing place. Upon entering the market, I was overcome by all the various shops. In every direction, it seemed never-ending. There was soul food, Chinese food, donuts, bakeries, fresh produce, fresh seafood, hoagies, cheesesteaks, crepes, etc. The list goes on! I had the intention of going to Tommy DiNic's for lunch. They're famous for their roast pork sandwich with broccoli rab√©. The line wrapped around the entire counter and to the soul food seating area. Many other shops had long lines as well, with eager and hungry folks waiting for a bite to eat. There is something for everyone at this market. It's a blend of Farmers Markets with fresh fruits, vegetables, seafood, and meats to various shops that offer food to eat right there and then. It's enormous and often packed, especially on the weekends. If you wanted to, you could spend all day or all of your vacation at Reading Terminal Market. There's just so much to see and do. Absolutely recommend coming to Reading Market, if not for a bite to eat, at least to see it for yourself.
