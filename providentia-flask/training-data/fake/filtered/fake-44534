The food was alright but I hated the service..the restaurant closing time was 9:30, and we arrived at 9:15. When we placed the order the waiter asked us to order all three courses because the kitchen was closing..ok that was understandable..but after 5 minutes it was like a flood on on our table ..all the dishes were served at the same time..to the point that we din't have any place left on ours..and had to put some on the side table...after a while they started vacuuming the place..if it was so bothersome for them then they should have told us beforehand that they could not entertain late orders..why ruin someone's evening? on top of all that they charged us $10.57 i.e. 15 % gratuity by default..all in all a very disappointing experience.
