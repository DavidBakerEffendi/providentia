A Philly gem! Dined with friends last evening at The Treemont. We first shared a few small plates...highly recommend the delicious Cherrystone clam ceviche and perfectly prepared Day Boat scallops and Foie Gras. Beef short rib entree was melt in your mouth tender. Don't miss finishing with the Sour cream panna cotta for dessert. Will be back!
