Super disappointed in the phone etiquette when I called to find out more about the restaurant. I spoke to a lady named "Jackie" and she had this pretentious air about her. Not sure if I was speaking to the proprietor or if she was a manager, but lady you could be a bit more helpful and friendly to people that want to give you business...seriously! She sounded very confused and clueless throughout the convo...sigh. I asked her about parking in the area since Chinatown could be a bit tricky and she immediately informed me that I could just throw my car into a private lot for $20.00 or so (really helpful). When I asked about reservations or the wait time, she was even more vague and I felt like she could care less. Okay, I get it that we're probably going to have to wait but having a welcoming attitude towards potential customers in NYC is must especially if you hope to survive in this tough economy. We were planning to invite two other couples for my birthday but now the plan to go to the Boil is gonzo.
