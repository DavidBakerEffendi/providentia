This looks like a nice place with outdoor seating and a good menu.  I was very disappointed with the quality of the coffee.  It was very weak and tasteless.  I don't think there is any excuse for weak and tasteless coffee.  I ordered a tea which came in a big cup with one little skinny teabag.  I couldn't drink it. They have to stop being stingy with the drinks.  Maybe the coffee would be better with a shot or two of espresso in it.  Never tried any food.
