Fuel is one of my favorite "fast food" restaurants in Philadelphia. Some people may scoff at the fact that everything is under 500 calories, but I can assure you you aren't missing a thing! The food is always fresh--I tend to get wheat panninis--the smoothies and juice drinks are fantastic (my favorite post-workout filled is the Protein Buster), and I have yet to encounter a negative staff experience, though at times eating in can be a bit on the slow side. All in all, I highly recommend Fuel, both in Center City and South Philadelphia.
