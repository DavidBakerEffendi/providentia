I just love this place. You are in the midst of everything and yet you don't have to pay high prices, like I would expect in Center City. The servers are really good and the food exceptional. Great location, great service, great food, along with reasonable prices. What more could you ask for? Oh yeah... they get you to the show on time!!!
