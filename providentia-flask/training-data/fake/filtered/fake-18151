Weak.  I went in on a Thursday night for dessert with my wife, it wasn't busy at all and we ended up waiting ten minutes till the server came to our table.  We finally ordered, 25 minutes later we walked out.  I work in the restaurant industry and there is no reason dessert should ever take half an hour.  The hostess was kind enough to tell us she could bring our dessert out in 2 minutes, which made me wonder: Why couldn't our server do that?
