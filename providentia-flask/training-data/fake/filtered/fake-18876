While the pizza might be fine for a drunken adventure, the staff is terrible. The cashier has nothing more to bark than, "cash only" (with no signs to support) and the bouncer (that's right a pizza place bouncer) randomly decides when it is and is not appropriate for people to eat pizza inside the establishment. If this pizza was mind blowingly amazing i wouldn't have posted this scathing review, but with mediocre pizza a nice staff is all they should aspire to. Since they don't even have that...
