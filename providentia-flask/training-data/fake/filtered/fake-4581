Fabulous new place in Murray Hill.  Walked by Chicken Provence today and was blown away by the menu.  So my husband and I ordered a rotisserie chicken with 4 sides and am I glad we did.  Phenomenal food.  They weren't making cauliflower today and had substituted it with sauteed spinach.  What makes Chicken Provence different is that they cooked the spinach to order so it was super fresh and done perfectly.  Look no further for great food in Murray HIll.  Hopefully they are here to stay.
