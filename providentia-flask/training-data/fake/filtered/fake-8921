This place is great. It has the absolutely BEST prime rib in the whole area! At one time it was also at an amazing price, and I would treat myself on a regular basis. Alas, it has gone up nearly ten dollars. For 26.00 I expect much more than over salted vegetables, bland salad and soul-less soup. The french fries are fantastic, some of the best I have ever had. I could eat my weight in them, but reserve myself to half portions from this place, always taking enough home for a complete meal, the next day. They really should remove the 24 hour sign. I cannot tell you how many times I have gone at 11:30 to find the doors locked. Wow, no truth in advertising. They once told me that when the students were back, they would go back to 24 hours, alas tonight as I got off work the only thing on my mind were some wings. No, doors locked, again! Breakfast is standard fare, uninspired and over fried. I swear they fry the pancakes and deep fry the french toast! You can get a better cup of coffee by soaking dirty socks in hot water. It amazes me, that something so simple can taste so horrible. If this place had decent coffee, free wifi and was open 24 hours as advertised, hungry college kids would pack the joint for late night studying.
