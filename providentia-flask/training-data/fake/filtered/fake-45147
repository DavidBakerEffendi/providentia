Ugh. Terrible. Ate there tonight (Tuesday night) for the first time. Really terrible. We had lots of options in Branford and wish we went somewhere else for dinner. We were four adults and an infant. Arrived at 6 pm and our food arrived one hour later. I asked our waiter if I could talk to the manager and the 20 year old kid told me his parents owned the place, wouldn't be in , and he was in charge. He cared not one bit that our food was so slow to arrive and acted like it was entirely my problem . He was arrogant and uncaring. I'd never eat there again and plan to tell all my friends and family to avoid this place. I've never, ever, written a review for Yelp but feel so slighted and ripped off from this place I felt I needed to write this review. I plan on copying to other review sites as well. Avoid Lo Monico 's at all cost!
