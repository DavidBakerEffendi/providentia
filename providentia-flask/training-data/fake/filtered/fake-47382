We ordered from this place for dinner tonight and was told it would take half an hour. 40 minutes passed and no deliver yet so we called. The lady told us its on its way the delivery guys left already. 40 minutes after that phone call (total 80 minutes wait now) there is still no food. This time a guy answered and said its still on its way.....we are still waiting as I wrote this review..btw they did not answer calls for straight 20 minutes while we were trying to call them... I will never order from this place again! Never
