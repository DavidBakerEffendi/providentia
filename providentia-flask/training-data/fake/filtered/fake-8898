I've been to many chinese restaurants, Yummy Yummy had the best fried dumplings and lo mein by far. The staff there is courteous, hard working, and helps provide a relaxing environment for customers to dine. They also do a splendid job in keeping the place clean and tidy. Even with all these good qualities, they still charge a fairly low price for their menu items. I would definitely recommend Yummy Yummy to anyone who likes top quality chinese food at cheap prices.
