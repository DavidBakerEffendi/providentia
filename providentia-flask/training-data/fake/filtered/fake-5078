Today was our 1st time at the neighborhood sports bar. We frequent another bar on football sundays where the food is outstanding as well as the service & drink specials. At sidebar, the drinks, no complaints there. There were no drink specials, the place had no identity, there were kids in the place and I do mean under 18 yr old kids, the chicken wings were rubbery & still frozen in the middle and the woman's Â bathroom was freezing cold , where I could see my breath & had dirty drink glasses left in it from the night before. The men's bathroom , well let's just say I hope no one farts because it's right next to the bar. The food service was a joke. When we mentioned that the wings were still frozen we expected for those in particular, to NOT be on the check. Any respectable place would have done that, right. Not this place. Instead, we got a, "we'll let them know." Whoever them, may be. Let's just say, we will not be spending another dime in that place again. Being from W. H., we're going to keep our usual Sunday funday hangout and just make the drive to Avon.
