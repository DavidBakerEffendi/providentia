Street food at its best.  If I'm ever in NYC I ignore all the other carts (save for those delicious sweet nut stands) and go straight to platters.  I've never had a gyro but I go straight for the platter and I've had I think every combination I could have had.  I've gone a few times in the past month and just been sticking to the regular mix.  The hot sauce is out of this world.  If you do not like spicy food be careful of how much you use because it will destroy you.  Like an irradiated source of plutonium, the sauce will burn and resonate in your system for countless hours ahead.  If you like to go number two easily do not use too much hot sauce.  The white sauce is amazing too.  I love this place.
