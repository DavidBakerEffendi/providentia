I've been to this restaurant many times - it's a family favorite - and have always enjoyed the food. While the restaurant may seem a bit dark and usually pretty empty, the simple, traditional middle eastern dishes served are delicious and satisfying. The owners know us for our frequency and are always happy to see us. If you're looking for fine dining you should look somewhere else, but it you want good food, good service, and a quiet place to eat with your family, Sahara is perfect!
