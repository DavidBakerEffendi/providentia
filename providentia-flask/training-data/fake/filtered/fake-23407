I went here with my wife recently and was legitimately surprised to find such a unique and genuinely good restaurant in Red Hook.  As a native NY'r I have to say that I'm biased.  I remember the days when NOBODY ventured into RED HOOK unless they lived there or worked at one of the industrial shops/mills.  It seems however that RH has a nice little "scene" going on now and I'd say that The Good Fork is definitely part of it.    The food was very good.  Try the Korean dish that they serve for lunch and dinner in a bowl (forgot the name).  Yummy!  What also sets this place apart is the nautically funky decor (appropriate given the history of the neighborhood).  Lastly, the owners are sweethearts.  They are warm and clearly committed to making sure that the diners have a good dining experience. Overall I rate it a high B+.  The only drawback is the location of RH.  Unless you have a car it can be a hassle to get to.  But TGF is worth the trip.
