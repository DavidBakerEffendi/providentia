I'm a huge fan of the bean!!! Nothing better then "The Gobbler" ahh thanksgiving in a wrap. You also get numerous choice for sides from cole slaw to Asian noodles. Very wholesome & busy. Great for catering.menu is very diverse. Â Parking is brutal since it's glastonbury. One cool aspect is it BYOB for dinners certain nights. Very friendly staff. Great place for lunch. !!!
