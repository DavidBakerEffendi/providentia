Cheryl's is an enigma. I live the the neighborhood, and whenever I walk by it's crowded with 30 somethings seemingly enjoying their meals. But every time I've eaten there I've been disappointed --  the food just isn't very good. Granted, I only ever eat the meat options, maybe the vegetarian food is great - but If you want a place that can capably cook bacon, steak, or a burger, this isn't it.  (Maybe the shrimp is to die for?) Not-very remarkable food wouldn't be a problem if the menu wasn't ambitious and overpriced , but it is. And yet, all evidence seems to suggest that people like the place. It's like there's a collective illusion -  with such a cool interior, and hip crowds, and high priced menus,  the food must be  good, even if it doesn't, you know, taste good. Of course that doesn't stop me from going back every now and then to see if I've missed something. But so far I've only ever been. disappointed. Am I the only one?
