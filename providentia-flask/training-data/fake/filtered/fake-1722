every time i go there the food gets better and better. try the shrimp with quinua, it's amazing. their drinks are the best in brooklyn. But the reason i gave it a 4 start is because there's always a long wait to get the table even if you make reservations. It's definitely still a hot spot, we saw Rachael McAddams there with her friends one time.
