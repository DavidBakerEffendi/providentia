The food here is delicious and the owner is extremely kind and generous. He often gives me and my boyfriend free hummus while we wait for our food. The ingredients are very fresh and there are a range of different dishes to try. I especially love that the falafel is gluten free. Last but not least, the Turkish coffee is delightful and unique. This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Fishtown.
