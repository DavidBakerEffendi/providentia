Cutest little spot, very modern and clean. The service was awesome...thank you for everything Lee :-). On a hip and lively street if you are out for the night. The pho was great. I had the classic beef pho and my friend had the lemongrass chicken pho. Both were amazing! I have had pho before and it was my friends first time we both loved it.
