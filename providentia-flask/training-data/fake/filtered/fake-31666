We would rate Tashan with FIVE stars if it weren't for their inconsistent staff. We've been to Tashan several times and have been raving about it since last summer. The ambiance is great, the bar looks good, and the cuisine is excellent. Really - subtle, unique, delicious, perfectly cooked, consistent presentation and quality. On the other hand, the staff is oddly out of sync with the decor and quality of the food. Staff experience doesn't match the digs, kitchen, or even their prices. First time, no big deal, but after the 3rd time, even noticing how the manager who one time, came out and made some lame excuses for why and how the restaurant *ran out of rice*... it was just odd. Don't care why or how, just wanted to know what you were going to do to give us some kind of accompanying carbohydrates. Another time, I had to wave at our server about 4 times to get our check for a business lunch hour - despite the fact we had all been sitting there, long completed with our meals. Finally got her attention by saying "excuse me" as she walked by us the third time. Hopefully they can spruce up their service and management before they start losing customers who are less patient than us.
