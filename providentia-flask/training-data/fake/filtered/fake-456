Came back after a bad experience from years ago, and seems to be the same. Again, I was impressed by the hostess service. They were so friendly and helpful. Again, I was unimpressed by the actual wait staff. Not especially helpful, and a little frazzled. I guess the food is supposed to come out lukewarm. I do NOT like this. I know the plates have to look nice and be wiped down, but that doesn't mean that the food should not be hot! The choices were a bit limited. We had the sweetbreads and and cheese steak bread were kind of mushy. Overall, I won't be back. I could get better food elsewhere without the wait of the lines. I definitely don't hate this place, but the cons outweigh the pros.
