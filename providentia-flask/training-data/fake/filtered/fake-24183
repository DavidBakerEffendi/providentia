The chopped liver was incredible. I was in Philly for a conference and then returned home to Austin TX and our own brisket - but I miss the liver! Lived in Pittsburgh for a year and had similar chopped liver at temple bazaars, but Hershel's - WOW! Katz's and Manhattan's delis in Austin need to take a lesson on taste and generosity/portionality! For me being from Austin area, Hershel's is as good as it gets - the airport - train to Terminal Market - and up the curb to a great lunch that you don't have to wait until 11:00am for an order! Worth the plane ticket!
