We used to be regulars at this place as the food was relatively decent. Recently on a rainy cold day, we called and proceeded to the restaurant as they told us that they were open at 4:00 PM. We reached at 4:05 Pm, knocked on the door and waited for about 10 - 15 minutes while the staff had their dinner at leisure. When they finally opened the door, my husband said that they could have at least let us in from the cold instead of making us wait outside. This set off one of the male staff. He started with - "This is not your house" and proceeded with insults like "You can leave" and "We do not want to serve you". He went on and on, till we told him to shut up! I strongly advise people against patronizing this restaurant. One of the greatest thing about America is world class customer service. With people like these, the American culture of goodwill and tolerance will be history soon. I am going to take this up with BBB and will post on all the social websites too! Remember Forewarned is Forearmed :)!
