horrible, despicable, appalling, atrocious, horrendous, foul, disgusting, inhumane....and any other terrible word you can think of to describe their customer service, would fit perfectly! Mustafa, the owner, is rude af!! I ordered the pepperoni pizza and jalapeño poppers, but received a pepperoni pizza with jalapeño peppers. I wasn't angry about the mixup at all. I called back and spoke to the owner in a very kind manner, stating, "I ordered a pepperoni pizza with the jalapeño poppers." He immediately told me that I didn't order the poppers. I told him one more time that I ordered the poppers and he replied, "F$&* You!!!" Then he hung up the phone. I called back and asked to speak to the owner. Mustafa the A**Hole replied, "I am the owner, after cussing me out again." I will never ever order anything from this place again and I'm trying to go through every avenue to spread the word on this despicable spec of a business.
