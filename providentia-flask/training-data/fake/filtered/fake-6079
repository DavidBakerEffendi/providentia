I love this place.  I've been for lunch many times. For lunch, has great specials - for a decent price.  For dinner, not quite as good a deal.  Always great service and great food. Nothing fancy, but attentive service. I love the green curry with chicken.  Spicy and yummy. I'm no expert, but I think the criticisms have to do with the misconception that this is a traditional Thai place - it's Malaysian...
