I do not know what Louis B is talking about. 1st off the Venture has been cleaned/painted /a new floor / a new owner and a new chef so basically his impressions are based on passed impressions. Kevin is a great chef with many different takes on items that are basics elswhere, and if it isnt up to your standards  he will do whatever  it takes to fix it. Bob the owner is a great guy who is there to help when thing go wrong and make sure that you get what you pay for. Not to mention what he has done with no fan fare for our community.. The waiters are our friends and I am glad they are!! The food is much better than the "competition" it is just that people like Louis think it is 1965 and prices should have been frozen. I know that the Venture has a great staff/ a very casual atmosphere and is not pretentious like the other places in the block. For a good meal /good fun and low key additude it is the best place in the city.  I also think we should commend Bob ..who is not gay and could have changed or sold it or made condos out of the building and we should support him!!!
