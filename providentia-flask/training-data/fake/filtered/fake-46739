This is my absolute favorite place to eat.  It's a local business and the quality of the ingredients is superb.  I recommend the "Fire and Smoke" sandwich.  It is friggin amazing.  The quality  of the subs is way above that of of the chain sub shops.   It may be a little pricy, but really, VT Sandwich is the best.
