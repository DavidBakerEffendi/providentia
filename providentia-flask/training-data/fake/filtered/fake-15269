Good Thai food, and at a price point you really can't beat (especially in the w village). Pad Thai is awesome, dumplings are great, and they have really awesome lunch specials during the week. Downsides: Staff can be a bit odd at times and the place is very small. If you can get a table and are in the mood for Thai, I would definitely recommend Pinto.
