I've been to Italy numerous times, and the pizza at Ah'Pizz is as close as it gets to authentic Italian pizza & in particular La Vera Pizza Napoletana. Every time I walk into this gem I'm transported back to Italy. I always receive the most outstanding service from all of the staff. Joe, the manager, has always made me feel at home, like I'm a part of the family. And the pizzaioli are amazing at their craft of pizza making. My favorite pizza is the Bufala. It is topped with buffalo mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, basil, olive oil & Parmiggiano-Reggiano. The flavors meld together perfectly as the pizza cooks in 1000 degree F oven. The oven lends to the pizza a wonderful smoky essence. If you're a lover of la vera pizza you must run to Ah'Pizz.
