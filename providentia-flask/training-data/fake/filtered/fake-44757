As a regular downtown I eat at many restaurants,  Yerba Buena is my all time favorite for Tapas or great drinks.  Upon arriving you will be greeted as if you owned the place.  The waiters are extremely attentive and the food is no less amazing.  The Caipirinia's are among the best in area.  Try the croquette's as Tapas, you won't regret it.  The pricing is fair for the area and two can easily get food and drinks for under $100.  Highly recommended for an intimate dinner or just catching up.  There is an upstairs and downstair so don't let the upstairs area fool you.  See Angel who is the manager for extra great service!  This place is the best of the best and is clicking on all cylinder's!
