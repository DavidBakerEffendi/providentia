I have always ordered the duck curry w Thai eggplant. That's one of the few dishes that doesnt have pork. One time i tried beef curry over rice. I had 1 bite and it was chewy so I sent it back and i orderd another dish. The waiter keeps on coming back like 3 times and said to me that he wants to describe the dish and the taste to me. Â I guess he wants to make sure I won't return it. I said "dont worry i wont return it" all 3 times. Due to this and the waiter unwilling to put in my order, my partner had already finished dinner and I was eating alone like 30 mins later. The food is just ok. Small portion. I have ordered Fried Red Snapper : Their snapper is baby fish, smaller then other Thai restaurants and they charge $25 or so for it. I don't like restaurants that cheat your money and treat you stupid.
