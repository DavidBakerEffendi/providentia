Small family owned. The place is spotless and the fish is as good as it gets. Cooked to perfection in a wood oven grill. The owner Jose, is the greeter, seater, and waiter. He is very customer oriented and the food is delicious. Not cheap but worth the price. I live in West Orange, and it is about a half hour ride, but well worth it.
