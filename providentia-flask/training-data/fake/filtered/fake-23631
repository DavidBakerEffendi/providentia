I was told the place was amazing best burgers and cuisine accolades. Im from a chefing family so was excited to be able to afford this in NYC! I was HORRIBLY disappointed. If this was a local pub that I had after work drinks and a quick meal than Id would give it 3-4 stars. But in NO way does it deserve not just one michelin star but several years in a row!! I have lost respect for what that means now. My toast was burned. My mussels had no flavour AT all. The burgers which other people ordered were meat in a bun (hardly the best Ive ever seen nor inventive!) and the soup might as well have been straight out of a can. The atmosphere was that of a pub (which is fine if youre ok with eating around people pushing and spilling their drinks on you). Nice work Spotted Pig you managed to rip me off, ruin my evening and question the foundation of the Michelin Star.
