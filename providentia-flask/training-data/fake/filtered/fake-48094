The best Thai food! So cheap, and you get a great atmosphere to boot! Be prepared for a long wait that usually isn't quite as long as the time given to you (it's worth it). You can walk around the block while you wait- it's really cute and there's an AMAZING chocolate place by the theater where you can grab hot chocolate or a sweet snack. They sometimes pressure you to get up and go as soon as you are done eating (understandably since there's usually a line out the door), but if you just make it clear that you're going to take your time they'll back off. Oh, and did I mention HUGE portions, especially for NY?
