I have been to Laetus several times and enjoyed a great time on every occasion. They have wonderful food which you cannot find in other restaurants in Hartford. If you like to eat Asian food Laetus is the place for you. You can have a full meal or just appetizers and a drink or two. If you like to dance, go to Laetus later at night to have a good time. If you want to have a birthday party or any other party no problem, you are guaranteed an excellent time. Give it a try, bring your friends, enjoy the service and all the staff. Â You will be greeted by the owner, Hai who will make your stay very enjoyable.
