Luca's! I LOVE Italian food!! I was lucky to find this restaurant online. Starting with the decor being welcoming  with vibrant colors bringing coziness to the ambience. The owner has a passion for cooking and that translates to the flavor of his dishes. The first thing that came to the table was a warm basket with different types of breads. Me and my husband are food lovers and in our opinion the bread MUST be warm when it comes to the table. Big plus already. The appetizers were outstanding, mushrooms with escarole, mussels in a red sauce with capers and little fried pieces of bread on the bottom of the pot. Wow!!! Then clams with shrimp in a white wine broth everything steamy hot. Finally, homemade fresh pasta. Spinach gnocchi with meat sauce, diamond shape pasta with assorted mushrooms and lastly a traditional Spaghetti  Puttanesca sauce. Wow! I must certainly say that we closed the night with a golden key! We loved it!! Definitely coming back. :0)))
