Great food, service lacking. Made reservation for a Saturday evening. This seemed to make no difference as we were steered to table in front Â next to noisy party room. When we refused went to bar to wait for better table. Waited 5 minutes at bar with no drinks forth coming. Finally sat at table, waited another 5 minutes for drink order, food order taking but still waiting for drinks. Long wait between dishes. Dessert order was "you want anyhing else"? Bottom line, food was excellent but service 1/2 step above your average chinese restaurant.
