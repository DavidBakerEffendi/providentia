Appetizers to entrees and nothing food-wise disappointed.  The night started off with drinks and chicken tikka.  Chicken was perfection and 5 pieces went the distance with this table of four.  We moved on to entrees and portions were perfect - meaning, there were no leftovers, but we weren't looking for more either.  Chicken Shahi Korma and Chicken Tikka Masala had incredible flavors, with a great, kicking sauce. The Malai Kofta looks more like meatballs than dumplings, but again, no complaints and very tasty.  There was one other dish that we got that was chicken with veggies, but cannot remember the name, again this did not disappoint in it's flavor and portions. So, why the four stars?  The wait ... maybe it is NYC style (or my impatience) but from start to finish, it was well over 2 hours - we were seated immediately, but then 10 - 15 minutes before our drink order was taken, then another 10 minutes before our food order was taken.  The drink order came, but only half of us got our drinks, the other half had to wait 5 - 10 minutes.  Apps and dinner came out quickly and once we were done, they cleared immediately, but a long wait for the check, which we had to request.  Not sure if it is their policy o wait for us ask for check or not, but still a lengthy process.
