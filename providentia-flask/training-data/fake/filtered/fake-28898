Once upon a time, I thought every bar was like McGillin's Olde Ale House. I grew up in New Jersey, where every bar was stocked with "proper men," domestic beer and terrible music. In short, it sucked. So you can only imagine how excited I was to step into McGillin's on a Saturday night. This place reminds me of college and that's not a good thing. Too many bros in button down shirts, 311 and Sublime blasting out of the speakers and beers served in 10 ounce glasses. It felt like drinking at some college sports bar again. If you're in the area, I'd suggest walking to any of the better bars on 15th Street or heading down to Bob and Barbara's at 15th and South.
