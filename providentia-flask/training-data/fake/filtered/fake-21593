I performed in a band there, The Manager skipped out on us after the show, We never received our true pay, although we performed awesomely, **  WARNING TO ALL BANDS** Watch the door and get your money upfront, at least a projected rate. The bartender had the nerve to get nasty with us, just for asking for our money. What an Asshole, This Bar doesn't  really deserve any stars.
