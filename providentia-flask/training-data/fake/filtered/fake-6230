This is the first time I ever gave a review for any service business. So I hope this review will help determine if  "mambo Tea house" is the place for Cuban food.  My family and I (party of 5) went on 12/28/13. We started with a great introduction by the host. Later sat down with our server. She was helpful at first but seemed to be rushing our appetizers order. We had several questions about our apps that we ordered but it seem she had no intrest. Every appetizer we questioned and it seems like "everything was good" she showed no interest and seemed like she didn't know the answers. As soon as we got our appetizer, sure enough we ordered 2 of the same app. The sampler had one of our appetizer already. The cangrejo. Had she informed us about our order, just maybe we would of tried something else. It gets better. My girlfriend orders an "esalada de la Casa $6". Once we received our order, we thought the salad was a little plain, so we asked if we can get a side order of an avacado. She brings us the side. At the end why we got our bill, I noticed she charged us for the salad and for an avocado salad full price of $7.50.  Our server never informed us that we would be charged for an additional plate as to a side dish. We received the avocado plain, nothing with it. I mentioned to her, do yoou think you can just charge us for an avocado salad and remove the house salad? She said no. This was lost for words and I didn't want to bitch about $7.50. So instead I'll get my $7.50 for this review. My bill was $162.69 and I did leave a $20 tip. If the restaurants wants to confirm this review. Here is my ticket number that I kept. Order# 30419. Station 2 ticket #19  I had a girl server. "I won't use her name"  I hope this review will help the management for proper training especially in the services business.
