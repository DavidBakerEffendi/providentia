Fabulous Spanakopita and Greek salad.  Most establishments can't produce a crisp and fresh Spanakopita for nothing.  Effie's is homemade and sensational.  I will be dreaming about the sweet spinach mixed with the perfect amounts of cheese, mushrooms and rice, wrapped like a tamale with fresh flaky file dough until I can enjoy it again.  My Greek salad was crisp, fresh and equally perfect with homemade dressing.  Wow - very impressed, and I am a difficult one to impress.
