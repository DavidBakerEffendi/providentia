Superior Brazilian food, located in the Ironbound section of Newark.  There are plenty of Spanish and Portuguese restaurants in and around the Ironbound, but this is Rodizio Centro.  Rodizio? Well okay, a short explanation.  Back during frontier Brazilian history, ranchers moving their stock to the train station often stayed awhile waiting for the next cattle car train to arrive.  A contest of sorts would emerge: my steaks are better than yours.  Oh really?  Skewers of meat are passed around.  Thus rodizio: endless skewers of different kinds of meat.  Steak of differing cuts, buffalo meat, chicken, sausages, lamb, pork loins, coracao do frango.  An Atkins-friendly experience. The Brazilia Grill is also a full Brazilian culinary experience.  The caiparinhas are made the way you'd expect in Rio de Janeiro.  The steak with fried egg and rice is probably as good as you'd find anywhere in Fortaleza.  When they celebrate someone's birthday, an impromptu samba breaks out complete with berimbau and tambourine.  My favorite place to bring friends, especially if they've never had Brazilian food before and they love steak.  It's such a can't-miss choice I'd be hard-pressed to find anything wrong. -BrAp
