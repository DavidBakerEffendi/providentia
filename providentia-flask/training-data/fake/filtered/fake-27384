My husband and I and my brother, went to this place to eat last night my brother ordered a square it was all burnt and he said it was ok.. but her really didn't like it. I had ordered a spaghetti and meatballs dinner the sauce was all water so much of it the meat balls I never saw meatballs like this they weren't even round they were oval shape didn't look like any meatballs I ever ate. I have to throw out my dinner my husband chicken parm.. he said was ok nothing to get excited about..I will never go back there again and never recommend this place to anyone I know.
