Everybody seems to think that Philly cheese steaks are sppose to be a hit because of the reputation it has around the country and perhaps world.  I am here to report that Philly cheese steak at Genos and several others I thought I would try thru out my stay in Philly and was thoroughly disappointed.  Not good!
