I almost hate to crow about this tiny place because it's been our secret for many, many years. It's tiny. Understand, they do their best to seat you at your reservation time, but they won't be kicking anyone out of their table for you, so you may have to wait. Deal with it, because it is worth it. Many times, the gregarious and personable Peter will forgo sneaking a table in just to keep a table clear for you when you arrive. There is no waiting area, so be prepared to stand outside. Again, once you are in and seated, all will be worth it. The food is terrific - old school Italian. Egg Parm is amazing, and while we don't eat red meat, their meatballs are legendary. I am partial to their pesto, but everything we get over the years is delicious. This is a family establishment - and the wait staff has been around as long as we've been coming and they know how to run a restaurant. Warm, welcoming, and delicious. Just don't tell anyone :-)
