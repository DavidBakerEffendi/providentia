By far the worst Indian food I have ever eaten. Â I ordered take out and was wishing I could of sent it back to get my money back. To "top it off" the container wasn't. Not that it really mattered because it was just not good, but for the price it should of been full. I will not be going back. Yelp really needs to add a No-Star option
