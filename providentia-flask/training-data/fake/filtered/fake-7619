Went here based on the yelp reviews and I can only assume they were written by the owners. Ordered an egg bagel w/lox spread and an everything with lox and cream cheese. The cream cheese tasted like Philadelphia cream cheese, not homemade spread as advertised. The lox spread looks like they shredded a piece of nova and put it on the Philadelphia cream cheese. The everything bagel tasted like a poorly made onion bagel with other stuff sprinkled onto it. Both bagels were overly dense. How long does it take to cut a bagel? Went during a lull yet it still took almost 10 minutes for our bagels to be sliced and served. And finally, while we were there they burned something on the stove creating a nauseating smell that forced us out. All in all, I'd rather eat a dunkin donuts bagel. At least there I get fast service for my sub-par bagels.
