I was so excited when I heard Wings Over was in. New Haven.... I used to frequent the one in Hamden before it closed a couple years ago..... Boy was I let down!!!!.... The first time I ordered I went in and waited which took forever... The girls working the counter were more worried about their cell phone and talking with each other rather than being attentive to the customers..... Food was good but the wait was long... I attributed it to them working out the kinks..... My second order was for a delivery.... I was quoted a 1/2 hour when I ordered....45 mins later I called because my order wasn't delivered yet... I was told by the girl on the phone that it would be there in a few mins..... Over 30 mins after that my order was delivered and it was delivered wrong.... The delivery guy blamed the workers back at the store but when I called and spoke with the manager I was told it was the delivery guys fault..... I decided to give it one more try this past Sunday only because the boneless wings are so good.... This time I ordered waffle fries with my order.... When I got home from picking it up I open the Waffle fries and there were 5 yes 5 waffle fries for $3.00.... I called again and spoke with the manager... He told me they are portioned out ahead of time to 8 ounces.... I don't know on what planet they got their scale on but there is no way 5 fries equal 8 ounces so I pulled my digital scale and guess what.????? 4 ounces yes 4 ounces..... I am done with this place and I wouldn't be surprised if they are closed by the end of the year!!!!...... Totally Disappointed!!!!!!
