Best pizza I've ever had. My daughter and I were visiting New York and tried this place on recommendations from locals. Â We had the margherita pizza and it was spectacular and it was served to us by the owner. We have never tried Grimaldi's, so we can't compare (and we aren't too familiar with the pizza wars and lawsuits), but I can highly recommend Juliana's.
