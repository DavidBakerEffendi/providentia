Great place to sit outside and have thier pizza; its the best! the icecream is also a nice treat for the kids. I dont like going there in the winter as the place is a little small and its sometimes hard to get through with a srawler, but in the summer its great! would reccomend in the nice weather, wehn can sit out side.
