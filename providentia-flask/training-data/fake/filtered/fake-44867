Whenever we go into NY we go to Emporio. we love it. food is awesome. However, last night we went and food still good. service awful. our order was messed up yet no real apology. our waitress was awful. we had 7 people in our group so they include gratuity so she must have figured becuase it was included in the bill there was no real need to serve us. it was pretty disappointing.
