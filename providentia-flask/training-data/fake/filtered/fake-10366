Top Chef cutie alert! Eating here is like walking through a garden, such a variety of flavors; but delicate like flowers. Plenty of options for vegans and meat eaters, and the best most attentive staff ever. I cannot wait to try their brunch, but I'm not bringing my young children here. It's far too nice:)
