If you enjoy dining, in an atmosphere of days gone by; eating good food, and, if you appreciate interior architecture, you will enjoy the warm ambiance of the past. There are  arched brick masonery ceilings, stained glass windows, and a sculpture behind the bar. of a Duechman stradleing a barrel. The place is  reminisent of a Disney set depicting a European Pub, only this one is real!!! They have a great comfort food menu, along with steak. The servers are attentive, We enjoyed sitting at the bar, before going to our table. We were not rushed and had a great time. ed
