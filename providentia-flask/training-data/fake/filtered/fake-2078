Can you OD on bacon? YES YOU CAN! There, I said it. The bacon wrapped stuffed prune and bacon wrapped chicken liver entree dish is prob best shared between your party rather than order it as an entree for one person. I think there were 8 of these wrapped goodies for $12.95 (good value) but just tooooooooooooooooooooo much bacon.....
