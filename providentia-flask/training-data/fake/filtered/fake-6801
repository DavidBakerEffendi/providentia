there are no words to describe what the food at this place does to my pallette. it is literally a party in my mouth. from the ambiance of the place to the food and the excellent service, i wish i could move in upstairs. every single thing ive had at this place was absolutely amazingly deliscious scrumptios sensational fabulous, i could go on forever., if you are reading this right now it means you are considering this place and you would be making the biggest mistake if you dont go. you will not be dissapointed.
