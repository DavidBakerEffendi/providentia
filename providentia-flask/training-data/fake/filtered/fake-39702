Wonderful food, ambiance, great service and friendly staff.  Owner even stopped by our table and chatted a little bit.  They gave us a good deal when we had a large party eating there, and their recommendations were spot-on.  The food was excellent, especially the octopus appetizer and the molten chocolate souffle.  There was some kind of baked apple dessert that tasted exactly like lasagna, but that was their goal so it's an interesting dish.  Steak was cooked perfectly along with the asparagus, and the potatoes were served plain but didn't need anything anyway, everything was excellent.  The Greek coffee is delicious, too, if you've got a taste for something strong and unique.  Valet parking, beautiful and chic interior without being cold, bathrooms well-tended and the staff is excellent.  Absolutely worth going to.
