I am an excellent cook, therefore, when I eat out I expect great service, great food and a nice pleasant atmosphere. Cheryl's Global Soul provides all of the above. The food is excellent! The staff is friendly. Â Although, I do not live in this neighborhood I travel across town often to eat here. The whole fried fish is AMAZING!
