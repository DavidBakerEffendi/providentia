Maialino has overtaken Lupa as my favorite Italian restaurant in Manhattan.  A friend and I grabbed dinner here on a Thursday night.  First tip...ask your server for the bar menu prior ordering.  There are some great starters there that are not on the regular menu. Started out with the Salumi Misti and the octopus appetizer.  Delicious.  Followed up with the Bavette in Guazzetto, which was outstanding.  Very unique flavor and a bit of heat.  Also sampled my friend's Fettucine Bolognese, which was terrific.  The fried zucchini and vinegar is also a must have (not what we expected, almost like zucchini chips).   For wine, check out the Shiava (SCHIAVA, HUCK AM BACH, CANTINA SANTA MAGDALENA).  Very light with a bit of spice.  Perfect with the pastas. Definitely headed back here again...
