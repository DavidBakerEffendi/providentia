Pros: The Decor is relaxing and quite nice and overall, the food quality was good. Convenient local for Upper East & Yorkville residents. Cons: Hard to get a reservation during normal dinner hours, and even when I have been able to get an early reservation  because later time slots were reserved, the bulk of the tables sat vacant for hours which left  us frustrated. Portion size was "obnoxiously" small for each and every item I have ordered. I have tried numerous times in the event that it was a fluke, but no. I generally expect fine dining establishments to offer somewhat smaller portions, but when an establishment offers tiered pricing for entrees (small or large portions priced accordingly) and you order a large portion, you should not be given something that may not even pass as an appetizer in most fine restaurants. Very disappointing on portion size at that price point. The owners need to re-think their approach on this front so their patrons do not leave hungry, frustrated and disappointed. Elaine's no more!!!
