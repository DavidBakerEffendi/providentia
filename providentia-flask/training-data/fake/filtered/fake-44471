Spent a lovely Sunday early evening sitting outside and enjoyed a simple meal that tasted great and was served promptly. Turkey burger was very good and so was the corned beef boiled dinner. As some others have mentioned in reviews, we too had a fairly surly server who lacked interest in our needs. But, I'll still go back again and again.
