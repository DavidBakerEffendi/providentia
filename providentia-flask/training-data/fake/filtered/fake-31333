This place used to be great. The bacon was thick and perfectly cooked, the complimentary biscuits were delicious. Sadly, that has all changed. We used to go almost every other weekend for brunch and even gave it a second chance when we noticed things had changed. The bacon is now from the grocery store, thin, and we got one piece plus another half piece that looked like someone had already eaten, There are NO more free biscuits, instead you now pay $10 if you want some. The egg whites are in such small portion that it is not worth paying $8 for. The toast, which used to be homemade and 9 grain now tastes like metamucil and is bread from the grocery store or worse -totally flavorless and the butter doesn't taste like anything weirdly enough. The only redeeming factor is that the pancake recipe is the same but I would rather go to Good Enough to Eat for a much better overall experience. Beware that the orange juice comes to $7 and a basic breakfast for two, eggs, toast and pancakes comes to $60. We won't be going back anymore. Such as sad story. It used to be so good. I am not sure if new management came in or what happened.
