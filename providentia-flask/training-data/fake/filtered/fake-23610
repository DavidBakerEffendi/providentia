Food was good The atmosphere was nice too The only issue I had was the service I've order a bottle of chateau neuf Du Â pape, the first bottle wasn't good at all so they changed it, the second one was very flat, when I call the waiter he says he was getting the manager to come at the table . The manager came and told me that my palate was probably off tonight So I've had to stay with my bottle if wine That had ruined all my experience there Won't recommend at all
