Took my son here once and that was enough. Staff was rude and more interested in talking to each other. Burgers were over cooked and tasteless . Fries were cold and the price for just 2 people was a total joke. Give us 5 guys any day !! You know its bad when it's empty on a Saturday night around 5-6 pm. Pathetic!!
