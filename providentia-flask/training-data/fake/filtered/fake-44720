After calling 15 different places, I decided to go with Yerba Buena as the menu seemed incredible and the prices was unbeatable. This was also the only location that did not give me a problem or force us into a different menu (had a brunch party here for 19 ppl) We were given a nice private room. The food was indeed DELICIOUS! My one complaint was that there just wasn't enough of the food. The brunch entrees were priced between $9 - $14 and we paid a prix fixe of $15 so I assumed they would offer a starter of some sort (chips/salsa/guac) but unfortunately this wasn't the case. Other than that- everything was great. I would most definitely go back.
