Ironically, I have only been to the Pub twice, but its definitely a great atmosphere to eat; "Turkey Chili" was orgasmic, not to mention the watering spices, Chicken Quesadilla; delicious by far the best in Philly, amazing beer and cool drinks.. Also, the staff provided excellent customer service in accommodating my hungry needs, very swift & attentative..  Furthermore, the food was served in huge portions, prices were reasonable and of course, I will continue to explore the menu options to complete my heart's desires of little hidden treasures..  Great, cozy place and Highly Recommended.
