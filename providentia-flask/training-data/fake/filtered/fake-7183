Ive been out of New Jersey for 20 years and to my amazement, this place was still the same as before I left.  Ok, so I'm lying....ITS BETTER!!! The bread was AMAZING. The cold cuts FRESH.  The place is IMMACULATE.  THE PRICE WAS RIGHT.  THE STAFF went above and beyond to serve. I was so impressed that I pre-ordered my XMAS Eve antipasto and appetizer tray to make my life easy! Thank you Appetizzio's!  My lunch was FABULOUS!!!
