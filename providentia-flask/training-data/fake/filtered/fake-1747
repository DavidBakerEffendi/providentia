Service was HORRIBLE; food & atmosphe were good.   Service - We arrived at 8pm and were told it would be a 30-45 minute wait.  We checked in with the host after 30 minutes.  He informed us we were the next to be seated and it should be another 15 minutes.  We checked in 15 minutes later; same response from him.  We checked in THREE MORE TIMES after this and received the same reponse.   The bar tender even approached me and asked if we had plans to have dinner since he thought we had been at the bar for an awfully long time (ended up being 2 hrs). We informed the manager of the situation, and he assured us they would take care of us.  He did absolutely NOTHING.  We ended up waiting for 2 hrs before being seated. Food & atmosphere - The food was great; I recommend the Matador combo, especially if you are extremely hungry (which we were after a 2hr wait)!  The atmosphere was solid; very lively with good lighting, great build-out and just enough music. If the service wasn't so horrendous, I would recommend strongly.
