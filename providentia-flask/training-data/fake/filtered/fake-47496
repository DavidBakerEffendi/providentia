over rated pizza. I m a new yorker and I used to love this place until one uncrowded cold windy night, my friend and I were sat at a table right in front of the door. When I asked to sit somewhere else, the owner, moment before staring at his cell phone told me that we should sit there and made a fuss about us sitting somewhere else. The food? it s alright. The quality has been going down since I ve eaten there plenty of times in the past 10 years. Honestly, there are other brick oven places opening up and the competition is booming. you wanna go and wait on a line or have crappy service on a so-so pizza, go ahead. Right now, there is a big brick oven pizza boom. If you are making an effort to go here, whatever... there are plenty better spots, if you are making an effort to travel. I m betting there is Probably a better pizza joint in your own neighborhood.
