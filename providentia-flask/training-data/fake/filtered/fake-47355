My family and I have been dining here since 2001.  Never had a bad experience.  Service, quality and value of food always consistent.  This is a great place with a  warm comfy atmosphere. To customer/yelper Anna A that dined on Feb 3rd, you failed to mention in your review that the chef/owner did take $25 off your bill.  Before you write a review, please be honest.
