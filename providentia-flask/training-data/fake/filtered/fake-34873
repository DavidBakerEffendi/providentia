Went here last night for the first time with family and absolutely loved the place!  We also loved how you do-it-yourself which is different.  Very nice selection of food and our plates looked like something out of Food & Wine Magazine!  Stunning presentation!  We will definitely return and tell all our friends about this place!  Thank you Chef's table for making our experience memorable!
