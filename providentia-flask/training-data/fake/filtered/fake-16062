Do NOT under any circumstances eat at this place. The staff were nice but completely incompetent and the manager was a JERK. Our friend's food took 20-30 extra minutes to come and all they offered us was one free drink. When we complained the manager was a TOTAL asshole. It took us literally 30-40 minutes to get water.
