I came up to NYC to visit my friend and we were looking for good food and a hip location - we found Barrio Chino by accident last Friday night, and boy, we were not disappointed! Our bartender Amy was super nice and made wonderful recommendations, for a starter we had the steak tacos, we shared the enchiladas verde and the pollito asado - everything was super tasteful well cooked. I wasn't sure about the drinks, and Amy let me try the jalapeno tequila before I ordered the jalapeno margarita (and thank god she did - huge difference)! The music was just right, the crowd that night was friendly, we didn't feel rushed, and we had a great time!  So much so, we came in for Sunday brunch - the service (and the food) knocked us out! The service was also fantastic.  Our waiter was quick, attentive, and friendly. They were all very charming, gregarious, and engaging.  It made me want to eat here every night - which is ashamed since I live in DC :( In summary: Check it out. It's pretty awesome.
