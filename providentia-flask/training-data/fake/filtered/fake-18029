I can't believe this place gets on average less than 4 stars! I've dined here at least 5 times and get take out on the regular from here. I'm a whitewashed Asian so maybe my opinion counts less, but I love their dan dan noodles and dumpling sampler. The hot pots and pepper chicken are flavorful and the staff is always friendly and attentive. My only criticism is that sometimes spice levels requested don't always align with spice levels received. When dining with spice adverse friends some of them have been blown out of the water with the spiciness of the dishes they've ordered, but then when asked to be punished with heat I've gotten rather mild dishes... Seems like it's a bit of a toss up. Other than that no complaints!
