Rincon Criollo deserves nothing short of the 5 stars I've given it. I'm from South Florida and have been trying to fill the Cuban food void in my life since moving to NY a year ago. My roommate brought be to this place and I can honestly say it is the only Cuban that has satisfied my inner miamian! We ordered the arroz con pollo, which is made to order and takes about 45 mins to an hour, but was SO DELICIOUS, and even better the next day (even cold). There was enough for about 6 meals in that one order, so it was definitely worth the price. The staff was extremely friendly even if they weren't waiting on our specific table. They do an AWESOMELY hilarious dance and song if it's your birthday and the whole restaurant gets involved. It's such a cute place and AMAZING food.
