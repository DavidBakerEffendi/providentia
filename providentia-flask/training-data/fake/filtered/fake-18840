Over-rated! I've had better sandwiches. My wife, son and I went for lunch on Saturday. First off, the wait is horrible. Sure there's a lot of people but it was compounded by the host's inefficiency. Sitting 2 people on a table of six is unheard of! If anything big table should be communal because this place is nothing but a glorified sandwich shop. An hour and a half later we got a table. We ordered as soon as we sat down because we pretty much memorized everything on that small menu while we were waiting. Ordered the House made bread and the Roman style pizza for starters. Duck meatballs, Pastrami on rye & Roast Pork sandwiches were to follow. Lo and behold our waitress served us everything at the same time. How much carbs can you possibly consume at the same time? Meatballs were gamey. Pastrami was a HUGE disappointment! I was expecting something hot instead this was your typical deli-sliced meat. Katz's Deli in New York is waaayy waaay better. Heck, any Jewish style restaurants in NY is better. John's Roast Pork on Snyder Ave. in Philly makes the best pork sandwich bar none! As a matter of fact, the Albanian guy behind the counter of Paesano's makes better sandwiches than High Street. If not for the bread I would have given this place a 1 star. I guess all the hypes that were made is the reason why it was even more disappointing. Lost my respect to "Bon Appetit" magazine. I thought you guys are the so called "Experts".
