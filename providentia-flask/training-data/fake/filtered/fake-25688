I really like this restaurant.  First impression:  the staff is welcoming and gracious.  The food is impeccable!  Great flavors, subtle combinations, beautiful presentation.  They have a good wine list. The ramen is so good and wholesome and could be a complete meal. It's also easy to dine single there.  Enjoy
