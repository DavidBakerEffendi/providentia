Lineup is not bad if you get there around 6pm for Sunday nights. Fresh seafood - baby shark tastes awesome. Other than that pretty standard greek fare. Garlic bread was so good, especially when you dip it into the olive oil. Recommended: baby shark, stuffed fillet with crabmeat, saffron rice (so creamy and lemony!). Bottom line: Very generous plates. Fresh seafood.
