We stopped by after reading the review in the Inquirer. We shared the cod fritters, octopus escabeche and an empanada. The small plates were interesting and very good. However our cocktails did not arrive until after our appetizers did and we had to ask about them. My wife had the chicken ala brassa which she enjoyed, I had the pork entree' which was on the wrong side of fresh. We quietly complained and the the staff was accommodating, the waiter even coming back to the table to tell me I was right, after the chef was informed and confirmed that pork was sour. We had high hopes, but there were too many issues, especially for an "iron chef's" restaurant for us to return.
