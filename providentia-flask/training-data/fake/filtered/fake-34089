really bad service , food was good . We had a reservation at 8:00 , we were promptly seated . And that was the last time we had good service . Our server had no idea what he was doing or saying . It took forever to open our wines-it seems like he didn't know how to- and to get ice . Overall the food was good , but the bad service left a sour taste . Won't go back , rather spend my money somewhere else
