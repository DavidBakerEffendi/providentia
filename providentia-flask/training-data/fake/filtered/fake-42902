I've been living in Bushwick since graduating from college 4 years ago and cannot stress enough how excited I am for this place! I went yesterday for breakfast with friends from out of town and not a single complaint. The staff was amazing as were the owners/managers. They took the time to come to our table to ensure everything was as we wished. I definitely recommend the benedict which can be ordered three different ways for those who eat meat or not. The design is fresh and new and feels very clean. The prices are very affordable. For the three of us to eat breakfast including alcoholic beverages and iced coffee it cost us $43 including tip!! GO now before this place gets discovered and the line is out the door. There were already people waiting when we went for breakfast at 10:30am!
