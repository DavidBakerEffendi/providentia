Not one for cramped dining but I dont mind it so much if I am surrounded by good company.  This fine french bistro serves a decent duck confit, not too dry and flavored perfectly.  The restaurant is nicely decorated but very noisy. I would not recommend it to a couple going on a date, but for a group of friends getting together for a night out it would suffice.
