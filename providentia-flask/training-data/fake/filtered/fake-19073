Ok you guys. I need to be REAL here. Food: mediocre at BEST. Came semi cold. The smallest most expensive over priced pizza Ive had ever in NYC. New Yorkers know what good pizza is... this is a cop out. Service: horrible. The place said on its website that it had BYOB. So I bought some wine and headed over. When I got there, they told me as of yestreday the BYOD was over and now I had to pay $15 corking fee for my bottle!! Outageaos. This starte yesterday and they dont even have a trabsition where they let people know with a little bit in advance as they find the time to update the info on the sites! Really incredible. Not even the most expensive weddings have such an outrageous corking fee! When I heard this most dissapointing news, I got a little irate at the waitress, who whimpered away and later came back to cry to me that I had been "mean" to her but offered to uncork my bottle for free. I did not accept the belated attempt to have decent service... WE LIVE IN A CONSUMER-DRIVEN MARKET! I exclaimed this to my neighbors at the community table, who found this really funny and shared my exact frustrations. A shi* feast started... we sat around talking about the future of consumer relations. With these financial institutions crumbling around us, we MUST realize the power is in OUR hands, the consumers hands, to define what and who survives in trhe future markets... user reviews andservice ssuch as YELP are what are defining the consumer trends.... I may be an artist living in Bushwick and all, but just because trendies have arrived and unpacked their suitcases doesnt mean those who strive to live a REAL life in NYC suck our thumbs. Oh, one more anecdote from this fun filled excursion: the waitress replied when I said that I am a YELP contributor, "you shouldnt even be reading those websites. Can anyone help me figure THAT one out???
