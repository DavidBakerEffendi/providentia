Best place I have had brunch in NYC. The food is very good. I had the omelette and I asked for fruit instead of potatoes and they added a complementary salad to the order. I also love the where Isabella's is located. You are around the corner from the long block which is home to the Natural Museum of History and the Planetarium and lots of trees and grass. Where do you see that in NYC? Plus the park is just a block away. Last weekend we were able to sit outside which is nice because the sidewalk on Columbus Avenue is kind of wide. The food is simple but delicious and the service always very good. Even when its really crowded on Sunday brunch, the waiters are friendly and cordial. - I would recommend this place as a destination - Definitely for brunch - Make sure to also dig into their wonderful bread basket. Big fan of Isabella's
