PROS: -Great Food -Great Drinks -Great Prices -Great Service - they will help if you have any issues -Nice atmosphere (indoor and outdoor) CONS: -Take out (Try not to take out); doesn't taste nearly as fresh OVERALL: You've got to try this one!  They really take care, and have a high-quality standard.  Just hope they sustain their best cooks.
