While I'm no food expert, I have been visiting and working in Mexico (city and rural, more rural than anything), and thus eating most anything they have to offer for over 20 years. I enjoy a good taco as much as the next person. I have also tried a sampling of the food at several of the other recent Mexican food places in and around Burlington and the tacos at El Cortijo are the tastiest. I had the carne, carnitas and verduras tacos. I found the taste of all three outstanding, especially the carne tacos. They were loaded with flavor, something I haven't experienced with the same type of taco at other places in and around town. I believe the flavor of a meat taco should stand alone and not need sauces to be delicious. The carne tacos here were exactly that. The tortillas are exactly like the Maseca tortillas you'll find anywhere in Mexico, so I don't get what all the fuss about them is. Also, I'm not a super hot sauce person, so I can't speak to the restaurants house sauces, but I did find them hot enough for me and very flavorful. As for price, I had three tacos, a side of beans and a coffee for $15. I think that's a pretty normal cost for lunch in Burlington. The flavor of these tacos was much more than almost any I've ever eaten on any street corner anywhere in Mexico. I am extremely happy about this place, although I would really like to see refritos on the menu. The talavera toilets are awesome and very unique. Plus the walnut woodwork throughout is excellent and a detail I wouldn't have expected. Nice job!
