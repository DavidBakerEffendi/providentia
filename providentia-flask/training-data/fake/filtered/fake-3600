Apparently, you are supposed to go here for Brunch, which I did not realize. I have patronized the Smith for many meals and always have a fab experience. The cocktail list is unique, and the bartenders are truly fabulous. The dinner menu is a great balance of traditional fare with a creative edge, and is usually executed quite well. The service is quite able, and the atmosphere is great for a date or a dinner out with friends.
