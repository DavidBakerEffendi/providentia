My girlfriend and I have been coming to Risotto house for a long time. We like the food and this is her favorite restaurant. However we visited the restaurant this past Friday evening and it was perhaps the worst dining experience we've had in a long time. We arrived at about 9:30pm knowing that the place is open until 11pm. There are two senior wait staff who have been there for years. One of them is a very nice lady who knows that we come there every week. The other is a guy who lately seems to have a very bad attitude and is very cold. The vibe he gives off is unmistakably negative.  Usually we are served by the lady and everything is ok. Last night the gentleman took our order and his rudeness and impatience left us wondering if we did something to upset him.  By the time we were ready for dessert it was about 10:15 however we were the only patrons left in the restaurant. The lady did ask us if we wanted "something else" and I happened to comment that they looked like they were closing to which she replied something like "yes everyone wants to go home". Needless to say we felt rushed and did not feel comfortable ordering dessert so we left. My girlfriend was very upset, this being her favorite place. Having been to this restaurant dozens of times, it's very likely last night will have been the last. Loyal customers should not be treated in such a poor manner. If you do go, arrive earlier and avoid the male waiter, he just might ruin your appetite.
