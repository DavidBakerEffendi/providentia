Had dinner here last night, and it was a serious disappointment.   The evening started off great with one of their signature cocktails, but once we were seated, it all went downhill fast.   I understand that restaurants have off nights, but I would be hard pressed to give this place another try after my experience.   We were seated by a somewhat aloof waiter.   We put in our drink order, and then shortly after, our dinner order.  Nearly an hour passed before our starters arrived.   An hour!?  We had a couple of salads, a bowl of soup, and some grilled octopus.  Clearly our waiter had forgotten to put in our order.     We still remained optimistic that our dinner might come out in a reasonable about of time, but that did not happen either.   Almost another hour passed before our entrees came out.   The hilarious part throughout all this came when our waiter offered us dessert menus, and our dinners had not even come out yet.   The host did his best to mitigate the situation.  He paid for a round of drinks and was extremely apologetic, but in the end, it was a dismal experience.
