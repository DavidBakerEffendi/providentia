Few days ago my friend and I decided to find something new, something interesting. The Eddy was the place that we have choosen. And we didn't regret! Situated in the East Village, having just a couple handfuls of tables, with lovely decor. Food and drinks were unexpectedly tasty. That's what we were looking for!
