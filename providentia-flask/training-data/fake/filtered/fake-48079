The food was great, and so was the service, which was a pleasant surprise. however, they need to finesse their reservations. i made a reservation on opentable and still had to wait 25 minutes (though when I checked in, she said 5 minutes). also, the place is crazy loud... i think there are too many hard services. i was almost yelling to have a normal conversation.
