What an awesome place to grab a wonderful European type coffee.  We are visiting our Aunt for a few days here in the City from Washington DC, and next door to her apartment  we saw this little coffee house that reminded us of having coffee and small bites in Paris, Spain and Rome what a treat. Every day that we've been here we've gone for an awesome Latte or cupachino or just a regular cup of java. Excellent absolutely excellent and their small bites of sweets and savory are exquisite.  The staff behind the counter are not only charming and pleasant they know their products so well and make you want to come back over and over again.  I strongly encourage you next time you're on W 28 th St to stop by A Little Taste and enjoy a pleasant cup of coffee and a small bite.
