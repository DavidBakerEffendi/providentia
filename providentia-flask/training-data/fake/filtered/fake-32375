This steakhouse is as good as it gets! The meats and fish are fresh and cooked to perfection but unless you have good service you may be unlikely to return. So, rest assured, that if you are fortunate enough to have Darlei as your waiter, you will not be disappointed! This young man has impeccable manners, full knowledge of the menu and goes above and beyond to ensure your complete satisfaction. Now if only management would do away with the ridiculous red suspenders they wear, then everything would perfect! Can't wait to enjoy another meal there!
