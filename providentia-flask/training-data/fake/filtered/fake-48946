Well, based on a Yelp review I tried the vegetable dumplings ay Lao Sze Chuan and they were horrid! Huge dough bombs filled with maybe 5 cents worth of shredded cabbage and carrots. I ordered them steamed and ended up spooning out the meager, tasteless filling. What a waste of time and money. Have had the dan dan noodles and brisket soup. Both noodles mushy and overcooked. Do like the tofu skins with shitake, tho, wish they had them at the other Szechwan place. Up the road at Hao Sze Chuan in West haven it is much better and the people are so nice. They have this wonderful spiced cabbage they serve at the beginning that is spicy, fresh and crunchy. The velvet fish with chinese cabbage and Szechwan flavors is fantastic! Also love the steamed crystal shrimp dumplings. They are probably frozen prepared but they have that translucent, chewy dough that is never found around here, I think it is made with tapioca flour. Their dan dan noodles are not very good tho. When I had them they were overcooked and uninteresting.
