This is my first review as a yelper. I decided to review my favorite restaurant in NJ. My wife and kids and I have been here at LEAST 10 times and have never had a bad meal. In fact it has always been excellent. I have been to many thai restaurants both in NJ and NYC. This small place where the husband (Iggy) takes orders and the wife cooks up the most delicious food ever is the best thai I have had. The pad thai is excellent. the shrimp and garlic lover is amazing. The coconut soup and the hot and spicy soup will leave you wanting more. My kids love the spicy fried rice. The prices are very reasonable. We have never spent more than $70.00 which usually includes 2-3 apps, 3-4 entrees, soft drinks ( the thai iced tea is so refreshing) tax and tip. It is BYOB for those who care.
