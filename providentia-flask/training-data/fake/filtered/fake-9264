I have been here twice and both times the music and ambiance were great.  Unfortunately, on both occasions, our experience was tainted by the rudeness of the staff in the downstairs lounge.  Their coat check policy is mandatory and they will harass you until you do so.  One of the times we were there the staff was so rude about one person in the party not wanting to check her coat, that we left early.  The staff needs to understand basic customer service and that this is the lower east side,  where pretentious attitudes to customers don't go over well.   Other than that, we loved the atmosphere here.  If the staff in the lounge improves, we will come back.
