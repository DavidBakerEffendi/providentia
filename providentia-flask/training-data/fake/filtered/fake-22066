I visit the terminal often when I'm in center city working.  This place is filled with so many amazing shops.  You can spend an hour or so walking around in their visiting the different offering of shops and vast selections.  Some of the best kept secrets in Philadelphia are inside this place.  I love the Pennsylvania Dutch shops inside here.  I normally get my butchered meats here from Giunta's Prime Shop.
