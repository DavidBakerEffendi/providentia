I went there on a Saturday afternoon and received bad service. We walked in and waited at the reception desk for 5 minutes before anyone greeted us and sat us at our table. Then the hostess ended up being our waitress and she was dressed appropriately. She had on jeans and sneakers while everyone else wore all black and aprons. Then it seemed like every table she took us to was not clean nor cleared from the last customers. She then stated to the staff that they shouldn't wear the apron. She also never cleared our table once we were finished with the entree so we could have room on the table for dessert. The staff left their personal belongings on the bar in plain sight (I'm talking pocketbooks, coats, scarves, etc). It was not professional at all. Then we had to wait to get items that should have come with our entree and was never asked if we wanted a refill and we finished our drinks before finishing our meal.
