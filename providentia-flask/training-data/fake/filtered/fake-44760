I took my date to YB on the spur of the moment & they sat us at our table after a short wait even though the restaurant was busy. The bartender was polite and made us feel welcome. I played a joke & told our waiter that my date was deaf and he should speak slowly so that she could read his lips & he asked if he should speak English or Spanish. My date was touched by his concern & we couldn't continue with the bad joke but we fell in love with our waiter and with the great service at the restaurant. The food was delicious the drinks & deserts were unique and music was great. It was a great experience.
