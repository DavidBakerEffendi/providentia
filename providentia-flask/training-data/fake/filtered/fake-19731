I visited Peaches for the first time on my bday, Dec 1st and I was thoroughly impressed with this neighborhood eatery.  The ambiance was great.  I only had an appetizer but it was delicious as well as my drink, The Brownstone Punch.  The service was impeccable and the staff was friendly.  My husband and I went again on Dec 5th and had dinner.  We both enjoyed our meals and dessert.  We are planning another visit on Dec 17th with another couple.  I enjoy the ability to dine out in a great restaurant in my own neighborhood!
