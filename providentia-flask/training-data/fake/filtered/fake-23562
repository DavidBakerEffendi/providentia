Overall left frustrated, should have known from the nearly empty parking lot on a Saturday night. The food was tasty enough but the prices were not listed.  Comparable dishes in the menu were between $15-25.  Our entrees were $38.  While this is acceptable for a true fine dining resturant, Jamie's, with 4 Tvs in the dinning room and chicken fingers listed as a typical appetizer and sandwiches as the entree, was not acceptable.  Service was fine but the $9 coffee after dinner solidified my frustration.   Tried somewhere new... won't be returning.
