I was not a fan. I was a human being attempting to satiate my appetite on a nice fall evening, and I was greatly disappointed. My darling lover and I wanted to enjoy a nice Italian dinner (as lovers do), but ended up wishing we had settled for take-out. Our server was nice and friendly, but the dining area was cramped - I had to side-step between other patrons just to get to my seat in the corner of the restaurant. For appetizers, we ordered the grilled romaine (a special that night), and the grilled calamari. The calamari was slightly undercooked, and the grilled romaine left an unpleasant oily residue on my lips - I felt like I had just made out with a vat of vegetable oil. Slightly disappointed, we were looking forward to our mean course. My darling beau ordered the lobster ravioli; I, the ribbon pasta was shredded boar ragu (a special). The wait time was not long, but I felt my face drop as soon as the meal was set before us. The portion of pasta was very small - about the size of my fist. I was assured by our waiter that it was a hearty portion, but it barely put a dent in my appetite at all. My better half said that the lobster ravioli did not taste fresh. I don't go into any restaurant expecting it to be the best, but this was a let down on several levels. For the price, there is no reason why I should order an appetizer and entree, eat everything on my plates, and still leave hungry, feeling that the bread was the best part of the meal. I'll just put it this way - this place made me want Olive Garden.
