I stopped here last week when I was working downtown. I had tried Paesano's italian at the 610 wip hoagie hunt and thought that it was worth trying again. My mistake. I wasn't sure of thier hours so I stopped in around 10:30am. I was informed that they would not be open untill 11. Since I was short on time I asked if I could put my order in so that I would be the first sandwich made and they happily obliged. I  took a walk and came back at around 10:50 and had a seat inside out of the sun to wait for my sandwiches.  I was then asked very rudely to leave because " I don't want you attracting anymore customers"(I can't make this up). So, I went back out in the hot sun and waited. I finally got my sandwiches around 11:10(so much for putting my order in early) and headed back to the job site(about a 5 min drive) I was very excited to eat my "judges choice award" hoagie. What happened next it was made me subscribe to yelp. We opened our hoagies(the daddy wad and paesano) to find a soggy mess that had to be wrung out before I even attempted to consume it.  Once I finally bit into it i was even more dissapointed when I tasted bread that for sure had to have been sitting out for a few days before they used it. About half-way through our hoagies I gave up on mine and chucked it. I'm sorry Paesano's. I would have forgiven the mistreatment for a good hoagie, but I'm not sure why anyone likes what you serve. I think I'll stick to Sarcone's or Shanks  from now on.
