What happened????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  For years Jimmies has been our long time favorite restaurant.  As children growing up in Bpt we started going to Jimmmies before it was even a building-mostly a hot dog stand.  After the restaurant was built we enjoyed dining in (waitresses and customer service left a lot to be desired, though) but mostly took food out and sat by the water and ate.  We did this for years and years-and  became known as  "regulars" at the take out counter.  However  though  we noticed that the quality of the food had started to go down. We  always got the fried shrimp and either they tasted like wads of  paper or like iodine (research says that indicates they are not fresh)  Long story short we moved south 3 years ago and on our trip back to Ct . recently  we gave Jimmies one more try and it was the absolute worse.   The fried shrimp were soggy and the fries were grease soaked and the salad   greens were old and dry .  We were disappointed but not surprised..  After asking friends and relatives here in Ct if they  still enjoyed going to Jimmies the comments were all the same....".soggy shrimp"...."Jimmies has gone down".  And for our last visit there I would give it 1/4 star. ..For  the bottle of Sprite.  It was ice cold and help wash down the greasy soggy shrimp.
