We are Indians who cook, eat and crave hot spicy food . So when we were asked if we wanted our takeaway biryani hot , we wholeheartedly  "nodded yes in Indian style". When we tried the biryani we basically had to stop ourselves from spitting it out. They had just taken the biryani and added heaps of chilly powder and stirred it and packed it up. All Indian spices with a few exceptions like pepper and cardamom have to be cooked for a few minutes at least. trust me -the raw taste of chilly powder is very unappetizing.And this was like eating chilly powder from a tin with some rice and chicken pieces interspersed in it .It was truly  the worst biryani we have ever eaten -being biryani lovers , we have eaten quite a few .We ended up cooking basmati rice and adding to it to salvage it  quite unsuccessfully. We had a sunday buffet lunch from there which was quite good and we ordered a takeaway after that; which turned out to be pretty bad except for chicken pakoras. This was the third time we tried the food and after this horrible experience we are certainly not going back there again.
