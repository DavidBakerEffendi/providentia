I find it hard to believe that people actually like this place.  The ambiance looks as though it was put together with tape  and stuff bought at garage sales.  It might appeal to the college kids with the hookah lounge.  You start off with a long wait before any acknowledge you. Then the bring you stale pita bread with no accompaniments like olive oil or butter.  Just plain stale bread. You also get a plate of what is suppose to be pickled vegetables. What you actually get is some vegetables and olives that are marinated in SALT. It was not edible.  The Mediterranean salad t Although fresh vegetables in the salad, tasted of nothing but veg and water. Where was the vinegar, garlic, flavor?  W also had the ran cake special that was actually ok to eat.  The entrees!  I had a risotto dish that was served in a bowl that came right out of the refrigerator and my wife had a shis kebab.  Usually when other restaurants serve a half grilled/ roasted tomato it is actually cooked.  Not here.  You get an actual half of a tomato with grill marks and as hard as an undefined tomato would be.  We decided to skip dessert as we did not want to wait an additional 1/2 hour for the waiter to come by.  2 1/2 hours on a Monday night dinner for 2 courses.  The chef cam out to see how everything was.  He looked as though he was still in high school.  I told him if he really wants to know have a puff on the hookah then come back and see me to discuss the atrociousness of his establishment.  Eaters beware!!
