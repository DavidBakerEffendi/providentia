I've been to Grimaldi's several times in the past few years; it's one of my " have to go to " places when I go to NYC . The pizza is always delicious, Â the service is fast, and the wait staff is great !! Maybe you have to wait in line a bit...does it really matter? Look around you...the Brooklyn Bridge and Fulton Landing...the scenery is wonderful !! It's well worth the wait !! I only wish I lived closer so that I could go more often !!
