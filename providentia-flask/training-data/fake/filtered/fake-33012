I decided to try this place out with a few of my friends as we haven't seen each other in a long time and needed a nice elegant place to go to.  I heard many great reviews on here and had to come check it out for myself.  We were totally surprised at how beautiful, finely decorated, and calming the restaurant was.  The waiters and waitresses promptly greeted us with great smiles which was very nice to be welcomed this way.  The food we ordered, which was a variety of things including curry, was absolutely delicious and so tastefully designed.  It just added to the wonderfulness of this place.  After being sated, the scrumptious desserts was just perfect.  We really couldn't have asked for a better place to spend our time together.  The place was well lit with candles, a bit dim and romantic.  This would be a nice place for couples to go to also.  WIll surely be back again
