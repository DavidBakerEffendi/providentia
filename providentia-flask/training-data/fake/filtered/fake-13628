Solid beer selection. Friendly staff (if you can get them to even notice you are there). Would go there more if my previous complaint was fixed. From what I hear their food is decent. Haven't tried it... Yet. Maybe if they get to seeing more often I will get better service? We will see. Haven't written them off. Like I said, employees super nice, just too busy to notice people waiting to order sometimes. Maybe a good thing for the bar...always busy. Can't wait to eat there.
