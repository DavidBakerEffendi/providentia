Lentil soup: superb! Grilled octopus: excellent! Served with a delicious salad featuring in-house smoked garbanzos. Oregano Ravioli: out of this world. Salmon on a bed of kale and caramelized onions: Outstanding. Iced frappe very authentic, just like we got in Greece. Along with a good beer list that was not large, but broad with good choices, the experience was enhanced by our waiter Zach, with his professionalism and charm.
