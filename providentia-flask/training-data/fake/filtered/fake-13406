Well, I had always believed that the short pour of the drafts was due to happy hour rush and I never complained because the price was so good. But the other night, a friend arrived after happy hour was over and his pour was so poor that it probably added up to about 11 ounces. At full price, that makes a pint (or partial pint) very expensive. Â At $5 a pint, that is 31 cents/ oz. Get a pint with 11 ounces and that is 45 cents/ oz which multiplied by 16 is the equivalent of $7.27 for a pint! Whew!!! Someone splash some cheap, cold beer in my face!
