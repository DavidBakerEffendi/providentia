I love Jim's Steaks. I have been going to Jim's since I was 12 years old. Back in the day, you couldn't get a better cheesesteak in Philly. The other places haven't changed Jim's has. It's like they stopped caring and gave up. Philadelphia loves us so we can suck now. They raised up thier prices, and dropped the quality level way down low. There used to be nothing like a cheesesteak with wiz and a chocolate shake. I'll now go to one of the other guys before going to Jims which is soo sad for me because its like cutting out a huge piece of my childhood.
