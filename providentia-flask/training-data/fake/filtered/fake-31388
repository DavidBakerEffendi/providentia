This is my go to brunch place. Their blueberry pancakes are amazing- portion sizes are big though. You need to be very hungry or it may be worth sharing. The smoked salmon eggs benedict are also fantastic. It is a little pricey but then their ingredients are all well sourced and quality. It can get very busy but I have never had to wait more than 20 minutes. Food is served quickly and the service itself is good. A must try in New York!
