We just came back from The Rocky Hill Tavern for Father's Day dinner, the service was great, the Opera was wonderful( they had Â Opera for father's dae), food was good but it depends on what you order. I had a grilled steak salad but it was just mediocre, the chicken and lamb were much better. We purchased a coupon online on doubletakedeals.com, so the bill came out to be quite reasonable. Overall experience was very pleasant , we will definitely go back again.
