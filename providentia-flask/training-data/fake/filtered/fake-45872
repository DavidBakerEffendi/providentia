It's so nice to see central-northern Chinese cuisine in New York (and not all the way out in Flushing)! I was actually a little skeptical going in - would it be another place whose "northern" food was prepared by cooks from Fujian or Guangdong, who sweeten it and make it taste like southern Chinese-style food (no offense, I love southern Chinese food)? Fortunately, no. It tasted like what I ate when I visited Henan. The chicken, and the lamb tripe, were both really, really, really, really good. Seriously. Cheap, cool atmosphere/nice people, BYOB (!!!), and awesome, authentic food. If you don't like spice there are a few other options, but if you have a problem with bones in (the most tender, flavorful) chicken, then you're beyond help. Otherwise, it rivals Xi'an Famous Foods as best Chinese in NYC.
