I have to say once Taco Bell is up this place is so fucked! Another place in Hamden convenient to Quinnipiac students is Taco King. The best place to get cheap, imitation Taco Bell! This restaurant really caters to vegetarians or people who dislike the traditional taco filler, beef. The only issue I had with it besides the food (which I'll get to) was the fact that there wasn't one Mexican person there. The food doesn't really taste good no matter when you eat it, so if you eat as your driving home or six hours after you pick it up it tastes the same. I myself wouldn't let it sit out and gather flies for six hours, but some people prefer it that way. BEWARE the chili! It's the most god-awful thing you'll ever eat. My favorite items on the menu are the cheese enchilada, the chicken and steak fajita, and the jack cheese, ham, and chicken quesadilla. I greatly recommend the chicken and steak fajita, super yummy! Overall I give it a solid three.
