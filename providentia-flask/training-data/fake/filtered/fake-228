My favorite restaurant of all time! Best food I have ever eaten.  Must go here if you are a meat lover.  I have gone here for my birthday two years in a row for two reasons, one, its so fucking expensive, two, its so fucking worth it.  If your a hippie ass vegetarian its all good because just going there for the salad bar is worth it. To sum it up: Great service. Great atmosphere. Awesome food.  Very expensive. Two thumbs up.
