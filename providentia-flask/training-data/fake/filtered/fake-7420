This is the spot to be in downtown Manhattan! We dined here on a Saturday night in November for my birthday. The service was excellent, food was superb, music was on queue and the overall experience highly exceeded my expectations. From the delicious drinks to the perfectly cooked salmon, fresh lump crab, etc. I highly recommend The Trading Post for a quick stop, a business meeting, a birthday party, a night out, etc!
