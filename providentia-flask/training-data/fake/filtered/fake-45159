LoMonacos is my favorite restaurant! My whole family loves it and we go there for every special occasion. Â The ambiance is beautiful. There's a great selection on the menu, prices are good. You can plan on spending a good relaxing 2 hours for dinner. They have yummy garlic knots served upon arrival with fresh olives. They treat you like royalty there and the wait staff is terrific and very attentive!
