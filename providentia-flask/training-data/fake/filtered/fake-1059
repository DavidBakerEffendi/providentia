I have been here twice so far and am quite pleased.  I've had the Peter's Special and a soup.  Both were quite good.  It's not 'authentic' asian or italian, so don't go expecting such.  But that doesn't mean that it's not tasty.  Definitely a place you can go to grab some food to take back to the office.
