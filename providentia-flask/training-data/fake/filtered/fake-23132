I went here with my boyfriend for a fun Friday night date.  We were in the mood for something upscale, but nothing that would break the bank.  He heard about this restaurant from Philly reviews that claimed a light hearted romantic atmosphere and good seafood.  That review was correct.  We enjoyed the live piano music (nothing too loud, just some light jazz) and a yuppie young Philly crowd.  There is a lot of natural sunlight and fresh air as their huge windows were open on a breezy summer evening. I ordered the swordfish and it was cooked perfectly.  It was served over grilled vegetables- a beautiful plate that tasted delicious!!  My boyfriend ordered the Potato Gnocchi with short rib meat, which he loved.  Our waiter was very helpful with recommendations and we received impeccable  service. One piece of advice- avoid coming before a show.  This is located next to a theater so the "play crowd" sometimes dominates the bar.  Call the front desk to ask if there is a show and see if you can schedule your reservation before or after it.   Otherwise, this is a perfect date spot!
