We went to the Front Street Bistro on a Saturday afternoon (12/7/13) for a late lunch.  The atmosphere was great, the place was packed.  We got attentive service in spite of the crowds.  There was a bit of a wait for food to come out of the kitchen, but when it arrived it was creative and delicious.  We ordered a steak, the bruschetta, the Caribbean salad - all fresh and cooked well.  The desert was the best...very light waffles - not too sweet with apples and dulce de leche cream.  It was absolutely wonderful - perfect for a cold winter day treat.  The staff were 5 star.  We have no complaints, we will be back.
