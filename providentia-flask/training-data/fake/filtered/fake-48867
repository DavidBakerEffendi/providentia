I was really excited to try this new addition to the neighborhood but I was very disappointed. When we first arrived the hostess completely ignored us and went to sit another group only to not return for while. We were finally seated by a random server and it was at a high top with backless stools even though there were two regular tables open. It took some time to flag down the hostess, still not at the stand, to request a regular table. Food took FOREVER to come and was cold upon arrival. The portions were small and the food was bland. DO NOT get the french toast burger. I am somewhat adventurous and maybe done right, it could be a good dish but it was terrible. The smoked salmon platter was pitiful with a few small pieces of terrible salmon and some cucumbers. They could learn a thing or two from a Jewish deli. I may give it another try but not for brunch.
