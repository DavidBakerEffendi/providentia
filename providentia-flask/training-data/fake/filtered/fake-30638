I just want to start by saying that this is my first yelp review ever. My experience at Pizza Brain last night was nothing short of amazing. The food was incredible and that includes little babies ice cream! The people at pizza brain were so nice I was literally in shock. The overall vibe of the place is great as well! I am sooooo happy that pizza brain is in my neighborhood! I would highly recommend that you go check them out. You will not be disappointed! Thank you pizza brain! You made my night and I will be back soon for sure!!
