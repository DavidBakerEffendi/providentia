We saw the menu for Vital and we couldn't wait to come try their food. Well our meal was FANTASTIC and DELICIOUS!!! For our entrees, we had the Sirloin Bavette and the Curried Cauliflower, and they were both perfectly seasoned. Our appetizer, the stuffed avocado was very good too. Also, their specialty drinks added even more flavor to accompany the meal. And the people who work here, especially our server Sekai, were extremely accommodating and friendly! We will definitely come back again!
