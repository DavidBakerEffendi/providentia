I live around the corner from the Spotted Pig and have been going for years and have enjoyed myself every time , until last night. It was raining cats and dogs outside so I left my friends at home while I ran down to put my name down since I knew there would be a wait. When the hostess asked if we were all there I said yes the rest are just up the street. She then got really nasty and in a patronizing voice asked if all four were 'in the building' as if she had to spell it out for me. I felt like I was in line to order a Big Mac at the MacDonalds, I have been treated better at the CVS around the corner, not to mention the Starbucks. Needless to say I didn't dine at the Spotted Pig that night and have no intention of making that mistake again. When you pay that kind of money for dinner you really do expect a certain level of courteousness from all the staff.
