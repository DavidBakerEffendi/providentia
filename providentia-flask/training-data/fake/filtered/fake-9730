My husband and I brought a friend here and we were all extremely pleased.  All our dishes were fantastic but I have to say the wait staff is top notch.  We arrived late, around 9:30 pm, and although the kitchen closes at 10, they did not rush us.  Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable and helpful about the menu.  Great cocktails, great wine selection, great seafood.  A few of our dishes were oysters, esgargot, redfish, monkfish and steak.  Zero complaints.  Dessert was also fabulous.
