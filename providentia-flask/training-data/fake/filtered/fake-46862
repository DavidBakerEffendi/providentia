Just got sandwiches from here, not my first time. I'm used to the staff being unpleasant but today it went to far. First as we were walking up both cooks were walking outside to smoke. They made us wait for them to finish then came in and did not wash their hands. They rudely took our orders and made fun of a call in customer for saying "I would like to order some sandwiches." Then a woman walked in and ordered a sandwich. The main guy stopped taking care of our order so he could harass this poor woman. Our sandwiches were done sitting on the counter but he rang her up first. It's bad enough that they didn't wash their hands and were rude but watching him sexually harass this woman made me decide to never go to paesano's again. I refuse to fund misogyny.
