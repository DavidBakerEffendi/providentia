We came by on a Saturday night at 9pm and the waitress said it would be 1.5hrs before we'd be seated! So we came back another day - midweek at 1pm and we were seated straight away. The decor is really nice - we sat opposite the big mirrors with the funky wall hanging. The staff were really friendly - even a non-Japanese looking guy who worked there could speak japanese to the ladies next to us! We had constant refills of our water. We ordered a plate of Hirato buns which we'd heard were uber yummy, and they were lovely - the sauce was slightly spicy, with a piece of lettuce and pork inside a soft fluffy bao (bun). Then we ordered a bowl of ramen each (my husband had a set which comes with a side salad and a small bowl of rice). He had the Akaru modern and I had a miso ramen with Char Siu. Both were very nice - quite expensive for a bowl of noodles - $13. I'm not sure if I would visit again - if there were no queues and I felt like splurging out on some nice ramen!
