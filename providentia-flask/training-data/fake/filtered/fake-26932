The Butcher Bar catered my party.  Food was great and Kathy was professional.  Our guests loved all the food and I was really pleased to have it set up and delivered on time and with good service.  The prices, while not cheap, were fairly reasonable and Kathy worked to stay in my price range while keeping my guests from going hungry.
