It took awhile for the food to come out but it was good. Burgers are HUGE! Definitely get your moneys worth. Server was very nice and cheerful. One of the managers, however, not so much. She was very rude to our table and walked around like she had a burger or two up her...ya know. She was so rude it made me not want to go back there which is a shame because it is a nice set up.
