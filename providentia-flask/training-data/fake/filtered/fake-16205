I swear everytime I come here, it gets better. I love the waiters and waitresses here, they're all so friendly and great at recommendations! I always try to try something new and have loved them all. My friends and I split the mac and cheese trio sampler and we almost ordered another to just eat it as our meals. I especially like the truffle oil mac and cheese. I ordered their special blackberry lemonade which is served in a cute little jar glass, and it was a little sweet for my taste, but nevertheless great. Now, I love their breakfast foods, they're classics but always with a little twist on it such as their lemon ricotta pancakes. Yummm. I had their buttermilk fried chicken salad. I didn't like the buttermilk ranch dressing so I only used the chipotle dressing but I thought it was great. The chicken has a little spice to it which was a pleasant surprise. I haven't been able to get dessert once because I've been so full but they all look amazing and the people around us definitely devoured theirs! It's a great place to grab Sunday brunch or just go to for a casual dinner with friends.
