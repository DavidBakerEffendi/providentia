i have no idea why ppl say this place has the best pizza in the NYC. me and my boyfriend have been there once, after dumbo dance festival, and we waited about 30 minutes (we went there around 6pm). waiting is okay, cuz i know this place is really famous. and a small boy with restaurant t-shirts and doing host, was pretty impressive. haha anyways we ordered pizza, tomato sauce, italian sausage, and mushroom,, and ricotta cheese. and two lemonade juice or something. first, the juice was terrible. was sooo artificial and i've never heard of that brand. second, the pizza was wet !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! why it was wet?????????????/ they said if you add ricotta cheese, it gets little wet but our pizza was totally soaked!!!! damn. the process making pizza was pretty interesting so while i was waiting for bathroom, i was standing near them and watched them. but the pizza was just big. not good at all. if you are really pizza person, go to waldy's pizza. cheese is better, everything is fresh, it's wood oven(not coal oven like here). i think it's much better just get some pizza from any deli than waiting 1 hour here.
