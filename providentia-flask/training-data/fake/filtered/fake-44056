Amazing Food.  Cheap price.  Big portions.  Cash only?  What's going on here?!  I come here when I can and this place is always busy.  So plan on going early knowing that there will be a wait.  Small spot with nice interior, love the brick wall.  Good staff too.  Great for a date or just out with a small group of friends.
