In addition to having had a fantastic lunch at Gramercy Tavern in the past, we also held a small lunch reception in their private dining room after our wedding ceremony at the Marriage Bureau. Darlene, their events coordinator, could not have been more helpful and accommodating, and was brilliant at answering all of our questions (and there were a lot!) as quickly as possible. The private dining room itself was amazing! We had the option for additional floral decorations, but the standard decor was absolutely gorgeous--lots of seasonal greenery and a succulent centerpiece. The room holds up to 22 people, but some of the leaves were removed from the table to accommodate our party of 13. It was the perfect amount of intimacy--not too cramped, but we didn't need to shout across the table either. The waitstaff were totally attentive and professional as well (I think we had our own "crew" waiting on us), and it just totally enhanced the atmosphere of our special event. And the food--THE FOOD! It goes without saying that our guests were RANTING about how fabulous the food was. We opted for hors d'oeuvres before the meal, which were chosen by the chef, and each one that came out was better than the last (the fried oysters were a huge hit with even the most passionate of seafood haters). The meal itself exceeded expectations and the portions were generous. I had the Peanut Butter Semifreddo for dessert and it. was. INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!! At the end we were surprised with trays of tiny treats (mini macarons, chocolates, mini chocolate tarts with meringue) that were worth feeling overstuffed. Overall, our meal at the Gramercy Tavern was the absolute highlight of an already unforgettable day. I wish I could get married every week so I could keep coming back again and again!
