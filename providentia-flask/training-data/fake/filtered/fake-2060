Ordered from here tonight - what a pity we did. Food took over 1hr 30 to arrive (we live 3 blocks away), we had to call 2 times to check the status of the order (each time being told "it was on its way"). When the food did arrive, one of the boxed had exploded in the bag - clearly it had been bashed about. It was also stone cold and the bread had gone soggy. What a disappointment, this is the last time we'll bother with this place.
