Delicious ramen and good atmosphere. The staff outside were pretty snobby about wait times, and not particularly helpful about the fact we didn't have a US mobile number to leave with our names. Meal felt a little rushed as well - good place for a quick catch up with friends, but not for a relaxing meal.
