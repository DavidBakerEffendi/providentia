Based upon the review, our group of friends still decided to check this place out & you know people, THE FOOD WAS EXCELLENT!!! I loved the ambience, it was very warm & cozy & the service was good too. one really good thing about the restaurant was that it has a Big parking!!! we were 15 people & everyone was coming from different directions, bt it was such a relief to see the place for cars! we ordered plenty appetizers & drinks & every single item was worth a praise! It has to be because of the fact that ownership has changed recently, abt few months back! & now, the bad food is gone & Best food is in!! Totally loved the place, thinking of bringing my company collegues & my family here! we went there in the evening & it was an evening well spent!!!
