Lyn's is great!  The food is always delicious - my favorite sandwich is the egg and cheese sandwich with spinach on rye bread (for only $3!). The owners are very friendly and efficient at preparing food for lots of people very quickly.  The lunch rush can see some longish waits, but if I come right before or after the rush, I can be in and out in less than 3 minutes.
