I lived across the courtyard from La Viola for a year and a half. Let's just say our building was infested with mice and cockroaches, and that the workers frequently left shrimp tails in the gardens when they ate their early dinner out there. All I ever got from them was attitude when I glimpsed into their filthy stock room when I walked past the back door. There are so many other places for great Italian food like Le Virtu and Tre Scalini down on Passyunk Avenue in South Philly. Run, don't walk, away from La Viola!
