FINALLY!  A healthy, delicious and affordable addition to the neighborhood!  Everything is homemade and made from very fresh ingredients.  I live above this restarant and couldn't be more excited.  The owners couldn't be nicer too.  I would recommend the chicken salad, the lamb, hummus and any of their daily specials but I'm sure everything is great.  They also have fantastic coffee.  DEFINITELY CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!  A++++
