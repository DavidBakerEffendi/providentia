LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place.  We try to stop here every time we're in the city.  The beer selection is top knotch, the food is absolutely incredible and the people are so wonderful to be around.  Last night, we had the Poulet with Port special - chicken with port and a dijon cream sauce with oven roasted red potatoes and fresh veggies.  It was incredible!!  I told my boyfriend that he had to get a job there to learn all their recipes.  Previous times we've been here we've had the Jambalaya, which is the best I've ever had!  I highly recommend a visit to this restaurant.
