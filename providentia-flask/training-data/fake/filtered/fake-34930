This place is really excellent. The food is incredible and the drinks are double incredible. The best Old Fashioned in the 'hood, hands down. One awesome appetizer is the bacon wrapped prunes. Delish! The decor is cool and comfortable. It's cool without being annoyingly trendy. Totally worth every penny!
