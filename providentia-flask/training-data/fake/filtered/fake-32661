I love this place, I live in the city but when I meet up with my friends in Jersey we always have a great time there!  Its convenient since its right on route 46 by 3 and the parkway etc. The music is good, bartenders are hot, shot girls are hot (n actually have strong/tasty shots) and dj gets people dancing any night of the week.  Oh yea and the kitchen is open all night which is a huge plus, no need to go to the diner after ;) Go for BYOMug on tuesdays or have a unwind after the workweek fridays.  Last time I was there they had on iheartpub46 t's i need to get one lol Good times.
