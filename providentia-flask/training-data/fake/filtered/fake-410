We been there couple times. People expect too much from this place since it supposed represent one of the top Philly cheesesteaks.The food is not as good as all the TV food shows make it out to be. The atomsphere is ok, at least the neon signs and stuffs represent part of the neighborhood vive and its history. The price is ok, slightly overprice for the food + atomsphere you get. The cheesesteaks are just typical - good for very hungry folks. However, if you're looking for a tasty cheesesteaks, then try some places else.
