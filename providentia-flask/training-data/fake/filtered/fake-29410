I've been to Cafe Renata several times while visiting friends in Philly.  What a cute place!  The owners go out of their way to make you feel at home.  I've tried the soup and a couple of sandwiches and was completely satisfied. The baked items are AMAZING, very fresh and oh so homemade !!!!!!!  Love this place.  Keep up the good work !
