I go here fairly often, but of late, the place is really diving.   The tequila flight is nice, and the service is usually friendly.  Unfortunately, the clientele ruins the place.  The snacky foods are good, but the entrees have developed into ham-fisted versions of decent dishes.  If you want authentic Mexican, go across the street.  If you want a delicate, delicious meal, go down the street in either direction.  If you want to scream at your friends over good tequila, come to Cantina. Also, the mechanical bull is really tacky.  I don't think I'll be coming back.
