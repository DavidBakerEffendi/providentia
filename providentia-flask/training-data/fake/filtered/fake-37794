This place has great food, but what it really deserves praise for is its beer selection. As a lover of sour ales, the choices here are enough to keep me happy every time we go. The artwork on the walls is a little tasteless and doesn't really seem fit in with the theme, but the decor is otherwise very nice. The service is always excellent, and we had a nice conversation with the bartender about the music she had on last time we were there. Although parking can be a little tricky, it's a great place to spend time at when you're feeling like you need a relaxed atmosphere.
