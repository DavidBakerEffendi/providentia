I can't understand why other people gave this festival four or five stars. Maybe they were employed by Broadway Bites. I was really disappointed for several reasons: 1. It was too expensive. The pizza was $12! I can walk one block to get better $1 pizza!!! 2. The size of the food is small. After eating an $8 steak sandwich, I was still hungry, and had to walk to the $1 pizza to get more food. 3. The quality of the expensive food is not so good. It was a rip-off!! There were some advantages, though: 1. The staff was really nice and friendly; good service. 2. There is a HUGE variety, you can choose many things there. 3. You can drink alcohol there! In a public park! That is a very important point :-)
