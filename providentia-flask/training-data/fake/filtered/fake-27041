A warm destination for a hearty appetite. We started with a drink - two,steamy, Stone Fence (local apple cider, bourbon, citrus, honey syrup). It was the perfect cocktail for outdoor seating on a crisp fall evening. Service was great, always ready to take my next drink order - made a great recommendation on the Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Porter and Yards Love Stout. They know their beers, have variety of local drafts and an amazing cocktail list. Food was memorable, both vegetarians and meat eaters can all get along here! The bone-marrow burger was divine - juicy, perfect temp and delightful potato salad. The scallops main dish was incredible and plan to order this again next time. They also had bar snacks for $3 that looked interesting. A really hearty desert menu - apple crisp with maple syrup ice cream, sticky toffee pudding with caramel glaze and vanilla ice cream, root beer floats! (with Yards brewing house made root beer). freaking sweet. Found out they have monthly beer dinners that are 4 courses for $35, including beer! plan to be there for the next one, too good of a deal.
