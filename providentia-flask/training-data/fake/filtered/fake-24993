I was actually looking for Vanessa's Dumpling, but the line out the door told me I had to give this place a try. So, I took my place in line and waited only a few minutes to place my order. That simply gave me time to ask for recommendations from the regulars. The fried pork and chive dumplings are fantastic. The filling is flavourful. The skins are not too thick, have a nice chewiness and a crisp bottom . . . in short, dumpling perfection. And, at $1 for an order of 5 dumplings, it can not be any cheaper. The local ahead of me in line recommended I try the sesame pancake, which is something new for me. I have never seen it on a menu before. I ordered the duck and vegetable pancake. It arrived sans duck, but what the hell. It was still quite tasty, although a little greasy. Â  While the place looks a little sketchy in the cleanliness department, I took note of the "A" grade from the health department. As a foodie, I was quite happy to be able to see everything being prepared in front of me in the open kitchen. One doesn't come to this place for the atmosphere or to linger while trying to eat at the handful of stools along one wall of the tiny storefront. Take your goodies to the park that is only a block away to enjoy. Oh, and I did continue down the street to Vanessa's Dumpling. Prosperity's dumplings are better, but I will return to Vanessa's for the sesame pancake.
