Very disappointed about this good looking restaurant! I was wishing to try the eggs Benedict but supposedly they didn't have the sauce. Service was very poor, unfriendly, waitress forgot the straw, brought the check Â without asking about dessert which I wanted, didn't offer refill and when requested, she forgot, a total disaster! THE alternate eggs I ordered weren't great either.
