My sisters, cousin and I went to  Terrazzas for dinner and drinks while I was in town visiting from Florida. I had heard a lot about the restaurant from my sister who lives in Nutley. The food was TERRIFIC and the staff was very  pleasant. I will  be going back next month when I am in NJ visiting my family! If you live in the area, it is definitely a place to try!
