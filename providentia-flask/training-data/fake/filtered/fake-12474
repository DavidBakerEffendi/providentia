This place always does me right. Pasta, fish, beef, pork and fish all great recipes all prepared well. Â I've only had one bad dining experience here and I blame it on the odd rush of people that were dining on a weeknight. The place was a bit under staffed and not ready for the flow of customers. Besides this one time I've never left hungry or unhappy. I recommend the sweet and sour rib eye or my favorite double cut stuffed pork chop. I tell then cook it med rare by the time it hits the table the hot cheese and nuts finish it off and it's nice and moist.
