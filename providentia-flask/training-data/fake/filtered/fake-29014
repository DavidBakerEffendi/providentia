My husband and I ate here last night.  Unfortunately, we did not know we should have made a reservation. The wait was not too long.   In the future we will.   The food was delicious. We were each served a bowl of soup, which we enjoyed.   We both had the twin lobster special.  They were  cooked to perfection.  The potatoes were crisp.   For dessert my husband had the creme brulee, which was fabulous.  I ordered the flan.  It was the best I've had in a very long time.    The service was impeccable. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  We thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant, and will return the next time we are in N.J. Sandy, Florida
