AWFUL!  STEER CLEAR!  Poor food, inefficient service, rude management.  I attended a birthday party at The Office a little over a week ago.  The servers (2) did not write anything down, mixed up orders, and even forgot to bring some of the food out.  (Those orders had to be taken off the check at the end of the night).  Naturally, with a party as large as ours, the check was split--or so we thought.  Unfortunately, the check was not only split incorrectly, with the waitstaff charging one couple for another's meal / drinks etc., but the manager refused to fix the situation.  At the end of the day, the manager rudely told us that our friends and colleagues had "purposely left us to foot the bill" and several of us got stuck with a bill (over $80) that was not ours.  The manager--Jon--was extremely rude and belligerent and the waitstaff was highly ineffective.  We have notified the District Manager, who responded (over 1 week later) with an email that reads "by all accounts everyone had a good time."  Needless to say, he has been less than accommodating as well.  We will not be returning to The Office in any of its locations and have notified the Better Business Bureau.  If you want a good meal, with good service, at a fair price (with servers who will write down what you ate and drank and CHARGE YOU CORRECTLY, DO NOT GO HERE!!!!
