We've heard so much about Grimaldi's pizza  that On our way to New York on Wednesday we decided to stop by and see what the fuss was all about. From the moment I had to stand on line outside and wait while my husband parked the car I was taken back by how rude the gentleman at the door was to all the people standing in line to get into this dump. I asked him where does one park in this neighborhood since it was taking a very long time for my husband to join me and his answer to me was "good luck".  When my husband did finally arrive we were ushered up a narrow dark dingy staircase to an upper level  which had ceilings that were about to fall  from water damage. They sat us at the tiniest table ever and give you a menu that serves only pizza with different toppings. We ordered a margarita with sausage and peppers and two sodas.  The staff was inattentive and more interested in looking at the soccer game then attending to the needs of the patrons. The pizza came and it was not good. The sausage had bone fragments and it had way too many peppers on top which made the pizza soggy.  I am so sorry that we ever stopped there as I could've had a much better pizza in New York City. I don't know how they get the people to come here... I guess most people don't have a pallet for good tasting pizza.  As I came down the steps I encountered the rude doorman and asked him where the ladies room was located. He ignored me and walked totally away... The final straw... Who would ever want to come back to a place like this.
