Margaritas and nachos that will make your head spin from deliciousness. The nachos never get soggy, and they are a huge portion (how do they keep them so crispy??). To make things even better, they have waffle fries. In a Mexican joint. Can't be better. Go for happy hour because everything is super cheap.
