If you are a take out service you need to offer utensils and paper plates with the takeout.  Some companys do not have a kitchen and it would be very helpful to offer them.  I purchased soap and asked for a spoon and was told they did not have any.  I had to go to the 7-11 and take on.   Not really good service.  Food is great
