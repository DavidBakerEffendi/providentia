This claims to be a "kid friendly" establishment. It definitely is not! My family and I stopped in on a Saturday night, were happy to be seated right away and our order was taken promptly. We then had to wait 30 plus minutes for our food to arrive (simple meals: hamburger, chicken fingers and chicken kabob, nothing special) during which time we were trying to keep a 6 year old and a 1 1/2 year old entertained. Our toddler was happy so he screamed twice and it echoed very loudly through the diner (which has nice decor but large amounts of empty space for sound reverberate). A waiter, not our waiter, promptly came over to mumble in broken English that "he can no do that in here". I asked what he would like me to do and he just shrugged his shoulders and walked away. More irritating than that was the fact that we were seated in a booth, divided from another booth by nothing more than a small ledge and some fancy iron scrolls. The couple on the other side felt the need to tell me that I should take him outside and continued to express their opinion throughout our meal. These pompous jerks felt that because they were from Princeton, had no children and came to a diner dressed in button down shirts, dress pants and skirts that they were somehow better than my "middle class" family in jeans and Tshirts. Sadly, the attitude of the staff seemed to be the same. I have never felt so unwelcome. A small note to all diners and restaurants: If you are going to claim to be kid friendly and provide high chairs, you should expect the children who sit those chairs to make a little noise. Especially if you make them wait 30 minutes for their food.
