AWFUL!  This place has sadly gotten progressively worse!  Have been here three other times and a friend wanted to try it who had never been before.  The service is poor. The food is not representative of food served in Italy. The menu NEVER changes. The flavor of the food at best is mediocre.  Surprised it is still in business. Guess the old adage in NY is true. The demographics keep bad restaurants in business.
