We went here for our first year anniversary together. The first and only time I've had French food was 13 years ago, while I was in France. This was the first time outside of a croissant or two that I was eating French food in NYC. We ordered the roasted beet salad and soft shell crab as appetizers. I enjoyed the beet salad but thought that the crab tasted more Italian than anything else. I ordered the roasted lamb and my boyfriend ordered the veal. I enjoyed the lamb and the succulent sauce. There was potato au gratin and sides of pureed carrot, cauliflower. There was also a green squash, which I thought was tasty. My boyfriend didn't enjoy his veal very much. Normally, if one of us doesn't enjoy a meal, it automatically means one less star. Well, the service made up for it. The maitre'd thanked him for being honest and truthful and replaced his meal with filet mignon, which was very delicious. She was very attentive and we both appreciated the great service. I ordered a rum infused cake and my boyfriend ordered a custard with caramelized sugar on top. Both were good, but we both agreed that the rum cake was scrumptious! It's BYOB, but the waitress was courteous and chilled our white wine and poured it for us. It's a quaint little place, but actually reminded me of a restaurant I had been to in Paris several years ago. Parking was easy (right outside the restaurant) on a Sunday evening and is right near the Holland Tunnel. So it was easy to zip back to Jersey! Thanks Sirene for a memorable anniversary. We will definitely be back!
