My sister's and I decided to try Pat's cheese steak.  One sister liked the meat, the other said it was okay and I could have passed.  Asked for cheese and onions - hardly and cheeses and had to request that the mushrooms be removed.  While I was charged for the mushrooms based on the attitudes and freezing temperatures not worth the time to get the money refunded.  I do not understand why there is so much hype about these tasteless cheese steaks.  Overall not worth the time or effort.
