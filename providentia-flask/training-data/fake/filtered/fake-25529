While having just opening and slightly understaffed for the number of tables they serve in the party of six I came with all of our meals were cooked spectacularly with the exception of a misinterpretation of "medium rare" steak (everyone gets one flub up).  The atmosphere is warm and welcoming and the added bonus of BYOB (beer/wine only) is a bonus keeping your bill lower.  Overall I would definitely go back.  Great date or family spot!
