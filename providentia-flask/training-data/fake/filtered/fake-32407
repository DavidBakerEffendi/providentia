We were first time customers today after reading favorable reviews on Yelp. We are now officially repeat customers.  The food we ordered was excellent and the service was pleasurable.  Their menu has some great heart healthy options that are rarely offered in South Philadelphia sandwich shops.   We will be going back often!
