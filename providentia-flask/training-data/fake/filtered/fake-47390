Twice we asked to sit in the back where the ambiance was very different than the front with the bar and twice we were told different reasons - like there was a reservation coming (btw we had a reservation too). We were there 90 min. and there were still PLENTY of tables there. I spoke to the manager and she tried to apologize telling me yet a 3rd story of why they didn't seat us there (they didn't want to sweep in front of us..). My impression is that the hostess, help and manager are immature and don't know what true customer service is. Also, the plates are too small for the prices they are charging. We only liked 2/4 dishes. Pigs feet was tough and tasteless .
