Our hostess/waitress Tatianna (Tati) was very helpful, informative & polite from the moment we walked in til the moment we left!  Although first timers, she was so welcoming, friendly & chatty  that she made us feel as if we were regulars!   The appetizer & entree portions were HUGE (a tad salty for our taste, so ask for light salt if need be), the prices were Very fair & All the food was Very flavorful! They have a parking lot (free of course) in the back, right by the entrance, handicapped parking & accessible too!  Highly recommended by folks that have spent a lifetime eating out!  :-)
