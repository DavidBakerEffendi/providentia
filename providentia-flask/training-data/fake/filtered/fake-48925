I have eaten here at least once a week for the past 3 years and thought it was time to write a review. The noodles are chewy and comforting and the beef broth is revitalizing. I always add the grilled tofu to my soup because it has the most amazing flavor! If you find yourself in Chinatown looking for something low key and delicious, this is the spot!
