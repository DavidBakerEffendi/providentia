THE WORST!  Unfortunately there is no option for zero stars. I have given this place four chances, and every time has been horrendous. My latest complaint involves an order of takout I placed; a simple request for two burgers, one well-done & one medium. Both burgers were RAW! Not rare, but completely raw. The food is overpriced shit, but you would think they could at least get a monkey order like that right.  Recommendation: AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE! Unless you want worms.
