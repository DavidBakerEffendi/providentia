I ordered, via telephone, a small Russell Salad. When I arrived to pick up my salad it was ready, thats a plus. However the cashier was rude. She didn't even wait for me to sign my receipt she just walked away to respond to a text, poor customer service. The salad was good however they could have put more cornbread croutons (very good), pineapples and grapefruit slices. Overall they get 3 stars because customer service was lacking.
