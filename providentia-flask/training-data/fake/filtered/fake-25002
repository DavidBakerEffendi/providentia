Wow!! Broke food lovers take note: Vanessa's is the place.  The Pork and Chive Dumplings are near perfect! Crisp and golden brown outside; al dente, steaming and savory inside. A bit oily perhaps, but inspired nonetheless. I can't wait to try the others.  The Sesame Pancake w/ beef would have been enough to sate me, but, like many of us, I suffer from ADD (American Dining Disorder) and couldn't believe a $2 menu item would do "the job." I was wrong.  I would prefer the tender, delicately sliced, perfectly seasoned roast beef to be prepared medium, but MY GOD! when paired with the sweet and crunchy Julienne carrots, fresh sprigs of cilantro (?), and warm and chewy pancake, my tongue is obliged to wax Pavlov-ian even now.  In short, even if you don't live anywhere near the Lower East Side, do yourself a favor: get there soon... eat there often.
