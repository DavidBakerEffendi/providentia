Been going for 10 years. Never again. Totally shady experience with the blue plate special - charged us off the regular menu and then said 'we should have told them." It is the same item! They tried to charge me $16.95 for a plate of calamari and a small cup of soup. Then they tried to say the credit card sale could not be voided. And the topper was they added in the tip because we were a party of 4. 2 adults and 2 kids ages 7 and 4. This is truly a party of 4. LOW RENT! Sad part is I normally tip between 18 and 20% because I worked tables forever. Whole thing was suspect. Will NEVER be going back. Lots of good places to eat by the water in New Haven.
