Rude and antiquated. So narrow you can stretch out your arms and touch both walls. Went for a weekend lunch. Place was full with one couple waiting. Was told wait would be 40 minutes but there was literally no place to wait. Considering the space limitation, and rainy weather, we thought we'd grab a coffee or drink next door and wait for a call from the host. At countless restaurants, hosts ask for your cell number to call you when your table is ready, a win-win for both parties. When I attempted to give my number to the host, he said, "I won't call you." I thought he had misunderstood so I explained again, but was told, he had understood but simply would not call. I was amazed. This odd stance results in lost revenue and a poor impression of the establishment. While having this conversation, new diners arrived but could not enter properly due to the limited space. The host barked at them, "Close the door!" We didn't like the attitude and decided to leave...at least the people behind us were able to take the teeny spot we had occupied, if they decided to stay al all.
