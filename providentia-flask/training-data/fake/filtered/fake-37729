Not impressed at all with the food anymore. Not sure what is going on but when this placed first opened I real enjoyed it. I got a California quesadilla yesterday and it was a beef one. They put the beef inside the tortilla and they put the cheese outside the tortilla on top? Â I have never seen a quesadilla with the cheese outside it. The place is hit or miss at best depending on what you order.
