I dont know what some of these people are writing on here but they have to be insane!  My husband and I went to RARE last night for New Years Eve dinner.  We had a reservation and we seated right away. We sat downstairs by the wine celler and felt like we were the only two people there. It was so quiet, light music playing, a few tables filled with other patrons.  I had the Buffalo Mozz and then a filet mignon!! AMAZING!!!! And the whipped potatoes are to die for!!!! My husband had oysters and the cowboy steak!!! Also loved both!!!     And as an added bonus the staff was amazing! Our waitress was so sweet and kept checking back to see how we were doing.  I really have nothing bad to say about RARE!!! It was wonderful and we will def be returning for another dinner!  This doesnt even compare to a chain steak house like Ruth Chris or Mortons...Shame on anyone who thinks so!!!
