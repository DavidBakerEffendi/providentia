Oh my gosh! I heard about this great Southern resturant, so I wanted to check it out for myself. I was having a party of 250 guests at my sisters wedding. I called them 2 weeks in advance. i scheduled everything. i spoke to a woman named Sabrina who took the order and the day of I spoke to the owner, who comfirmed that they would be there at 10:45.A.M.....I got there at 10:30...not only were they early, they had every thing set up already. It was so beauitful. I have never had better service for catering and the price was reasonable and they threw in a few extra dishes. I was very pleased and I will only be using Mama Mary Soul Food for my catering in the future. Without them, the wedding would not have been successful. I want to take this time to Thank You from the bottem of my Heaert and the Harrell Family!!!!
