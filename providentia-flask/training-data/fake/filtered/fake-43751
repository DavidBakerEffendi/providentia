I decided to come here on my last trip to the city based on reviews I read here......it was soooo disappointing!! First of all the sangria can't be ordered by the pitcher. By the glass they're $11 bucks and have way too much booze in them(other than the wine). The plates are so small it's ridiculous(2 empanadas for 8 bucks). Some of the plates were actually pretty good, and the ambiance was nice, but don't go if you're actually hungry. We ate and left and were still hungry so we ate some more somewhere else. Seriously confused by all the 4 and 5 star reviews!
