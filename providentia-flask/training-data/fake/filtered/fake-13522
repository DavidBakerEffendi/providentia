My husband and I were excited to try this restaurant in our neighborhood. The atmosphere and decor are great, and the waiters were really friendly. But unfortunately, the food was disappointing. I had the vegan ratatouille and my husband had the gumbo. His dish was brown mush with a rather unappetizing flavor, and mine was really bland (other than the spiciness, which isn't real flavor)--both the vegetables and rice didn't taste like much. We were bummed that the food was so terrible, because it seemed like a place with great potential. Maybe with a new chef?
