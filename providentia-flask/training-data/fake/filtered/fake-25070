Too bad you can't give 1/2 star to this place.  The pizza is bland, service is lacking and the pizza maker thinks he knows everything.  Personally I don't want an attitude when I am paying for food.  I ordered the Quattro Stagioni (which translated to 4 seasons, meaning that there are 4 toppings not 8) and it looked like the vegetable section of the supermarket threw up all over it.  I asked the server why there were only 3 olives, and I was told that olives were $3 extra!  REALLY?!?! but you pizza is suppose to come with olives! My husband had the DIAVOLA... with 3 pieces of mildly hot sopressata (I use the word :hot" loosely).  I could have gone to Domino's and gotten better quality (and service) for 1/3 the price. NEVER... EVER.. NOT IN A MILLION YEARS... AGAIN!
