Delicious pizza. Too bad you can only get pies, but I guess that is part of the charm. The line is a lot shorter now that they are becoming a "chain," (other location, in Manhattan, is just as good), and there is also a pizza place next door that I have not tried, but I believe it to be the same style of Brooklyn pie pizza. Either way, definitely worth checking out. The way to get the best "New York Experience" is to cross the Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan, stop here for pizza, then go down to the water in Dumbo and get ice cream, before you stroll back over. Tourist or True New Yorker alike should try this atleast once.
