Such a disappointment. I've eaten at the Marathon at 40th and Walnut a few times (always good food and service, though a bit overpriced) and was expecting a similar experience here.  Unfortunately, I am not even able to review the food because the service was so awful that my guests and I left before we even ordered.   We were seated right away and provided menus; on a Saturday evening the place was surprisingly empty (including the outside seating, I'd say it was 1/4 full).   Despite the relatively few tables, my guests and I waited over 8 minutes just for our water - and we only got that after we flagged down a waiter who was refilling another table's glasses.  Having already neatly filed our menus away (clearly sending the message of "we're ready to order") we waited another 5-10 minutes without service, although we did notice the speed in which unused tables were being set and readied.  Again, we flagged down someone (this time the host) and said we have been waiting over 15 minutes and no one's come to take our order.  He apologized and quickly took drink orders.  Our drinks were quickly served (just 1 diet coke & 1 iced tea) by someone we believe was a manager (compared to the wait staff/hosts, she was dressed in more 'business' attire: suit jacket, etc).  We thanked her for the drinks and again mentioned that we were still waiting to order.  Again, another apology and a promise that someone would be right with us.   Once we were nearly done our drinks and had STILL not given our order, we decided to leave.  When I asked for the check, explaining that we just wanted to pay for our drinks and leave because of the poor service, they apologized again and said the drinks (1 diet coke, 1 iced tea) would be on the house.   The phrase "it's the least they could do" seems beyond appropriate.
