You just can't find a better BBQ place in Brooklyn, The brisket was moist and delicious, pork rib were divine. and the customer service was incredible. We were seated out side and it began to rain. We were a table of 20 and the owner ran to the corner store and bought everyone umbrella and gave us free alcohol and even baked my wife a cake... Â Really one of the best dining experiences i've had in NYC and I've been here all my life.
