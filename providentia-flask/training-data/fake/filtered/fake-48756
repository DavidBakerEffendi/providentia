The Yardley Inn did a fantastic job on my sister's bridal shower.  We had about 55 people and 6 people with dietary restrictions.  The menu was all vegetarian and the chef did an amazing job with the menu from salad to the buffet lunch to the amazing chocolate mousse!  The staff was so easy to work with and the service was fantastic.  Thank you Yardley Inn for making the event a success!
