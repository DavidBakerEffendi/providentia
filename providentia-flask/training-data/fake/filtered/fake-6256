I now know the inspiration for Seinfeld's "Soup Nazi". I went there for my birthday because we heard it had good pizza and beer. We order a $21 large pizza, and a couple of $7 Paulaners, both prices were too high. My wife and I finish the pizza and it turns out we are still hungry so we ask to see the menu to order a salad and more beer. The server told us that we could only order take-out as they have people waiting on the table. I insist on ordering, stating I did not know the pizza would not fill us up. The owner then comes over and again tells us the policy for ordering additional food, but that this time only she will let us order. My wife is from Japan and immediately says, "Let's go", because in Japan a customer would never, ever be spoken to this way, as they are treated like kings. Annoyed, I tell the owner that we're done and she just lost a customer for life and she responds "don't you dismiss me, I'm the owner". I give it right back, telling her, among other things, it must be a good problem to be able to tell a customer willing to pay more money to leave. I mean for all she knows we might have ordered two more overpriced pizzas and beer. I expect this attitude in New York City, probably where she is from. Therefore, the bottom line is you need to order all of your food in advance and do not dare speak your mind to the Pizza Nazi, they are too concerned with turning over tables. They are doing you the favor by serving you, just like the Soup Nazi. In addition, judging from many previous posts elsewhere, the owner and staff treat others this way. Go around the block to Gusto on 22nd Street: it is better pizza, it is reasonably priced and more importantly, the owner appreciates your business.
