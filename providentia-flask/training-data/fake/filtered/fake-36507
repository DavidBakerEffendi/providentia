This is my first post.  I wanted to set the record straight on this place.   I still don't think most americans know what to do with good spanish food, so i think the negative reviews are pretty silly.   I had the razor clams, the cod cheeks and the grilled octopus.  all were delightful.   the cod cheeks were exceptional actually, they poach them in butter, factor in that the cheeks are the best part of the fish, it's actually as good of a fish dish as you can have.  the clams were drenched in this salty, garlicly, herby, citrusy deliciousness.  i didn't let any of that stuff go to waste and got extra bread to mop it up - its like a terrific mussel broth.  and fresh octopus, simply prepared and charred to perfection, giving it the smoky and that great cunchy texture.  still don't understand why people ever tempura fry squid. the only observation i would make is that this isn't 100% spanish sourced food.  but isn't that spanish in philosophy?  e.g. using local, fresh long island razor clams?  the jamon was all autentico, but you can't say the entire menu is spanish to the bone.   on the other side, it is very batali - simple, fresh, high quality food.  osteria mozza prepares my all time favorites on Melrose, i would definitely consider this place on par.   (please, no more whining about prices - go to chipotle - and the foodie frauds whining about service and ambiance, try the olive garden)
