I've never been treated so badly at a restaurant! Use to love this place, but I'm never going back now. This winter, after waiting outside for two hours for seats I went inside to ask how much longer it would take. The owner was at the front and he proceeded to yell at me, take my name off the list for asking, and told me to go eat at the Italian place across the street... Just for asking how much longer!
