Well, firstly the best veggie burger that you can imagine, where you can create your own toppings etc It's absolutely yummy...My waitress Alyssa was not only super friendly but made me feel like a superstar/VIP and not just like a guest...I'm going to go as far as to say that she is the best waitress I've had...Super cool. Cody the bartender is outstanding and could put Tom Cruise to shame in 'Cocktail' What a great bloke! This place is amazing and I will certainly be coming back on a regular basis. If you don't check this place out, then shame on you!
