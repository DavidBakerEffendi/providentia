So everyone talks about trattoria l'incontro so we decided to give it a shot last night! I made reservations cause I heard tables were hard to come by. I started off with a glass of moscato rosé which was delicious!! For appetizers we ordered baked clams and fried calamari...I've def had better calamari but the clams were good. For dinner I ordered Fettucini with shrimp mascarpone cheese and leeks and my boyfriend ordered the chicken in a four mushroom sauce. He liked his meal which was a fancier version of chicken marsala, mine was ok I wished the sauce was a little thicker I didn't feel like it stuck to my pasta! As long as a restaurant has creme brûlée on the menu I order it, here not my fav! It was way to creamy inside and I didn't like the texture! But the service was phenomenal and the ambience was cozy and romantic, but it will cost you!!!
