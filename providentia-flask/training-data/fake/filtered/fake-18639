My wife and I had the best experience at Gramercy.  We ordered the tasting menu and Gramercy lived up to the hype.  It was immaculately prepared and presented.  The portions were big enough to get a good taste, but small enough to leave you wanting more. By the end we were stuffed but still got the dessert.  Delish.
