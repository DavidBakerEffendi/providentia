I have never written a review before but was prompted to put cursor to laptop by the wonderful dining experience I had at Emporio. My wife and I decided to have our wedding dinner for 18 people at Emporio on Oct 24th. We had a long table in the back room and had a fixed menu family style. I can't say enough about the food, the ambience and the service at this restaurant. The charred octopus was exquisite as was the pizza, burrata and steak. The staff were wonderful and allowed us to linger with our guests without any pressure to leave. I would unreservedly recommend Emporio and particularly anyone looking for a great place for a small wedding dinner or any other larger party celebratory occasion.
