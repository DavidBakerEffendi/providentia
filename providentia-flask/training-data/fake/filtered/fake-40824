My wife and I took the girls to Lombardis for dinner last night. We don't normally have dinner outside the uptown area very often, so we thought it was time to venture out a little bit. A work colleague of mine recommended we try this place. We arrived relatively early, and before the line to be seated got too long. So we were lucky enough not to have to wait too long, and were seated and served within the hour. The place was like Tourist City.... The food was delicious. My wife and I shared  a calzone with meatballs, ricotta, olives and mozzarella cheese. Fresh home-made tomato sauce was served on the side. We both really enjoyed it. The girls shared a cheese pizza - they loved it. Our server was very efficient - to the point where he noticed that I had ran out of sauce, and replaced it without asking. I thought it was a little over-priced for pizza, in comparison to your standard price of pizza in NYC, but I guess you are paying for the name and the reputations of Lombardi's Pizza. A little taste of Italy in NYC!!  BELLISSIMIO!
