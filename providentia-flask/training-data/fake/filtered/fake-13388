The seafood is delicious! The calamari is very light and seasoned perfectly. the assortment of fish offered is a bonus. I loved the shrimp platter with the fries. The service was friendly and fast. The dining area in the back was perfect for my group to gather eat, drink a glass of wine and talk. I'll be back! Â Definitely worth a stop.
