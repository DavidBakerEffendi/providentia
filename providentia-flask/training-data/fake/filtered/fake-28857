Went here for brunch today & was very very happy.  The veggie gorditas were delish & my hard-to-please dining companion exclaimed: "these are the best veggie tacos I've ever had"  about his dish.  If you are in a hurry, don't eat here.  Go when you have time to relax & enjoy the care put into a proper home-cooked meal.    Nice array of Mexican wines & fresh juices but really looking forward to them getting a liquor license!   Will go again, 100%.
