I admit my experience was clouded by having eaten at an independent restaurant that I loved  the previous night and at two Seasons 52 restaurants in Florida earlier this year.  I had been looking forward to having a Seasons 52 nearby.  And I was quite disappointed.    I also realize it was the third day they were open AND it seems they should have been prepared for the demand.  Service was less than acceptable. The waitress did not seem to be educated on the menu.  My lettuce was not fresh. The salmon was dry and tasteless.   The vegetables were limited and overdone.  Maybe we will return much later.
