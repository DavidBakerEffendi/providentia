I live a few miles from this pub, and I am forced by friends to eat there every week or so.  I am amazed that they have any positive reviews because although there food is good and the ambiance isn't bad, the staff are staggeringly obnoxious.  The owner and his wife, with whom I am on good terms, make no bones about despising their customers and they show it. If you want to be secretly abused, openly neglected and resented, this is the bar for you!
