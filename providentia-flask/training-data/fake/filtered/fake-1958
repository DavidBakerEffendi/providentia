Ok so I tried them out and MY experience there wasn't what I thought it would be. Actually I felt unwelcomed I'm not sure why? I spoke to my husband who was with me along with my one year old daughter and he also felt awkward. We spent a little over $50.00 for two lobster rolls and a lobster mac and cheese along with fries and chips and two drinks. Oh I forgot to tell you we never got the fries... and I didn't want to go back and ask for fries... I mean really its just fries... I started to think that maybe we got that kind of service because of how we look... I'm a young Spanish looking girl and my husband also looks Spanish. (By the way we are very successful individuals who open up a business from scratch). I guess in their eyes we were probably sad statistics that don't fit into there world of "class". And I'm not even Spanish.... I'm Portuguesa which is considered European.
