Awesome little restaurant I usually just pass on the daily. I believe in quality over quantity. We found it on Yelp and I'm so happy we did. Great service, and delicious food! What's not to love? This place is very cozy and homey serving very fresh Â breakfasts. The Famous Sloppy Johny was very good, carefully prepared and cooked perfectly The place was so friendly and the staff seemed to be genuinely happy to work there. The waitress is really nice. I will be back for more soon. I hope.
