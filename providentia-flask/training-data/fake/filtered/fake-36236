This place has hands down the best value "high end" Sunday Brunch on the UWS. Coffee and first OJ/Mimosa included.  Their brunch mains are all $14-18. The setting and atmosphere can't be beaten here - near the Natural history museum on bustling Columbus ave.  Summers are especially popular due to the outdoor seating. I always order the Huevos rancheros.  My wife always gets the Salmon Scramble.  We have never been dissatisfied with the food or service.
