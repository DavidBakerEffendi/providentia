From the minute you walk in Divina's you know it's going to a good experience. The aroma is mouth-watering which makes the anticipation of the meal all the more exciting! I've been frequenting Divina for close to a decade. The main reason is due to the consistency of how great the food is. I have never been disappointed. Ever. It turns out that Mario, the owner/chef, is from the same region of Italy that my immigrant parents were from. I grew up at the table of one of the finest cooks: my mother. I don't Â go out for Italian food unless it's to Divina. The freshness of the food, the homemade pastas, the tender chicken dishes make me feel like I am back at my mothers. The service staff is always attentive, efficient, courteous and knowledgable of the menu. This restaraunt is truly 5 star and highly recommended by this fussy Italian! Oh, and don't forget to try the lasagna!
