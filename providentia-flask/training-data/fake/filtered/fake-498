Visiting Philly for the first time I and a colleague had to stop by an authentic cheesesteak place.  Got a tip from a life long Philadelpian to try Geno's and/or Pats, so off we ventured forth.  Got to say coming down 9th Ave. to get to both these places was a trip and a half since we don't have brownstones in Seattle.  We decided to stop at Geno's and get our fill there.  Ordered a cheese steak ""with" and was not disappointed.  OMG......greasy steak with cheese whiz and onions - holy crap Batman is was soooo freaking good.  Got some cheese fries with it as well and they were OK (that's what gives this place four and not five stars).  I'll be back in a couple of weeks to try Pats, but got to say as a a native West Coast'r Geno's was pretty damn good.
