Want good pizza? Pizza one is the place. Always freshly made pizza, but it's not just pizza. They have everything u can imagine and anything you want to create is not a problem. Staff is always friendly and welcoming. The desserts are amazing, banana cheesecake bites, blue velvet cake even chocolate chip zeppoles with Nutella dipping sauce! If your looking for a new place to eat I think you should try pizza one. It's reasonably priced and it's a great atmosphere.
