Back in New York for the Holidays and we had to stop and chow down to some of the best pizza around. Great to see our friends Dave our FAVE waiter still on the floor and Patsy walking around. As to food...The perfect thin crust, delicious sauce expertly combined with garlic, the creamiest ricotta, and fresh basil. Â Yummo! This most delectable meal was topped off with the best guidance from our server, David!
