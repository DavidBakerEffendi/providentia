THIS IS NOT A CUBAN PLACE!! This is a bunch of DOMINICANS trying to pass themselves off as Cuban.  It's not rocket science.  A cuban sandwich is a simple recipe. YOU DO NOT PUT MAYO ON A CUBAN SANDWICH!!!! Let alone have to beg for them not to do it!!!  This place was awesome when Cubans ran it. CLUELESS people have taken over!!!
