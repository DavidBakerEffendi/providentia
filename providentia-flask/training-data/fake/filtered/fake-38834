I found this cafe through Yelp three days ago, and I've been going regularly ever since. I LOVE it and it's right around the corner from me in the notoriously cafe-deficient brooklyn heights. Great Stumptown espresso, super sweet environment, laptop-friendly, what's not to love? Also -- the food is really great and very lovingly prepared, though they have a limited menu.
