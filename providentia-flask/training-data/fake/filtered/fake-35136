Not sure how this place continues to stay open.  The food is mediocre at best.  The chi had an attitude when we requested that they cook our steak a bit more.  He actually came out Ina bloodied apron holding our plates with a big chip on his shoulder.  Our 14 year old son was so intimidated we said never mind.  Paid for the over priced meal , left and went to Bruno's.  There are many other places to get a great steak dinner in the city, I would definitely pass on Ruddy and Dean.
