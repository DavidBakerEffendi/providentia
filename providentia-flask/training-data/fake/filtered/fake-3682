My wife and I just went to Villa Barone for the first time and will definitely return. My wife ordered the Gnocci and I had the Free Range Chicken which was perfectly roasted over a red wine reduction accompanied by potatoes, broccoli rabb, and figs...wow really good surprised me that was getting quality food like that in Hamilton, NJ. Truly a gem and BYOB to boot...go go go
