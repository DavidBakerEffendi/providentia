service - helpful, attentive, rushed very noisy but it's a little place! - softshell crab over asparagus risotto - crunchy fried soft shell crab over creamy, not too heavy asparagus risotto and stewed grape tomatoes...amazing. - ricotta cavatelli and tomato broth - high end ABC soup to me, very good but not out of this world - gravy sliders - three luscious meatballs in little cheesy buns - buns not so good, meatball very good - beau soleil oysters - ooh heaven - scallops over a bed of spicy greens, parsnip puree, grapes, calamari Â are the BEST scallops i have EVER EATEN EVER - they really know how to make their scallops with excellent char marks and absolutely tender on the inside - pork chop - the other amazing pork chop i had was at babbo and this is certainly a keeper - over spicy greens and parmesan butter beans oooh so gooooooood and tender juicy morsels, just want to suck the meat off that bone - strawberry rhubarb crisp and marscapone gelato - generous portion, tart, tangy, mushy, crust could have been baked longer and been more crunchy, marscapone gelato fantastic - chocolate cake was dense, rich, good portion and that espresso gelato is the absolute most flavorful i have ever had. tasted like i was biting on an espresso bean - raspberry beignets could have been less greasy, the filling was extremely tart, but it went well with the nutella. beignets should come with something cold - ice cream would have done the trick. i want to eat everything on that menu. EVERYTHING.
