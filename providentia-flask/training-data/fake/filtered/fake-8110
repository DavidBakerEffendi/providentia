I drive by Papa Franks everyday around lunch on a truck route and there's always at least 5 people already in for lunch. Pretty much the best deal on Italian food you can get, entrees don't break $8 unless your getting a bigger pizza. Can't beat the garlic bread for under $1 a basket, granted its toasted buns but still awesome for what it is. The food's just good home cooked pastas you could probably do yourself but might as well go here to get it for the price. Seating can be cramped and definitely has low lighting but that gives it a unique feel. The only bad part I see about Papa Franks is the parking but it's worth the short walk.
