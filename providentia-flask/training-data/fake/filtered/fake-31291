I was a English teacher in Korea for two years and I have developed a taste for all Korean dishes.  Bulgogi and Chapchae are only gateway foods, there is a lot more to Korean food. Whenever I eat Korean, I typically order the ojinga bokum bop. At least this is what I order the first time I go to a new restaurant.  5 stars.
