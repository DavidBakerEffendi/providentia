Ok, I'm going to be nice and give this place 2 stars and not 1 for deceptive advertising b/c the people who work there seem pretty cool. I went here with a mild hangover and chose the "tarragon chicken sandwich" off of the menu b/c I felt it was the safest. Quick poll, how many yelpers would read ""tarragon chicken sandwich" and expect to receive a chicken salad sandwich??? Yeah, as I thought...none. I was far too tired/frustrated to complain and my waitress took the sandwich away without a bite taken out of it and didn't even ask me if there was anything wrong with it. Buyer Beware on the Chicken Sandwich
