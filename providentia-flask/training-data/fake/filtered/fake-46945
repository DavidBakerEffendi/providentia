Had a light brunch with a friend a few weeks ago one Sunday and was very disappointed with the service. I had heard that the quality of the food was excellent and thought it would be great to try a new place. I figured how wrong can a mere "Frittata & cappuccino" times 2 be! It was only so--la-la. I would not go back because the waiter did not bring water or bread till we asked after 25 minutes.
