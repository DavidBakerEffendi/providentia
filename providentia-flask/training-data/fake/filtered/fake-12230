The food was really good. A step up from regular Chinese places. However, the service wasn't great. Kind of rude to be frank. My party of 4 (all middle aged adults) ordered a large amount of food and as soon as we started eating they gave us the check. Â One minute later, the waitress came back to collect it and we were shocked that we had to stop eating to figure out the bill in front of her. Also, while still eating, they started closing the lights at 10pm saying they were closing. The main waiter seemed very bothered and short with everyone as well. Probably just his personality but not very welcoming. Service does not match the food.
