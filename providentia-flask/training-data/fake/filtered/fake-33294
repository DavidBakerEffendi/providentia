Location does not serve this place right. By far the most incredible meat I've ever tasted, and it was dressed in this little Jamaican restaurant. The perfect blend of spicyness, and tenderness the Jerk Pork was seriously to die for. Capped it with a homemade, soft crust jamaican beef patty I was so in heaven I thought Bob was rolling one next to me! Seriously though this place is amazing do not stop going because you will not stop being satisfied. And for service, I have never had a problem like the other reviews so it must depend on the day. p.s. they have tropical sodas and desserts too! Also very good!
