When you have a menu as large as this place does it does not bode well.  The menu makes the usual diner menu look small.   It usually means they don't do much right and that was certainly the case here.  The service was pleasant but it was obvious that the waitress did not seem to know what she was doing.  She could not explain items on the menu.  Management is arrogant, bordering on downright nasty.  When we asked why one of the appetizers did not taste right we were told that is the way it is and you have no choice but to eat it that way.  The food was ok,  steak was small and greasy.   We were also turned off by the dirty front windows.  The design is interesting but they should clean it maybe once of month.   Avoid
