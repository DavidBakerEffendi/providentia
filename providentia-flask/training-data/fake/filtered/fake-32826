This is a wonderful place! The food is great, the ambiance is chill, and the owners are very nice and welcoming. I went in thinking I'd just get something to go since it was just me, but while looking over the menu I decided to stay a while because it felt so warm and inviting there. I'm so glad I did! The owners took their time to explain the menu to me, and I ended up having really interesting conversations with them about Venezuelan culture and music. On to the meal: The passion fruit juice made me exclaim out loud, despite myself, "oh my God!"... it was delicious! For dinner I ordered the Pabellon Criollo. One bite and three thoughts ran instantaneously through my mind: 1. I need to know the owners on a first name basis because I'll be coming here often, 2. I need to bring my friends here, and 3. I want to know how to make this dish. Good thing this place is in my neighborhood so I can eat there often: the food is great, the price is right, and the owners make you feel at home.
