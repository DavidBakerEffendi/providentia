This place is the most overrated diner ever! I have been going there for years because its close to where I live, and every time I go, I hate myself for it! Here are my complaints: #1 Overpriced - This is a diner, food should be priced accordingly, I don't care that plates are fancy, you're still a DINER! #2 They dont care about their regulars, for someone who has been going there for over 10 years (about once a month), the owners or managers have never once smiled at me, shook my hand or asked how my meal was!  I know they care about the bottom line at the end of the day, but at least try to be somewhat courteous about it! #3 The wait staff is all very hard working and kind - and I truly appreciate them for it! #4 They really want people to eat and get the F out and they arent shy about it.  I get that its a diner, but sometimes you want to just sit with your cup of coffee and have a conversation, its def. not the kind of place that welcomes that.  They have a line, and they always will, and they will never be shy about how cut-throat and business savvy they are.   #5 The menu changes so often and the prices go up.  Not cool! all in all, this place is okay, its def. not as fantastic as people make it out to be, its the closest diner to me, thats why I go there, but I very rarely enjoy the experience.  It gets so much business because of the hype, but its really not that spectacular.
