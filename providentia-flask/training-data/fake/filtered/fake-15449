I'd like to give this place 5 STARS but can't because the Goat Cheese Salad I bought two days ago sucked. Don't order this unless you like the taste of something mind numbingly sour with little bits of what felt like tiny buck-shot pellets in it - and then I had to ask and wait, wait, wait for a bag! Baby please. I do give two thumbs up to the chicken fingers, arugula  salad and the sauteed spinach. Great compliment of MASH beverages  and desserts. No frills ambience and prices. Great for las touristas or natives on a budget who just  need some eating and hanging time in between important stuff.
