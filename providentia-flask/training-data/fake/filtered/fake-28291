I usually don't Â update my reviews for anything, but for this restaurant I could not hold myself back. They have improved their service and food since my last visit almost two years ago. It is an absolutely beautiful place outstanding customer service and the food was so delicious, I and my best friend had birthday dinners there two nights in a week and both nights were amazing. I want to say a huge thank you to the manager/owner wafa for ensuring that my birthday was amazing. I will go back again, soon!
