Mollys offer a perfect combination of traditional American and Irish settings.  It operates a full bar and the ambience here can be described as casual. Some of the features you should not expect to find here include; reservation, delivery, and outdoor seating, but it is an ideal place for groups. The place is not for kids and you shouldn't expect extras such as coat checking, smoking arena and dance settings but I do find the fire place area a super-cozy environment. Mollys accept credit cards, and the music is basically supplied from the juke box, hence you choose whatever song you wish to listen to. The parking arrangement is outdoor; you can also watch the TV while you enjoy your drinks and music.  Mollys open every day but I have discovered that the best nights run from Wednesdays to Fridays.
