Consider me addicted! Â I eat at Dos Toros at least twice a week ...and now I'm totally hooked on the basic burrito. I did get a plato recently, and found it to be wonderful (truth be told, I took one to go and reheated it for lunch at work the next day - it held up 100%!) . I love that I can get lunch/dinner for less than $10 in NYC too!
