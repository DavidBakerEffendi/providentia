Previously wrote a glowing review - but the last time I attempted to order from Williamsburger has totally changed my opinion. This review applies only to the manager/chef I spoke to during a phone order - the service inside the restaurant and the waitstaff are great.  Mind you, this was a while ago - so there's a chance (fingers crossed) that this guy has left the restaurant. ------------------------- Rude, arrogant, condescending man on the phone.  I accidentally made two orders online - and when trying to remedy the situation over the telephone, the manager flipped his lid.  I'm trying to order a couple of burgers, not asking you for a kidney.  Even after ////paying for both meals//// (the original, and the duplicate order) the owner/chef was still nasty and rude. Here's to hoping you got some coal in your stocking, buddy.  I feel badly for the friendly waitstaff that work for you.   ------------------------- In my opinion:  eat in, don't take out.  There are dozens of friendlier local restaurants in Sunnyside/LIC that deliver both friendly phone demeanor and great meals.
