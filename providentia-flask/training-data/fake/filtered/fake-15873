Maybe I'm over-enthusiastic about this cheesecake because we have nothing like it in Maryland, but I was 100% happy with the original slice that we ordered! The texture is amazing- firm, but very creamy. My fiance mentioned that it actually tasted like cheese, which is something that mysteriously seems to be missing from many cakes at home.
