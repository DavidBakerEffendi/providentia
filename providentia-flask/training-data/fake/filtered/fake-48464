I arrived in Philly from a way-delayed flight from CA, and all I wanted was for my friend to take me to a good cheesesteak restaurant.  She highly recommended Pat's fries over Geno's, but liked Geno's steaks over Pat's.  I had  no time to listen to her food critique and at 11:30pm on a Sunday night, I just wanted to eat.  Both restaurants had the same amount of people in line but I chose to go to Pat's because it was closer to where we parked. Some tips: 1 - make sure you follow the instructions before you order.  Are you ordering a cheese steak "wit" or "wit-out" ?  They're referring to Cheese Whiz and don't try to enunciate the word "with" - say it as it is spelled on the sign or they may send you to the back of the line.  Or they may squirt your face "wit" -- haha, they're really nice and I don't think they would do that. 2 - order the fries and devour them 3 - the peppers are spicy! yum! 4 - no indoor seating - just picnic tables outside (Geno's only has outdoor seating, too).  So if you're from CA like me, make sure you dress well on a late winter evening because our skin is not thick enough to handle the Philly winter.   Yes, I'm a wimpy CA girl who can't withstand the cold, but I can down an entire Pat's Philly cheese steak!  And fries!
