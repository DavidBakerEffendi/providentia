The staff is beyond rude! I had ordered from this place two different times and never had a problem. One day, one lady calls me YELLING at me saying that they keep calling ME saying they don't deliver to my area. I HAD NEVER GOTTEN A CALL BEFORE. EXTREMELY RUDE! It's not my fault they can't keep track of their account on delivery sites and of what costumers they talk to. OH YEAH! AND OF THEIR MANNERS. HORRIBLE!
