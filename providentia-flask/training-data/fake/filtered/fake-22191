We just ordered lunch from Costa Pizza and what a mistake that was.  I had the "Loaded Fries" and a sausage calzone.  The fries were soggy and I am not sure if they understand the definition of loaded because there was less than half of an once of cheese and bacon on the fries.  The was plenty of parsley however.  Perhaps they should call this "Parsley Fries".  The calzone was grossly undersized and lacked in both sausage and cheese and had appeared to have been made by a seven year old child in an Easy-Bake Oven.  The three other people that ordered were also utterly dissatisfied with their orders.  Our bill was over $38.00 yet they charged an additional $ .75 for using a credit card.  If you want good food and value for your money, EAT SOMEWHERE ELLSE!
