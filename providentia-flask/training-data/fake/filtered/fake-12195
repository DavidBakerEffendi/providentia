GREAT PIZZA - VERY TAKE-OUT FRIENDLY.  as far as dining in, the waitstaff is good. nothing to write home about.  after all, you're just ordering a pizza...not a whole lot of waiting required really. there can be a bit of a wait if you go at a busy time.  very convenient for takeout as the wait time is a known quantity: in 20 minutes, your pizza WILL be ready. and the pizza never disappoints. the quality of the meat toppings especially stand out from your average pizza place
