Bottomless cups of coffee, four varieties of non-dairy milks on the bar, a bookcase full of radical literature AND hardcore music playing all day long? I could see how someone looking for a quiet place to study might look elsewhere, but for me, this place is simply The Promised Land. I'm not even vegan, but I live miles away and skip right over the hundreds of coffee shops between me & Grindcore every time. One of the hidden gems of Philadelphia.
