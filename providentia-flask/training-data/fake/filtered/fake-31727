I have been going to emeralds corner for the pass three years. I always enjoyed that it was a hidden gem in the Bergen/Passaic county area. The food is great (especially the wings) and they have decent specials. But as of late this dive bar has been going down hill. With new owners/management the prices have went up significantly and they got rid of a lot of awesome deals such as "beat the clock". A recent incident has put the final nail in the coffin for me. I went with a few friends to get a quick drink before heading home after a night out in montclair and the bartender, Chris, refused to serve us because he thought my friend was "too drunk" which she was not. She was standing by the bar waiting for me while I was saying hello to some people I knew. After asking why he rudely told us "first it is my prerogative if I want to serve you and second I don't want to." Not only did he do this to my set of friends but to serval other patrons at the bar. He was obviously lazy but not lazy enough to serve his friends at the end of the bar. I would have understood if we arrived close to closing time but we did not - we got there at least an hour prior to closing and with enough time to have one drink. It pains that my favorite bar to recommend to people is now one that i wouldn't wish my worst enemies to walk into.
