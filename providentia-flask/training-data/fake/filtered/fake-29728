Dining at Bibou was truly sensational! The Foie gras and bone marrow were amazing. I've had Foie in some of the best restaurants in the world and Bibou is now the front runner. The attentive service and intimate atmosphere compliment the delectable menu. Don't forget it is BYOB; this gives you the luxury of bringing your own wine to pair with your courses. To top off the evening the Chef visits every table and personally thanks you for dining at his Restaurant. We can't wait to dine at Bibou again and introduce our friends to this French gem!
