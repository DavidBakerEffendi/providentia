Best CUBAN food in NY.  This place has amazing customer service, great atmosphere, and authentic Cuban food/cafe. I am Cuban soo I would know! Everytime I go it's very busy but the wait time isn't bad  at all.  I wish this place was a little bigger but regardless I would def. Recommend going and trying it out.  The staff speaks English for those Americans that would like to try Cuban food without feeling out of place.
