our party ordered: spaghetti & meatballs (me, was awesome!), chicken bella bucca (my brother loved this), ravioli and meatballs (again loved), and chicken parmesan (loved too). Appetizers were the asparagus, garlic bread, and a Jersey tomato salad. We loved everything except the garlic bread. Be careful because prices add up quick! The few complaints we had were: only 4 ravioli in the dish, chicken bella bucca was great but it was just meat and sauce, no pasta, would really go awesome on top of some orzo. And, the meals, for the price didn't come with a salad.
