I went with my friend for lunch yesterday.  Browsing the menu, I thought they had a nice selection to choose from.  The prices though were a bit spendy.  However, I was in the mood for raviolli, and I was disappointed they didn't have any spinach cheese.  They only had cheese stuffed and beef stuffed raviolli.  I had the cheese one and my friend had pasta.   The restaurant was empty at lunch time which was nice and quiet, but we waited a long time for food to come.  First, my shrimp salad didn't taste as good as I expected it, and my raviolli was put in a tomatoe sauce and didnt taste good either.  Overall, I didn't like the taste and food quality.  But I enjoyed paying less through Yelp deal and that compensated for te somewhat disappointing experience.
