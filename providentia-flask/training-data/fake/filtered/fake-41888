I have been a fan of M. Psilakis for a very long time. His food is always traditional and very flavorful.  Keffi was one of my favorite restaurants for very long time.  Came to this location on Thursday evening and it was very busy.  Decor was tasteful, food was fanstastic, presentation was on point and the flavors were bold.  Every time I order octopus at any of his restaurants I Always enjoy, but the time in specific I was really blown away.  Excellent grilled whole fish.  Always a fan of greek meatballs which were delicious and the portion was big. Service was good but not as friendly as I would like it to be, but all in all a great dining experience.  Will Return.
