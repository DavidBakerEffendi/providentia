Went here for a late valentines dinner the monday after valentines day this year. We sat downstairs right by the window. very warm and cozy place. We started off with a cheese plate and then split four tappas. The food was delicious. I'm not a wine drinking so I didn't order any, but my girlfriend said they paired the wine very well with the food. The stuffed calamari and turkish beef dumplings were amazing. Desert was delicious. The waiter brought me out a glass of warm mulled wine. I'm not a wine drinking but it was paired with the desert I got. I've never had food with wine that is paired together. It really does work. The wine was delicious. Was one of my favorite dates, very intimate and very relaxed. We were there for 2 1/2 hours! The waiters didnt rush and made the meal an event.
