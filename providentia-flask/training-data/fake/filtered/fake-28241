Made a reservation and went here for lunch today with a group of 8 people for 2 of my colleague's birthdays and it was SOOO yummy. First of all, the place is so little and cute. Kind of has an underground feel to it. Had great music and great ambiance. Everybody that worked there was very generous, so no complaints about that. And now for the food... Took a little long to all come out. BUT you just NEED to order the mussels because they really are the bomb. The poached egg sandwich looked pretty good too. But I'd say your best bet is getting mussels, fries, and a beer. Can't go wrong with any of the desserts either. It was a very filling and delectable meal!
