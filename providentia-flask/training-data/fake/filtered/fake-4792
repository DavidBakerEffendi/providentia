Now this place is really different, but the owner is so nice and can sell you anything. The smoothie menu is unique but definitely worth a try. The cuisine is like none other than I heard before, but don't miss out on trying something new. I was scared at first, but all the flavors he put together where natural, simple and quite tasty. I will giving this place a second try most definitely in the future!
