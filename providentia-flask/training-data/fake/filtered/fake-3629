A French restaurant without French crunchy bread? Gummy sourdough instead. Pulp was very good, mussels...I woke up today with headache, vomits, etc. and I know positively it was the mussels. Chocolate mousse, from a box. Tatin tartare, so so Rock'roll music instead Edith Piaf or something else? Not coming back. The personnel is great!
