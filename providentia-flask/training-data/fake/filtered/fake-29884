I love it here. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere/pictures make you feel right in Thailand. The food is awesome, and they have 8 dollar lunch specials. For the brave people out there who like extremely spicy food, try the "redbull" beef dish. If you have a more sensitive stomach try the Lab Gai, it's chicken with rice/onion/cilantro with lemon/lime juice. So good. They draw fancy designs on their plates with syrups to add to the experience. I like the coconut chicken soup too. So good.
