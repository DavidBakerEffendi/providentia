Whenever I want my eyes to glaze over with the sight of food and dessert goodies I head over to the Reading Terminal Market. It's hard to restrain yourself from buying something when you look at all the choices available to you. All sorts of cheeses, the Grill, and Bassetts Ice Cream! The atmosphere is always holiday-like, if you know what I mean: filled with people, lights, shops hugging each other, with new ones to discover if you turn this corner or that corner. A pretty wild place, perhaps too crowded, but understandably so.
