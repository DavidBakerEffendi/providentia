Ridiculously overpriced. We ordered a medium sicillian pizza for $12, and what did we get? Six slices of air. There were about 4-5 pieces of pepperoni on the entire pizza. Actually, I wouldn't even call it a pizza. It was more like an appetizer. When we opened the box, we seriously thought they accidentally left out half of it. We were still hungry afterwards, so we picked up a Digiorno frozen pizza from stop and shop. Please don't go here - there are SO many other pizza places that are better.
