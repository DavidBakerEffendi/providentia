I am still in shock from my last experience at Sabrina's on Callowhill.  My friends and I had brunch there last saturday, June 4th.  We had a minor wait which was fine, however when we were seated things went from bad to worse.   The place was crowded and clearly the wait staff could not handle things.  Our waitress took our drink orders and then did return for 15 minutes with the drinks.  This was ok with us since we don't often get the opportunity to get together and we were happy to catch up a bit.  When she final did take our order she seemed very rushed.   Sure enough when the food came two of our meals were completely wrong.  We informed the waitress who was rude and actually just walked away.  The hostess came over and said that she would fix it.  Eventually, a man came over and informed my friend that he would comp her meal since  they messed things up.  I asked if mine would also be removed from the bill since it was completely incorrect and he actually said "well maybe but since you asked no".  He then informed us that he was "totally put off by the fact that we asked him to remove it".   When we asked him what his title was youo can imagine our surprise to hear that he was actually the manager.  We all live in the city and have many clients and friends who we take out to eat.  None of us have ever been spoken to this way by a manager.   He never came over to apologize but did come over to our table several times to try to clear the plates, etc.  Too little, too late.  Rest assured that none of us will ever eat here again.  The food is good not good enough to deal with this kind of treatment.  I have been to many other places in the city that have a way better brunch and most certaintly better service.
