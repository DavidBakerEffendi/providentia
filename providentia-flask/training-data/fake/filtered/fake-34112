The best service I have received in a restaurant in a very long time. The staff was prompt and courteous from the moment we walked in. Our water glasses were continually filled, our wine glasses were never left empty and the food was delivered quickly. The tapas were amazing and we enjoyed being able to try multiple menu items. Our primary water was knowledgeable about the food and the vast wine selection. We left very impressed and hope to return soon!
