This pizzeria has truly gone downhill. I was a regular customer. All was decent when they first opened. My main concern is sanitation. The girls at the counter take your money and then handle/cut your pizza etc. No  one wears gloves!  I saw the girl at the counter handle raw chicken, then touch her cell phone and then pick up my two slices to heat them! Yuk! Have they heard of salmonela! No one washes their hands! The chicken is always rubbery so I stopped ordering that too.
