I recently dined at the Yardley Inn with my husband and in-laws and it was a terrible experience!  First and foremost, I must say that during the 2 and 1/2 hours we were there, my husband saw two cockroaches.  UNACCEPTABLE!  He didn't tell me until after we left and thank goodness for that!  The hostess who greeted us was rude and unapproachable.  Our server was excellent and the food was decent, not for the price tag though.  Honestly, I would never ever visit there again.
