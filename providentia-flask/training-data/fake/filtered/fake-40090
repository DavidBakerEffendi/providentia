Pizza slice is very good but everything else STINKS!!! Don't know what all the hype is, maybe cause you are waiting an hour for your pizza and your taste buds are all screwed up. All you morons traveling from all over to watch an old man make a pizza, get over it. It's pizza, plus its all a show just to make you wait and salivate. $5.00 per slice - really ain't worth it Shut down for health code violations yearly - reality Go somewhere else and save yourself a trip.
