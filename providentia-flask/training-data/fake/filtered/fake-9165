Went March 9th for dinner with a friend.  Got there around 9 p.m. and although the place was busy was greeted by friendly staff and seated immediately.  Ate crab cake, spare rib and mussel appetizers.  (Mussels melt in your mouth.)  Entrees were Hanger steak and Mac n' Cheese, fries and Brussels sprouts were the veggies.  All was great and would you believe we made room for scrumptious cheese cake.   I didn't drink because I drove but go with a thirst as bar offers various beer, red and white wine choices.  When we left, at 11 p.m., couples were still being seated.  I'll definitely be back.
