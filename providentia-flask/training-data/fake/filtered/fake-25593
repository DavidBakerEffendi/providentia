My husband and I went to Friedman's for breakfast and it was really good.  The staff was friendly and they provided excellent customer service.. I had  two eggs, bacon, and potato hashbrowns.  My husband ordered the B.E.L.T.  His eggs were runny.  I guess he should have specified how he wanted them cooked.. Overall 4.5
