Their way or highway. They do not accommodate to the customers who do not eat ham or bacon but they will charge for those ingrediants. No subsititutions for those ingrediants. I was their loyal customer since 1997 and always bought 3-4 pizas per week. when they opened the new restaurant they  picked up some business and they lost the personal touch. The young counter staff is pleasant but the management staff have the attitude like We dont need your business. I will say to the owner , when you take a penny out of hundred dollars. It is no more hundred dollars. I have about 50 families from my community living on Mix Ave I will tell them to support little piza parlors on Dixwell ave where you are wellcomed. I guess Damattios has become an exclusive restaurant and only sensitive to their own kind of peoples' needs  and not for those customers who want to experince italian foods with a little twist.
