I have been to Amis twice (third time is already on the books) and have had nothing but great experiences.  Food, service, and atmosphere are always top notch.  Only issue is they run slow on reservations sometimes and you end up waiting for an extra 15-30 minutes - but just plan that into your time and you are all set.
