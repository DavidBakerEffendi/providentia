We went to Brazi's as a large group (baseball players and parents) there were about 25 of us from Massachusetts here for a baseball tournament.  Our waiter was the best I have ever had in all my years of going to restaurants.  He got every order correct and was incredibly polite and capable.  Our food was fantastic, it was served promptly and the quantities were generous.  We had everything from pizza to sandwiches to entrees and salads.  This place is wonderful and the prices are good too!  Don't miss it!
