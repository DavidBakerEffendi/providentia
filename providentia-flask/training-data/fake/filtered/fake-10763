Having traveled to many countries in Asia, I continuously seek an undiluted international dining experience... aka non-westernized food. For the taste of the food, this place is more like 4-star. However, the poor service and microwaved food are definitely a deal breaker. The lady at the sweet corner seemed more courteous than most staff. I don't understand why they can't have a more professional staff and better service.
