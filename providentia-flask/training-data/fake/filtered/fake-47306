Went out with friends for dinner to try a new restaurant. The restaurant was exactly the same as it was when it was Charlie Brown's. When we first got there they told us that we had to wait because the kitchen was behind. We then ask if we could be seated and just order drinks and they told us no. We ordered our meals. My steak was like shoe leather for $24.99 and they served ice cold garlic mash potatoes. Two friends of mine order the pan seared tialipa and it was fried. Last but least someone ordered prime rib and asked for French fries instead of mashed Â potatoes. The French fries came out ten mintues later cold and no flavor. The food was terrible. This place was actually better when it was Charlie's Brown's. This was the worst restaurant that I have eaten at in a long time. The owner needs to get his act together or just close his doors.
