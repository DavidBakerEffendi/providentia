I went on a Saturday night, which I will probably NEVER do again, but, in saying that, I must say, the food's BEYOND excellent.  I went to the pizza/pasta restaurant and it was the best food I've eaten in a L-O-N-G time.  The pasta was sooo al dente, EXCELLENT, the pizza, fuhggedaaboutit.  We also had an asparagus/fava bean appetizer that my friend & I were ecstatic about.  We, finished it off w/ gelato. Yes, as others have said, it's expensive and crowded, but, I must admit, it's worth it and I WILL go again, as I want to eat in the other restaurants as well as the pasta section again. Also, I found out that they have a carry-out on 24th St., and, unfortunately or not, I'll definitely order takeout.
