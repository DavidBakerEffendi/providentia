This is certainly as good as it gets- a completely relaxing and pampering experience - yes, pampering!. Amazing staff and service - they pop up the second before you were going to look for them. The food was delicious and after a stroll in the grounds this is the best place to kick back and relax. The Moroccan theme is outstanding with pops of turquoise and blue strategically placed. The outdoor seating was stunning with the view of a Monet painting. Our food was perfect - the steak hangers were juicy and just so tender with a delectable herb garnish. The crispy Grouper was amazingly balanced with grilled pineapple slices. The best part was the price - Â bang for the buck in terms of service, food, taste, decor and hospitality. Loved it!
