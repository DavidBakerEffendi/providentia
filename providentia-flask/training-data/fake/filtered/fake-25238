I absolutely love this place. I'v been coming since it was just a bakery, and now they have a full menu. The fact that everything is vegan still amazes me. The service can be a bit slow sometimes, but the food is what you come for, and you wont be sorry you did. I love the Hot Cubano panini. I think I might be addicted. If only there was a Champs in the city... Sigh lol
