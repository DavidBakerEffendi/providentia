Came across this cozy spot while trying to escape the frightful snow storm. The staff was EXTREMELY friendly and inviting- like we were chatting with old friends.  We ordered the kale salad to start and then the daily pork cut as well as the gnocci.  Everything was SO flavorful, mouthwatering, and delicious.  Needless to say we will definitely be back, with or without a snow storm!!
