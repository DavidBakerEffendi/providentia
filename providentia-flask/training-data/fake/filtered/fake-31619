Amazing restaurant and the location is excellent. We went after work on a Monday, so the place was not yet crowded. The atmosphere was friendly, the food was great and our waitress - Alexis was fantastic. She was pretty honest with her recommendations from the Menu, which were all good. Will definitely go there again.
