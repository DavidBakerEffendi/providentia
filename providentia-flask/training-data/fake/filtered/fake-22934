I started coming here many, many years ago when it was known as Ciro's pizza. At that time, the pizza was great. Now both the service and quality of the food has deteriorated.   They seem to want to stay in the business by providing 'specials' and 'deals', but they need to also maintain the cleaniness of the food.  I use to stop by this place 2- 3 times a week for lunch.  I would notice that the staff would not wash their hands.  For instance, they would begin reading a newspaper, or wiping the counter, and then start preparing the food.  One time I asked them why they would use the 'ladies' and not the 'man' bathroom.  They admitted that it was due to cleaniness.  They need to be more cognizant of preparing healthy food and cleaning the facilities.  The staff is rude and the guys who actually prepare the (sandwiches, etc), do NOT speak good English.  Which is fine, but it becomes troublesome when they do not know what a customer wants. Overall:  I suggest (1) being respectful to customers; (2) being cognizant of the cleaniness of the food preparation and (3) making quality sandwiches and pizza.  Not simply cutting the price and advertising 'deals' and 'specials' if in the end the final product will be horrendous.
