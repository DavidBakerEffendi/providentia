Tony and Lucille's sucks! They are unwelcoming people. Hubby and I stopped in one evening to eat chicken grinders. The old hag was rude when we ordered and didn't even seat us. Hubby asked if we could grab a table and she raised her voice "oh no this is only take out."Bitc* so why are there like 10 tables on this side? Totally disgused us and walked out. It's winter and I'm not eating in my car. Take your Italian menu and shove it up your a**. Never again. I found better Italian places. Racist as* DO NOT EAT HERE,UNLESS YOU WANT TO FEEL HUMILIATED AS A CONSUMER
