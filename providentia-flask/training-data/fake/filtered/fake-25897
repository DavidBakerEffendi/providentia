Rolled in late on a snowy night to enjoy the clams in red sauce, gnocci, meatballs--the works. Excellent traditional Philadelphia Italian. For dessert, I ordered the tortoni out of childhood nostalgia. When the waitress heard us talking about tortoni and the little wooden spoon in paper it used to come with, she went back to the kitchen and brought me one. Great memories, great food.
