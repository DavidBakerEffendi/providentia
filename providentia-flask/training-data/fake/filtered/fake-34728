I'm a huge fan of Sanford's and look forward to (especially) weekend brunch!  In many years of going solo or with family and friends, no one has left disappointed or hungry.   Some (and I underscore some) of my brunch favorites include Eggs Benedict, Crab Cakes Benedict, Steak Skillet and Spinach Fritta.  I'll also double down on the champagne (note that all the wines are skillfully chosen by one of the owners who has a fab palette) and wrap up with tea or hot chocolate.  All for a great price!   Brunches are super busy and the worthwhile waits of sometimes more than an hour can make the sidewalk outside crowded no matter the weather.  Particularly when it is crowded, be sure to show up with your entire party and be communicative with the wait staff.   The staff go above and beyond to make the dining experience one that leaves you wanting to come back.
