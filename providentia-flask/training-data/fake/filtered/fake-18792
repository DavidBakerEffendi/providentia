DON'T COME HERE IF YOU ARE ONLY WOMEN IN THE GROUP!!!This last experience has turned me off this restaurant for good. I used to come here at least once a month, during off-hours for a quiet lunch/early dinner, and the food was better than others in the chain, service was good, all was good. Yesterday, my two friends and I came in for an early dinner, around 5:30, and there was only one other inside table occupied. I ordered the stuffed shrimp with Greek salad as my two sides, two appetizers, and each of my friends ordered entrees as well:Gyro platter and Lamb over orzo. First, the waiter made fun of the way my friend pronounced the name of the dish (it was not funny), then they brought my dish and assumed it was for the table. THE WAITER FORGOT TO PUT IN THE ORDERS TOGETHER!!! Finally, we had to beg for more pita, they didn't take away the appetizer plates, we had to stack them on the table, three waiters came over (the original one didn't want to bother), as it was clear that something was wrong. I waited until my shrimp was cool, so that my friends could get their food. The quality of the food: shrimp was large (prawns), and at $26.00 for four shrimp stuffed with mushed-up salmon, and a plate of salad, the shrimp should have been excellent. They were OK, had come frozen (hard to separate from the shell,) and overcooked. Â Also, they were swimming in "butter/oil". they others likes their dishes. French fries were good (how hard is that?) After our dinner, no one came over to see if we wanted dessert, no one checked on us. The owner stood their, twenty feet away and watched us leave, looking away, so we didn't catch his eye. THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN EXTREME APOLOGY, AS THE ORDERS WERE SCREWED UP. MY FRIENDS HAD TO WAIT A GOOD TEN-FIFTEEN MINUTES FOR THEIR FOOD AFTER I WAS SERVED.NOTHING, NOT A THING!Why was this happening, when I had such good service before? Two groups came in well after us--both with men and women. The waiters fawned over the men in the groups. The owner is listed on the website as Muri Najib. Mr. Najib should have done something about this--even a sincere apology would have been enough. If he bothers to read this review: Mr. Najib. I know women are not so important to you as men, in your restaurant. But looks can be deceiving. We are a lawyer, a doctor and an accountant from California. I don't want to go back to your restaurant. Perhaps you don't care. But I am writing the first restaurant review of my life and it gives you one star! In the competitive business of franchise restaurants, this should matter to you. TRY IT'S GREEK TO ME IN HOBOKEN, ENGLEWOOD, ANYWHERE BUT CLIFTON.
