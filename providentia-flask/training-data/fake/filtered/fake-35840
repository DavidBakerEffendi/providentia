Pagani is my new favorite restaurant in the city.   Unbelievable creative modern Italian food - all of your favorites, each with a unique twist.  Same with the expansive and awesome cocktail menu. The service was perfect, and the atmosphere is modern funky quaint if that's a thing.  Well it is a thing now, and its at Pagani.   Ps - all this awesomeness comes at a totally reasonable price.   Love this place.
