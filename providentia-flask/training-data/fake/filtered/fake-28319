Stopped by for the second time this summer. First time around me and two friends made the mistake of buying dessert here. Don't waste your money on the dessert menu! However, I remembered how tasty some of the dishes passing by looked and made a mental note to try their food menu. I stopped by yesterday with a few people from work, we were all satisfied and happy with our choices. Also they serve Breakfast till 4, which I think is pretty awesome. Also there are some vegan friendly choices and that's a good thing when you're hanging with a variety of people. Make sure you sit outside on a nice day, very comfortable and relaxed environment. Good food and a great place for chatting it up. I'll be back.
