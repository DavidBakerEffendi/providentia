Based on my first meal here, I'm a fan. Seating was prompt, service was friendly, and the food was very good. I started with a spinach salad with beets, corn and peppers; while I'm not generally enthusiastic about corn, its sweetness and crunch complemented the other sweet veggies well. Also, the cherry tomatoes were sliced, which is unfortunately often not the case. Overall, a well-made and attractively presented salad and an auspicious start to the dining experience. I followed up with the eggs florentine, about which there's not much to say: they were good. The eggs were cooked right and, more importantly, so was the kale: it was neither cooked to death nor rough and raw. And yes, as others have pointed out, the breakfast potatoes were delicious and perfect for scraping up yolk. I hope this place finds its customers and survives, because I look forward to returning and exploring the menu further.
