Great food!  Great hospitality!  The car's water pump was leaking enroute from Montreal to Boston.  Stopped for some food and while the sandwiches were being made and without asking these guys offered several filled water jugs and towels to take.  The tuna melt and reuben were delicious and the water came in very handy!  I'll be back!  Tom from Belmont
