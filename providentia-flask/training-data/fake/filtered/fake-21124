The Montville Inn is one of my favorite restaurants.  The Tavern Menu is great for adults and kids alike, and the prices are wonderful.  My family has sampled almost everything on the Tavern Menu, but the highlights are the Kung Pao Chicken, the Montville Inn Burger, the Spicy Shrimp Pizza and the Ribs.  The Slider Sample appetizer is also great, as is the Fried Calamari Two Ways.  They also have a wine list of ~25 wines for $25 a bottle.  We are a family of four.  With a bottle of wine, dinner and dessert, we can get out for ~$100 - $120 including tip.  For the quality of food, service and decor, that is just great.  Top rated!
