I've been there for lunch and service is slow as can be but food and presentation are great....went there on a Friday night...place was hoping. Great atmosphere, my food was great...but my other guests food was oily, and over-buttered and it took 1 1/2 hours to see any food.  Waitstaff needs to be trained, and hey, ever hear of trays?  They cost about $5.  Invest in some so that you can carry more than one glass at a time, especially when you are busy.  I will go back for lunch when I have 1 1/2 hours to kill but will NEVER go there for dinner in the summer again.
