Just came here for dinner, had spring salad, ragu pasta, the charcuterie plate and the ricotta cheesecake. The food was not only uninteresting, but poorly prepared.  The leaves in the salad arrived wilted, due to the large quantity of salt on the leaves.  In addition, there were few other flavors, such as herbs or vinegar, in the salad to balance out the overwhelming flavor of salt.   The pasta was served with a ragu that was watery and also lacking in flavor.  The was comprised of shredded beef short rib - bits of it were crunchy - maybe was burnt from sticking to the bottom of the pot?  The tomato base did not taste of fresh ripe tomatoes and was lacking in complexity (herbs and spices).  The pasta itself was cooked quite well, just a touch other al dente, but the quality of the pasta suggests that it was cooked from the dried boxed variety - lacking the fresh chewy texture and also lacking in complexity due to the simple wheat base used to make the pasta. The ricotta cheesecake - maybe it wasn't a cheesecake, but either way it was not smooth and creamy.  But the taste was nice, a little tart and a little sweet.  However, the crust was again poorly constructed - soggy and again uninteresting in flavor. Overall, food lacked flavor and balance and was poorly prepared. This would be alright - except for the price that was charged.  Expect to pay $60/pp for these courses without alcohol.
