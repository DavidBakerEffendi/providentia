Best Banh Mi I've had since moving to NY from DC.The old ladies behind the counter know what they're doing and are the nicest and funniest women I've met here.If you speak any Vietnamese,PLEASE order in Vietnamese,they miss hearing their language,so do a few elderly women a solid will yah? I've had every single one of their sandwiches and have never been disappointed.Fairly-priced,and stomach- filling sandwiches.I recommend the classic Banh Mi for first-timers.
