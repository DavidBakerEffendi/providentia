My husband and just recently moved to Elizabeth and were looking for a place to have a couple of drinks at and play some pool so we decided to check this place out. I must say that it's a nice place Â with good music and drinks and we were having a good time playing pool even though you,re only allowed to play for 30 min, which was fine. Once we were done playing our game, we took a seat and ordered more drinks and about 5 mins later we ran into my cousin and his girlfriend, so we decided to ask the hostess to put us on the waiting list again for the pool table. We played one game pretty quickly and moved on to a 2nd game; half way through the game the hostess came over to tell us to hurry it up, so we tried to speed up the game, a little while later she came back and we just had one ball left to shoot so we asked her to let us finish shooting the last ball and she went up to the table and pushed the ball into the pocket and said game over!! How freaking rude! I could not believe she did that and needless to say, I was mad, so I asked to speak to a manager and some guy claiming he was the owner came over and I explained what happened and he flat out told me "we have rules" and we were taking too long. That was so disappointing to hear because we were hoping to make this place a regular, but after being treated so awful, I rather spend my money else were.
