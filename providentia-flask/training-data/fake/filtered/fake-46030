I brought a friend for lunch today and discovered that the music, which was a little louder than normal, came from upstairs where a private party was in progress. I commented to my friend that I sometimes stopped there instead of across the street where the decibel level was normally high. After our food arrived, the decibel level increased to an unpleasant level. Then they started jumping up and down, quaking the ceiling. Â I complained to the waitress, then to the manager. They both defended the good money they had paid upstairs for the private party, disregarding the good money I would pay for a meal which could not be pleasurably eaten, since the deaf people were allowed to set the decibel level for those whose whose hearing was still intact. The refusal of management to correct an unpleasant situation was abhorrent. Admittedly, they have a great kitchen, but they are socially impaired. In the future, upon entering i will ask if the sound level will become annoyingly loud in the next hour or so. There was nothing the kitchen could do to prepare a meal so fine that noise could not ruin the experience of eating it . It was a terrible dining experience.
