The Greatest Pizza in the World!!! It pays to be a Grimaldi when you go to Grimaldi's. We didn't have to wait in line & the service was excellent. Love all the Staff & the Host! The gelato cart outside with spumoni was so yummy after enjoying the most delicious pizza pie I've ever had in my life! I LOVE GRIMALDI'S!!!
