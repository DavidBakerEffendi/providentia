The Calamari in the photo I selected was very good. The drinks were really cheap and the service, once we finally got a table, was great...it was packed so I guess I should be more understanding, but when you have to wait 20 minutes for a table, it's not a lot of fun. What was fun was sitting outside in th nice weather, sipping down beers with friends and munching down some fried squid! Will definitely make reservations the next time!
