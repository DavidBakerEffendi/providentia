Was introduced to this place by my best friend who grew up going here even before their re-model. I love this place and go about once a month. My favorite menu items are the butternut squash ravioli and the thai chicken wrap. Their beer selection is also amazing and there is always something new to taste. Service is always awesome and the brunch is once of the best deals in Astoria.
