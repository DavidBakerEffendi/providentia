HORRIBLE!!! Greasy food with no flavor I LOVE Cuban food but this place was the worst I've been to. I asked the waiter if they had a house salad and he said no. Who doesn't have a house salad? In this day and age where people are trying to be more accommodating and healthier to not even try to make something up horrible. As for the noise factor..WOW talk about noisy. Had to yell across the table at each other. I asked for seltzer water it took 3 times before they could get it right. Waiters are not enough for the crowd, constantly running back and forth Â no time to spend with the tables. If you ask for something be prepared for your food to be cold before he comes back with it. Too many tables in a decent sized place. No reservations on Sat, and the wait depending on where you want to sit inside or out can range up to an hour. No need to ever go here again. Very disappointed.
