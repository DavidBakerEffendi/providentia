This restaurant was truely lovely. My boyfriend and I had an unforgetable night at Little Owl. As soon as we got there the staff and ambiance was so welcoming. They were playing great music and the whole vibe was just so alive and charming. Our table wasn't quite ready so the hostess offered us a complimentary lass of prosecco while we waited (the wait ended up being less than 5 minutes). Here is what we ordered: 3 appetizers: Avocado/Tomato/Prosciutto Salad - excellent! Meatball sliders - I was hoping these lived up to the hype and they 100% did! So juicy and tasty - cooked to perfection! Clams - tied with Catch most delicious clams I have ever had We each ordered an entree: I had the artic char which was incredible. This is not even a fish i usually order but it was excellent. I have been thinking craving it every night since we ate here. My BF had the lamb chops, which he seems to really enjoy. A bottle of Malbec - delicious!
