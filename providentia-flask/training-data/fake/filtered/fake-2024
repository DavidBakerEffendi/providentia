I'm not gonna waste to much time writing about this place. Sunday Brunch. Not too busy. Waiter took our order that's the last time I saw him until I hunted him down for our check. (skinny bearded squirrely guy). No napkins. No Utensils. No Straws. Food took 35 minutes to come out. Got my own napkins and straws from the bar. When i finally got my check which I waited 10 more minutes for there was no Pen to sign my slip. Overrated. Tell ur cool manager to take off his friggin sunglasses and manage that place.
