Food was typical....just about average...I Mean it's not amazing but it's not nasty.....the reason I gave it one star is because this pizzeria is very bad in service quality....it took more than an hour and a half to finally get a slice of pepperoni pizza!! Horrible right?? And the place had only 8 ppl which were my family of 3 and a different family of 5....I say, you could do better at sparros....
