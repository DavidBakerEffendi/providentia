Great food and great atmosphere. Me and a couple of friends tried to get Phillies tix last minute (no luck), so we decided to go to chickie's. The food was great, the beer was delicious (we got a tower ), and then we topped the night off with some Play2 (mortal kombat on a 60 inch). Great time, definitely a must when near the stadiums.
