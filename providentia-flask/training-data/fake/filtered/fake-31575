I just left from having brunch here and I must say, not only is the food delectable but the service is right up to par with the amazing view of the city I got to experience, my server Felicia was really funny and super hospitable. She check on our table several times and my boyfriend and I enjoyed our experience there thanks to the great staff. Â The food was finger licking good and we left wanting to go back for more.. We will definitely be back to this beautiful place with great atmosphere!
