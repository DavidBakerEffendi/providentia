The food is fantastic.  The salsa they put out with the chips actually has spice to it, something not many Mexican spots in the area can say.  The service is friendly and the place is always busy.  I ordered Carnitas tacos which were seasoned pulled pork, red onion, avacado, cilantro and a cheese I forget.   NEW SPORTS BAR upstairs that has a bunch of TV's and another group of tables in addition to the bar that seats about 10.  Service can be slow up there though cause it's usually just the bartender for bar AND tables. All around much improved since my last visit over a year ago, will definitely go back soon.
