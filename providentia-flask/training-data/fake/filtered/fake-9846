Friends and family took my  daughter here for a birthday dinner(her restaurant choice). Two of us had the halibut, which was absolutely delicious. One had the filet mignon which she loved, and the birthday girl had the pork tenderloin that she said was the best she ever had.  The food was exquisite, but the service was over the top good.  Charles was our waiter and was warm, friendly, and very personable making us feel very comfortable and happy and excited to be there.  In talking to Charles we mentioned that it was my daughters birthday and when he brought her dessert it had a candle in it and Happy Birthday written on the plate in chocolate.  It was beautiful and very unexpected.  The rest of the staff was very attentive making sure we had plenty of water and cleared plates.  The best dining experience ever.  My daughter wants to make this her birthday tradition!  Well done!!
