This is THE BEST PIZZA ON THE PLANET!!! well I haven't been to Italy so lets keep it as the best pizza on planet USA... This is truely a slice from paradise :) My New Yorker friends were always talking about this place and how I have to go there and try it out and I'm very glad I did. The line was super long (I waited more than an hour to get my hand on this beautiful pie) but it was very well worth it. The crust is thin and the cheese is out of this world. They use 3 or 4 different kinds of cheese (I think bufala, parmesano, and I dont know what else...) and they cut fresh basil on top of the pie as soon as it comes out of the oven. It's hard for me to descibe how good this pizza is so my advice is to just go there and try it out, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!
