We were looking for Indian food near our hotel, and the concierge recommended Indieblue. My friend and I shared two appetizers and half-servings of three entrees. Over the last 15 years, we have probably gotten together for 3 meals a year at conferences all over the world. We agreed that this was the best meal we've ever enjoyed together. The food was absolutely stupendous, and the service was marvelous too.
