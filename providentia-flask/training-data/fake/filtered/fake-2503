First time in Philly so I don't know how "authentic" they are but they tasted damn good. Surprisingly high quality meat and tasty fire. Also very friendly and helpful. Also my fiancée is a vegetarian and they had no problem making a nice grilled veggie sandwich.  In fact they seemed uses to the request and had a range a veggies to include.
