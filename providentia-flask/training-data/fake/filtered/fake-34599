My first trip to this fine Indian restaurant was a great experience.  Featuring primarily dosas (fillings in a super thin, crisp "pancake"), it is like a fast food Indian joint.  I went with the classic dosa (there are many other variations on the theme) and was not disappointed!  There samosas are also a suggested hit.  I would recommend this place, especially to those who want an quick introduction to Indian cuisine.
