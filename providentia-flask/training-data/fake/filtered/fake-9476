Went in with the family on Tuesday service was very slow and there was two waiters that didn't even attend us until we kept asking for service. Food price was very expensive and the hummus was defiantly  not fresh its tasted like it was out of a can plus for the price they charge you you don't get what your $$$ worth, And to top it off we ordered crepes with nutela chocolate we asked them to add a few pieces of strawberry and banana  and they charged us $4 for a few pieces,it was almost have the price of the crepes . I would defiantly not go back and I would never recommend any one to go there
