Casa Mono is easily my favorite restaurant. We've come here multiple times for birthdays, promotions, and anniversaries and Casa Mono raises the bar every time. Thank goodness it is a tapas restaurant because you get there and want to try everything. Here you have to opportunity to try several different plates without getting too full. I definitely recommend making reservations for the bar in front of the chefs so you can observe all the care the kitchen puts in to each dish. Sitting here can also help you decide what you want to order while you enjoy some wine. Venture out of your comfort zone here, you will not regret it. We tried Babbo, one of Mario B's other restaurants, and by the end of the meal we wished we had gone to Casa Mono. There's no need to go into the details of each dish, because its more rewarding to try them without a pre-existing opinion. The setting of the restaurant is lively but romantic. The staff will help remove any uncertainties you have about the menu items with detailed suggestions. Don't expect to eat on the cheap here. If you have wine, 5-7 small plates, dessert, and coffee, with tip you can expect to spend $200-$300 for two. I would be lying if I said it wasn't worth every penny.
