Amazing selection, fresh seafood, quick service. It's BYOB but there's a liquor store two or three blocks away -- just to be safe bring your own. We started off with oysters -- excellent. Moved onto the lobster bisque -- very good, larrrgeee portion. Finished off with the mixed grill special for the night - salmon and swordfish and I got the scallops. Everything tastes wonderful, light and fresh. I would love to come back.
