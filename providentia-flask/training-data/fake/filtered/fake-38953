This place is pretty over rated.  Several friends raved about how amazing everything is here and I just don't agree.  The eggs benedict was fine but certainly not the best ever.  The waitress wasn't very attentive either.  She never came over to see how things were until it was time to deliver the check.  Then it took another 30 minutes to get the check taken care of.
