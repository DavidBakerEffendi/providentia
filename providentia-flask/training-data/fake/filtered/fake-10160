Ordered a Tiramisu for a birthday party thinking that an Italian bakery would know how to make an italian cake. When they gave me the cake I told them that it wasn't a Tiramisu, but they ensured me that it was their Tiramisu. Cake was covered with frosting, had no ladyfingers, poor coffee flavoring, etc. Horrible cake. The only thing they make that's decent is their cookies, why people keep going there is a mystery.
