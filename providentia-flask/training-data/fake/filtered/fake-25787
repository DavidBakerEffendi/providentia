My girlfriend and I wanted to get lunch and we drove by this place so we decided to give it a try.  Best decision we made!!  This place is a great restaurant.  We both ordered things with crab in them and I couldn't believe the amount of crab meat that were in them.  The price is very reasonable considering how amazing the food is.  We will definitely be going back here very soon!
