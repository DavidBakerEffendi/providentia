It's really a shame, I was Devil Alley fan from the time it opened but the last couple visits there were a big disappointment. So I thought since Smokin' Betty was the latest offering perhaps it would be better. My experience it was not. I was seated next to a big open window that was nice until the sirens going to Jefferson started. I tried the wings with the dry rub, my server said it was pretty much the same as Devil's Alley. The wings were served at a tepid temperature. And the quality of the wings were not good. They were kind of rubbery and dry. They were not too fresh. The food runner was in drop and run mode. I had to ask for a set up which was not her fault. She did bring me back a complete set up which was more then my server did. I had the lamb burger which was good but nothing more. My server came to the table with check in before I was offered dessert. That's kind of rude. I felt rushed by that. The restrooms were a mess so at least I know one tradition fron Devil's Alley carried over. I won't be going back to either.
