LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!   Their food and desserts are ALWAYS delicious.  I highly recommend for lunch, dinner, or take-out.  I've enjoyed their sandwiches, side dishes, and meals.  I've also enjoyed grocery shopping as they offer a variety of high end pastas, sauces, and a whole host of items (too many to list).  Their desserts are delectable. Consistency is the key to success in any industry and every time I've patronized this establishment, I've always been pleased (I've already patronized at least a dozen times).   A few months ago, I was lucky enough to be given an impromptu tour of the kitchen; it was by far the most organized and impeccably-clean professional kitchen I've ever seen.   Wonderful food and great service!  This food snob gives it 5 stars!!
