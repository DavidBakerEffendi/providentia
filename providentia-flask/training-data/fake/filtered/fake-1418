This is unequivocally the worst place I have ever been to with respect to service. It has great character and all the potential in the world to be an excellent Princeton bar/eatery but is clearly mismanaged. I live in Princeton and eat out often but refuse to stop at the Tap Room because of the lack of attentive service from both the bar staff and restaurant/dining staff. I've sat outside on their amazing patio in the spring and couldn't get a drink to save my life. Sat at the bar on multiple occasions with an empty glass and sat in the restaurant with an empty water glass for the duration of the meal. I have yet to have a positive experience at the Tap Room but I give it two stars because of the character, the potential it has, and of course the Norman Rockwell behind the bar.
