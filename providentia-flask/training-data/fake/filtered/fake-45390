After reading so many great reviews on this place we ventured out of our cozy bay ridge and decided to give brunch a try. SOOO very glad we did!! There was a wait when we got there around 12:30 which we expected so we saddled up to the bar and were offered to have brunch there. Sure!! No wait! Our bartender/server was Sumaiya and she was PHENOMENAL. Her suggestions on drinks and food were on point. I had the hibiscus margarita and my bf had the strawberry moonshine. Both delicious! I ordered the crawfish eggs Benedict and he had the crowd favorite of fried chicken and waffle but it's a RED VELVET waffle! On her suggestion we got a side of the Mac n cheese. To call it a side doesn't do it justice because it's a meal on its own! My bf doesn't really like waffles but these waffles made him a believer! Now he says he just likes THESE waffles. They were fluffy and perfect! My Benedict was amazing with perfectly poached eggs and an old bay hollandaise that was beyond good! We will definitely be back and most likely for dinner next time!! Well done!!!
