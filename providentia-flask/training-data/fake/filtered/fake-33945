Stopped in one Saturday night because my 2 young nieces needed to use the bathroom very bad. We were berated and turned away unless we bought something. After $3.00 on two sodas they used the bathroom. They said no one lets you use the bathroom unless your a patron and someone should call the board of health on Libby's because their bathroom has been out of order for 40yrs. Not only were my 2 nieces their own nieces that they didn't recognize but then I was talked down to like a piece of crap. Thank God I never frequent Wooster Street establishments and never will again.
