What a find~  Immediately felt at home here.  Well blended decor, menu, wines and ambiance - a great intimate Latin Cuban restaurant nestled in Thompson Street.    One of the high service points was one of the senior staff just pulled up a chair and chatted with us about our day in the City, and the menu etc.  That kind of touch goes a long way.  But the staff were neither too fussy over us which I also like.   Be real if anything.  Don't be fake and they weren't.  They went out of their way to gi ve us recommendations on the area and were enthusiastic in all respects.  The dining experience was all together amazing for us.  Appetizers were just divine.  Meat cooked and seasoned to perfection. Perfectly presented and delicious.  The bill was not shocking.  I would say especially for a couple, or a small group of friends or family this place is going to give you a lasting memory and a wish to go back.  Looks like they also had a private dining room for about 12 which looked like fun....and was well decorated..
