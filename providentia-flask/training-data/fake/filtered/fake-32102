Went to Bahama Breeze for the first time on a Sunday night. After waiting 20 minutes to get a table, we sat in a comfortable booth.The food was excellent. The people were nice and friendly. But it was getting busier and there were about 20 people waiting to be seated and there were 3 dirty, un-bussed tables just sitting there for the entire hour and a half we were there. The managers walked past them about 4 times each, not even clearing them off for people to sit. OTHER than that, Bahama Breeze is a nice place, with great food.
