You need to hire more bartenders.  Although if you made your sons actually work instead of standing around and doing nothing then you wouldn't have to hire more people.  The service at the bar is horrendous and its not the bartenders fault.  You have one bartender to cover the whole restaurant and the bar and that is not enough people to cover that.  The food is great, but won't be going back there unless you have more bartenders to serve the people there.
