Noisy and boisterous.  The food is great.  I had the bone marrow appetizer, while it might give you a heart attack, it was to die for.  Fish dishes were great, salads were fantastic, and of course, those who ordered the black label burger smiled serenely while they devoured their meal.  It is expensive, but not more than you expect.
