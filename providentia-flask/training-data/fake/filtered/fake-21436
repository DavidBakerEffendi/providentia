Absolutely the greatest sandwich I have ever eat!!  The fish shawarma is the best thing going. The Moroccan fries are to die for. I will be making special trips to University City just for this food.  The service is wonderful - I love chatting with the guys.  You can't go wrong here.  I'm an absolute food snob, and while I'll eat almost anything, there are very few things that I adore, but this truck is one.  If there were justice in this world, there would be a Marrakesh Express in Swarthmore.
