My husband found this place using Goggle asking for the top ten Italian restaurants in lower NYC. We decided to go after work on a Friday. This place is small and intimate (very good for first dates). Â My husband had the seafood pasta, my daughter the lasagna and I had the thin sliced filet mignon with roasted potatoes. The pasta that came with my husband's dish was fresh and so delicious. My daughter really enjoyed her dish and I enjoyed mine. For dessert we shared their version of flan which is panne cotta. OMG was that awesome! Ghe prices are sooooo reasonable which is rare for NYC. They only accept cash though, so leave the credit card.
