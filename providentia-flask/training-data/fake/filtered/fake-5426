"settling!" is what our neighbors at this tightly packed narrow restaurant thought about being with my date. Having waited about ten minutes to be seated and frustrated from an earlier experience we thought it would be best to have some sangria. And what an excellent choice it was. I ordered the bistek enchizado (most likely butchered that one) a breaded fried steak. The "reacher" ordered the churasco. Both portions were generous and filling. Although some more flavor of the rice and beans would have been nice it was not disappointing. The service was a bit rushed and witnesses the waitress remove plates from patrons who were still nibbling. My other complaint would be the small tables which quickly became crowded with two entre's and sangria. It was a pleasant experience but think I will check out a few other places before returning to this one.
