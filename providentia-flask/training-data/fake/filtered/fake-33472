This place has become a regular haunt for me, as their beer selection leaves little to be desired. The emphasis on American beer and spirits is refreshing for a beer garden. The only food I have ordered is the Duck Sausage and man, I can't stop talking about how AWESOME it was. I want to go there now and eat twelve of them. It would be nice if they would on occasion do a buyback or two
