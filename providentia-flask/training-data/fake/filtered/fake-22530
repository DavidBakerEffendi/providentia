It enrages me that anyone would state with any semblance of authority that Mediterra would serve anything frozen "out of a bag". Mediterra uses locally sourced, grass fed beef and all food served there is locally sourced, organic, entirely fresh and never frozen. The diner who claimed that is really irresponsible and has no idea what they are talking about. The owners of Mediterra have been true leaders in their effort to bring local, organic, "farm to table" ingredients to Princeton diners.. They have great conviction about the importance of that effort.
