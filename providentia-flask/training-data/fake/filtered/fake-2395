FRESH, DELICIOUS, UNIQUE FLAVORS + COOL EMPLOYEES AND PEOPLE WATCHING. As someone whose travelled extensively throughout europe and Italy, cooks daily, and loves pizza, I can honestly say Prince st Pizza is some of the best in NYC, let alone the states.  It would be a mistake to get a basic slice of cheese here.  The squares are FKING AWESOME--the mercer margarita is a garlic twist on margarita that's absurdly good, and the Spicy Spring is a delicious delicious nd spicy pepperoni pizza.   During the middle of the hurricane I stopped by the only mart open in all of soho/little Italy and grabbed some fresh garlic, tomatoes, fresh basil, etc with the intention of making pasta.  I walked by Prince St Pizza and saw a light on.  Although it was the middle of the hurricane and they were closing ASAP, the guy running the place opened the door and no questions asked ordered his colleague to "get this guy a dough" and sent me off insisting that he couldn't accept any money for it and that I make a great pizza for my roommates.  Great dudes.   The guys who run this place are part of the culture of the 'hood.  They will talk you up, recognize you if you come back, make you laugh--like I said good dudes.  They will tell you all about the secrets to the homemade sauces and cheese thats made downstairs if you ask.  Fresh and delicious. On top of this, the vibe in the place is right.  Brick walls, cool original photos of classic visitors on the wall.  Sit at the stools at Prince St w a friend and you have one of the best people watching spots in the city--very attractive, unique, interesting people walking by speaking all different languages while you chomp on some rlly good pizza.  Great move-day or night.  Awesome fcking place, GO HERE.
