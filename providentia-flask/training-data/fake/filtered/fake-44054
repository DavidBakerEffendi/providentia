Came to Staten Island from out of town and decided to come here for lunch the other day with my family because a friend recommended it. Ordered the lobster crab ravioli and italian chicken pasta which were both very good. Got 2 pizza pies for the table that seemed a bit under cooked but overall good taste. The server was extremely sweet and accomodating. overall good atmosphere. would recommend.
