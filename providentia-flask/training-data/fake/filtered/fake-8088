How happy are we that Mint Thai Restaurant opened right in our own backyard. The exceptionally creative dishes they serve are so tastefully delicious. We always start with the vegetable glass noodle soup- which besides being so chocked full of vegis- it has such a smooth flavor able taste. And--- it's really not a glassnoodle soup- but everyone who works there is so accommodating in creating what we ask for. Then we get to the main meals- where to start. I happen  to love spicy foods and curry and I've had their eggplant, shrimp & basil- which is just so mouth watering. And then there' the red curry dishes - yummy. My husband tends to go for the Radna noodles. Tonight he ordered salmon- which was really so very moist and tasty. Mint will continue  to get our business!
