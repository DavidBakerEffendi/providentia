I really don't get the negative reviews for this restaurant other than I am always suspicious of the anonymity of these forums and the agendas that some must have. I always laugh at the self promoting intros of these negative reviews as if it establishes their bona fide culinary credentials "I am a foodie that has eaten at many high end restaurants....." blah blah blah. Anyway, I have been to the pines twice and both times I thought it was spectacular. Every aspect of the meal, the bread, appetizers, pastas and entrees were superb and the service was terrific. They take reservations, which is a welcome relief in Brooklyn these days. Waiting outside by the outdoor fire for a drink is not a bad way to go however if you are game to wait for a walk-in rez.
