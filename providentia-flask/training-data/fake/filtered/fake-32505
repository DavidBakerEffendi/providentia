Best anniversary dinner ever !!  My husband and I had a remarkable evening seated upstairs in the casual but romantic dining room.   Perfect table centered against the open window/wall and wrought iron railing with flower boxes.  Overlooking the hustle and bustle of Walnut St., historic churches in eye shot, we shared the perfect meal.   Started with the delicious Maryland crab on toast and beef tartare with fresh horseradish toasting each other with my new favorite cocktail, the "Jack Rose" and a great Belgian beer chasing both down with flutes of champagne and the complimentary pea soup.  Onto the main entree of organic Amish chicken, which we shared, finished with my hubby's "the best roasted chicken I have ever had" proclamation. Sides of crispy potatoes with shishito peppers seasoned with a spice we just couldn't figure out but didn't care because they were so good along with fresh spinached sauteed to perfection.   We took our time to soak in the ambiance and to allow room for dessert...two cappuccinos and a shared smoked chocolate and butterscotch parfait, yummy.  Although the table next to us had the blueberry pie which looked out of this world...."Next week" my husband said...lol.  Our next visit will be in the brick face back room to watch the chef at work while we enjoy a table with our friends. The service was so courteous and prompt and I love the Converse sneakers the servers wear as it adds to the non-fussy feel of the place.  Celebrations, happy hour, theatre crowd, date night....this restaurant is for everyone.  Sensible prices worth every penny and their classy hostess, Julie, made us feel welcome and special. This restaurant is going to be a staple in the Rittenhouse area and we can't wait to go back.
