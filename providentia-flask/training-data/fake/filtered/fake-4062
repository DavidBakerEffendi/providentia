A group of 10 went to Caseus to celebrate a friend's birthday.  We opened two bottles of wine and splurged to the tune of almost $300.  Towards the end of the evening, one of us brought out a small birthday cake.  To our flabbergast, we were charged $1 per plate per person.  To further cheapened the experience, we were brought plates without forks and had to wait an agonizing 15 minutes before the forks arrived.  By that time, the birthday candles have burned out.  We spent $300 and we were charged $10 for plates to celebrate a friend's birthday.  We left feeling sick, never to return, ever.
