An excellent value for the fresh, well-prepared and sizable meals offered.  Watch that spicy chicken, because as they warn you, it's not just a name!  The decor is simple and really attuned to take-out service, but really, why pay extra for glitz, when the food is what matters? Support this family-run local business, get a great mixed meal with perfect produce and proteins, and prepare to come back often!
