Went there today Â , seems very unorganized to me . I also noticed the waitstaff? bring several wrong dishes to other tables, I however did get the correct items , Blackened chicken panini it was dry so i had to ask for mayonnaise to make it so it would be moister, my daughter had the tomato basil panini ,no comment . In my opinion the portions are rather small but it was OK I will not go back , We also shared a lemon mousse square , I am Belgian , like the owner who is from Antwerp where i attended the culinary school in the late 70's early 80's and i told my daughter in Belgium if you're lemon mouse is not what we expect it to be you would not be in Business long , but here the general population has no idea what the consistence or the taste should be ......they grossly failed at the lemon mouse i would almost be sure it was a boxed product . A strange aftertaste lingered in my mouth , just not worth a second trip .
