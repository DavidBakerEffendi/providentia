My friends and I had a wonderful dinner at Cafe Himalaya. The food was delicious. Being a vegetarian, I was happy to see lots of choices on the menu for me. The restaurant itself is tiny, but the table was comfortable for us. The food portions were pretty large and I had a dish of mixed vegetables with pan-fried noodles. I also ordered a paratha bread on the side. I couldn't finish it all. The aura of the restaurant is clean and happy, with most tables filled with people in their 20s and 30s, I'm somewhat older, but my friends are in their 30s. If you are vegetarian and don't mind a restaurant which is very small and filled with chatty diners, then Cafe Himalaya is for you!
