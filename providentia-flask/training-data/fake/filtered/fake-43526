Food was unimpressive, but wasn't the real issue. Our waiter was a pure douche, way too emotionally connected to the food. After we ordered meals outside of the ones he recommended, he was clearly angered by it and completely ignored us the rest of the night. Didn't ask if everything was alright, check if we needed more to drink, nothing. I had to ask another employee to get our check, although I really wanted to just walk out. Will never go back again and be made uncomfortable by that pretentious asshole.
