My owners told me the last time they ate at Diner, they sat next to this one guy with his girlfriend drinking at the bar. They were all waiting for a table. The guy started pestering the bartender about the long wait. The bartender told him that he had no information and that he should ask the hostess. Pointing his finger at the bartender, the guy insisted that as a customer, he did *not* work there, so it was the bartender's responsibility, not his, to ask the hostess. The bartender looked at him and said, "Listen, don't ever talk to me that way," and walked away. The guy and his girlfriend turned as if to say, "can you believe that guy?!" but were nonplussed when my owners just laughed. The food was really good that night, though, and the waitress was lackadaisical in an endearing sort of way.
