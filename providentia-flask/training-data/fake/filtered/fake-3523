Deceivingly cheap-- small portions and poor quality. Their fried rice is white, with diced onions and PEAS. Their chicken is white, hard, and a bit crunchy. For $5, you could get a couple of tacos next door or a decent portion at G Heaven. God help these people...their service is just as terrible as the food. One can even leave with a stale taste in their mouth from a take-over experience. Avoid. It isn't a "cheap, good bite". I'd rather starve than eat here again.
