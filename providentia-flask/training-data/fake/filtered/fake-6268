This place has a great and expansive beer list, as well as a full bar for those of us who are not beer drinkers.  Lots of local micro-brews to choose from.   They also have an imaginative menu, along with some basic bar food staples.  The food is freshly made, so it is worth the wait.  Try the specials.
