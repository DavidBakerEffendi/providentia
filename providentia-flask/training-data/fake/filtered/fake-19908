We stopped at Oasis at the end of a Â night bar-hopping in Williamsburg. We stopped there because it was next to the L train station and was convenient, and ended up taking the train out from the East Village the next night to get takeout from there again. It was THAT good. I had the falafel and it was delicious - the toppings included red cabbage, which I'd never had on falalfel before but was wonderful. Overall, it was tangy and spicy and superb. My husband had the chicken sharwama and said it was fresh, flavorful and filling. We also got a side of their eggplant salad, which was fantastic. The poster who said they were rude, I don't get that. Maybe it was you. The people working there both times when we went were friendly and sweet, cracking jokes with us and chatting us up. They could not have been nicer. I can't recommend this place enough. I only wish I lived closer to them so I could eat there more often.
