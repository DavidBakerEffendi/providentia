Food is ok ,but the servers will confront you if they think you did not tip. In my case I tipped the cook as soon as he was done $15. I paid my bill $89 for 3 people and I was confronted by a server who did nothing at our table asking me if I planed to tip, when I told her I tipped the chef Â she wanted to know how much. Being in shock over her approach I just simply replied ask him. I can't believe how petty and desperate people can be.
