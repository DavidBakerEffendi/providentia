What a dissapointment! This restaurant is well past its prime. We should have guessed by the number of empty tables.. apparently people already know to stay away, though not those writing reviews on yelp! This was the worst meal we have had in a long time and would not have justified even a very cheap ticket, which was far from what it was. We had a tasting menu and one extra dish - and without exception, every plate we were brought was a disappointment. The overwhelmingly consistent feature was the food's blandness. None of the dishes had any flavor. While the textures were not bad the taste was totally absent. Even the appearance seemed somehow artificial and stale. The dishes might as well have been reheated frozen ready meals. The quality was below the standard of what you would get in a supermarket. Aside from the terrible food, service was fine, but the decor was faded and old. We would strongly advise you not to bother!
