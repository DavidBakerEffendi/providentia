As others have said, skip Geno's, Pat's and all that crap.  If you're in the area, go here for a cheesesteak.  I've eaten a ton of cheesesteaks at a lot of different places and cooked a ton of cheesesteaks for a lot of different places, this is by far my favorite right now.  You can get pretty much any toppings you want, they have a nice variety of peppers at the counter, and the service was always top notch when I was there. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if and when I'm in the area, I definitely stop for a great steak...always! Oh and they use the better quality Amoroso rolls (Amoroso has a few different types), you won't get that at the tourist steak places.
