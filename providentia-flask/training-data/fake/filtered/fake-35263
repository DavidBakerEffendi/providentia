As a connoisseur of  many fine coffee shops,  I found this cafe to be the most satisfying both in intimate atmosphere  & exquisite Italian- style food, let alone the specifically delicious Illy coffee.   I must also mention the amiable & very knowledgable proprietor Gaia herself. She adds a level of European cordiality found nowhere else in the Big Apple. This place is clandestine treat.  Don't miss it.
