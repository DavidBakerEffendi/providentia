Finally had a chance to stop in and try the food. The commercials make it look so good!  Well, looks can be deceiving.   The staff is great.  Very nice, friendly and quick.  The place was empty at 2:30PM, which should have been a hint.  The food was terrible.  We were one of 4 couples in the place.  You would think the food would be cooked amazing...NO!  It was just terrible and expensive.  Lunch for two costs us $60.  That was just one appetizer each and both our meals were $15 each.   I will NOT be going back!
