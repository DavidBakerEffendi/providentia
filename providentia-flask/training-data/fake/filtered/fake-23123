I love love LOVE this place. Â I like it so much that I've made it a staple in my transition from NY to Philly. What really makes the experience great is the the happy hour menu, the location to the theater and more importantly the bartender - Carl. He's fantastic! He's approachable. He pays attention to the patrons. He's just an all around nice guy. I highly recommend the place. Oh and let me not forget, the food is great too!
