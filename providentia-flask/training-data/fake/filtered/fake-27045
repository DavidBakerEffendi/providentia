I am a resident of L.I.C. and love to support our local establishments. I have been wanting to try Crescent Grill for some time after driving by and admiring the restaurants exterior. I finally had the chance to dine there for dinner and was a bit disappointed. They definitely need to "hip it up" in some areas. Once I walked into the restaurant it felt a bit awkward. Not what I expected from the exterior. Is it a restaurant or an art gallery? The space is way too bright inside. So much focus is put on illuminating the artwork that the essence of intimate dining is completely lost. Maybe having brunch there is a better option. In addition the music that they were playing was "very" dated and dry ... possibly a 70's station on Pandora... and not surround sound so it is heard in corners where the speakers hang. It almost felt like dinning in a lunchroom to me. The food was average. Bread was tasty, halibut ok and could have been crisper on top, dessert ok. Service a little lacking although there wasn't a lot of staff on site. Hopefully they read the reviews and make some changes because the place definitely has potential.
