This is a below avg Chinese restaurant disguised to be "authentic" Japanese sushi restaurant... its not. I've been there three times, two times during lunch and one dinner. First impression was "so so", but gradually got worse and worse and has gone way down hill... I think they want to save some payroll and then using some cheap young ''boys" to roll sushi. Other than some flashing light bulbs as food presentation, very inexperience food making. One thing that always puzzled me is some dead mouse smell in the air either from the ceiling or from those sushi fish in the dinning room? I don't know, brought it up to the owner and was told that came from a sewer near by!?!?. Service there is usually OK, but I have had some unpleasant experiences and inconsistencies in food. The rolls seem to get smaller and smaller, and they don't use the higher grades of fish. I once got some weird cartilage in my spicy tuna roll and that was the final straw for me. Plus, there are too many other excellent sushi places nowaday that are almost as reasonable as them. Never will go back again.
