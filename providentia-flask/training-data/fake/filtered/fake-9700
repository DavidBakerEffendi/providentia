Bad attitudes like third world country. They all need Prozac. I can see in the kitchen window the Spanish kitchen workers were making my salad with their bare hands. HEALTH CODE VIOLATION! Service is awful. Food is not good. Overcooked pasta,sauce is bland, ext... The Dining room (if you call it that) looks tacky and dark. So many other places to choose from I would choose another place.
