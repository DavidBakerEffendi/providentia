My friend was in town from LA and staying at my place last month. She said she had an outstanding burger at this great new place in Carroll Gardens. I trust her taste and had been curious to try out the restaurant but in and out of town. Tonight, my boyfriend and I were coming back from vacation and had a car so drove over to Buttermilk Channel. Truly awesome. The meal was absolutely delicious - grilled kale and endive salad - yum!, the burger was as my friend said - outstanding - , and the staff and owner made it feel like a place that will not only thrive but will be a staple of excellent food and warmth in the neighborhood. I can't wait to go back, and save room for the brioche dessert!
