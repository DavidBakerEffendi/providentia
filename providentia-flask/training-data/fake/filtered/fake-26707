I am re-writing my review for Spuntino.  I received a phone call from the GM after he read my review on Yelp. I was pleasantly supriesed.  He called to apologize for his team on dropping the ball with my inquiry for reserving a private party.  Never under-estimate the power of social media.   My husband and I went for dinner and enjoyed it.  As an importer for cured meats, I have to say the prosciutto di parma was excellent.  I should've ordered another plate. The goat cheese with caramelized onions bruschetta was very good, also. The only plate I did not enjoy was the broccoli rabe. It was over-powered by garlic.  The remaining of the tapas plates were good. Oh, I can't forget the Spuntino's donuts served with Hersey syrup, a twist on the traditional zeppole.  It was very light and airy.  The only change I would make is replacing the Hershey syrup with warmed ganache. (sorry this is the pastry chef coming out). After the sincere apology and an attentive evening, I will be returning to Spuntino with the girls!! If you are looking for variety for a meal, this is a place to go. PREVIOUS REVIEW: I called 2 times to attempt to reserve the private room for a party.  I spoke to a manager and he told me he would have menu to me via email at the end of the night. Nothing!  I called the next day to speak to a manager and was told someone would call me back.  I went in the later that day to speak with someone and there wasn't a manager there.  I was told the manager in charge of booking parties will be in at 4 and he will call me then. Nothing!   Very unprofessional.  I have no desire to even try the restaurant. Suggestion: need to find new managers who actually call people back and does not let potential business walk.
