We just held our youngest daughter's wedding at the Valley Regency this past June and while I had been expecting a beautiful wedding for my daughter they just blew away all my expectations and exceeded by fat anything I could have imagined. The venue itself, both inside and outside, is beyond beautiful and the food is out of this world both in quality and quantity. There is something to satisfy anyone's tastes and the service is first class. We received nothing but compliments from our guests who were not shy about telling us outright it was the best wedding they had ever been to or as to how we had hit a home run, how it was 'elegant". The cocktail hour was superb made even more so by having enough tables for the guests o enjoy themselves and t have to juggle their drinks an their food plates! Frank and Danny and the rest of the staff cannot receive any higher marks for ter servce which was just exceptional. We are going to have our older daughter's wedding there as well in October and having made the announcement, without even having sent out the invitations, people are jumping on board already and lining up telling us how excited they are and how much they are looking forward to attending our daughter Holly's wedding! It made me feel great just seeing how much our guests had enjoyed themselves. FIVE STARS is JUST NOT ENOUGH to bestow on this most excellent venue and it sfaff! Thank you Franko, Thank you Danny! Thank you VALLEY REGENCY!
