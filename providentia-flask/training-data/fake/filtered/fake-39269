Came all the way from Long Island to try this new restaurant because I love Mama Theresa's & it's the same family & they've adopted some tried & true family recipes. This is a place for EVERYONE. The traditionalists will love the familiar dishes & those of us that like lighter fare will be pleased as well by the healthy alternatives. I could not believe the prices for a Soho place! The decor was just beautiful. Loved the skylight & the exposed brick. This is a restaurant I will go to over & over again!
