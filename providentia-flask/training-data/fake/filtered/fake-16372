I worked near here awhile and kept seeing crazy lines, figured i should give it a try. It's not half bad but it's no L&B. Don't go at exactly dinner time try when its a little slower but sometimes even lunch seems pretty busy. prices food and service are all pretty good but not nearly good enough for some of the lines ive seen.
