We were on an overnight checking out NYU b/c my daughter had just gotten accepted. Went there at 9:30pm b/c we had had a late lunch. I haven't seen my daughter so excited about a menu since she was diagnosed in Sept. with celiac...needless to say she will be a regular once she becomes an NYU student. Bravo!
