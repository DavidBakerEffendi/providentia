I went here with my mom and we went to order another drink and the waiter told us we weren't allowed to have more than one drink per person on the table. He made us feel like alcoholics when we just wanted a second glass of wine. Don't know why I keep going back but another time I went here I am pretty sure there was no alcohol in the mojito which I sent back and I hate doing that. Food is also pretty awful. Only redeeming thing is the cheesecake.
