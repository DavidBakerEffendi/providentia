I think this place is over hyped. I came there with my wife after a friend recommend it to us. We came in on Friday during lunch hour, we got a seat right away and were very excited because we both love Thai food. I guess you could say we didn't get the right waiter because it went all wrong from there. The waiter was very rude and short with us and didn't really help us in the dish selection process. After we placed the order, the wait was terribly long. It wasn't that busy but it took 30 minutes to get our food, when we did get it it was not what my wife wanted , our choices were either have to eat what they brought us or wait for another 30 minutes for another dish. It was just not right. By the way, if you going to order meat they are going to assume that you want ground beef(their default choice) of meat. The waiter didn't even bother to ask us how we wanted it. After we told them that we were going to leave the waiter went to tell the manager and the manager was looking our way and didn't even come over and try to talk to us and find out what went wrong. Poor hospitality skills! I don't recommend this place. The service is bad. The staff is not friendly. Oh and the soup that they brought us was very salty(not a good sign if you ask me either).
