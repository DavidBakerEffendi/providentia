I used to live around the corner from cafe zona sur right when they opened, and fell in love from the start. The atmosphere is a little out of place in that area of sunset park, but a very welcome change of pace. From the back patio to the decor, its a welcome escape from the sometimes run down area. The food is excellent, and the chef himself is frequently seen asking customers for their opinions. The staff is friendly and the prices are great. Even now that I have moved closer to Bay Ridge, I find myself coming back here whenever I feel in the mood for brunch.
