I think there are better options to try in the neighborhood.  ...Prices are very expensive here for what you get...(i.e look at Bubby's menu and cost vs. Marc Forgione); and, it's very loud and crowded (on weekends for brunch.)  I wanted to like it.  Have been there many times...and have always left feeling disappointed.  ....Again - wanted to like it - I'm writing this in the hopes that the proprietors read these reviews & modify for the possibility of improved customer experience & value.
