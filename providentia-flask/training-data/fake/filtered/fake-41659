Best brunch spot in the neighborhood, hands down. Best lunch spot, too. Basically, it's the best spot. I recommend the Williamsburger and Tater Heaven. It's not that the other things aren't worthy of recommendation, it's just that these things are SO good I can't manage to pull myself away whenever I'm there. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that their soda mix is off. Like, way off. It's both under-carbonated and over-syruped, making it nearly undrinkable. I brought this to my waiter's attention, and he was kind enough to take it back and play around with the machine, but the second version wasn't much better than the first. I wish they carried cans!
