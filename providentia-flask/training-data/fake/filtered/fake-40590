Everyone told me that this is the best pizza and that I had to eat there. I am a big pizza guy and I was really disappointed. I am from Miami and I have tried many pizza joints but this is not even close to my top 20. Â In fact while I was in NY I probably ate at 5 better pizza joints. First of all they are so over prized that it is not even funny. We had a big pizza w 3 toppings and it was $35. The only way I would eat this pizza again, would be if they sold it for $8. Honestly, I rather order papa johns and I don&#39;t even like pizza chains. The service was good and the atmosphere was ok but I will never eat there again. Over hyped, stay away and go eat at any other pizza place!
