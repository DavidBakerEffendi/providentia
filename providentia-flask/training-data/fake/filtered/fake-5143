not many Chinese restaurants in Parsippany, but Noodle Chu comes off as average. dim sum is ok but not great. dinner service is nice though, the food comes extremely fast and it's always decently satisfying. prices are relatively modest as well. Noodle Chu isn't a place for high-brow Chinese cuisine, but it's nice for Chinese food out with the family.
