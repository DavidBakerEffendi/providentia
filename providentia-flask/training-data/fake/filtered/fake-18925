PAT's = Juicier, tastier meat, but the bread is way better at GENOS. Also, the hot sauce offered at GENOS is exceptional to spice up the steak and cannot even be compared with the hot sauce available at PAT's. Can someone please open up a new store in between these two venus and call it PANOS or GET. If someone was to ask me... Would you drive all the way to Philly just for a cheese steak? My answer would be yes. $20 for tolls and $30 for gas and ($10 x 2 steaks, fries and soda = $30) NET $80 for two philly cheese steak? Yes it's worth it. Please note: There is no bathroom.
