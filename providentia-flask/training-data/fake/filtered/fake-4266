I used to be a big fan of this diner! I remember being able to order a toasted corn muffin as well as a great varieties of entrees now that's all gone. I went there for my birthday recently and they couldn't figure out how to heat water for my tea. Really, no joke, they became very defensive, yelled at me and brought the manager in to try and resolve the issue. Instead of just putting my cup of tea in the microwave, he used a gauge to measure the water temperature and came up with the exact temperature I had predicted: 180 degrees. The fuss greatly disturbed my evening with my girlfriend which we spent trying to make sense of what happened.
