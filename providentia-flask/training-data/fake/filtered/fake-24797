Very small cozy place. Upon eating there I almost always mention to my boyfriend " I feel like i"m eating in someone's kitchen (in a good way). Â You can clearly see the kitchen from the dining area and notice that everything is made to order. I recommend: steamed chicken dumplings (a large order, can easily be a meal in itself) Spicy chili shrimp special Rice pudding for dessert. Also, try the bread option with the main entree/ soooo tasty:-)
