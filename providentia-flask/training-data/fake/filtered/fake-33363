Just came back from dining there with my sister and I am stuffed.  However, the food was not that extraordinary, just plentiful.  The salad bar was fantastic and I would have preferred just having that.  Did not know this was an option until after the meal and the waitress told us we could have done that!  The meats were okay, but many were overcooked and dry for my tastes even though we asked for the rarest pieces they had.  Some meats were over seasoned (with pepper and salt) for my taste.  Service was impeccable and someone was by your side before you even knew you wanted something.  That was nice.  Key lime pie was excellent.  So overall, some things were great but I'm not sure I would go back unless my husband really wanted to be grandly carnivorous.  And then I would get only the salad bar...
