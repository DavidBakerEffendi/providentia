My friends and I went to La Follia last night.  We enjoyed the food but the portions were small.  For example the crostini appetizer came with only two crostini (and there were four of us).  Everything would have been great except for the rude and inappropriate service at the end.  By accident, my friends and I added the tip wrong so that it added up to 15%.  The waitress looked over our shoulders while we were filling out the receipts and said in what to us what a snotty voice  that we were not tipping 20% and then blamed our addition problem on the way we chose to split the bill and said  with a biting edge "I told you this would happen."  She kept going on about the tip mistake.  Obviously as she was standing over our shoulder we felt pressured to change our error into a 20% tip.  As we left the restaurant she was glaring at us.  While we had a wonderful dinner, delicious food, great wine and loved the ambiance, our memory of this restaurant is now clouded by the rude service.
