I had a great chance to visit this area. A friend of mine invited me to Orchard for dinner, he told me that this restaurant offers organic food. It was hard to believe without trying. A waitress, who took care of us, gave an advise to try whole trout and short rib. And it was wonderful. The fish was without bones and so crispy outside and juicy inside. Instead of main dish we ordered a couple appetizers, artichoke dip and shrimp to start. Everything was delicious. I tried Old Apple Tree cocktail and to be honest I wasn't Â expected it could be so good. I'm really exiting with this place. The special atmosphere, good music and nice stuff made my night. Thank you guys for your great job. I'll definitely be back and take my friends with me.
