I love this place more than almost any where in New York. To say the service is bad is to disrespect the atmosphere of the restuarant. It is busy and small and staffed with what appears to be friends/family. Its awesome and you will have a great great great night! Every time! ps I finally had to write a review on Yelp just to counter-argue people's complaining here!! :)
