We've been to Rouge in Philadelphia many times for Irish Coffee and ambiance.  This is a great place for Irish Coffee especially in the summer when the windows are open.  So, we decided to dine there.  BIG MISTAKE!  I ordered the black cod (which is similar to butterfish).  At the Rouge it was more like rubber fish.  It smelled bad too so you know it was NOT fresh.  They did not charge me, but that is the last time I will eat there as my husband's salmon was OK, but did not sit well with him later on.  As we were walking back down Walnut Street, we decided to stop into our favorite restaurant, Alma de Cuba and have an appetizer and a cocktail.  Right choice.
