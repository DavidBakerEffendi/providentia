DIARRHEA!!!  Yes, I said it DIARRHEA!!!  We went with a party of 8 and all 8 of us got sick.  Turns out one couple in our party went there once before and also got sick.  No surprise, the waiters seemed amateurish, the restaurant was overcrowded, and the whole place seemed unsanitary.  I wanted to like the place, the decor was pretty nice (although my wife thought it looked and felt like a cheesy Epcot center restaurant).  We were essentially forced to buy overpriced sangria,which was thin and poor.  The food was fair (while it lasted in our system), but overpriced.  I like thinking back on the restaurant I went to earlier in the day, but not on the toilet.  Pay too much money to then be sick. No way.   WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE EVER!!!
