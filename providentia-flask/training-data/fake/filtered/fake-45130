Driving around the city on a snow day with few options, my friend and I decided to play it safe and get some sandwiches.  Rybread is that perfect neighborhood place to pick up a reasonable lunch of a sandwich, drink and chips, and have your hunger sated. It also must have been a fortunate day for me, because they had the Plymouth sandwich as a special.  The Plymouth (as in the Plymouth Colony and Pilgrims) is the typical Thanksgiving sandwich with turkey, cranberry spread and stuffing.  Pair that with a raspberry lemonade and a bag of Cape Cod chips and I was completely content with my lunch choice. My one complaint is too much mayo, it overwhelmed the cranberry spread.  Although there was this one misstep, I will definitely be back, maybe even to try a different "regional" lunch concoction.
