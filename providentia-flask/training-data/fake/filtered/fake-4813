This is one of the worst Italian restaurants that I have ever experienced.   The meat in the meatballs and lasagna was no better than dog food.  My wife took me to this restaurant because she remembered it being good many years ago.  She tried my food, agreed with me, and will NEVER return.  There is nothing special about thts restaurant.
