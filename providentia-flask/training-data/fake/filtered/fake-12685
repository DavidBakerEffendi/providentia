My friends and I were so excited to dine at Lupa.  And the food was great!  Our waiter was outstanding and offered some great suggestions that were all amazing.  However, the reason for this so-so review is due to our service at the bar.  We were a little early for our reservation and tried to grab a drink at the bar.  The bartender looked at us multiple times, made eye contact but would not take our order.  It was extremely frustrating.  It took over 20 minutes and we finally moved to another spot at the bar and to another bartender where we were promptly served.  When we mentioned this to the manager, no apologies were offered.  In fact, he was too busy defending his bartender to care whether or not we would come back.  It didn't feel like they were too concerned about how we were treated or if we came back.  Customer service is extremely important and I was disappointed that this was lacking with some (not all) of the staff here.
