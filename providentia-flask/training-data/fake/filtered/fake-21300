what a great place!  I plan on going back with teh purpose of introducing more people to it. A cute Colombian themed restaurant with good servers and better music. The service was rapid, drinks were delicious and the food was ok.  We orderd breakfast speciffically for Mangu.  We were more pleased that they were still serving mangu than we were with the taste. It was not bad...but it wasnt good. Excluding mangu, everything else was enjoyable.  i will definately be going back---you should too.
