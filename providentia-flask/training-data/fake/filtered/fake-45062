Had pizza there on Friday, March 1st on a recommendation by my niece as the best pizza she has ever eaten.  First off, the booth seating is designed for elementary school kids, not adults.  We made the mistake of thinking it was a BYOB.  Bad move, at least on the awkward scale.  Was like bringing wine into a McDonald's. The pizza was nothing more than mediocre, in fact it was more on the bad side.  The ingredients were on the skimpy side even for pizza. I guess my niece has not had her taste buds exposed to anything close to being eatable.  On the good side it is located in the middle of Cranbury, a nice quaint town. I would recommend Osteria Procaccini,in Kingston, DeLorenzo's (Trenton, not Robbinsville) & Federici's in Freehold as far superior.
