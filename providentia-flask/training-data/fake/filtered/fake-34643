Stopped here for lunch today. So bad I had to create a Yelp account to review it. I've driven by here a lot and always meant to stop as I'm a big diner fan, but I was extremely disappointed. I ordered a cheeseburger and fries. Fries were bland and lukewarm, like they'd sat out all day. The burger was atrocious. Very dry, no flavor and had the too perfect grill-lines of a frozen patty. Frozen or not, it was one of the worst burgers I've ever had. Service was ok. My waiter was pretty apathetic, but the other waitresses looked attentive and friendly. I was in there in the late afternoon on a weekday, so maybe they had their C-team on. But with so many other great options in northern New Jersey, I won't be taking a risk on visiting this place again.
