i'm literally joining every one of these sites that i can just to tell everyone about my nightmare experience at verlaine...not only was the wait staff rude but they threw us out because we wanted to close out our tab before things got crazy...i'm telling you don't ever go there, furthermore, if the owner or wait staff or friend of teh wait staff ever see this...go F*%K YOURSELF
