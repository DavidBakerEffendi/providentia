Love this place!  Stumbled upon this place when I was visiting a friend in Brooklyn. One knock is it is a bit small. Otherwise 5 stars. To start we had oysters and they were amazing. We also had a heirloom tomato salad and a crab corn salad. The owner came over multiple times to check on us and even sent us down the street to grab a bottle of wine as it's BYOB and he said you can't enjoy good for without good drink!  How right he was. For main we had the branzino cooked To perfection. As well as the salmon. Who would have thought you could have a wonderful French seafood restaurant in Brooklyn?  Well it's there and you should all go. You might have to wait for a table as I mentioned it is small and no resos
