Service: 1/5 Pizza: 2/5 Prices: 1/5 They are very rude here. For that fact I don't care how good the pizza might have been. It was ok at best and the fact that they have something different to offer probably gives it it's novel liking for many. The guy at the register tried to stiff me $1. I knew he tried to pull a fast one on me because he was quite upset that I called him out on it. After I kindly questioned the amount he slammed down the other dollar on the counter as if I had inconvenienced him. So we ordered 4 slices for take out but we wanted to try it and eat while walking so we asked for 4 plates and for one of the slices to be cut in four. When we opened the box and proceeded to get a small piece each, one of the big husky guys behind the counter blurts out: "What the hells the point of the box if you're gonna eat here? You just wasted a box!" To which I then replied, "We're not allowed to try it?" then he responds, "oh ok but you wasted a big box". That was quite ironic because before we walked in we were all commenting about all the wasted plates and boxes just outside the entrance. Anyway, we were amazed and quite shocked at his rudeness. We just paid $4.50 per slice and wanted to sample a taste and in return got scolded like a group of disobedient school children. As for the actual pizza, it was ok! The crust is thick so it's more like a sicilian slice with a unique topping/flavor with the artichoke and cream. It is a very heavy pizza and while I do appreciate trying it, I will never get it again. Overrated and service is poor at best.
