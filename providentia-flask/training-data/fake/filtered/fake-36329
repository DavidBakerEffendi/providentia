UNBELIEVABLE ATTITUDE - STAY AWAY.  We stopped in for a post-dinner drink at around 11:30pm on a saturday night.  Our drinks arrived, and because mine had been mixed very sweetly (with one of the three ingredients clearly dominating the drink), my wife politely asked the bartender to remix it a bit more evenly.  The bartender gave a surreal, unintentionally hilarious response about how she "works at a top restaurant and knows how to make drinks."  We expect to encounter this sort of clownishness when we eat out in another city, but we've rarely experienced it in NYC, and despite having had a decent (B-) meal at Scarpetta last fall, we won't bother with it again.  I'm willing to grant that anyone can be having a bad night, or a bad moment, at their job, but snapping at the customer is a loser move and is completely unacceptable regardless of the circumstances.
