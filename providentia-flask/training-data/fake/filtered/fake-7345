My boyfriend made my Birthday in this place. I thought that it will be so crowded there for romantic dinner for two . It was just perfect we had very good table for two. Food was delicious , and wine was fine. I enjoyed our night. The one thing I didn't like, the way how waitresses were dressed :))!!! Beside that everything was perfect!!!
