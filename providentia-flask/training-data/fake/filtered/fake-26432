This was one of the best meals I've had in a while. My dad and I came here when he was in town on a Friday. You do have to call ahead to get a reservation but its a huge place so you should get a table -- although the restaurant was packed until 10 pm (which is when we left.) We had the escargot and lentil soup for appetizers. It was the best escargot butter sauce I've ever had and the snails themselves were cooked pretty well as well. The lentil soup was good but nothing to write home about (although I've had many lentil soups so I have an extremely high standard for this dish) The entrees were both amazing. The pan seared scallops were honestly the most amazing seafood dish I've ever had. Not only were the scallops cooked to perfection but also the sauce complemented the dish so nicely and added the flavor.   The staff is very friendly and cooperative.  Although it is a high end restaurant, the atmosphere is bustling so it does not seem snobby at all (I was a bit worried about that as it was an expensive french restaurant) Price wise, the dishes are on the higher end, about 25-30 per entree and 10-20 for the appetizers.  But it is completely worth it! Will hopefully come back and try the amazing dessert!
