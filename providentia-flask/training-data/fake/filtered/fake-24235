The only reason I felt unable to give Cafe Lutecia 5 stars was because of the cramped establishment and lack of seating, other than that, the food was fantastic! In total, our group savored the flavors of the Romain sandwich, Goat Cheese & Spinach Quiche, Lobster Bisque soup, etc. My husband proclaimed the Lobster Bisque as "the best I ever had". Again, the ONLY bummer was, due to the cramped space, we were forced to sit outside, although the weather wasn't 100% on our side. We almost had an unfortunate incident when the awning came loose and nearly smacked our friend in the noggin!
