I was taking a trip to the McCarren Park for my soccer game with a couple of friends, when I saw this restaurant nearby- (between Lorimer St & Nassau Ave) called Five Leaves. When I walked by, a scent of ricotta pancakes was in the air, compiled with banana, and a pile of berries. It looks as good as it sounds. I would say the coffee part is a little overpriced but the breakfast is a must. So I decided to try these ricotta pancakes. They came with a mound of honeycomb butter, toppled with berries, and a whole banana. These amazing pancakes filled me up quickly, and the texture was fluffy and soft. I highly recommend this place, just come before noon and you won't have to wait like a half-an hour for a table. I would also have to say that the exterior view is amazing. Also if you get the chance, definitely try the truffle fries. They are crispy and brown on the outside with softness bundled on the inside. And they aren't even that greasy, like McDonald's or any other restaurants'.
