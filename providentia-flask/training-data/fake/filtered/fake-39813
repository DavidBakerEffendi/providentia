WORST ATTITUDE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! After 10 minutes I walked to the store, nobody comes by to say hello or sit me or ask me to wait. I asked the waitress walking by "Can I order now". She pointed me to another waitress, who is serving another customer who came LATER into the restaurant than me......I FOUND A TABLE MYSELF and WAVED to a coming waitress I'm ready to order, who saw me but chose to IGNORE me. I talked to the this waitress and asked for reason of her behavior and expressed my willing to talk to her manager. She said "Go ahead!". Btw, I'm the only Asian in the restaurant. Is there any other reason besides RACIAL DISCRIMINATION to explain their awful attitude?!!!!! Ironically, it is an ASIAN restaurant but only friendly to NON-ASIAN.
