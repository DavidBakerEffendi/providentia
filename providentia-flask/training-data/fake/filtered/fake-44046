Are the new owners or managers TRYING to ruin this former gem? Though festooned with one too many wide screen TVs playing sports for our tastes, this was BY FAR our favorite restaurant on Staten Island, just because of the amazing arugala pizza, as good or better than any in the city (including Otto's, John's, Grimaldi's and Patsy's, etc.). They also had a party special-- a large pie such as the arugala, plus buffalo wings or calamari, and pitcher of beer, for $25 total. Plus, nice attentive (but not suffocating) staff. The pizza is still great, but the prices have doubled in the past month for this and many of the menu items. The special that used to cost $25 is now $50 for the same thing plus a desert. Brunch is $30 FOR ONE PERSON, albeit with 3 free Bud Lights (yay----NOT). While we were there other patrons were also literally laughing at the new menu prices. This is not the sort of place that can support such high prices, not without a serious redecoration, which would alienate much of their existing clientele (decent, well mannered, but not people who will regularly pay $30 per person for an omelette, a cup of coffee and three buds). To top it off, a new manager or host or whatever that big beefy guy is now hovers and stares at the patrons, like he's a CO and this is a prison cafeteria. (If you're reading this, no offense, you're probably a nice guy, just wanting to make sure everyone's happy with their meals, but seriously, you really gotta learn to become much more inconspicuous and not hover and stare, it's disconcerting). Also, the new menus, printed/sponsored by Bud Light? Tacky. Exactly the opposite of what you want to convey when you're doubling your prices. Lastly, I'm not sure if there ARE new owners, or just new managers, or just new policies, but these new prices are a joke. We're not coming back until it changes, nor are most of the people we know.
