Fun atmosphere, pretty good selection of beers.  Food is decent, although it's hard to find something that's not totally greasy.  I've been going there for years and only once can I remember having bad service - but I haven't seen that waitress since then so I guess they must have gotten rid of her once they realized she wasn't doing a good job.  Good for families as long as you leave before it turns over into "bar" mode.  Overall, I'd recommend for a decent, inexpensive, comfortable place to eat!
