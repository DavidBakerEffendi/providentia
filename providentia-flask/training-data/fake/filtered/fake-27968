Finally modern American dining right here in Nutley. This place is beautifully decorated with exposed brick walls and nice lighting, which is key for me in restaurants. Must try: bacon appetizer, steak (any one) will do, and the cheese cake pops dessert. I usually don't write yelp reviews but I really want this place to do well and stay open. This place is one of those restaurants that is trying to do right by it's customers with quality food, a wonderful atmosphere, and friendly service.
