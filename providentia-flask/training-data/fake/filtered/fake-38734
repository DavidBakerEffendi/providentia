Food is consistent there.  It is such a hard place not to like!  We had a similar experience with the bartender as the reviewer Spa Girl S and have never set foot in the bar since.  Maybe now we will give it another try.  The place looks great ( I think it has been remodeled) and feels very much like a French Bistro. Restaurant  week is coming up!
