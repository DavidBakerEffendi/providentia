While I have never eaten here, I would never do so because of many of the menu offerings.  Any eatery that continues to serve dishes associated with gross animal cruelty are not ethically worthy of staying in business.  The current dishes to which I refer are two that contain foie gras, another with skate and finally veal.  I was told they also serve raw horse meat, but thankfully I did not see that on the current menu.  Cruely should not be on any respectable restaurant's menu.
