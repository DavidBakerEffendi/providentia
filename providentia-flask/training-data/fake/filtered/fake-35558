i went here to try the burger and the wings.  i have read many reviews on this place which talk about how good the burger is.  I was hugely disappointed.  The burger was not even average, it was greasy and the garnishment was old and wilted and not fresh at all.   The bun was a bit stale possibly a day old.  All in all i would say the food ingredients are very low qulaity and the preparation is just a notch below a bad diner.  I have no words for the space itself.  I think i would start at disgusting and dirty but that would be an understatement.  Normally i would just walk out of a place that looked like this but i read many good reviews so i tried it.  i will not go back, i should have listened to my instincts.  Bonnies is really nothing special at all and obviously has a loyal following but i cant seem to find why.
