After coming to this restaurant for over 2 years and ordering the same thing, the experience I had will lead me not to come back ever again... This restaurant has no customer service and does not care if your food comes out wrong. I asked for no shrimp and my dish tasted like seafood and nothing else. Do they care at all? No. The answer I got was I'm sorry I will not do anything for you. Don't waste your time or money at this establishment, a complete waste of money!
