There is no shortage of decent pizza places in West Hartford, Backstage joins that list with thin crust pizza and decent salads.  They have a small selection of acceptable domestic bottled beers but nothing on tap.  The patio is the bomb in nice weather.  They sometimes have live music which can be great or a little too loud depending on your mood and company.
