Delicious !!! My wife and I have dinned here multiple times. Whenever, we visit theater program in bloomfield ave, we never miss chance to dine at chatni. This review is based on last weekend visit. Tofu, Navtatna Korma, and Tadka daal was yummy. The spice level was as requested, extrahot. Naan was soft and fresh. It melted in mouth. The winner was momo, white steamed dumpling with filling. We love this. We had good portion to pack home for next day breakfast. Waiter was attentive and filled our water glass multiple time. We look forward to next dinner soon.
