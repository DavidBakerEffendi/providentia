this place is banging! i wasn't sure what i was walking into at first but then i was greeted by a friendly blue haired bartender, with cool tattoos. My friends and I enjoyed the delicious specialty drinks, then we discovered their unique food menu. food was brought out personally by the chef, to our surprise a cute little italian girl. Just when we thought it couldn't get any better the food was amazing especially their wings 20 sauce choices!!! and the bourbon mayo! i will definatly be going back!
