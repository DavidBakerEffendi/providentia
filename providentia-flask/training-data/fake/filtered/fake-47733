ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! My mouth entered heaven. This pizza is hands down the best pizza I ever had in my entire life. I did not expect much Â but seeing all the people lined up outside was ridiculous. I never saw a pizzeria that packed. Inside is a comfy home like setting. The employees were also very friendly. I love it!
