My favorite Restaurnat in New Haven!   Food is always wonderful, as is the service!  It is not cheap, but it is TOTALLY worth every dime!  You will not leave hungry as you can at some high priced eateries.   They are also very generous to a select group of Not-for-profits!  I always recommend them as my number 1 choice for dining in Downtown New Haven!
