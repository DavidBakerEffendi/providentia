I really wanted to love this place based on the reviews but I was pretty disappointed. Here's the scoop in a nut shell: -Great band performing on Thursday nite- best part of the night! -beautiful, cozy, great atmosphere -our apps: beet salad and empanadas were good. -our main courses- the steak sandwich came with stale Luke warm fries and the breaded chicken with fried sweet potatoes was not exciting at all... - service was bad, apps came out, no one asked how they were, main course arrived with empty app plates still on table and no one ever asked us how our main course was....good thing we were busy listening to the band..
