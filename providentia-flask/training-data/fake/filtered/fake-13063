I absolutely love Paprika! Have only gone there for brunch...but OMG is it amazingggg.  Used to live on 14th st and 1st and this was my weekly brunch spot. Now I live in Brooklyn and I still make the extra effort to go there once in a while.  The prix fixe is a great deal for a meal, mimosa/bellini, and coffee/tea even though they've raised the price to $13.50. One Valentines Day I had exceptionally slow service and they gave us our meal for free :-)! This is the place to bring anyone who is visiting NYC because the food is always consistant (LOVE the eggs benedict)!! Only downside is that brunch is now cash only :-/.
