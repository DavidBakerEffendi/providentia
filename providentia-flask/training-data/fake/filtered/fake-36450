this restaurant ruined one hour of my existence.  the food may be good, but the management was dreadful.  new york is reknown for restaurants with fine food and excellent service.  this place meets neither of those bills.  you will have no problem going elsewhere. a restaurant that treats its customers as though they don't need you, is one to where you don't need to go. i never write reviews, so you should immediately get the idea that a random person like you could get so frustrated by the horrible experience that i had at this terrible restaurant.  mind you, the food is sophisticated, but the people who work there are not.   the worst service that I have ever had in new york.   we called ahead to make a reservation, and were told that the restaurant did not take reservations.  when we get there, the hostess asks us if we have a reservation.  ok, so whatever.  the general manager, a woman whose name i did not bother to remember, gave us an estimated wait time of 10 minutes.  so we wait. 10 minutes passes. 20 minutes passes.  30 minutes passes. and 40 minutes passes.   i understand that in new york, at certain places, you will have to wait.  no biggie.  but when i check in to see the status of our table, the general manager cops an attitude and says unapologetically, that she cannot force people from a table.  totally understandable. what is not is her treating her customers as if she did not need them.  she insisted that we have the option of getting off of the waitlist.  this is the general manager speaking.  when i complain, she accuses me of starting off with a bad attitude.  this was not the case, and even if any customer has a bad attitude it should not be matched in kind from the GENERAL MANAGER. i will never go here again.  spare yourself the time.
