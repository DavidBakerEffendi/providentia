I went to this store and I had a tuna wrap with small fries for $6.95 and a free fountain drink. I also had European ketchup. The fries were nice and thick it was crispy on the outer core and smooth on the inner core. The wrap bread was so special and they put great organic greens with tomatoes and tuna with celery. It was very tasty and whenever I'm in old city I'd have to remember to go to this store To,                                                                                                            European Republic
