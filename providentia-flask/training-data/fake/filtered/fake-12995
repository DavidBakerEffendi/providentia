I wouldn't suggest this place to anyone and its because they think there prices are lower that they can be rude to people in general.  I have been to most every Italian place in the city and a lot of restaurants in general.  I live next to Il Corallo and went there once but just hadn't been back as it was just ok.  Nothing special and wasn't impressed at all.  However now i know why friends say not to go there.   I went there last night and had never had anyone in an NYC city restaurant, hard to believe, been so rude at all.  I wouldn't suggest this place to anyone and its because they think there prices are lower that they can be assholes to people in general.  Food honestly was ok/cheap but not worth it in general.  They rush you out of the place as soon as you order. You roder a bottle of wine and expect it to be gone in 10 min. I love to drink and get drunk but not to down a bottle of wine on a date in 20 min and be asked every 2 min if there is anything else.  Worst Italian place in SOHO and in general.  Upset that this place is on the same street as ditch plains. Highly recommend Isodi or Malatesta as good affordable places.
