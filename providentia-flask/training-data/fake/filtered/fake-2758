I would like to give negative 5 stars actually. I've been to Cuban Pete's many times on busy weekend nights but have never experienced such atrocious service like we did last night. Host and manager were obnoxious. We had to wait two hours for a table when they said one and when we asked the host after an hour and a half wait.. The manager said "well she Changed her mind!" The manager should be ashamed of himself. Five of us ordered skirt steak and when the waiter brought it to our table they had no idea whose was whose. Well done? Medium? No. Clue. One steak was so Burnt so we asked for another one and the waiter said you'll have to wait a loooooooonnngggg time for a new one then. No one liked the food last night. It wasn't good like it usually is. I'm so disappointed and will not be going back to Cuban Pete's. I'm traumatized from last nights service. Shame on you!
