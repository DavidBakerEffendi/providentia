Ok so made it here based on all the reviews...great late night spot since my bf and I have crazy wrk schedules. Kinda glad though b/c we made it here at 10:30 on a Wed. and the place is still packed. was kinda dissapointed when the waitress handed us a  menu  had many of the things they were known for omitted. She said it was a limited menu that night because they accommodated a wine party earlier that night.....Nice. If iI knew that I would have came on a different night I guess. I still had some things on the menu that were worth trying -- the sheep milk ricotta, which was like dipping brick fired sliced bread into  whipped buttery cream..yum.  Saccislia pizza was excellent. glad i had that instead of the ouvo which wasnt't available. We then had the chestnut rav which was a good but a lil greazy . the other pasta dish was unmemorable..had there "famous" dsert it was caremei with salt and that amazing ricotta and cookie crunch... goood.
