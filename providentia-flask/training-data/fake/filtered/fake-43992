The Banana Leaf came highly recommended from friends around the area. The food is good, not great, but it is good. The food however does not make up that the weekend environment. We were surrounded by kids that seemed underage drinking like they were at a frat party. They were playing thumper and having chugging contest. At one point the group was chugging straight from the bottle. The staff did nothing to stop this. The staff was also rude about collecting our dishes extremely early. We asked 3 times for our dishes to be left before she eventually ignored us and started cleaning the table. Our party had not even finished eating yet. All-in-all, you can find this style of food at other places in Chinatown Philadelphia, I would recommend going to these other places.
