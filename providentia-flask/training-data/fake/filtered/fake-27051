To say it at the start, Crescent Grill is, without a doubt, a gem.  I believe it easily serves the most high quality, delicious, diverse cuisine in all of Queens.   I have eaten at some of the finest dining establishments in the entire world and can honestly say that Crescent Grill can compete at an elite level.  Chef Shaun Dougherty is a master.  Every dish I or my fellow diners have had has been cooked to absolute perfection and garnished with the most appropriate, locally-produced, savory sides.   I do not say this lightly - CRESCENT GRILL'S NEW YORK STRIP DONE MEDIUM RARE MIGHT BE THE ABSOLUTE BEST STEAK I HAVE CONSUMED IN MY LIFE. As if that were not enough, the Crescent Grill's vibe is completely refreshing.  It is never overcrowded and the management and staff (Daniel Dougherty, the owner, in particular) exquisitely balance genuine, friendly attitudes with the certain seriousness required for nothing-short-of-excellent customer service.   I am so lucky to live down the block, but I cannot encourage people to put in the effort to visit Crescent Grill enough.  It is just a 10 minute walk or so from Queensboro Plaza subway and it is more than worth it.   A lovely benefit of Crescent Grill's location comes in the form of reasonable, dare I say comparatively inexpensive, prices.  I would estimate the restaurant could markup its prices about 1.5x if it were located in Manhattan. Go to Crescent Grill and experience this all for yourself.  Tell them Keira sent you ;)
