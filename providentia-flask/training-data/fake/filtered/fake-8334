Wings were good but at an expense..... Wings only good with the garlic chunks. Mild was terrible. Here is the issue you pay for EACH of these blue cheese, garlic, celery, hot sauce, extra anything! Yes, 40 cents a wing but at what cost? Have anything more than just wings and pay a lot more. Pay $1 EACH wing to go on top of your 40 cents a wing... 4 wings $1.60 plus $4 to go is $5.60. You decide if its worth it. Dive bar, crazy loud, no real dining area.
