I'm a big fan of Thai food and especially Brookside Thai, which has the formula down. They have authentic flavors, and flavor according to taste with respect to spicyness. I have not been disappointed with my experience there, and will return soon. The soups were clear, with very clean flavors, no overly spicy broth, just the right balance of lemograss flavor and thai spices without overstimulating the palette. They also have a good selection of spiciness as far as the green chilis provided, or the red pepper sauce. If you care for the dried red pepper, that's also available. Bottom line, I can't wait to return. I'm from the city, so it is definitely out of the way, but I plan to make an excuse so I can find my way to Brookside again. Wouldn't have thought dirty jerzy would have such good thai. The ambience leaves something to be desired, but it's quite tolerable in it's understatedness. Not a dive, but not quite upscale. This place wins where it counts - for its food.
