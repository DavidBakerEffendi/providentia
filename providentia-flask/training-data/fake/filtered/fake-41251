After reading the previous reviews here, I was stunned with the horrible service I received at Cafe LULUc.  The hostess/waitress (who I believe is one of the owners) was quite rude and completely unaccommodating.  When I complained, I was basically told "too bad, if you don't like it then leave."  As a thank you I was overcharged on my bill.  On top of it, the food was too greasy and made me feel ill for a few days.  Bottom line: avoid at all costs lest you overpay for mediocre food.
