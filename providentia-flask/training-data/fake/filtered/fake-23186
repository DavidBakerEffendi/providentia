My favorite spot, for confort food, We got Lamb in a special peper sauce next to beens and mash potato tasting as home made, dessert is a fresh Tiramisu with a nice Nutela Coffe with chocolate chips on top, giving a nice aroma to the coffe without been too sweet, the staff are very friendly and warm, the dinner with a full sellection on the bar, we find a nice cozy place to eat and enjoy, also the branch I had in there uhmm it taste really good but more important Keeps me going over the day...
