I lived down the street from Entree and had gone there for Restaurant week once and we loved the food and were pleasantly surprised by how good the food was for such a new restaurant.  Then my sister decided to plan my Bridal Shower at this restaurant.  It was the best.  We had the whole restaurant to ourselves, all the staff was extremely accommodating, the food was delish and prix fixe with dessert, a good price, and the bride felt like a queen (I was the bride so it's not hearsay).  Can you get any better than that?
