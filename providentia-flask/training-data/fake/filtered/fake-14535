Went to Legends on a whim after the lunch rush; heading home from work. When I walked-in, it was kinda quiet but that was OK because I joked around with the staff. I ordered a pastrami sandwich and fries which was really good. I received my order in about 10 minutes. Nothing but great things to say about this place. It's located in a good location; away from the "busy" part of the city, service was great and the food was superb. I'm planning on checking-out their breakfast menu soon.
