I will never eat or order from this retuarant again.  The manager's "nephew" who works in the evenings is the rudest person I have ever dealt with.  Several times when ordering in Thai Chef has "forgotten" to include items paid for and then refused to make good on the dishes that were not included.  The service in the restuarant is also rude and slow. Stay away!
