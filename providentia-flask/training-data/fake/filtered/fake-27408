I love them!!!! Amazing fries, lots of sauces!!! After crazy party night when you are still drunk, its a place to go and much on some french fries!!!! its not a place to Â go and sit and have lunch, there are very limited with seating! To be honest they serve only fries, why the f do you need to sit???? Its more fun to hang out outside standing around a little table they have outside with bunch of friends!!! I drive to the city from Brooklyn just to get fries and dips!
