I am a longtime Bubby's fan and we come here monthly. It can be a bit pricey, but the food and service have always been worth it. HOWEVER, we went today for brunch and everything had changed... We were still greeted by our friendly bartender (who makes the best bloody mary's around), but that's where it ended: Once we were seated, we ordered right away (bubby's griddle special for me and eggs benedict for my boyfriend). It took over 45 minutes to get our food, which is unheard of there. Everyone around us had been seated, ate and left and we were still waiting. When they finally brought our food, the eggs in the eggs benedict were hard boiled and we sent it back. My food was cold and worse yet, there was a quarter sized piece of eggshell scrambled into my scrambled eggs. We could barely flag down our waiter for more coffee and when we sent our eggs benedict back for a 2nd time, again WAY overcooked, he was overly rude and refused to talk to us or make eye contact again. We finally asked a busboy for the manager, Carlos, who came over and explained that the head chef had been "moved to another restaurant" by the same owner and that "the new chef is killing me". He was very nice and ordered us a 3rd eggs benedict, which thankfully came back hot and perfectly cooked. Carlos apologized profusely and was very nice, and even comped our meal. Our waiter still refused to talk to us and we left full but let down... Carlos is a gem, and we would consider trying again, but BRING BACK THE OLD CHEF!!!
