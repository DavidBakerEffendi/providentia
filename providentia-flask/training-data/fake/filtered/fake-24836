I was extremely impressed with not only the food but also with the service and decor of Brauhaus Schmitz. I am shocked to see the mixed reviews it is getting, especially since hearing that this is the first restaurant that the young owners have opened. From what I saw everything was running smoothly and I didn't see any of the kinks you usually run into when dinning at a newly opened bar/restaurant. Our waitress was attentive and could explain everything on the menu to us in full detail ( I was not familiar with most of the authentic food listed ). Although it was not too crowded when I was there, I will absolutely be back when there is a larger crowd because the atmosphere is definitely one that I can see being entertaining on a Friday or Saturday night. The set up is comfortable if you are choosing just to drop by for dinner, but the bar and friendly service encourages me to come back for the night life, especially with the extensive beer list. We ordered Â a bunch of smaller dishes because we wanted to try as much as we could and everything that I sampled was delicious, I will definitely be trying one of their entrees on my next visit.
