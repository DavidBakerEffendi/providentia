It's a casual, welcoming place right on the main drag in Hanover.  Informal but upscale, it draws a clientel that clearly has an affection for the place.  The staff knows what they're doing -- they are friendly and efficient.  The decor is attractive and elegant in an old school mode with wooden canoes suspended from the ceiling.   The food is very good -- especially the cassoulet, and the menu changes entrees regularly.  The selection of beers is large.  It's just a block or two down the street from the Dartmouth campus.  I drop in there whenever I'm in Hanover, and I'd recommend it for lunch or dinner to anyone.
