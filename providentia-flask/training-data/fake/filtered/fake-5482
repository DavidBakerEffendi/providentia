Sweet Afton is a great spot. -good beer? check -good burgers? check -pickle martini?- check -creative cocktails and excellent bartenders? double check My only complaints about Sweet Afton is that the menu could have a lighter offering to balance out the delicious, but very heavy, offerings. I am perfectly fine eating their burgers every visit, but do wish there was Something that wasn't fried or cheese oriented.
