I have dined at Stone Hearth 3 times now- we are from Westville and frequent the restaurants there- and I must say it's got some room for improvement.  It's not totally bad but there are a few suggestions they need to heed before we become regulars: 1.  The Staff- many of the wait staff and the bartender seem either socially inept or are feining a snootiness that doesnt sit well with my family or friends.  You dont have to tell me your life story, but dont be a stepford wife (robot) either. 2.  The portions are smallish, but that's fine.  I think the pricing is a bit steeper than it should be for the size and taste of the food. 3. Drink prices arent cheap so dont go there if you intend on having a few w your dinner or 2 of you will be well over $100. 4. The so-called tables for 2 (there are 2 or 3 of them) in the dining area are not suitable for normal sized adults. Very cramped and uncomfortable, especially for the price you're paying.  When i remarked to the waitress about it, she did not offer another table, though many were open. 5. Lastly, the Manager seems nice but in 3 trips there for dinner, he's never come over to see how everything was, etc which to me is a major mistake in a new restaurant. We havent given up yet on Stone Hearth  but we will think twice before bringing other famliy and friends there.
