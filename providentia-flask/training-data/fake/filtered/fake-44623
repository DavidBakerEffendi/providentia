This place is always slammed - have come up 2x without a reservation and the wait is insane.  However, the one time I was able to enjoy a meal, it was outstanding.  Really delicious, great atmosphere.  Wait staff was friendly, if not overwhelmed...bill was not as bad as I expected...the decor is pretty good...all in all a great spot and I will definitely come back again.
