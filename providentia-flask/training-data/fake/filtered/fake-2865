After many mediocre experiences at Cuban Pete's my friends and I decided to give it one last chance for a celebratory dinner.  We made a reservation for a large party on a Wednesday night.  After the first person arrived at 7:30 they sat her with no problem.  From that point on the hostess and management bothered her many times about where the rest of her party was.  Within a few minutes the guests who had already arrived that we needed to give up our table.  After refusing to do so because the entire party was there the manager told us to "get the hell out" and also called us a very inappropriate term.  In a sense I am glad that the management was so rude because we ended up enjoying a very lovely dinner at a nearby restaurant.  In my opinion they should have not sat anyone until the whole party had arrived if this is their policy.  I will never return to Cuban Pete's and suggest you give it thought before trying to plan a dinner there with a large group.
