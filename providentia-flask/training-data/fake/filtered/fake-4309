Based on a recommendation we ate dinner at August on a Wednesday night.  The hostess was accommodating and offer either of the two tables available.   The young waitress spoke so quietly and said nothing other than "ground pepper?", but each time I had to say excuse me? I ordered the artichokes (which were very good) and the halibut, which was the special and came with spinach and beans and rice.  It also came with a cream sauce.  I try to avoid dairy and was bothered that I wasn't told it was included a cream sauce. My partner ordered the calamari which was worse than bland and only contained rings.  The mussels were OK. When the young waitress took our plates, we asked about desserts.  She looked at us like we had asked her a word she never heard in a spelling bee.  In a dazed manner she said cheesecake, um bread pudding, uh ice cream, ...  We said just the check. Our bill came to $65.35.  We put down $80.   The hostess/waitress took the check and asked if we needed change, we said we did.  She brought back a $10 bill, 2 $1 bills and 15 pennies and left it on the table.  Wrong amount (80-65.35=14.65) and if felt insulted, like it was some kind of statement that I shouldn't have asked for my change when she left the 15 pennies.  So we left the $10 and the 15 pennies.  Normally, we tip 20% for excellent service and 15% for average or poor service. I was not about to leave over 20% for this service. Won't be back, will discourage anyone from going.
