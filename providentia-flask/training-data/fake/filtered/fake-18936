Tough times have hit Artichoke. i hadn't been since December 08, and it has changed. Â The artichoke and spinach slice is still good, but not as legendary as it once was. it is alot smaller now-it used to be too big to fit in my microwave! now it fits easily. and the amount of toppings has noticeably decreased. this is fine--the old slice was sort of too big and too decadent--but if i am paying $4, i expect something really special. Also, now they just throw it on a paper plate and in a bag instead of giving you a box. Also, the new system for ordering and paying is much worse than the old way. It's true, these guys are not the friendliest, but who cares!
