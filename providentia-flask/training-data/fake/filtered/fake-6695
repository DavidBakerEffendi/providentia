I visited Olea in mid-October, back when the air was still warm enough in the late morning to sit outside for brunch. Sunday morning brunch, if pushed more toward noon, can involve some waiting for a table. My friend and I were early risers, so we were seated (a little before 11) at one of four outside tables, where we could people watch from the corner of Lafayette and Adelphi Streets. I started with hot apple cider ($4), which wasn't overly sweet (hot cider does not require mounds of sugar!). We split the almond-stuffed, bacon-wrapped dates ($5) for an appetizer. My sister has been making these for years, so when I saw them on the menu, I knew it would be a delicious way to start our meal. It was! For my meal I had the brioche french toast with fruit ($8.50). French toast was perfect: slightly crispy on the outside, airy on the inside, and was served with maple syrup. The fruit was not so perfect: it wasn't fresh and consisted of pineapple, two pieces of melon, and one grape. Bad fruit day? The service was great and our food came extremely fast. Tapas is served later in the day. Owners also have three other restaurants in Brooklyn (Pequena, Moe's Bar, and Maggie Brown). I look forward to visiting when I return to New York!
