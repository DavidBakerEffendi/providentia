(for Philly).  I have lived here for two years and honestly, no complaints.  Doormen are awesome, management is pretty good (new manager now so we'll see what's up), excellent facilities, and fantastic location. In terms of the yellow water, dude - that's probably your pipes; get them cleaned and fixed.  I've been here two years and have never had yellow water. Condo fees are expensive, but on a sq/ft basis, it's not bad compared to Rittenhouse 10, 1706, the Ritz, etc.  But you pretty much get the best of city living in Philly..
