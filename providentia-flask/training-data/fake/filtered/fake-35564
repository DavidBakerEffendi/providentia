I went to Bonnie's on Saturday night for a good-old burger and fries.   Some parts of the meal were excellent, others were so-so.  My cheeseburger was cooked medium with a nice char outside, but was still somehow dry.  Liberal application of ketchup and chipolte mayo fixed that, though.  The mayo is great, by the way.  Put it on everything! The fries were good.  Nice and crispy, not too salty, and you are served a good sized portion of them. The real standout of my meal was the cup of vegetarian chili that I got with my burger.  I am certainly no vegetarian, but their chili made me not care that there was no meat in it.  It was very, very good.  If I go back to Bonnie's, it would be for their chili. The service was sub-par.  I ordered bacon on my cheeseburger, but that never happened.  I don't know if the waited heard me or not (the place is small and loud on a Saturday night), or if it was just missed by the cook.  It seemed that we were a bother to the waiter upon entering the restaurant, which helped add to the feeling of being rushed. If you go, do NOT sit in the small table near the bar.  Everybody needs to pass by you on the way to either end of the restaurant, and I was bumped into about a half-dozen times while I was there, not to mention bumping into other people while trying to leave. Good: Chipotle mayo & vegetarian chili Bad: Cramped quarters, poor service
