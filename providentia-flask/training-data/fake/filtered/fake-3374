I'm writing this review after about 8 or so visits to Pok Pok (I live in the neighborhood). The first several times I was floored by the flavors and how interesting and authentic the dishes were. And the atmosphere was fun, service good. Waiting never an issue, as I would put in my name and then wait at my place for a call. The last few times I have come to rethink my affection for this place, especially when I get the check. The restaurant is starting to seem more and more like a processing plant. You get shepherded to the most ridiculously undersized, cramped tables, elbow-to-elbow with annoying hipsters wearing tank tops so their underarm hair is in your face while you eat. The expeditors (hosts?) wear doofy little headsets like they're coordinating the moon landing or something. Â At first the service is really good, but then you realize it's because they want you to order, eat, and get the hell out so they can fill the table again. I get it, you're a business trying to generate revenue, but when I'm paying $100 for dinner I don't want to feel like I'm at some deli or fast food place. The last time I went on a Saturday at 5, which was a huge mistake because like NYC cabs, these guys do a shift change, and the service vanishes. And really do the prices really need to be so sky-high for everything? You can't even get a draft beer for less than $6, which for this neighborhood is too high. If the service improved and the prices were reduced (ha, yeah right), this would be an easy 5 stars.
