Blah...Exterior is new, interior is updated, but that's it for "positives".  I thought the food was just "OK".....  Service:  BAD -- I sat at the counter for nearly 5 minutes, watching 3 waitresses standing around gossiping and complaining about their coworkers until I could not takes it anymore and I finally interrupted them and asked for a cup of coffee.....my question was answered by "Didn't she help you yet?....I'll her her for you...".  NO TEAMWORK. BAD SERVICE. I had to ask for everything...every coffee refill...a missing napkin....water....what a dreadful place.  My meal was: 2 eggs, 2 sausage links, toast and coffee = $9.91 total.  After today's experience, I don't  think I'll be back anytime soon.
