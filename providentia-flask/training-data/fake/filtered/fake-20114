We've driven by here a few times and said we should stop, but we never did until today.  I wish we had done it sooner because the food was excellent.  It's authentic style Mexican and not a "Tex-Mex" type of place. The prices are moderate, but the portions are large.  The meal started with fresh tortilla chips and salsa, along with a tasty bean dip. I was looking for a chicken burrito/cheese enchilada combo, which wasn't  on the menu, so the friendly waiter substituted a couple things to get exactly what I wanted. It was delicious! My wife had a deluxe chicken burrito, and my son had 2 chicken enchiladas, which he quickly devoured.   I'm not sure why, but our food seemed to take a long time, and a couple who arrived after us completed their whole meal and left before we got our food. I'm guessing something went wrong in the kitchen, and they held all of our meals until it was fixed. The service was friendly and helpful, and the wait staff kept coming over to make sure our drinks were full and everything was to our liking.  We will definitely be back.
