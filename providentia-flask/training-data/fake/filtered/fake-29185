Best sandwiches EVER! Without a doubt an authentic feeling when stepping in and the staff is extra friendly and attentive. Their cold cuts are super fresh and never slimy and I always rave about how they have the best balsamic vinaigrette I've ever had. My co-workers and I all agree that this is definitely at the top of our list for local delis.
