Very cool place, lots of locals.  It's true that you have to fend for yourself a bit at this place to get some attention (ahhh, there's a list(!) for sitting at the bar - information i could have used sooner, but I wouldn't have met as many people ...).  The food was great - i had the warm mushroom salad and an amazing pork chop, which was a huge portion, perfectly cooked.  Others at the bar were following my leader on this one ...  Totally great place for flying solo - not full of singles, but a friendly crowd.
