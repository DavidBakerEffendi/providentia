If I could give a no star review, I would.  I have ordered from this restaurant and many other garces group restaurants through diningin and at the locations.  Tonight, unbelievable!  Ordered our meal and received a call from Diningin stating that restaurant no longer wanted to do business with them so our order, which they had for over an hour was not being fulfilled.  We were left hungry and wondering why Rosa Blanca would not alert Diningin in advance that they would not honor their orders.  Extremely unprofessional and, quite frankly, RUDE.  Will be some time before I give Garces another shot.  Growing to fast to control branding!  Moral: you cannot unring a bell!
