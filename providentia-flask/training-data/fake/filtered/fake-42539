Went in between lunch and dinner- for an interim menu. 4 different hostesses at front were indifferent about menu- had to ask to see one. Then told us we could be seated at bar area for interim menu. Upon seating we were asked to move because they were setting up for dinner. We left because not only were hostesses rude, they have a staff during interim time that seems to be standng around and can't accomodate. Overall reminded me of a tired old ship with stale smelling carpeting.
