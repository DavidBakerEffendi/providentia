Ippudo is cool.  I've walked by it a bunch of times before I was actually able to try it out because I love ramen.  And in case you need me to qualify how much l love ramen, I've been known to beeline to ramen shops in the middle of a sweltering and humid Tokyo summer. Ippudo is a busy and bustling place.  There is a wait but there's also a bar right by the entrance so you can have a few drinks before being seated.   The ramen is good (not great) but the interiors are cool.  Ippudo feels more like a hip bar that happens to serve ramen instead of a proper ramen house.  An authentic ramen shop would be a small space specializing in one thing -- ramen.   More than 3/4 or the staff weren't even Japanese which isn't a deal breaker but the authenticity of a Japanese restaurant has more cred when you see an older Japanese man behind the counter who has been making (and perfecting) his ramen broth over a few decades. I love a ramen house where the owner will cook one (or a few) pots of broth for the entire day and when that's finished he closes shop for the day.  Instead I see NYU kids serving up bowls of soup in a trendy restaurant. Is the food good?  Yes.  Does it feel authentic?  Not so much.  Would I go back.  Absolutely but  Ippudo is a place where you want to go when you don't want to trek all the way uptown to Totto Ramen.  Ippudo is a place where you want to go when you've got a ramen craving but you want to take someone to "a nice/trendy place." The communal style seating is cool.  The crowd is hip.  The interiors are stylish and in a very contemporary Japanese way.  Ippudo is a popular spot so my 3 stars isn't probably going to have much affect on it's street cred.  If you're downtown and on the east side with a craving for ramen -- hands down go to Ippudo.
