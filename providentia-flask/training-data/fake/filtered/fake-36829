This place has been a near weekly order for us for the past several months. The food is still great but the delivery service has gotten so bad that we are done. The final straw was this evening when we had to call 3 times asking about the status of our order, the last call being 1 1/2 hrs after the order was placed. We were told each time that the delivery person was on his way. We live less than 5 mins from the restaurant! It became apparent the order was never processed. Really unfortunate, we enjoy the food but will not waste our time anymore. There are plenty of other great restaurants in the area
