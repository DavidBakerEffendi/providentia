A beautiful space with a relaxed, intimate atmosphere and incredible food! Fresh, local ingredients and interesting combinations of flavors. I came for dinner with a large group and everyone's dishes were delicious! Particularly recommend the cheese platter, pickles, chicken, and mussels! A wonderful addition to the neighborhood.
