This is the first time I have ever taken the time to write a review about any restaurant.  The food was ok.  The first time I ordered delivery the delivery man overcharged me and included his tip in without asking and was very short with me.  The second time I ordered the lady who answered the phone was extreamly rude and so unprofessional.  Everytime I asked a question, she cut me off midsentance. I cant see paying anyone to treat you like that.  Never again.
