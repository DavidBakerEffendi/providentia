I have been here many times and the food is great. The new chef has reinvented the menu while still keeping some old favorites (the amazing chicken sandwich). The appetizers and salads add something extra to this pub and transform it from a guy hang out to someplace I can bring my girlfriend to. Overall everything at this place is good and I find myself getting something different every time and am never disappointed. Â The drinks are also fun and exciting, I especially like the beer sampler as it gives me a chance to try a variety without getting too drunk.
