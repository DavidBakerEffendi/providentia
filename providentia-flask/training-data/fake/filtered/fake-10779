Just got back from BBP. Couldnt wait to try it. Will NEVER eat there again. Go there at 11:10, but still waited 40 minutes to order. One person behind the counter. I ordered the Philly burger, fries, onion rings and milkshake because I wanted to at least try everything. The milkshake was in this tiny little glass and served before anything else. For $5, Â it was fair at best. The burger came out extremely rare instead of medium. The onions and peppers on it were nothing to write home about and the sauces on the table were crap. I like mayo on my burger but there was nothing even remotely close to that (although I was told after the fact that I could have ordered that when I put in the order.) The Bobby Flay burger sauce was crap. The fries were broken into tiny little one-ince pieces instead of a decent dipping size. The whole food experience was EXTREMELY disappointing and way overpriced. Enter at your own risk!!!!
