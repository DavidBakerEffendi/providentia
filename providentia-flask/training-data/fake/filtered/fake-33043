We took over the restaurant for my Venezuelan  husbands'  70th birthday party. Everything was amazing,  food, ambiance and service . Carmine, the owner, was on top everything,   The delicious food did not stop coming all evening. She was a pleasure to  work with . Hector, our waiter was also wonderful.  Easy to work with and very accommodating The sangria was a big hit and they carry Polar beer. All of our guests are now  big fans of Venezuelan food.
