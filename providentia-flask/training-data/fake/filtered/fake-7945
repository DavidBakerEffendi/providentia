I was staying in the hotel across the street from here and wasn't really down to trek around downtown Hartford late at night, alone and in the freezing polar vortex. The hotel recommended eating here so I went for it. I sat at the bar and the bartender was GREAT (her name's Jordan)! Anyways she helped me pick a beer and chatted with me for a while - she's an absolute gem and really made my night.  I got the sausage and broccolini rabe and it was alright, not really what I was expecting. I probably wouldn't order it again but other dishes on the menu looked awesome - I was trying to be "healthy" after feeling gross from flying all day.   Overall rating of 4 stars - lost one star bc I wasn't totally feeling the food
