Mediocre chicken sandwich The server told me that the chicken is marinated in tabasco and buttermilk Yuk! The marinade drowns out the flavor of the chicken. The biscuit was soft but needed a tad more butter and salt; the gravy, likewise. The crunchy, cooked purple cabbage was the tastiest part of the sandwich.  Makes me wonder why there are so many reviewers raving about this sandwich. I surmise that the reviewers come from homes where fried chicken is not a specialty.  My parents and grandparents were from Harlem, where fried chicken is King. The space inside is narrow and has one bar and a table to sit.  The place is suited for take out. However, I will not come here again.   It is not worth the time or money
