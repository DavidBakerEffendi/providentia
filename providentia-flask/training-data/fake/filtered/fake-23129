My Girlfriend Made Reservations For Us @ 8:30pm 2/13/12. We Called In Advance To Tell Them We Were Running Late About 10min, They Told Us No Problem. We Arrived & They Gave Us A Great Table By The Window. The Service Was Great, The Food Was Great, And It Definitely Was Not A Wallet Breaker.They Were Not Very Busy During Our Visit So That Probably Factored In On My Pleasant Experience With This Restaurant It Was Not Loud At All. I Would Recommend To Anybody That Visited The City Or Just Wanted A Night Out On The Town As Me And My Girlfriend Did For Our Pre-Valentines Day Dinner.
