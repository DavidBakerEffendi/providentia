Visiting New York last fall we loved Bubby's and went three times for breakfast.  This year it was very mediocre.  The bacon that used to be fabulous was so-so.  Scrambled eggs were under cooked for my liking.  It's cash only,and when the server brought our change, he shorted us three dollars.  He corrected his 'mistake' and then brought us correct dollar change, but neglected the 65 cents.  Seems Bubby rounds way up, in their favor.  Is this legal?  I'm finding a new breakfast place.
