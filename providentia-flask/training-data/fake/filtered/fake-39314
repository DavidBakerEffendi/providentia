My husband and I have been living in Bella Vista for a while and have been meaning to venture into Ba Le for some time. A mutual craving for banh mi finally brought us there today for lunch, and we weren't disappointed. We walked in to find a lively atmosphere filled with all sorts of goodies -- from hot food to a wide assortment of snacks and takeaway foods, as well as and desserts sold by the cup in a back refrigerator. We ordered the grilled pork (#2 on the menu) and shredded pork (#9) banh mi, and also tried the fried bananas for dessert. The fresh and flaky bread, the pickled vegetables, the healthy dose of cilantro, and slices of jalepeno came together beautifully. Of the meat choices, I have to say #2 was much more to my liking than #9; the grilled pork was full of favor, whereas #2 seemed to be more like cut strips than proper shredded pork (like the kind you'd get in a BBQ sandwich) and seemed to lack flavor. The fried bananas were covered in a thick, crispy dough, making them into a super rich treat. We'll definitely be going back to try more banh mi varieties and other Vietnamese treats!
