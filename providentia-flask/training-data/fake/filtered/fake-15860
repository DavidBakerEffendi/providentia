2 months ago we stoped at the Junior's for a late breakfast, before seeing a show, and had a delicious breakfast, and good service. At 10AM on a Sunday, it was not crowded, and we sat outside. Our waiter was very attentive. They don't have a kid's menu, but one child just wanted side orders for her meal. The other one only wanted one egg, which is only offered as an add-on to an entree, but they considered an omelet an entree, so they just added it to an adult order, and she got the egg. We shared one piece of cheesecake for dessert, and it was wonderful. Will come back next time!
