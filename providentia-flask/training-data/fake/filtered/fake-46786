After $110.00 of take out from here tonight I think I'm qualified to rate this place. I have to disagree withother other reviews. The food is nothing to brag about. I take review very seriously and critically bc others count on opinion. When someone says hands down or best kept secret or to die for they shud reallymean it. I am a food and rest. Junkie and yhat goes for fast food as well. So here we go: soups very good. Eggs rolls good. Panfried wontons rubbery not crispy. Seasame chic w/ white meat rubbery not to much flavor. Chic & broc very good with great flavor. Pepper steak and onion good flavor but quality of meat cud have been better..shredded pork and string beans stunk.  far far far from what shredded actually means. Boneless spare rib tips stunk too extremely dry. Pork fried rice and nooble very dark in color,oily. Over all this place is ok. I wudnt order from again but continue my quest. My favorite is chengd kitchen in woodbridge but they dont take credit cards so I relied on yelp for help.  I hope this helps.. even for fast food this place is seriously just average.
