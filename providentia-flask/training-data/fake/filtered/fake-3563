Don't waste your time. After our visit, I shake my head every time I see a wait here. The space is quaint and the service is good enough... but the food is sub-standard. Â Dry, tasteless, over-cooked. Think the turkey in Christmas Vacation. Do yourself a favor... go a block down Court St to Pompette instead!
