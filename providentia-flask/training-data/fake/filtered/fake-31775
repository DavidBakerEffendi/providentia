I have given this place three tries and today they struck out.  I ate at the bar and was not too impressed by the bartender eating behind the bar as this is a definite NO NO!  Beyond the unsanitary server,  I ordered a Medium Rare burger that had to be sent back twice!  The bartender gave me 50% off a burger that I would not eat after 2 failures.  I should also mention I was one of about 8 customers in the whole place...not tables, but people.  I will never go back and I have given them more than enough chances to not screw up a simple order. Get out of town McGilllicuddy's!
