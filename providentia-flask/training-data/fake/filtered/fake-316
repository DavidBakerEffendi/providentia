Most people who live in and around South Philadelphia don't get cheese steaks from here.  It's for the out of townies who don't know better.  I would rather walk down to underdog's and get two hot dogs, fries and a drink for under $10, rather than paying almost $10 for this lousy steak.  Oh, and the people that work there suck too.
