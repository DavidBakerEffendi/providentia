Oxcart is great place to eat or just have a drink.  Chefs have creative flair.  House salad wit walnuts apple slices cinnamon and tangy house dressing. Everything is tasty.   The burgers are real,  fries area de from  even ketchup is house made.   If you order the wings,be  careful with the super hot they are really hot and I like spicy food.  Deserts are large and pies have homemade flavor. Staff is young so music is always cool two flat screens keep u posted on the games.
