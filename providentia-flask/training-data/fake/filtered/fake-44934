Poor service with a slightly bad attitude. I live in Philly and eat out a lot. I just happened to be at a seminar next to this restaurant. I went for lunch. I ordered one appetizer and one flatbread. The hostess was polite. The server didn't seem like she wanted to be there. She wasn't rude to me, but she was condescending and obvious about her feelings about being there. I asked for a soda (I wasn't in the mood for a shake). She rolled her eyes - rolled them - and pointed behind me and told me, "Sweeties, this is all we have." I turned around to see a 2ft. x 6ft. soda cooler - barely stocked - that was situated behind a table. Of course, I didn't notice it when I sat down; it wasn't obvious and the menu suggested a lot more of a selection. The server rushed me out as well. I began to ask her for more napkins and she cut me off and said, "Oh, you're finished? Let me get your check." I had to tell he no and that I really just needed a napkin. The food was okay. It seems like it would be different, and it kind-of is. But, I could order most of the protein from the menu from any India restaurant. I did not have the opportunity to try a smoothie, but I don't see myself trying this place again.
