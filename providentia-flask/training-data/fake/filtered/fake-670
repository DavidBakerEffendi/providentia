i was soooo excited to try Amada. after 6 years living in Philly I had been hearing its praises over and over again. We had to make reservations over a month in advance to get the time slot we wanted. so, maybe it was my high expectations that caused the meal to fall short, but anyway... we arrived on time and our table wasn't ready so we sat in the bar for about 20 minutes. no problem it was a friday night, totally understandable. the sangria we drank at the bar was delish and the bartender was AMAZING. FIVE STARS for her! she was lightning fast, made delicious drinks, and had a huge smile even with a million people trying to get her attention. I wish I got her name. Once we got to the table is when the trouble began. Our server was knowledgeable, but kind of bored-seeming and even seemed a little irritated when my dad had to take out his reading glasses and look closely at the drinks menu before ordering a beer. we got the tasting menu and most of the food was solid but nothing spectacular. the grilled calamari was cold and rubbery, the mussels dish was mostly broth. the worst part of the meal was that they rushed us through the whole thing. servers were trying to clear our plates before we were finished with a course and rushing to put down the next course. it's great that your restaurant is so popular that you are packed to the gills on a Friday night, but don't take so many reservations if you have to rush folks through their meals. I probably won't be going back to Amada, but I would still like to try the other JG restaurants and hopefully they have a more laid back vibe.
