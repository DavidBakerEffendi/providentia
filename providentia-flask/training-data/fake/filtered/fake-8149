This is a kinda cute place, and it offers decent tapas for fair prices. I liked the corn cake with the mushrooms, but the ceviche we couldn't finish. It didn't taste fresh.   Still, at half prices it wasn't a big loss.   Mojitos were on the average side, but the atmosphere was lively.  Lots of free chips take the edge off.
