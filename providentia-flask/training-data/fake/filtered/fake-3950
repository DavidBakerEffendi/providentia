I went to Get fresh for the daily brunch today.  The brunch every day concept is a good idea for the neighborhood. and the place seemed to have a health, clean, diverse food range vibe. At the first table we chose the smell of bleach spilled out of the service station not so wetting to our appetite, and it would return to our second table later. We found out as we tried to order that they did not have squash. That made for no soup option and made the only salad on the menu, by the waitress's admission, just apples and vinaigrette! for $9. From there we ordered an egg sandwich and heuvos rancheros and a side of "winter greens."  several minutes later we found out they did not have greens either.  That left mushrooms as about the only vegetable on the menu, which are mushrooms really a vegetable? When our food came the real disappointment set in... The huevos rancheros which cost $11 consisted of 2 tortillas, 2 fried eggs, a handful of beans, and a spoon full of salsa nothing really "fresh" about it since it did not contain and vegetables at all.  just in case that sounds significant it was easily eaten with five fork full's.  The egg sandwich while not as highly priced was just 2 eggs, 2 pieces of toast and some frisee on the side.  The quality of the food was something you could find at a bagel shop of bodega for 25% of the cost. While getting the bill corrected for items they did not have but still charged us for, we decided we would not be returning here.  Then to cap it all off as we left (and admittedly not their own fault) a guy came running loudly espousing about the two goats he had for them.  Everyone seemed to go into an immediate panic.  looking into the kitchen during this I saw that they were not even cooking with gas in the back but single electric burner. In a neighborhood lacking in lunch spots but high in quality restraunts this was a big disappointment that does not warrant another visit.
