I've been to this restaurant a few times.  On the whole, I've had excellent food and service to date.  It is a little pricier, but you're definitely paying for ambiance too.  If you're on a date, this place could certainly qualify as a quiet, romantic setting, especially during the dinner period.  On to the food...the very first time I came here, I ordered a curry dish with shrimp.  It was more than a tad sweet, but I've ordered this dish multiple times and every other instance was just right.  Additionally, they ask you how spicy you like your dish.  Originally the rating was up to 4, but I asked for a 5.  From someone that's used to eating spicy food, a 5 is very, very spicy.  It turn out that 4 stars was just right for me.  Trial and error.  My wife and I agree that food is fantastic here and it's really the only decent Thai restaurant in the area.  You won't go wrong.
