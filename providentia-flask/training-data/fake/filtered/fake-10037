Perhaps we had the same host as Jamie T from Clifton NJ. I will never spend my time or money here. Three of us were going to go there for dinner the night of Feb. 4, 2010. We had just put our name on the list at Mary's Fish Camp (half a block away), but they had a long wait, so we wandered up the street to Extra Virgin. Upon entering we asked about a table for three. The host said right this way. I turned to my friends and said, go ahead and sit and I will be right back, I just want to let the other restaurant know that we are not waiting and to take our name off the list. After all, it is the polite thing to do. The host then said "so you are not all here?" I told him that yes we are all here, but that I just wanted to go remove our name from the other list. As I left and removed our name and was heading back to Extra Virgin, my friends came out and said that he refused to seat them at the table until I returned, that he ignored their request to sit and was rude. So we decided to put our name back on the list at Mary's, which was worth the wait. We also proceeded to tell the staff at Mary's what had happened and that we were grateful for their hospitality. I managed a popular restaurant in the West Village for many years, and we would never allow that type of rude behavior in our establishment. The host at Extra Virgin should be ashamed of himself, for not appreciating the etiquette and consideration one of their patrons was willing to show to another restaurant. We certainly would have shown him the same, but now we do not have to worry about it, as we will NEVER make an attempt to dine there. I wish everyone else a better experience.
