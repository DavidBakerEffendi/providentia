I went there last week for a graduation dinner with the family in tow. Getting seated wasn't a problem, service was great and the chef even made conversation with my mom while she waited in line for the bathroom. Since I wasn't paying, we ordered pretty much everything on the menu (even if I was, it would still have been pretty cheap), and I remember the sliders and the pork belly being damn good. Even the pseudo kosher member of my family was able to enjoy themselves with enough options there. I'm tempted to give it 5 stars, but gotta hold back. Either way, highly recommended, definitely a welcome addition to the neighborhood and I'll be returning very shortly.
