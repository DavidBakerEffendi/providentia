Pretentious. Overpriced. A staff who thinks they are God's gift to Brooklyn. The pizza may be decent, but it's NOT worth the time you have to wait and the time you have to waste putting up with the unbelievably pretentious staff. Roberta's is the cool kid at school who knows they're cool, so they feel like they can treat you and friends who just want pizza, like shit. After waiting nearly an hour and a half for a table, we finally were seated. Mind you, the host was very professional in quoting a time. It was what we expected and killed time in their outdoor garden thing. We sat at a communal style table which was quaint and understandable for a place as busy and packed as this. Shockingly, the trouble began once we were seated. We don't remember our waitress's name...started with a T or something...she is tall, cocaine-thin with short hair. She thought she was America's next top model or something, cause damn did she have attitude! It took over half an hour to get someone to bring us another damn bottle of water, probably because our cocaine-addict waitress was too busy flirting with every male staff to see who she could go home with that night over the importance of whether or not our thirsts were quenched. Not to mention, there wasn't a manager in sight for us to complain to. I think it might have been some asshole with a 1970s porn 'stache. Who really knows? It was absolute chaos. I work in the service industry and while their pizza is decent, it is not a solid enough excuse for every staff member from waiter to manager to act like jaded hipsters. Some advice to Roberta's staff: When you're in your mid-30s and still acting like life is so ironic...it's not cool anymore. Grow up and build a grown up restaurant, please.
