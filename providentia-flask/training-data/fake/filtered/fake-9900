One day I was craving mango sticky rice, so I Googled Thai places in Philly that had it and this was the first to show up.  My aunt, uncle, and I headed there for a late lunch; unfortunately, we had gotten there 10 minutes before their afternoon closing time.  I expected to be turned away, but instead the sweet waitress ushered us in and told us that of course we could still eat.  She handed us their special lunch menu, which was unfortunately restricted to an appetizer soup and a lunch entree; no mango sticky rice.  My aunt urged me to ask anyway, so I did.  To my surprise, the waitress said that making it would be no problem at all.   The Tom Yum soup was spicy and delicious.  The Pad Thai tasted authentic.  And the mango sticky rice?  The best I've ever had. This place is amazing.  Accommodating, delicious, beautiful... what more could you ask for?
