I went into the Spotted Pig having heard rave reviews.  I came out feeling like my rights as a patron had been taken away from me. First of all, the only thing mildly affordable on the menu is the burger for $17.  Everything else, and I mean everything outside of appetizers, was above $25.  The beer selection was good, but, pints started at $8.  A local Five Points beer was priced at $10.  $10 for a LOCAL beer!!! I can find the same beer for half the price at most bars.  No excuse. When I received the burger, which did look delicious with it's gourmet meat patty and rich blue cheese and hefty amount of shoe-string fries, I noticed there were no condiments other than ketchup and mustard.  I asked my server for lettuce and tomato, which he promptly refused.  I ask why -- did they not have lettuce and tomato in the kitchen?  No.  The chef apparently refuses to offer anything with the burger except for ketchup and mustard.  No amount of pleading could get the server to bring me out simple lettuce and tomato.  In fact, what he did tell me was that I could order a salad (!) if I wanted lettuce and tomato.  I did enjoy the burger, but, yes, it would have been much better with lettuce and tomato.  The chef's arrogant attitude about how his food should be enjoyed has gotten completely out of hand.  This kind of pure disregard for what the customer desires has become more and more commonplace in New York City's trendy restaurants. I do not recommend this place unless, (1) you have a lot of money and don't mind spending it, (2) you don't mind waiting close to an hour for a table, and (3) you don't mind bringing your own condiments (BYOC) as they will not give you any.
