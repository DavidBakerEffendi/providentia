Celebrated my sisters birthday here for brunch and It was insanely great. We had a party of ten and from making the reservation smoothly to leaving everything in between was awesome. We did the Family Style Pre-Fixe. Sliders, Pancakes, French toast also had the Lobster and Benny. Food gets 5 stars! Service was just as on point as the food. Service also gets 5 stars! Cant wait to come here for dinner.
