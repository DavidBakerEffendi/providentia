Two words: Family Jewels. The Family Jewels Pizza is one of the better pizzas I've had in my life, fresh with a thin, chewy crust. The hipster atmosphere is fun but not overwhelming or pretentious, and I would definitely repeat order the Romaine Salad. A lot of people complain that the wait is long, but on a Wednesday night at 6:00, I had no problem getting in and getting a pizza slapped down in front of me in under half an hour. Highly recommended/
