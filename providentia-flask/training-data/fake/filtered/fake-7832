Try the off-Menu "Amber Roll:" shrimp tempura wrapped in Nori with tuna and avocado on top. The Miso and the spicy tuna rolls were great. The Edamame was overcooked, though. A nice selection of cocktails, vegetarian items and sakes. I had an unfiltered, nigori sake with the rolls which was a great pairing. The sharing plates were greasy. The server took them away as soon as she realized they weren't clean. This could have dissuaded someone else from even ordering, as cleanliness in a restaurant that prepares raw food is paramount! Â I'm glad we stayed, though. It was excellent. Just one more thing. They should consider double glazing for their windows. It was freezing and I was wearing a fleece lined hoody!
