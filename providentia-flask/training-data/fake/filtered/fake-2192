What a disappointment the Americana has become.  I used to eat there at least weekly several years ago, and now I seldom the place.  I hate going to a place and feeling ripped off when I leave.  That didn't used to be the case.  $11 for a mediocre burger and a dozen fries in a small cup just doesn't cut it.  I'm sure I'm not the only one.  There used to be a wait at the door.... Haven't seen that in a while.
