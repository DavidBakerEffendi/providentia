ok, let me say that I have been here a few times a while back and the food has always been good, but I just had to write this because of the recent service that I got.  I went in the other day and I guess it was pretty early.....I didn't notice any signs that they were closed for dinner setup and assumed that I could get a table, So we went in and then just waited.  I thought it was great, I stayed at the front waiting to be seated and everyone just looked at me and pretended I wasn't there.  Two,  what seemed to be bartenders to my immediate left at the bar, chit chatting away and a few staff all the way at the end, appeared to be counting their $$$.  Anyway, I left pretty disappointed.  You would think someone would say......"we're sorry, but we're closed until 6 for dinner setup" or something. I guess they just had such a successful run they just don't care. This is what happens when a restaurant is just making too much money.......must be a nice luxury to have!!!!!
