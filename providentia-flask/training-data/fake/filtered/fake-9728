Owner/Manager in denial? I've been to this restaurant a hand full of times. It has always been good to very good. But things do happen. For instance, my wife went with her girlfriends one night and brought home a dinner for me. I have done this before at the Mill. It was a seafood entree' and it was pretty good as usual. I am also a chef/past restaurant owner/ Manager/ Sous Chef, etc... I know how and what it takes to get sick from food/food poisoning. I got sick late that night from the dish from "The Mill on the River" I called to give them a heads up about what I had eaten and what it did to me. I wanted nothing more then to tell them. I left my name and number and the "?"OWNER called me back and actually argued with me and tried to tell me that I did not get sick from their food. I beg to differ!! I did get sick on "The Mill on the River's" FOOD. It's too bad that they wouldn't listen. So I suggest that if you are going to this restaurant in the future, that you do prepare yourself for food sickness, ie; look it up online and know what to do for yourself just in case you too get sick on the FOOD at the "MILL ON THE RIVER" restaurant. I and my wife and friends will not return to this restaurant because now we can not trust that their food is being prepared correctly. With you or us in mind. Be very careful people!!
