Sam's Morning Glory Diner has become one of my favorite brunch places in Philadelphia. The restaurant itself is tiny, so come prepared to wait for a table. Despite the crowds swarming the side patio, there is actually pretty quick turnover of tables. Getting seated as a couple can take about half an hour on a busy morning; if you go with a group of 3 or more be prepared to wait longer. Sitting at the counter can shorten the wait, and you get to watch the food being prepared. In the winter, there is a heater to help keep people warm. Perhaps the most surprising thing is the friendliness of the waitstaff. Many places with long lines have a "take it or leave it" mentality and can have brusque service. Not Morning Glory. The people calling out names at the door are happy to answer your questions regarding your current position on the list. The servers inside are super friendly and prompt without making you feel like they are rushing you to leave. Service is quick, but your food won't be whisked away while you are still eating. The food is excellent. I don't eat eggs, but I've heard good things about their egg dishes. The biscuits are amazing (eat them with the jam found on every table). The pancakes are thick and fluffy. Hot beverages are good and served in cool metal mugs. Servings are large, so either share or be prepared to bring home leftovers. Prices are reasonable, especially considering the quantity of food you get. There are some creative daily specials, but don't come expecting fancy gourmet brunch fare. They do the basics and they do them well.
