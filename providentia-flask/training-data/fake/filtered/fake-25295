Welcome back Mundo!  I was delighted to hear they are open again & I was looking forward to see what they've created. Menu was very similar to their old one with some favorite dishes available (red sonja, carrot dip, veggie wrap, etc) but I was actually hoping for a food more options. The other reason for only 4 stars is the portion sizes vary between tapas style & entrée and it's not very clear on the menu.  I loved everything we ordered but we needed to order side dishes to supplement.   Decor, Location,  Service...5 STARS! I will be back & I'm bringing friends to ensure they stay around for a long time! I truly wish Willy & the gang continued success as they aspire to give the neighborhood what it is lacking. Keep your eyes out for new dance nights for their large downstairs space!
