My god.  This place.  I don't really know how to elaborate on those first four words.  I went here with my girlfriend back in December.  It was our first date and I wanted to pretend I was a big shot for the night.  This story's made better by the fact that she was well aware I was not and am not loaded.  (But I will be...)   Anyway, the story: It's pouring rain and we get into the restaurant.  The girls behind the counter see me looking like a wet dog since I let my girlfriend have the whole umbrella, and they hand me some towels to dry off with.  Awesome.  But then, even with reservations, there's a 20 minute wait.  Not so awesome. But it didn't matter.  First trip to Buddakan scores you a free plate of the trademark edamame ravioli.  I'd describe how awesome these bad boys are, but it'd be like describing a color without just saying the color: you can't do it.  Try it.  Then try to lick your own elbow.  I'll wait.  You done?  Okay, moving forward. I ordered the pork shoulder.  I have never been this happy with a decision since the time I got orange and black braces on Halloween when I was 12.  So that was destroyed in a matter of minutes.  My girlfriend got some chicken tempura thing that looked like sushi but wasn't.  That description may make it sound like we hated it.  We didn't.  Why do I say we?  Luckily, I date a girl who doesn't finish her entire meal sometimes.  So, since I was dropping $150 on food, I dug into her plate. In other news, the dumplings were out of this world.  We finished up with the lemongrass consomme because sometimes I like to feel fancy, OKAY!? Go here.  Just do it.  I don't care if you have no money, imaginary person.  Go here and eat.  Now.
