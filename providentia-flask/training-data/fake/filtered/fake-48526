Why do they make their cheese steaks so good? Oh my gawsh! My only complaint is that every time I go, I eat too much! I order too much! There's too much for me to enjoy and I can't decide between wiz or american cheese. But you can't go wrong with either as I usually get one of both and then eat three fourths of each until like i feel like im gonna burst. This place is fantastic i only wish it was closer to my house. The staff is really rude though, they expect you to be all knowledgable before you order like they got some system and what not. But I got no idea the right way to order so i feel like i was doing something wrong. But if you figure it out, you'll order right and feel OK - its all worth it! They're food is out of this world!
