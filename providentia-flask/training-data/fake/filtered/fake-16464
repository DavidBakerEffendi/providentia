I went last evening with my daughter and grandson. The server introduced herself to me (Natasha) as usual she asked about beverages I requested Pinot Grigio they had 2 brands I was not familiar with, so she described both to me and I picked one. To my surprise she came back with a taste of both to choose from. We started with the calamari, now don't expect the boring fried stuff. This has a delicious sauce and some additional veggies I wish I can order this as a dinner meal it was so good. However, we then ordered the Grilled Chicken salad (this was to be shared with my daughter and grandson, along with his order of chicken tenders and fries), chicken was tender and grilled to perfection salad was perfectly cold. My daughter also wanted (by the way she's pregnant) the Beef Kabob Wrap the beef was cooked perfectly as she requested for well done. My order was Open Shish Kabob Sandwich  because I knew my tummy could not hold two kabobs. The Shish kabob I ordered was a medium cooked lamb kabob cooked to perfection. The Tikki Masala sauce was fabulous. Dessert was Bakalava with Mango Ice Cream and Rice Pudding. Our servers name was Natasha who was very attentive, and polite. We also met one one the managers David who was also very nice asking of course about our experience and if we're locals which we are. *** So I guess by now you must be asking if we had such a great time and such a great dinner then why 4 stars?  It was the dessert, the baklava did not did not taste fresh or homemade, the mango ice cream was old and the rice pudding was watery.  HOWEVER WITH ALL THAT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU GO AND TRY THE FOOD!!!!
