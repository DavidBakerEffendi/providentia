First off, this review has nothing to do with the food at City Tap House. I've only had their pizzas and they've been excellent. The two stars are for the horrific service I experienced getting take out this past Sunday. When I arrived, the hostess was very welcoming and polite and sent me to the bar to pick up my to go order. The bartender (unfortunately, I did not get his name but he was wearing hipster black glasses and looked like one of the most unhappy people I've ever seen) ignored me for a good five minutes while he washed one wine glass. I finally politely interrupted and said I had a to go order to pick up. He rolled his eyes and said, "Name?" I told him my name. He turned his back, pulled my tab and threw it in my general direction. Seriously?! I gave him my credit card. He took it and then did the same thing, threw my card and the receipt tab in my general direction. So much so, that the receipts went flying on the floor and my credit card almost slid off onto the floor as well. Â When he brought out my pizza, he threw the box on the bar and turned his back. Not once did he say anything to me during our entire horrible interaction besides 'Name.' Instead I got a lot of sighs and eye rolling. City Tap House, you are awesome but you really need to screen your staff a lot better. This guy ruined it for me. I'm not sure I'll be back.
