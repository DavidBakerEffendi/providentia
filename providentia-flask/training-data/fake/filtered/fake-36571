Very Nice. The restaurant itself is nice and clean. the wait staff was not the greatest but they weren't the worst either. My waiter was Â not very friendly. He did not check on us like he should have and someone else came to offer us refills on our drinks. However the food was very good. I have the ribs and Mac and cheese also the bread was amazing and spicy. Really good food not to pretentious. I was very happy about eating here.
