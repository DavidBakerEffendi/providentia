I've always been skeptical about pancake places. I mean, how different could they REALLY be? How many different ways could there possibly be to make a pancake? They always end up tasting the same anyway right? Then, I met OPH. One thing that (strangely) caught my attention is the lack of those classic 'sticky menus' that pancake joints and diners are famously known for. A small detail, yes, but important. If they take time to wipe down their menus, imagine how clean their kitchen must be! The food is amazing! Light, fluffy pancakes and crepes with fresh fruit spilled over my plate. My Mother, however, stared in disbelief at the massive omelet that she was expected to devour. OPH is famous not only for their delectable pancakes, but for their monster omelets, which consist of 6 (yes 6) eggs! Maybe I should have mentioned that to my Mom, but the look on her face was very much worth it! If you're looking for amazing pancakes and enormous omelets, OPH is the place!
