I was recently there on a Friday night with five others.  The food and service was good but the end result was very disturbing.  My group was on the second floor and it was very dark.  When the check came I added a 20% gratuity.  The waitress neglected to mention that they had already added a 20% gratuity.  The next morning I noticed the double gratuity and called Eulogy.  The person who answered said she would have the manager call me back.  I did not receive a call back.  A couple of days later I called again.  Same result, the person who answered said the manager was not there and she would have him call back.  He never called back.  SO BE CAREFUL.
