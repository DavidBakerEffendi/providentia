I was told that this was an awesome Mexican restaurant, so as a lover of authentic Mexican food I could not wait!  Boy was I disappointed! I ordered a burrito and the first thing that turned me off was the tortilla. They used a whole wheat tortilla! Yuck! Like most whole wheat tortillas it was course and on the dry side.  As for the filling, it was OK, (though it was HEAVY on the peppers and the meat was a bit dry) but was nothing like I've had before. I'm thinking the chef is not so much for making authentic Mexican, but rather putting their own stamp on Mexican food. Some may like this, but not me.  Reading the other reviews, maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but just for the fact that they used a WHOLE WHEAT tortilla!!! I won't be going back.
