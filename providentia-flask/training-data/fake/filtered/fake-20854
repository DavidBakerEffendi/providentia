Shenanigans. I tried this place again on the recommendation of friends but I could have sworn I was in a sitcom the whole time. Â We called to make a reservation on a Sunday for brunch and were told they don't take reservations for parties smaller than 6. Ok. When we get there, the first thing they ask is if we have one, which we didn't. The (very) young guy said about 25 minutes so we ask if he wants to take our name and he says ,"no, I'll remember your face." Nevermind the fact that he only looked at one person in our part of 4, but you can't take a list of faces and remember who was there first. We waited half an hour, went in and checked again, we spoke to a different person who didn't take our name. Eventually, after 12 people came out of the building we went back in to make sure they knew we were still waiting. The guy told us that "someone jacked your table" but we'd be sat next. Shenanigans. I'd suggest a hostess station with a list of names and a dedicated person to seat people and maybe a sign that says "Please wait to be seated" on busy brunch morning to avoid tables "getting jacked" The food was fine. We only got one cup of coffee each and my friend received two tea bags with no water, then was asked if she wanted both bags. Overall, I think they need more experienced servers running the show, and a house manager. (Or a better one) It felt like an episode of Seinfeld.
