Disgusting. I ordered several rolls to take hone and had to throw them away. The texture and taste were off. When I called to tell them they were unwilling to resolve the issue.  There are too many sushi places to choose from to go here for expensive I'll tasting food.  The noodles I ordered were tasteless too.
