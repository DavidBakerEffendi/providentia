I visited this tourist trap today thinking their cheese steak would be something to write home about.  Definitively not the case.  This place was horrible and their service was appalling. I should have known my experience was going to bad when I attempted to order a steak sub with wiz and extras.  The woman at window said "we don't carry lettuce, tomato, mayo, etc.  You can only get wiz and onions!!"  I ordered two subs and a soda and the total $19!!!  What!  That's so overpriced for a mediocre sub. While I was eating I recognized something foreign in my sub.  A STRAND OF HAIR!!!  I immediately took it back up to the counter telling the evil woman I placed my order with earlier about the hair.  I demanded my money back.  She refused.  She said the hair must have been mine because everyone on the staff wears a hairnet.  I told her that's crap and she said I would have to find the hair and show her (actually digging through the steak).  I refused, yelled, and slammed the sub down on the counter splattering cheese  and steak on the inside of their booth window.  They didn't like that too much.  One of the cooks threw my sub at me and hit me in the arm.  What kind of business does that???!!!  What type of business are they running?  Assaulting people with food.   I will never go back to this place.  It's an overpriced tourist trap and with terrible customer service,  bland food, and serious disregard for hygiene!  I'm happy to add to the growing negative reviews on Yelp. Those looking to have the cheese steak experience while in Philadelphia will be much better off going to smaller, lesser know restaurants.  I bet the subs will taste much better and the staff will be courteous.
