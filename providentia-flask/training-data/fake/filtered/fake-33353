Loved close to everything about this place. The decor was very festive. The crowd mostly consisted of young professionals, which in my book is a huge plus. I gave it 4 stars because my date's entrée wasn't quite as perfect, and though the chocolate cake I had for desert was pretty good, I have had much better.   For the first course we got the Antipasti for two. Every sampler was great and just enough for both of us for the price. We also got a tomato bisque, though it was something my date ordered, the waiter brought us 2 spoons, trying to play cupid I assume. It was cute. However the tomato bisque I had at Audrey Claire has now probably ruined every other tomato bisque I will ever have. We got their specials for the day for our main course. I got the fish special, while my friend got the rib eye. The fish was cooked to perfection complete with a crispy skin :) The rib eye however was a little too fatty. Desert, we got chocolate cakes. They were pretty good, but I have definitely have had better.
