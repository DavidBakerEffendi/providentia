Very fast service and good food - would get my burrito fix every couple of weeks and who can say no whole wheat tortilla and brown rice? Prices aren't too bad and they have unlimited amount of salsa and chips as you wait for your order. Recommend it if you're in the neighborhood and want some descent mexican food at a good price.
