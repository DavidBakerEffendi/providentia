This has to be the worst service i have ever received in a Restaurant. We were there on Saturday Oct 20,2012. The waiter was so rude in taking the orders - then when the bill came i gave them 10% as tip since I was not too happy with the service. The owners wife comes to me and tells me i have to pay 15% tip??? i told her the service was bad she did not want to hear anything and told me "so don't come here" I will never go there again nor should anyone who expects a pleasant dinning experience
