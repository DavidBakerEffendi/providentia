My mom and I dined here for lunch on a Friday around 1pm. There was a decent sized crowd and only one waiter who was a superstar. We each had a half liter of the Hofbrau Original, the cheese plate for an appetizer, and shared four wursts and sides between us. Overall a very pleasant and delicious experience! On the "kaseplatte", there was a Limburger, Camembert, a Stilton, and something hard and bitey. I most enjoyed the pine nut and honey spread, sweet and nutty. As well as the Hungarian paprika onion spread, sweet and smokey. It's hard to choose favorites, but my mom and I admitted we liked the Ungarischewurst the best. It's description reads "Hungarian paprika, red wine vinegar, and garlic", and you could certainly taste all of these. The Bratwurst was probably the most recognizable of flavors, with caraway and majoram. Speckwurst is made with bacon, and Baurenwurst with beef. I definitely recommend getting the sauerkraut, it's a traditional side for a reason, it pairs so nicely with the wursts, a little bit with each bite. The Kartoffelpuffer, or potato pancake was dense, in a good way, and not greasy. The Rotkohl, red cabbage, was sweet and delicious, again it pairs nicely with the wursts. And personally, I usually could take or leave Spatzle, which is sort of a noodle dough riced into little nubs, but this was also very tasty.
