Best Date Spot in the Area Hands Down! I'm a local from the area and this is the perfect hidden gem of fine dining especially if you want to impress a date. Mulberry Street is my go to place for first dates period. The service is exquisite, the food is amazing, and atmosphere is best combination of high end dining mixed with quit low key intimate setting. This place is a must if you want to impress your special someone without looking like your trying too hard. Trust me
