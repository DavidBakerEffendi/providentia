I ate here a random Friday night with my girlfriend. Usually I'm very picky about Spanish food but I had no complaints We ordered the ceviche appetizer which had the right amount of spice that made it perfect as a starter the plate also had a bit of sweet potato on the side to balance out the spice . She ordered the seafood platter and I ordered the Steak but it had us taking bites from the others plates. It was sooo good! Mix that in with a great Peruvian ambiance and Joe the extremely cool mixologist who made some great pisco drinks and it made for a simple but great night out in Long Island city.
