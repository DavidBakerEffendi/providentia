Pies N Thighs catered my wedding in January. They were great to work with and we had a wonderful experience. They were responsive to us from the first time we contacted them--immediately scheduling a tasting for us at the restaurant. Their catering manager was really great and we felt that she really wanted to work with us. She was great about coordinating all of the MANY details of the wedding and everything went off without a hitch. Several people told us that this was the best wedding food they'd ever had. My husband is from Texas and requested that they cut the meat in a different way to make it more like what they serve at home. Anyone considering using them as a caterer should know that the catering menu does offer quite a few options that are not on the normal menu--and that are a bit more elegant. We also wanted to have plenty of vegetarian options and this was not a problem at all--we had loads of choices.
