Ever eaten something so delicious that you have to go back the next day and have it again? This is my situation with the Arugola Pizza that I had last night. It was a perfect symphony of Fresh Bufala Mozzarela, Homemade sauce, fresh shaved parmesan, arugola, and Basil in a rich lime flavor (didn't know what it was, still don't and don't care) broth. Heaven! My dining partner had the Lasagna di carne (the best I have ever had). She also had the Calamari which we have had in every which way and every where yet this basic played out dish....still managed to be flavorful, tender, perfect and surprising not predicable and boring! Ok, yes...I am drooling a little bit thinking about my meal. I have been going to Luzzos since before I could afford to go to Luzzos, let's just say that about 8 years of being a local fan. I have never been disappointed with the service, meal or even the eye candy of all the fabulous people watching. Don't worry this is not the type of place you have to be model thin and seen in the "right" designer. All types of interesting people can be found here. The restaurant is listed as Napoletan Pizza but for those of you that are phobic to exotic cuisine ...no need to fear. The pizza is easy to understand and there are few exotically daring dishes on the menu. There is really something for everyone! Luzzos is a true New York establishment that has remands true to it's self. I highly recommend this dining experience. Oh....and it has a super cool, hip bar also if you just want to go for drinks.
