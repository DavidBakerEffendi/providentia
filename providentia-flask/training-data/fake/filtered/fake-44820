Pretty good place.  Not the Spanish tapas place that you go to in NYC, but it is decent within its location.  Went there with parents and had a great meal.  I got the lobster plate while my parents ordered the grilled whole fish and sea food platter, which was huge and had crab, lobster, and other shell fish.  Definitely a nice place to spend the Sunday evenings. Thanks, T
