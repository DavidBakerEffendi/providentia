Let me start off by saying that just because this is my firs review it doesn't mean I don't know what I'm saying, everyone has to start off somewhere right? Anyways, I've been to this restaurant multiple times and I have to say, they make very good food when it comes to the hibachi, my favorite meal is the filet mignon w/ fried rice and miso soup. The vegetables are very good and the presentation is great, all of the chefs are friendly, fun and great cooks. The only downside I have to say is that the sushi is mediocre at best, I am a sushi Â lover and eat it all the time from well respected restaurants and I've honestly had better and cheaper sushi from whole foods than at Sakura garden. Final Verdict Great restaurant for the whole family, a bit pricey, great food, great atmosphere, stay away from the sushi.
