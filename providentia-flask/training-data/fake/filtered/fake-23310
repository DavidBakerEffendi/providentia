Just wanted to pass along to all, that the beloved owner passed away last week.  This is a family run business and the wife son and daughter will continue to run this awesome establishment.  My father and the gentleman I speak of (Jose Romero) were good friend for over 15 years.  Although similiar to portuguese, this is a famly from Spain.  I'm not trying to nitpick here but as a spaniard myself, I wanted to point that out. This place is as good as it gets, for what it is! Cheers !
