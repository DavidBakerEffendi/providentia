This place is seriously awesome. I was there the other night and this dude walked in and it seemed like Cheers ... because everybody knew his name. Maybe they'll know my name someday too. Total sitcom material. Things you need to eat here that are delicious include Mac and Cheese, Spicy Dry Rub Wings, Hot Dog Platter, and the Pulled Pork Sandwich. They are good. They will make you happy. They will not cost you a fortune. The cocktails are good I hear, but just skip those and go straight to beer. There are always good beers. And not only did I like the beers, but they liked me back. Good happy hour prices too. This place is awesome. Go there. You will not regret it.
