When I'm in New York Graffiti is the first place I go to. Yes, I just can't go without this place. It's an absolutely awesome place, very small but extremely cozy. Great for a date night out and has a selection of affordable wines by the bottle and very delicious tapas style food. The d√©cor blends in very well with the adventurous menu and concept of the restaurant, andlet me repeat myself the food is always sensational. The winner on their menu in my opinion is DUCK PORTOBELLO GRATINEE, you gotta try this... it's an absolute delight. I think this is one of those must go, must try places. Would recommend to everyone!
