i went to rice pot for lunch !!! i ordered a dish and specifically told the waitress not to put egg in my dish so when my order came out i started eating it and tasted egg! it is in in my religion not to eat egg/meat! when i told them that there is egg and if they could just make me a new one....they refused to make another one and basically told me to never come back to the restaurant again.the waitresses were very rude to even say that to me. that is unacceptable! Â how can you treat customers like that! i will never recommend anyone to a place that doesnt care of religion or customer appreciation.
