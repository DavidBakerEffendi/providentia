third time over last month waiting time was close to 1.5 hour and they were saying 45 min. when they stared my wife and I loved the food. recently food got worse and getting worse. today I received the food and they change the trays for cheap ones. food tastes awful. I have general tso chicken. looks like from cheap please. egg roll very bad. and chicken soup doesn't even look like chicken soup. looks like leftovers from miso soup. guys try to do what i did before,otherwise you will be keep loosing customers. I was big fan of this place before. not anymore.
