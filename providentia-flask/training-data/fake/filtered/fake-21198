The food got off to a good start with the warm rolls. The salad was standard - a good size, good taste, nothing terribly memorable. There was a minor service glitch when the wrong entr√©e came out, but the right one quickly arrived. The salmon was a little dry. The tables were much too close together - I felt like I knew the life stories of the people sitting next to us. The noise level got louder and louder as the night wore on - if you don't like noise, come here early. They have a lively bar scene, so that accounts for some of the noise spilling into the dining room. The prices are reasonable, so I would come back if I were in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't make a special trip.
