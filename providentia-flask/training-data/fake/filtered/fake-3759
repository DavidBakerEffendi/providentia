My kids and I take the train in from NYC on a regular basis and Hapgood's has now become a must on our way to visit family. The pancakes and omelets for breakfast are perfect but you must try the poached pear pancakes. So fluffy and delicious and a unique combo. Even my kids like to sneak a few bites. For lunch you can't go wrong with their version of a BLT - it's made with Brie cheese on a roll. Yummy! The deli salads are super fresh and come with your sandwiches. Frankly we haven't had anything less than delicious. They make great cappuccinos and have a varying selection of baked goods if you are in a hurry. My hope is they stay open for dinner. Service and staff friendly and efficient. The portions are generous for the price.
