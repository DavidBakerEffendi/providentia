We really wanted to love this place, turns out we liked it...mostly. I hope the operators read this because they need some help. The food had a great mix of flavors and the variety was impressive. But, Way, Way, Way to much salt. It overpowered the other flavors. And, they need support on the Beer selections. There are beers that could really compliment the foods. On the night we went the beer choices were week and flavorless. They need some robust selections, some hoppier selections would help.
