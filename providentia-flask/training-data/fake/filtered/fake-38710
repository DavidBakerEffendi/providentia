Comfy ambiance, friendly/professional/helpful staff esp. Charlie and Jose plus really yummy food locally sourced and well prepared.  Everything better than it has to be.  Frittatas w/salad, French toast, great coffee, and desserts that demand scraping the plate to get every bit.  And all gently priced.  Can't wait to return!
