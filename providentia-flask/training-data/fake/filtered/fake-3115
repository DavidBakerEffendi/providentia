went here for my anniversary with my boyfriend for hibachi and we were HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED! we ordered edamame for appetizer and A COCKROACH CRAWLED OUT OF MY EDAMAME!!! we complained to our waitress who then got the owner who wasn't able to speak english well!! WTF?? after speaking to the owner and telling him we were absolutely not going to pay for the edamame we immediately left. i am extremely disappointed especially because the reviews on Â yelp were pretty good.
