I have always enjoyed their food and friendly service up until tonight. Â I went there tonight and the tall dusty want to be Malcolm x with the missing Jerome (from Martin) jacked up teeth had a major attitude. He made a bad name for the business and so did everyone else who stood around listening to this jerk wanting to argue with me because he made my sandwich the way he wanted it. I hope that the owner reads this and fire everyone who worked there tonight except the dark skin short bald head brother who stepped in and took charge professionally.
