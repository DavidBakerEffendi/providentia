The confusingly named "Smith" is quite a deceiving restaurant. I went to this large, white building expecting a place to buy fine steel. Unfortunately, all that was in this so-called Smith was food. I will give the place that it has the best brunch in midtown, but had the Mongols been invading, we all would have been slaughtered. I recommend the food, but do not go there if you want a fine blade to defend Tarnovo with.
