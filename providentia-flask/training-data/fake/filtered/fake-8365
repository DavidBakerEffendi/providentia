Stopped by Laetus for dinner on a Monday night.  We sat at the bar and were greeted by the bartender Jeff right away.  I ordered a couple appetizers, the edamame, shu mai and steak satay.  All of which came out in a timely manner and were delicious.  Overall the food was great, the staff and service was excellent and the atmosphere was enjoyable.  I would recommend to anyone looking for Asian cuisine or even just a place to grab some drinks.
