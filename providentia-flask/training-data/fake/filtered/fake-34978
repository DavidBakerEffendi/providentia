Just had brunch here. Very disappointing. Small portions (good for those on a diet, though). High prices $16 for very minuscule Eggs Benedict (2 oz of meat at most and $12 for a Bellini drink that must have measured 4 oz at most). Very uneven service -- first time that I've had my drinks served AFTER my entree. Biggest problem though is a food safety one -- beware of the water dripping from the overhead vents onto your food and drinks. My water tasted funkier as the meal went on and then I looked up and saw the condensation on the vents. When I pointed this out to the serves, all she said was "We're working on it". Overall, incredibly overhyped for what you get. As a long time Princeton resident, there are so many better choices. In fact for Brunch, the Eggs Benedict at PJs is more flavorful and plentiful at half the price.
