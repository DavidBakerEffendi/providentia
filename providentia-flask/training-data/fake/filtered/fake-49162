I saw the reviews raving about the freshness of the food, vegan meals,  cleanliness, and delivery service. I had something delivered a few weeks ago and thought it was good and couldn't believe how fast it was delivered. I stopped there for lunch today with a friend. It is small and very clean with a very lovely décor; two tables and bar seating across the front window. You have to order at the counter. The reviews were right - the vegetables, meat and fish are really fresh, the veggies are not overcooked and nothing is greasy; very tasty lunches are $5.50 and most dinners $7.50. The owner is a very personable and obviously hard-working young man who went to Noah Webster School in Hartford's  West End. Being a long-time West End resident, I've encouraged all my neighbors to support this business! It's a keeper!
