My girlfriend and I stopped in here for brunch today, Sunday June 30th and we were VERY dissatisfied. We placed our order and noticed some disorganization among the staff but didn't realize what it would cost us... 1. we waited 25 minutes before we got our food, we ordered a bacon/chicken sandwich and a tuna wrap ... not all that difficult 2. the bacon/chicken sandwich should've been deluxe as we ordered it that way and we never actually got the extras that came with it 3. we ordered a wrap that had sundried tomatoes in it and it was so greasy the entire wrap ended up drenched in it and so did my hands, gross! 4. we told the owner about our experience and he gave us some strange explanation about how he thought our order was a "phone order" and that's why we waited so long ... yet the staff were speaking with customers who appeared to be their friends asking what they liked and never once addressed us 5. I unfortunately noticed some FOOD SAFETY ISSUES: the man cooking our food was also EATING FOOD at the same time, other workers were eating food while behind the counter, I saw a worker wipe his sweat with a rag that ended up on his shoulder ...and god knows where else Unfortunately I did try to nicely explain these things to the owner but he really did not understand, and I'm not sure they follow proper protocol with their food safety. I'd avoid this place and continue giving honest reviews until they fix the problems or close.
