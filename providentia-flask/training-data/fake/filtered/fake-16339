My wife picked this restaurant as it was close to Montclair State Univeristy where we went to watch a performance. It was also our anniversary dinner. Even though we were early, the captain gave us a booth next to the waiters staging area. We ordered Calimari which came out good, if a bit bland. As for entrees, we were not offered the choice of potate croquette which was listed on the menu, Our order of Chicken Francese came out ok, but without much flavor. My son's had a sirloin steak which came out as ordered but it was very bland, without much steak sauce and was tough. As for the veal, I would say it was as good as the ones I had in my college cafetaria. The salad was drowning in the dressing. My son and I went to use the men's room. It must be in the midst of being clean, as there were toilet paper strewn about in the stalls and the floor was all wet .We concluded this place is overpriced for the standard it delivers and the quality of the food. If not for the nice decor and ambience, I would have given it a single star
