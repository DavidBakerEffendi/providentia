Brazil Grill is one of our favorite restaurants! It's one place our whole family can agree on. The food is terrific and the people are so nice and welcoming. I love the buffet with a serving of Top Sirloin. My son loves the chicken wrapped in bacon and the pork loin. My husband loves it all - the pork sausage, the lamb, everything. He usually goes up for thirds!
