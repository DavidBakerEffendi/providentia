Just walked in the door from a Friday night out at Boulton & Watt and I had the most incredible night. This place is first class all the way. The ambiance is wonderful and it has a sophisticated feel without being stuff, which is a tremendous plus in New York City. The food is absolutely incredible. We started with the Robiola and Steak Tartare, which was out of this world. My friend and I were battling over the Robiola trying to sneak bites in before the other did - it was that good. Then I had the Steak Frites. I enjoyed every bite of the meal and couldn't believe how large the portion size was. My friend had the Blackened Brick Amish Free Range Chicken and raved. Boulton & Watt is obviously run very well. The staff is extremely attentive, accommodating and courteous. They went out of the way to make sure that we were seated in a timely fashion and the food arrived very quickly. I already talked about how incredible it was, right?! Overall, I was very comfortable the entire evening and couldn't have asked for a better experience. And the prices are very reasonable for NYC. I cannot say enough great things about this place, but don't take my word for it. Check it out for yourself. You'll thank me later...
