First time in this place. I'm not going to like but it was a busy day the day I went with my family. Overall the good was delicious but we ordered an appetizer that came REALLY late. Pretty much we got the appetizer and then five minutes later we good out main course, makes no sense. But out waitress was on top of everything and services wasn't bad. Oh and one more thing, when we got sat down the waitress took a while to come and introduce herself and start the ordering process. Overall place was good and the good was good! I'll definitely recommend this place and I'm definitely going back some day.
