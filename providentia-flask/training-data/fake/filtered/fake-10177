When it comes to its female patrons, BAR is not the place for Britney Spears wanna bees.  I was dressed in a spaghetti-strapped crop top exposing my midriff and lower back and was told to put a shirt on.  I told that bouncer another woman was wearing a top that was full-length in front, but exposed most of her back, but he (the bouncer said she was wearing a shirt).  I just really want their dress code to be more relaxed.  I think BAR also said they imposed that dress code to protect women from being harassed.  That's blaming the victim!  Truth is, perverted men don't really care how a woman is dressed.  They are looking for women who look vulnerable.  BAR definitely gets an "F" when it comes to its dress code.   Just remember folks, looking semi/fully nude is not rude!
