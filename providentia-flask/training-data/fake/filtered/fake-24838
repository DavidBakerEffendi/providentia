One of the worst restaurants my wife and I have eaten in for a very long time. My wife ordered the crab cake, it was obviously frozen since the center was still cold and the exterior edges only partially cooked.  It was sitting in a pool of olive oil that had been poured over the meager greens. For myself, the turkey burger had at best a smear of aioli sauce across the bun and the burger was dried out and sat like s hockey puck in my gut after eating. Service was slow and poor. The only redeeming aspect was the rooftop bar.  The beer was fine, but pretty hard to screw that up. It will a very long time before I put my foot through the door there again.
