My friends and I recently went to Oaxaca - our experience was wonderful. I was early and had a couple of their house margaritas at the bar - they hit the spot! We sampled a variety of appetizers - all were delicious, especially the blue crab. For dessert you have to get the tres leches cake - it is phenomenal! And try the prickly pear cocktail - it's a little on the acidic side, but I loved it! Our server was wonderful and we loved the ambience - I felt like I was in Epcot!
