This place is amazing.  It's the Garden of Eden of Italian food.  Freshly made pastas, a deli to die for, artesian cheeses and a chocolate bar.  In  the heart of New York, very unassuming from the outside and as you walk in it looks like a Costco of gourmet food.  Only  reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it's a  bit pricey.
