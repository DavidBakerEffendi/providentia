I thought this place was going to be super romantic, as per other reviews. Yes, it was very dark, with small candles randomly placed throughout the bar. The drinks and music were good, but my date and I were practically run out of the place by a very large group of Â female college students. The college students seemed to multiply like Gremlins. Now, this is not the other room's fault, but I find large crowds of 21 year olds annoying. Hopefully the bar is more chill on weekdays.
