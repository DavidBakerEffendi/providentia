dined at Zahav last week for about the 6th time since theve opened. truly amazing, the lamb shoulder haunts me with its deep rich flavours. the kibbe naya is the most amazing tar tar in philly. service was great friendly attentive. cant wait to go back but i will starve myself first so i can eat everything
