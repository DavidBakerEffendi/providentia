Things to love: - The sauces provided on every table are excellent. The meats I've tried have all been served dry, and then it's up to you to sauce it up to your liking. I'd suggest mixing a few together and experimenting! - The pulled pork sandwich is the perfect meal for a big appetite. Delicious meat, great roll, Â yummy coleslaw, and the mixed fries are definitely the way to go. - The atmopshere is comfortable and relaxed, a nice place to sit and study or meet with friends (due to it's great location smack dab in the middle of Drexel and U-Penn) - The staff has always been friendly and quick with the service Things to avoid: -DELIVERY. I cannot stress this enough. I don't know how the in-restaurant service and the delivery service are so different. I've never had a good experience ordering from here. The food is always cold, every time. They almost always forget to include the sauces, and when you order a pulled pork sandwich and recieve no bbq sauce to put on it, it sort of defeats the purpose of "ordering bbq" With a whopping 15 dollar minimum and 3 dollar delivery fee, its a ripoff to even consider ordering from here. I promise, it isn't worth the energy you'd save to go to the actual restaurant. Overall - Reasonable prices for sizable servings of good ol' comfort food, as well as the cozy atmosphere, makes this place a go-to for any college student nearby.
