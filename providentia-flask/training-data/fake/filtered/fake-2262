This is a cash-only restaurant, only they didn't tell us that via signage or when we ordered. Thankfully a Duane Reade is nearby for quick cash back. Pancakes were delicious!!! Omelette only okay, but with "Baking" in the name, I recommend you order something made with flour, since that would be their specialty.
