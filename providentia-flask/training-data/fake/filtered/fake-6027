Just delicious! Best thing ever happened in Bed-Stuy. They are simply just delicious. Everything. The grandma's pie, their tomato soup or potato soup, pasta, their baked goods, the bread everything is delicious. They are only take-out and its so worth it to walk over there and grab pretty much everything. Also both the girl and the guy who works there are really nice and friendly. Just love it.
