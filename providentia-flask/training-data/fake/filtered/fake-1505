This place is amazing. The boyfriend and I stopped in for a quick drink one night and wound up having the specialty dessert, berries and creme, while sipping cocktails. I had the peach old fashioned and he had a sazarac. We also wound up splitting a cheese plate after a few drinks. It was excellent! I assumed the staff would be very drink knowledgeable and not know that much about nice cheese but the bartender explained every cheese to us in detail and made great recommendations. The bartender was super friendly and we definitely plan on stopping in again! It's definitely not cheap but for that kind of service I'm always willing to pay more. Love it!
