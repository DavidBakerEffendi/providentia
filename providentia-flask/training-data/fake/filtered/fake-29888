I have been to Golden Rock a couple of times already.  It is a nice place to have a New York style pizza in this corner of the globe.   The coffee was great, the staff was very attentive and the place was clean and very roomy for a downtown area.  Most of all, I was able to have halal pepperoni pizza as all their meat is halal.
