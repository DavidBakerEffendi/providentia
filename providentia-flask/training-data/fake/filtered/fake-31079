Oh, Memphis Taproom. I want to like you. I really do. My friends like you. I've been 4-5 times and I appreciate the effort you put in, but your execution is terrible. Pros - Great draft selection, clearly marked vegan and vegetarian menu items. Cons- Poor service, mediocre vegan food and a total lack of cleanliness. Would it really kill you to clean the bathrooms? Would it really kill you to ask me how everything is when I have only eaten two bites of my curry stew.
