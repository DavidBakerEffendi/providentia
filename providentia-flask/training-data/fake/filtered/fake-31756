This is a HUGE, nicely decorated new-ish restaurant that I visited for a buffet lunch. I would imagine that the space would be attractive for large groups.  The food was unexceptional.  The service was plentiful (as in lots and lots of staff wandering about), but neither efficient nor discerning.  At least some of the food in the appetizer section ("chili chicken") appeared to be recycled, and was actually inedible. Perhaps it will get better over time, but I am in no hurry to return.
