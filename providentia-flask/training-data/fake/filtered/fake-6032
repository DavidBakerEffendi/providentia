WORST ice cream I have ever had! AND 5 bucks for two measly scoops. It would have been different if it was even remotely tasty. They have a spot that takes advantage of the nature-lovers traffic, the bikers and bladers and strollers who do the Kelly Drive Trail. I guess it's a captive audience, but if they can't get something as simple as ice cream right and at a reasonable price, then my advice is to stay as far away from this place as possible.
