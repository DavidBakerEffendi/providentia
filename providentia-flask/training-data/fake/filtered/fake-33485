This hipster trash commenting on this page is seriously annoying. The servers are all new and young, they are there to take your order, not know every beer related question you can ask. Matter a fact, why don't u keep your questions to yourself and order a fucking beer so she can get on with her life. The decor is PHAT...i had to bring out my 90's slang for that. the crowds decent too. mix of hipsters and polacks, with a couple of older peeps thrown in. I like that its not just all hipsters and doesn't make you feel mad unwelcome because your not cool enough. The beer selection is pretty good but like stated before, its expensive. I don't really understand all the talk tho, because lets get real, you live in greenpoint, its the new hot area in case your weren't aware. I mean, if you can pay $6 bucks for your latte, i think you can afford the beer. The food is well prepared and YUMMY! The weinerwurst is retardedly good. the servers are pretty nice, the bartenders are also cool. Im pretty sure one of them was getting mad saucy behind the bar lol. Overall, i think its a pretty chill atmosphere to bring your friends and drink and have a good time. Just watch yourself so you don't rack up a hefty bill
