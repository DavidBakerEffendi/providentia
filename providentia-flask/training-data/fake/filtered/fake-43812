I went for lunch on a Saturday and the place was a little dead--never a good sign for a restaurant. I went with my sister and we looked at the menu and we were automatically impressed. They seemed to offer anything and everything! We were seated at a table, but we asked the host if it was possible to move to a booth. He happily obliged. It's a really nice space and you could tell by looking at the design that this was a trendy spot at night. At the same time, it was cozy and casual--a perfect Saturday lunch setting. What to order was really an impossible task because they offered so much and it all looked good! My sister ordered the Nicoise salad and I ordered an egg white omelette (which you can create yourself) with spinach, tomato and feta. While waiting for our food, we nibbled on the table bread, which came with incredible olive oil. Soon after, our food came, and this is where it became a little disappointing. My sister's salad was really good and well portioned, but my omelette was one of the worst I've had. All I could taste was salt! It was so unappealing. The only way to eat it was with a piece of toast, which is exactly what I did. It was much better with the bread because the saltiness was balanced out. Even though my omelette was bad, I think I would go back again because they offered a lot of other things and my sister's meal was good.
