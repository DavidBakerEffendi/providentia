If you thought you couldn't throw a meatball and hit a decent Italian place that delivers, think again. The Non Solo Pasta restaurant brings an authentic and warm-hearted Italian food. More than your usual pizza and pasta pit-stop, this tried and true full service restaurant has a tongue-bending selection of antipasti, insalates, and entrees to satisfy even discriminating palates. At Non Solo Pasta you won't find anything out of a jar --everything is made fresh from homemade ingredients just like grandma used to make. Making for an out of the ordinary eating experience, and the value in itself is worthy of repeated encores.
