This bar/restaurant is one of my favorite in the city for one major reason: THE OWNERS!!!! They are the most friendliest people, know how to make amazing drinks, and you can have an intelligent conversation with them. The first time I was there I had a cilantro mojito and amazing mussels. My friend had an awesome beet salad. The second time I was there I had a Pepper Shooter Martini :) Â phenomenal drink. My friend ordered their dessert---butter cake--amazing. I will be definitely going to this place more often where I can talk with the owner who is also the bartender who really shows she cares by getting to know her customers and her husband, the chef who makes food with soul and care for the people who eat it. :)
