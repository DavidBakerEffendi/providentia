My husband and I flew to NJ for a wedding recently and ate here with 2 other guy friends on a Wed night.   The place is spacious with great decor and the food was generally very good (admittedly none of us are gourmets).  We had: Cajun Seared Tuna (appetizer) 3 Course BBQ Dragon Dinner (miso soup, salad, rice, Chinese sausage, beef short rib, chicken breast, jumbo shrimp, vegetable, pineapple, and smores you grill at your table for $22.95 per person) Angry Dragon Tempura Roll Spiderman Roll Happy Pig, Drunken Shrimp Props to them in that although we only had 1 order of the Dragon dinner and therefore only got one soup, salad, and rice to share among 4 of us, the waitress very kindly gave us enough smores for all of us. Service was a little lacking - our waitress was pleasant and worked hard but she was the only one there so we had to wait for some dishes and the check.   In summary, a good dining experience!
