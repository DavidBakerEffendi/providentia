Awesome service and atmosphere! I've been here quite a few times and that is definitely going to continue. Whether it's lunch or dinner, the prices are very reasonable, compared to all the other restaurants in the Hells Kitchen area. You will definitely leave full. The decor is amazing, you are definitely entering a mysterious, yet beautiful realm. From what I have seen, lunch is usually a quieter time to have a relaxed one-on-one. The lunch specials are a MUST, they include one appetizer and one entree. The portions are definitely good enough to fill a hungry chap. The chicken skewers are just generous and juicy. For lunch, I usually get the Pad Woon Sen. This is stir-fried glass vermicelli mixed with vegetables, egg, and shrimp. Again, the portion is very generous, and the taste is just addicting. Now the good part: dinner. Their squid ink spaghetti is their own specialty. It's a bit spicy, but it is balanced out with the rest of the dish which is filled with calamari, shrimp, and vegetables. The pasta itself with the sauce is just enough on its own. If you are a first-timer at here, I definitely say go all the way and hit up this dish. It might be a little dark at dinner, and the noise level is definitely up there that you will definitely have to talk louder to be heard. But overall, it is a reliable, affordable, and very satisfying place.
