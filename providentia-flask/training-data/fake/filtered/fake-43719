I had dinner here last week and was pretty darn happy. I got the burger with the whole deal egg, pineapple etc and it rocked. My buddy got the hanger and was equally stoked. Got a good drinks menu and I thought the vibe was Â  super cool, nice staff good tunes and just a good plae to have a good time dinner. I live in manhattan but will def be back over the bridge to visit again.
