My wife and I discovered this place a couple of months back as we were looking for a good Italian place that served moderate portions of pasta. Our first experience here was very, very good. We happened to walk in without a reservation and despite it being a busy night the host accommodated us at the bar and was even gracious enough to offer us a free drink. The artichoke appetizer with parsley and lemon butter was simply amazing! What I loved about the pasta dishes were the sauces, they're not just home made, but have a fresh taste to them which makes the food simple, yet so delicious. Since we had such a great experience the first time, we went back there with family and needless to say, the host (Anthony) was once again very courteous and warm and offered us a glass of wine since we had to wait for the table. The food as usual didn't disappoint and the portion sizes are just perfect. My wife and I plan on making this our "regular" Italian place as the food along with the service and the warmth just make this an amazing experience.
