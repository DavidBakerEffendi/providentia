DOES NOT DESERVE ANY STAR AT ALL... I called and spoke to the manager today 7/6/14 @ 145pm to let them know the usual grilled chicken salad we order is unusually small portion compared to the previous serving they give. Instead of listening to their regular customer's feedback he just blew me off...as if I will waste my time to call for trivial matters. THEY JUST LOSE A CUSTOMER WHO ORDERS AT LEAST 3-4 x a week!
