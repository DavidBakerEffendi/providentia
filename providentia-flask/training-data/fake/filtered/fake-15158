i think today is the last day for the 20% off take-our or dine-in, but the food here is really good.  my wife is 9 months pregnant, so we've been about 4 times in the past 3 weeks for the vegetable rolls and shumai.  the dinner box is crazy--you get a bunch of tempura (including 2 large shrimps), soup, salad, shumai or gyoza, rice, and whatever entree you choose all for under $20.  I've tried the chicken teriyaki and chicken katsu.  both are great.  the teriyaki was a little under cooked one time. my wife and i always split a dinner box and she gets one other roll. we'll be coming here a lot .
