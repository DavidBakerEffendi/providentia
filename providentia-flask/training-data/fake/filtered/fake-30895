Checked in early Tuesday.  I was in the area taking care of an assignment and since I was on someone else's nickel I figured I would pick up a sandwich to share with wifey. This was visit number 2. 1st time trying was about 2 weeks ago. I saw the place on an episode of Diners Drive-ins & Dives and knew I had to visit. 1st time had the roast beef, eggplant, and mozz. Very good ! Eggplant thin and tasty, cow was tender, and the mozz was ... in a word,  GOOD. This visit was an Italian combo with lettuce, tomato, and onion. We always get vinegar on both sides of the bread with any sandwich we order and this time was no exception. It was almost 2 and a half hours before we dug into this log of deliciousness and we were not disappointed. My only complaint was there was not enough vinegar. No big deal ... that's why we have 55 gallon drums of red wine and balsamic vinegars in the basement ( :- ). However you have to get here, ... on someone else's nickel,  your nickel,  back of a radio car, ET's bicycle, ... get here. You will be glad you did.
