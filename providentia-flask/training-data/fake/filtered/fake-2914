Never Again.....  We were devoted fans of Cuban Petes and before that, Mexicalli Rose.  Our last visit was the worst experience ever.  We went with another couple so 4 adults and 4 children.  We were seated at a rather large table and when we asked if we could have a leaf removed to make the table smaller, we were first ignored then after asking again were told NO.  When our waiter took our order, we specifically said that we just wanted to order Tapas as we were all not that hungry.  The portions were a bit larger then we remember but there was definitly too much food for the 4 of us.  Our children ordered off of the kids menu so their oder was fine.  Now the Tapas are usually $4 each and we ordered 7 of them.  Not once did our waiter even ask how we were or ask if we needed anything.  When we asked for our check, it was literally thrown at us.  To our SURPRISE, a $210 dollar bill.  They charged us $15 dollars for each Tapas with no warning.  They brought a pitcher of Lemonade for our children when only 2 ordered and charged us $12 dollars and that auto gratuity of $30 for service that didn't exist was a joke.   The service was horrible and quick to get us out of there, making that obvious as they were spraying down the table as we were sitting there.  I've experienced the "Hurry up and Eat" by this place but this was ridiculous.  We decided to wait until the owner was in which was the next day to complain but what do you know, he wouldn't get on the phone.  Way to go Pete, we will now recommend to as many people as we know not to eat at your classless establishment.  FYI, if you decide to torcher yourself and still eat at this dump, avoid Javiar as a waiter.
