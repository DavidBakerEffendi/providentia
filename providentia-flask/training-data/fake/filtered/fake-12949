Dear Culture needing reviewer: I found this place by looking thru yelp reviews, and almost took a pass on it, but glad I ignored the last two reviews and came anyway. THIS IS A BEER BAR WITH GREAT FOOD !! As a self admitted beer snob, I fell in love with the selection. Prior reviews boasted 10 taps ?        How about 22 !?! An amazing variety of craft and microbrews on tap, Rogue Dead Guy, Arrogant Bastard, Dogfish 90 and Troeegs Hopback ?? Pick any other five bars and you will not find anything close for a beer geek!. Bottle list around 75 hard to find choices were also available, but the drafts quickly won me over ( even gave me free samples to see if I would like to have more ) The place is CLEAN, music lively ( digital juke box ) and the staff know their stuff. Speaking with the manager I was told that 16 beers are "mandatory for the chain" and the others are tapped at guests suggestion ( Delirium tremens on the way ? ) The food was great ( new menu in place ) great burgers, sandwiches and amazing chicken wings, in 4 flavors. What do the other reviewers need in a restaurant ? Came in on a Wednesday to find it was karaoke, and almost ran, but the crowd was into it, so I stayed to watch ( no beer strong enough for me to sing ) They were great ! strong following of talented singers, my own private Idol show , WITH GREAT BEER, which is discounted on Monday and Wednesday, day and night. 3 dollars for a pint of amazing beer? sign me up ! My review ? Ignore the snobs, and come see this place. Great beers, full  bar, 14 tequilas, fun and  great snacks. What else do you need ?
