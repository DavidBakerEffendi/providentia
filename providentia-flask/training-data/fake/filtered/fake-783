Went to Habana Â Outpost yesterday afternoon for the first time. I ordered a catfish sandwich & the grilled corn that folks had raved about. I was very disappointed, the corn was cold & there wasn't much fish on the sandwich. There was more mayo & tomatoes then fish. I felt it could have been better considering the sandwich was $8.75.
