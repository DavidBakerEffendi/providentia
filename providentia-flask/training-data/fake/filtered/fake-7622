I'm glad I finally decided to check out this local coffee shop. Wish I had sooner. The people here are friendly and patient with your order for breakfast or lunch and they don't seem annoyed when you have to change up something after they wrote it down already. There's seating for at least 50 people with large bay windows, and a plus is that there is free wifi too. I was there, I'd stop for breakfast and lunch too Have had the bagels here and they're soo good. I believe they bake on premises a few times daily The bagel was warm and soo soft very authentic bagel style I didn't even need it toasted. Too bad this place closes at 5pm all week else Id be by after work. If they stayed open until 12 Am that would be nice because I could relax and enjoy a nice meal and coffee after a long day. You can't get this atmosphere at SB or any other coffee franchise in this town.Overall, this is a nice neighborhood coffee Â shop.
