Great place to go to for a dinner and drinks. The salads are great and can be shared because they do come big. The prices are very reasonable for both food and drinks. Buzz Aldrin is my favorite drink there. Best part, kitchen is open until 12am on weekends which is great if you're going out in the city and want to grab a late dinner.
