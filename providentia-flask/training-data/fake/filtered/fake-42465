Just had a party there last friday in the private room (cariage house). The staff was amazing, the food impecable and the service even better. The location is perfect for a group of 10-15 people. the staff decorated the room for that wonderful home feeling. They even went above and beyond and were able to find a memory card from one of my guests the following day. absolutely a great and memorable evening! Thank you !
