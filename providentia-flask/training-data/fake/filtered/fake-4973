this is my favorite restaurant in williamsburg!!!! the moqueca (shrimp stew) and the filet mignon sandwich are my favorites!!! while you are seating at beco you really feel like you are in brazil music is great!!! staff is super friendly and the waitresses are really HOT!!! highly recommended try the sakerinha!!! my favorite drink at this place and please do not miss the pao de queijo
