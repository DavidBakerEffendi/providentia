This is one of my favorite places to eat in New York City. The lines may be long, but the food is so worth the wait. I always get a rice plate and make sure to slather on the white sauce. Beware of the red sauce, as it is extremely spicy. Just a little bit will do. The food is piping hot when served and it's one of those kinds of meals where you may be full, but you are going to keep scooping that food into your mouth. If you get this in the winter, be sure to eat quickly as the food gets cold fast and it's not as enjoyable.
