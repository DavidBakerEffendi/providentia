I had never heard of this place, but my friend had eaten there, and, frankly, it was close to the theater where we were going, so it just made sense to eat there....walked in last night and the place was packed!  We took a table upstairs which was a little less hectic.  started out with a cocktail called a Southern Belle.  Champagne, strawberry something, and mint.  So incredibly delicious!  Not a frilly girlie drink at all...lovely, lovely strawberry essence and slight flavor, with the champagne cutting through whatever extra sweetness there is...I could have had 5 or 6 more of them, but ended up (only!) having 2.  We started out with the Shishito peppers, which were swathed in oil and cruchy Maldon salt.  Served along side was a grilled lemon half, which when squeezed on the peppers gave them just the right citrus-y tang.  Only issue here was that, while most or the peppers are not spicy at all, we were told that once in a while there was a hot one hanging out in the bunch. MThye weren't kidding about hot!!  Since I am not a spice girl, that ended my Shishito pepper experience.  Dinner brought the most divine, sexy, juicy, delicious, huge, properly cooked burger, which shared the plate the the most sensational, duck fat French fried potatoes.m Holy shit!  And the truffle aioli dipping sauce for them wasn't exactly shabby, either! Other than the noise level, which was practically deafening  this place really can't be beat!
