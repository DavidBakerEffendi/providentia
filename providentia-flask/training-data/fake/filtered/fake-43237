probably the best sushi you can find in the area for the price! Very affordable and always fresh. I live in the area and searched high and low until I found makato. The staff is friendly and their unlimited sushi deal is not a bad option if your stomach is going to be able to handle the endless amounts of food! only order as much as you can handle because they'll charge you for leaving food behind and you can't take it to go but its well worth it if you are with a group of people and want to have a nice night out.
