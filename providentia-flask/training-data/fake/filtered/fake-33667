Horrible experience. Just got back from there and I had my purse stolen from right under my nose. I had it hung on my chair when I sat down to eat. Never left the seat and When I got up Â to leave it was gone, nowhere to be found. My server kept saying that I might have just left it in the car or at home rather than trying to help out with the situation. used to love this place but after such an experience I don't think I will ever go back there. BEWARE on your next visit there. Filed a police report right there...such an unbelievable and traumatic experience.
