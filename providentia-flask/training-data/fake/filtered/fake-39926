Based on the many reviews here, I traveled to 79th street from Flushing to try this place.  It's in the space long occupied by Arunee Thai.   Yes, the remodel is modern and attractive, with comfortable faux barcelona chairs, and lots of mirrors. Our waitress, I believe an owner or manager, was pleasantly attentive and ultimately apologetic.  And yes, it is inexpensive for lunch at $8.50. The cook who earned all the five star reviews was either having a bad day or had just left town.    It was one of the most disappointing Thai meals I've ever had. Why so bad? The curry puff was not yet defrosted; I sent it back and it was replaced with an identical, but colder version. When eventually warm, it was tasty. The next dish, essentially Singapore Mai Fun, had the wrong meat in it; not a big deal, but it was oddly insipid, as if several ingredients were missing. The Pad See Yew, a favorite standard, had a nasty, off after taste which was traceable to the mistreated shrimp; and it too was otherwise flavorless and boring.  Pad Ka Prow with ground chicken was edible, but was far too sweet, as was the Pad Thai, which was drowned in sugar and tamarind syrup.  I ordered dishes that are hard to screw up, but they were. I suspect the cook was hired from a Chinese fast food place ...although I heard the owner speaking in the kitchen in Thai. I'm very reluctant to send dishes back, but had to do so here three times.  Thai food can and should be delicious, even if not spicy or "authentic."
