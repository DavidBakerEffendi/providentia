My husband and I went here with friends for brunch on a Sunday. This place is incredibly affordable for the amount of good food that you get to eat! Wow, we ate so much and it was all delicious. For $15 you can have unlimited juice, pastries, waffles, omelletes (made fresh to order at their little omelette/pasta station), pasta, meats (take your pick at the meat station), eggs benedict...literally almost any breakfast item you can think of. I had omelette, croissant, pasta, and OJ. My husband had omelette, waffle, meat, and pasta! The ambiance is peaceful. Attentive service, but not over-bearing. I highly recommend this place for Sunday brunch. I have had great brunch like this before, but not for this low price. I highly recommend it.
