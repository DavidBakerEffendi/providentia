The dosas are great, but the atmosphere and disposable plates and utensils knock it down two stars for me.  I hate having to contribute trash to a landfill just to eat in a restaurant.  It makes me feel guilty, like I should have eaten at home.  Plus it's tacky.  Is it really that much more effort and cost to wash real plates?  Seriously--if you want, I'd even go back there and wash it myself.  But anyway, as the other white folks around me sawed at their dosas with silly plastic knives, I ate mine with my hands, adding the pleasure of defiance to the light, crisp bite of the dosa. As for the food: the first time I went with some Indian friends, and we got the traditional dosa, which was excellent.  Yesterday, alone, I tried to make a nice balanced meal out of it: a veggie chicken dosa with spinach, tomato and onion.  The veggie chicken is AWESOME.  Definitely add the sambar so you can soak it up with the non-filled parts of your dosa.  I liked the cilantro chutney, but why do we have to choose just one? :(  I want to try ALL OF THEM.  A way more funner solution: a little chutney bar where sauce addicts like me could serve our own into washable ramekins.  This might add a bit to food costs, but the restaurant would save on stupid throwaway plastic containers probably laden with endocrine disruptors that cause cancer (and even worse, small penises). One other downer for vegans: the Madras coffee is pre-made with milk.  Would be nice to offer it with soymilk or simply zero milk.  And with most of the special (American) dosa orders, you need to ask them to leave off the cheese.  Otherwise, it's quite vegetarian and vegan-friendly.
