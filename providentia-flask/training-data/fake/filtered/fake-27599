I've been living in this neighborhood for years and my family is Italian. We always go here for celebrations. The pizza is fantastic and the service is great. There is a large outside area with a lot of tables, and an inside diner where you can order food and have it served to you! Their ice cream is delicious. It's a great place to order from if you're having guests over.
