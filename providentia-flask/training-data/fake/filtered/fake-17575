I couldn't believe the number of 5 star reviews this place has, so I went by at brunch to check it out.   Long wait for pretty ok food, pretty ok prices, decent atmosphere. Once we got sat, thing went better.  Free drink was nice. I mentioned the waiter (who was perfunctory, but not rude or anything) all the great reviews, and he kind of shrugged and admitted that the management "suggests" that staff write reviews.  That explains how a pretty average place gets such great reviews, but I subtracted a star nonetheless!
