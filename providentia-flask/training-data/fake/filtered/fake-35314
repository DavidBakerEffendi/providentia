i used to go to this restaurant all the time while it was called mr. chicken. the food was great. then the basement flooded and mr chicken was replaced w/ fusion and a new staff and management. the food was disappointing. my second time around w/ fusion and the chicken was undercooked. needless to say i do not see myself returning anytime soon. the customer service given after i presented management w/ my problem was exemplory however i am still disgusted.
