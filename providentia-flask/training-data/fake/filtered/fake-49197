You would think that such a carefully decorated place would have an excellent menu and service to match... unfortunately this is not the case. The menu is over priced and very scattered (not like an Applebees/Fridays selection at all). Although the focus is Asian Fusion, you would expect a more suitable family style menu...especially given it's location. Food quality is alright and the music is really annoying at times (Beatles playing one min and some foreign Asian mountain music the next). Sushi selections are not what I expected either.. want sushi? Take the extra 10 mins to drive further down to Yu-Yee. The management in this place seems like a joke... there was absolutely no structure. Employees were walking around aimlessly and the manager/hostess (dressed in street clothes) walked around with a bowl of food to their faces eating on the floor! The staff joked loudly and conversed with one another across the room. If you plan on trying it out, do it soon because at this rate I see them lasting about as long as the Boulder Creek that used to be there.
