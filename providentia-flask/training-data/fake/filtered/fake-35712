MIND BLOWN !!! The Plate for 2 is a steal of a deal ! Under $20 gets you like 3 pounds of meat a big Greek salad and your choice of any side, the good thing is that they let me mix the meats so I got to try they're different meats and they are all mind blowingly delicious! For a side I recommend the baked lemon potatoe wedges! I'm not from the area but I will deff be back for more next week.
