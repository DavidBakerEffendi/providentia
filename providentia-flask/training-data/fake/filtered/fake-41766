It is terribly sad that when a natural disaster strikes so many people have to suffer.  Bakehouse was unfortunately hit pretty badly by Super storm Sandy, and although they were essentially the new kid on the block they were definitely in the process of being a neighborhood institution.  The service, the food, the atmosphere, and the staff are top notch; they are a family through and through and one meal there you feel like part of the clan.  They have been knocked down by the storm (temporarily) but they will bounce back, they have too.  In the meantime we will miss their Truffle Omelet, the infamous Bakehouse Burger, the Ricotta Pancakes that melt in your mouth, the homemade pastries and breads, the list goes on and on.  We, the neighborhood, the Bakehouse babies, and the city of New York need you to come back really, really soon!!!!
