I love Bar Bruno. I just finished a delightful dinner there and I can't say enough great things about it.  My husband had to work late and I didn't feel like cooking so I took my 15 month old son out for dinner.  First of all as many other reviewers said the decor is cute and welcoming, very bistro.  Secondly, the music was great and put me in a great mood.  There was an excellent mix of 60's and 80's music but it was not at all intrusive.  The food, as always, was great.  It is nothing, crazy out of this world but it is delicious and perfect for what it is.  My son and I split the corn and the fish tacos.  Lastly, the service was unbelievably  wonderful.  Our server, Enzo, was attentive, sweet, charming and best of all when my son got a little fussy, Enzo snatched him up so I could get a few bites of food in with out having to tend to a cranky toddler.  Bar Bruno is exactly what it should be, a perfect neighborhood restaurant where you feel at home.
