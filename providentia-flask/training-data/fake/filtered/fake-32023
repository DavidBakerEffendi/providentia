this is one of the best indian restaurant in iselin area...even though i am from nyc i work in islin so i have tried most indian/pakistani restaurant ..so i would say this restaurant would be on my top 3 list in indian/pakistani resturant in nj....the food is prepaid right after you order so you know you having something fresh rather then food that is sat there for hours.. another good thing is the prices... an avg dish would run you for about $9 or $10...one of my favorite dish in this restaurant is panner tikka masala...its one of their best dish along with chicken tikka and fish pokadaa....
