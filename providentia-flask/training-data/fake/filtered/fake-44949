Ordered something simple small pizza with pepperoni and pineapple, took 2 hours to arrive and when I got there the driver gave me an attitude about her tip (only $3 for a tip she said) I remind her of the 2 hour wait and that was a lot for a $12 order. I get the Lukewarm pizza inside and see that is completely flipped on its self which meant someone dropped it. Never ever again!
