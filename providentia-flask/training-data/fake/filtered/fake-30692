This is one of the most poorly run establishments I have ever been in. First of all, the food is overpriced and not very good. It takes forever for the food to come out and having worked in the restaurant business for many years, it is unacceptable. The staff is horrendous and more interested in socializing with each other, rather than focusing on the customer and making sure the order is correct. I was also a witness to several drug deals taking place over the bar, as I was sitting right there. That is pathetic. I WOULD NEVER recommend this restaurant to anyone. Don't waste your time, money, or tastebuds on such a crappy place. The owners are clearly making money in spite of themselves.
