Soba-Ya is such a fab place, so much loved by me that I've been known to go there in coldest weather, or hottest! Food is great, atmosphere so nice with singles, couples, families, and mostly Japanese, along with neighbors.... Food is very simply well prepared and wonderfully served. It can b a bit pricey but I promise it's well worth it!
