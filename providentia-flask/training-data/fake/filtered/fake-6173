My husband and I used to live around the corner from this precious place about 8 years ago.  We ate there at least once or twice a week (no mortgage and no kids!). Although we live in NJ now, we came back to see Peter Gabriel in concert about 3 weeks ago and decided to go to L'Angolo for a romantic dinner at our favorite ristorante in the world.  I guess we had been away too long and forgot that they need reservations!  We showed up and saw the same chef and the same head waiter who had been there before and we were THRILLED...but alas, we were told that without a reservation we wouldnt be able to be seated.  Heartbroken, we left our phone number and waited outside on the dim hope that a table would open up while we considered any and all other options.   Not 20 minutes later, the waiter poked his head out and signalled for us to come back in.  He had gone out of his way to rearrange some seatings and we had the most delightful dinner we'd had in years. The food is ALWAYS incredible (the grilled asparagus wrapped in prosciutto with shrimp was FANTASTIC!), the prices are reasonable....but the heart of this little BYOB is always in the right place and the staff made sure that our trip to L'Angolo was not wasted.  We appreciate that so very much...it made our night that all the more special.  THANK YOU, L'Angolo, for being the PERFECT combination of good food and kind hearts.
