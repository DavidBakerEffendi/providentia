We love Mama Palmas.  We moved into the neighborhood about three months ago and this is the first restaurant we tried.  They were very friendly and welcoming and the pizza was top notch.  The toppings are fresh and the variety of pizzas are inspired.  My children and I love the clams and garlic pizza, and my husband always orders a plain cheese "if it's truly good pizza, then all you need is a cheese pizza". We just had family in town for the holidays and took them there for dinner - they left raving about the food and the warm, friendly experience.
