The BEST TAKEOUT-DELIVERY in the area!!!! Very tasty Fast food and some pretty YUMMY Home-style chicken!!!!!!!! Have seen many places come and go in this area and THIS ONE REMAINS by far the best choice!!!! Try the Chicken Sandwich----secret recipe. Even the Mac and Cheese on Fridays! And the coffee outranks most franchised brands in taste. Breakfast Catered Deliveries are awaited events at the office. Freshly baked muffins, and quite LARGE. Waitresses are nice, except resemble old ALICE cast in style. Rest of staff Family run -working hard to get your order out quick!! and thats always good for me!
