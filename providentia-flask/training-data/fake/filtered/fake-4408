Wow. What a tremendous meal and experience. With a little help from our awesome waitress, Christina, we enjoyed a delicious, flavorful, and unique meal. Six Bluebird Oysters and poutine to start. The oysters were  fresh, had a lot of body and a balanced briny flavor. The poutine was to die for, with rich beef gravy and fresh cheese curds that melted in our mouths. She had the double beef burger cooked medium. Check out the pictures. They don't even do justice to the flavor. Not too greasy and slathered in sautéed onions cooked to perfection. I got the macaroni and tomato ragout per Christina's recommendation. Fresh pasta twirls in a hearty meat sauce with chunk Roma tomatoes and sautéed onions, so rich and filling I could only manage half. We split a sumptuous warm aple crisp for dessert. Like the rest of our meal, it came out plated nicely, steaming with a scoop of fresh vanilla ice cream in a cast iron serving dish atop a rustic wooden block. The crumb topping was buttery but crisp and the apples as sweet as can be, with just the right amount of cinnamon. We sipped our authentic Russian Standard dirty martinis from start to finish and enjoyed thoroughly! Christina was warm, attentive, and very helpful, offering her recommendations eagerly (and knowledgeably) when asked and they were never off the mark. She even gave us recommendations for enjoying the rest of our evening in beautiful, quaint Burlington. We may com back in the summer just to come here again.
