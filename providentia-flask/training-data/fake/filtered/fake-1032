Mamma Flora's is my favorite Italian restaurant in the Ewing area. It is my favorite restaurant to order pizza delivery from, and also my favorite restaurant to sit down for a dinner with friends or family. The pizza is Trenton-style with a thinner, crisper crust than a typical pizza. I have tried many different varieties of their pizza, including the Tomato Pie, Margarita, Greek-style, and, of course, Classic Cheese Pizza. I also am a big fan of their appetizers and dinner entrees. Their house-dressing for their salads is excellent. I also like their fried calamari. The entree portions are generous and delicious. I am a big fan of the pasta and seafood offerings. Linguini with clams in white wine sauce is one of my favorite dishes, and Mamma Flora's makes it expertly. It is a lovely family atmosphere, BYO (which is great!), and always has attentive and friendly service. I recommend Mamma Flora's to all my friends and family who visit the Ewing area.
