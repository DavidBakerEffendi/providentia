Met with some friends at Ward III for some late drinks and snacks. The food was very good, we had a selection of their small plates, and all were well above average quality. The mixed drinks were especially good, and the bartender who made them was fantastic. The atmosphere in there was less than fantastic though; very loud, almost had to scream to be heard. And a bunch of drunk and aggressive B&T idiots made for a less than great experience. One even challenged me to a fight after he accidentally grabbed my jacket and tried to leave with it... after trying to get my jacket back he flipped out. Luckily for me he backed down after his girlfriend calmed him down and basically told him he was being an idiot. So, overall, the bar itself is good, the bartender is fantastic, but the clientele is less than great. And they really need to turn down the music a bit.
