Newly opened BBQ SmokeHouse in Robbinsville, NJ.  I purchased a take-out order for four on their first day of operation and we loved every bite.  St Louis style dry rub was meaty, tasty and perfect picture of what a dry rub rib should look like.  Smoked whole chicken was moist and pulled apart real easy.  Maybe a little too heavy on the smoke flavor but I chalk that up to start-up and look forward to a second sampling next week.  Sides were good also with a unique and flavorful blend of baked beans, a must-have tomato green bean mix and freshly done fries.  I also purchased a jar of their homemade BBQ sauce which I had already come to know from various local farmer's marts.  As always, delicious!   I have no relationship with this business other than the desire to have great BBQ within walking distance from where I live.  It's in the Foxmoor Plaza off route 33 and Washington Blvd in Robbinsville.
