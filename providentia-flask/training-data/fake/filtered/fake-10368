I'm afraid to write too effusive a review as it might not make it past the bullshit filter.In the ten years it's been open, Cafe Steinhof has become a neighborhood institution, I've been a loyal customer since shortly after it opened. The food is excellent, a mix of Austrian standards augmented by some very good seafood and pasta dishes. The ambiance is laid back, homey and arty. The music eclectic and appropriate to the hour. The things I like most about Cafe Steinhof is the staff and the bar crowd. All of the staff and the majority of patrons are interesting, intelligent and creative people involved in music, film, theater, visual arts, nary a bond trader or lawyer in the bunch.
