Eating brunch on a Sunday in NYC can be a real drag, especially if the place is popular.  5 Leaves is the exception to the rule.  EVERYONE was polite and accommodating.  Service was top notch and the food ruled. We waited 15 minutes and the place was packed.  While we waited we saw the owner out there making sure the customers were taken care of by shaking hands, busing tables and serving coffee.  You could tell he is working hard to make sure the place runs smooth. I had the pancakes which were farkin' delicious.  My kid (4 years old) had some eggs and toast which they made up special for him.  He inhaled that and ate half my pancakes.  They were very nice to the boy, by the way which was a bonus.     Everyone was happy with their meal and really enjoyed the experience.  I was very impressed with the place; they were nice to hipsters, locals and tourists alike and can't wait to go again.
