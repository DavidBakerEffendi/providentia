I greatly recommend this establishment.  From speaking with other customers its gone through a recent ownership change in Sept. 2010.  The change has greatly improved the quality of food and service.  I'm a huge fan of boneless spare ribs, they are amazing here.  Sauce is on point, texture is soft and refreshing.  Give them a shot!!!!
