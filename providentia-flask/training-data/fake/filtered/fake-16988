Can't get behind a restaurant whose owner tells patrons "F*** you" simply for telling someone else you didn't think he was the owner and a waitstaff that openly disparages other customers in front of customers. Pizza was so mediocre for this awful treatment. If they hadn't already charged me, I would have walked out when my friends were kicked out.
