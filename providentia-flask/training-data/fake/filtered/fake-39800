Walked in at 10:47. The door unlocked and music up. The only person there says "Sorry we don't open till 11:00", unsure if I will return. Went back after getting shut down by being 12 min early. Got provolone wit. Other posters are correct, the bread is wrong. And the meat is a bit stringy, causing chunks to come out of the sandwich with every bite. I threw half of it away. My advice is go to 99 Miles To Philly in the east village. All around better sandwich with a returning customer card. Buy nine and the tenth is free.
