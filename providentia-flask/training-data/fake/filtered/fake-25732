Katz's used to be pretty good in the  80's to 2000. The quality was never as good as legion ave ; or the whalley ave deli's of yesteryear but it was good and worth the trip. We went there several times recently; as well as ordered out and have been disappointed each time. The corn beef was dried out; the pastrami was fatty; the chicken soup was; bland- tasteless; the chicken salad unflavored. Each time the sandwiches were made wrong- reuben's not grilled; dressing omitted ; forgot the swiss; service lacking.  Cooks had an attitude. Worst encounter was the owner!!!  RUDE does not begin to describe this individual!  I had heard from friends and associates that he was less than a gentleman ; but to witness it in person; first hand was revolting. He made the comment-  his problem was his "customers were old and Jewish". Very sad and uncalled for. He knows he has a monopoly as the only Deli in the area and is capitalizing on it. With Abel's downhill spiral ; there is little in the area for catering etc. We won't be frequenting this establishment again. We will order from NY Katz over night. I do hope it improves for the wonderful people in the area!
