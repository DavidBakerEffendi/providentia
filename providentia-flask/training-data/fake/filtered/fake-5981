Went here with a friend last month. It was a quiet night so not too crowded. The waiter was helpful and guided us through their menu. We opted to buy a number of things and share. Each dish was unique and well presented. Decent wine and beer selection as well. I would definitely come back here on a date. They have a few specialty meats as well that I didn't try but would love to.
