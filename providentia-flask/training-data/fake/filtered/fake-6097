Great place for Thai food! My three friends and I went on a Saturday night, no waiting time which was great and a great table. I ordered Pad Thai which actually came pretty fast, the dish was delicious and everybody seemed to be happy with their orders as well! The only two reasons why I don't give it a five is that there wasn't as much meat as I would normally have on this dish... Â sorry but I love meat. The service was pretty good too.
