After a leisurely stroll with my husband on Graham Ave, we decided to walk into this newly opened bar.  Williamsburg has more pop-up bars than I can count, so what a pleasant surprise it was when we were invited in so warmly by the owner James,This guy is top-notch.  He welcomed us like family and chatted with us, then introduced us to his staff and asked Alex the bartender to fix us his signature drink called "Brooklyn Ting" (say it with a Jamaican accent) that was absolutely AWESOME a must have.  I really loved the place, the drink, the warm inviting atmosphere, the friendly staff but must of all I was impressed by James the humble owner.  He shared how important it is to him to help our community by making purchases from the area as well as hiring his employees from the neighborhood.  Sweet Science is here to stay for a long time.
