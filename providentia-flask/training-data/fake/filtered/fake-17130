Went to the Ugly for a quick night snack.  Ordered wings which Arrive in a foolish temperature. Friend ordered a salad (expensive for what she received).  Service was a thumbs down.  We felt that anything we asked for (drinks or otherwise) was a shore. When I asked for the bill the waiter slammed the bill on the table and kept walking to sit with the other waiters and the owner.  I was shocked and taken aback by this event.  When I commented that slamming the bill on the table was rude the owner, sporting a neck collar, identified herself to tell me the waiter did not "intend" to slam the bill.  No apology just an attempt to explaining the state of mind of the waiter.  The place lacked any sense of professional decorum when dealing with its patrons.  Been there before and was not impressed. So the ugly behavior of the owner and staff is not worth dealing with at all.  At the end a good time with friends turned into a "pain in the neck".
