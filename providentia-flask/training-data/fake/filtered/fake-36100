This place is great!  Years ago, my husband took me to South Street for the first time and we decided to stop into La Fourno's for pizza.  Being that I am a caesar salad lover, I made a last minute switcheroo and ordered their caesar salad.  It was incredible.  As a caesar salad lover, I give theirs a 5 out of 5! About a year later I introduced another couple to the place and they fell in love as well.  The four of us make a regular trip to La Fourno's from Lancaster and York, PA (which is quite a haul) with the primary focus of having caesar salad and pizza at La Fourno's.  Our husbands swear by their pizza as well...and I agree, it's delish! This past weekend the four of us had a trip scheduled to Hightstown, New Jersey to visit friends and immediately upon confirming the date of the trip, text messages were shooting all around to confirm that we'd be making a pit-stop at La Fourno's on the way.   Aside from the charm of the place, their staff is very polite and they make you feel very welcome.  In the years we've been going there we've never had a less than fantastic experience and will continue to plan regular trips to South Street and La Fourno's! I can't wait until our next "excuse" to head towards Philly!
