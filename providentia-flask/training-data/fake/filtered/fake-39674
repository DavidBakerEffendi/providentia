this place after change of ownership really sucks ! the food now are tasteless and very simple order ,yet they can't make it right. i have tried their mee goreng,cantonese fried noodles,singapore fried noodles and "kapitan fried noodles" , and they all really sucks and tasteless. Maybe if you are not a Malaysian,then you wouldn't notice a difference at all. i just have one advice for the people who wanna eat there ...."do not waste you money and ruin you apetite and let it spoilt your mood for the day or night"
