I celebrated my 6th anniversary with my fianc√©e here! I'm a newbie to Cuban food. It was an interesting experience, filled with flavorful eats. This place was jammed pack that night! We ordered the plantain chips with guacamole and the three different types of ceviche as appetizers. I especially enjoyed the shrimp & lobster ceviche!!! As for the main course, I ordered the Lechon Asado. Disappointed. I felt like a grease ball after two bites! If you enjoy consuming pork rinds, this dish will suit you... One of these days, I may swing by for happy hour.
