One word: Awful!  My Brazilian husband and I had been going to this small and quaint restaurant for years.  The chef/owner and waitresses were always friendly and attentive, and the food delicious.  Last night however all that changed.  Perhaps the positive reviews have gone to the chef/owner's head... We made our usual dinner visit last night and right away noticed the new staff.  The food took long to arrive and only part of the order was ever brought out.  We tried repeatedly to get the waiter's attention (the place is tiny!) but he simply ignored us.  His focus was on the larger tables.  So after a long wait we decided to leave.  I actually had to go to the counter to get the check and when I expressed my disappointment to the waiter, he told me "If you don't like it you don't have to come back".  I was so stunned by the comment that I asked to see the chef/owner who came out, and while he was mildly apologetic, he was mostly dismissive and couldn't be bothered.  This lack of basic customer service is unacceptable.  Nope - we will never, ever go back to Malagueta. There are plenty of Brazilian restaurants in the area with excellent food and service that are 'hungry' for new business.
