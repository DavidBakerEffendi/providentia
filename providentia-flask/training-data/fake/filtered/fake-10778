Let me tell ya, Pat's and Geno's are overrated. They are for tourists who don't know any better. The lines are way too long for a cheesesteak that is just ok compared to the BEST. Try going to Steve's Prince of Steaks on Bustleton Avenue. THis place is Pat's like because of the way they cut their meat, but the American with onions wins it for me. Andno, we're not talikng about plain American cheese we are talking about this Merican being melted like wiz. I know philly inside and out, and trust me I would bet my paycheck on the best of the best.
