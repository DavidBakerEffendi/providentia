Amazing Wen't with my Fiance and our friends. We all go out to eat all over central new jersery looking for new places to try. We just moved to the area and going to get some groceries at the shoprite next door we noticed a pizza place. Last night I decided to take my friends out to eat there to see how it was. Ordered some large pies, garlic knots and pitchers of soda. Very inexpensive for everything, and when the pizza came you could see the all the extra cheese on it that we ordered. Â All of us were stuffed by the end of the night and very satisfied with what we had got. The employees were very friendly and talked to us like people and not just an order. I had asked if they do delivery, which I found out they do, and now when I throw event's at my house. I am most likely going to give these guys a call first for my service. My fiance and friends all enjoyed the food and are excited to come back.
