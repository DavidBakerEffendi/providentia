Wonderful place!. Huge selection of teas, very quaint. I liked it better when it was less well-known, but I guess any quality establishment gets crowded after it gets discovered in New York. Good lunch specials and I find it' s a good place to go for a tranquil, refined meal as a break from the chaos of NY. Highly recommend anything from their menu.Black sesame creme brulee, Japanese toast with jasmine ice cream, amazing desserts, amazing savory dishes, amazing soups, amazing service. Â What an adorable tea place!
