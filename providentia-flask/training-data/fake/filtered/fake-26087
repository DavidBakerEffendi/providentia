Food is terribly inconsistent.   Fried calamari was served to us with a doughy, uncooked center.  Tried to flag down our waitress who was too busy eating to be bothered.  Came to see what our problem was with a full mouth.  We actually had to wait for her to stop chewing for a response. They can't cook a steak right to save their lives.  Order it rare and you get well.  order it medium rare and you get well.  The only time they get it right is when you order it well. This is just a place for drinks.
