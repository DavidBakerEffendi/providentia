I've been to Walter's about six times already and have had a great experience every single time.  I honestly don't know what some of the people below are talking about... (unfortunately, i think Brooklynites love to hate on new restaurants)  First of all, the restaurant is beautiful.  It is cozy and inviting and the vibe is always fun.  Whenever I go, everyone around me seems to be having a wonderful time.  The staff is friendly and the service has been really great. The menu is delicious.  I've tried quite a few items, but I'd have to say that my favorite dishes are the clams with garlic bread, the duck buns, the meatballs (yumm!), the bibb salad, the roasted chicken, the fried chicken and the french dip.  Not to mention the chocolate bread pudding for dessert!  I went last weekend for brunch.  My friend and I shared the friend chicken and waffles and the eggs benedict.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  They also have the best Bloody Mary's I've ever had.   This neighborhood needed a place like Walter's and I would recommend it to everyone!
