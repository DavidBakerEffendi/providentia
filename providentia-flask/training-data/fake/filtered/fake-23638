A friend loves this place, and the atmosphere is nice.  But I was seriously turned off by the staff and the burgers were seriously undercooked.  One person ordered medium well, and the burger was medium rare (Mostly pink).  Another ordered medium, and the burger was rare (warm, but all pink).  After eating about half, we gave the medium-well back to the server, stating we were fine with paying for it as is, and don't want another (it takes about 45 minutes to get one), but no serious cook would consider this medium-well.  The server gave it to the manager, who retorted with "We cook our burgers 'steak done'"  Having worked in restaurants before I said 'Seriously, steak done is not totally red for medium well'... He was nothing but an a**hole still.   I mean, seriously, you charge $20 for a burger, at least tell people you cook it about 2 levels less than normal, and don't be total assholes when people complain, if that's what you do. What happened to the customer is always right?   I guarantee if the manager had taken the burger to the cook and asked how he thought this burger was ordered, he would not have said medium-well....  But, we'll never know because the manager was an a*hole and just gave us the check anyway (a check for over $200 i'll add--we weren't drinking water...) The cask conditioned ale is awesome, and the appetizers we had were good too.  But their head has gotten too big about how to cook a burger, and definitely order it 2 levels more cooked then you normally would --- I can only assume if you order a well burger it will come with a layer of pink in the middle, based on how they cooked burgers ordered medium and medium-well....
