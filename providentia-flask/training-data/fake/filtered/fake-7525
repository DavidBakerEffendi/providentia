Never go there if you had a voucher from Livignsocial or Groupon. Awful service and I suspect that they served my friend leftovers of mac n cheese of the lady who sat next to us. Feeling yucking about the whole experience. The only good thing were the cocktails. The food is the most mediocre one I've tasted.
