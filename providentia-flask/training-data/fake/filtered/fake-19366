A great ambiance, an extremely welcoming and friendly staff, and outstanding food. That's my core impression of Revolution Kitchen from this past Friday night. The place was hopping at about 7:30 on Friday night, but I conveniently found a place at the open bar with my friend, as the table seating was about a 30 minute wait (totally worth it, by the way). I started the night out with some local Lost Nation Saison brew and Pan-Fried Wontons, followed by the Tempeh Reuben Sandwich on Slow Fire Baguette... I think the Wontons, with their almost ragoon-like qualities and texture, would please even some of the pickiest meat eaters. And the Tempeh Reuben? You've got to try it. Pretty full as it were from the mix of goodies, I needed to try one of Debra's homemade desserts: so I caved for the Blueberry Tart made with Almond Flour. I am so happy I did. I highly recommend Revolution Kitchen for anyone looking for a really cool spot and real people.
