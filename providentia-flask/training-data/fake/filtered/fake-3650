In New York for a visit and my daughter took me to Buttermilk Channel. AMAZING! We went for the brunch and the food was the best I have had in New York,. Â Before out meal, the waiter brought us a walnut cinnamon roll and a jelly roll. It was a great start for what was to come. Delicious! Every item on the menu looked good so had a hard time deciding. I had the burger....best burger in New York I was told and now I understand why. We also ordered the scramble and the apple, smoked bacon and grilled cheese sandwich. Our meal was perfect and even though I was so full when we left I couldn't help but wish I had also ordered the Pecan French Toast. Yum! If you are staying in the city it is well worth the commute to Brooklyn. I can't wait to go back!
