It is a requirement for anyone in the city to stop by this dumpling house!!.. probably one of these best dumpling joints around in Chinatown. You literally can just spend $5 bucks and you got yourself a full meal!! I would highly recommend the duck pancake and hot and sour soup!! they are to die for!! The wait might be long, but it is worth it and could be packed at times, but why wouldn't it I mean the food is amazing!!
