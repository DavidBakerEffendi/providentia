After reading the reviews, we were really looking forward to trying the food.  Ordered a variety of items for take out, and was horribly disappointed.  A truly epic fail.  The hummus was good.  The lamb tikka kabob was dreadful, consisting of 6 quarter-sized pieces of dry,  tough lamb, a huge amount of "Persian rice", and a chunk of stale bread.  The salad was good.  The gyro platter had okay flavor, but again, the meat was overcooked...the flavor came mostly from the sauces.  The beef kofta was also dry, which is remarkable given it was drenched in sauce.  The baklava was obviously a supermarket-grade, previously frozen item that had little to no taste other than sugar.  The young woman at the counter seemed sullen and uninterested.  What a shame.
