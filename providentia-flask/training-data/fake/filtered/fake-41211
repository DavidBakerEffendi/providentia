Bf and I went here over the weekend. The hostess said the wait was an hour forty five  but we were seated an hour and a half. Kudos to them. I've never waited  that long for dinner and they don't take reservations which I am not a fan of.   But overall I was impressed with a couple of factors. Food:   For appetizers we had the crispy pork belly and pork buns. I did not think these were good despite all the rave reviews.  I've had these dishes elsewhere and they pale in comparison here. For dinner I had karaka men with tamago added and they were excellent. I liked this ramen way better than shin sen gumi but the bf's akamaru modern wasn't as good. Food - 3 1/2 Service:  such excellent service.  The staff was awesome. I requested hot water because it was freezing outside and they were very accommodating.  Water was never empty and the food was out in matters of fifteen minutes of sitting down. Now if this was fine dining restaurant I would question the 15mins food but this was street food and I commend them for getting the service and food waiting factor down to the tee. 5+ Decor:  cool trendy vibe. 3 1/2 Now if only I can befriend the hostess or the owners is I wouldn't have to wait in the hour and a half line!  Would I come back?  Maybe when I figure out which night is a slow night for them. Perhaps a weeknight. But until they have a reservation system (which I doubted) I won't be spending another weekend night here.
