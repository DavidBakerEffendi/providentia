I have to admit that I truly enjoyed the authentic taste of the food.  The Mole has to be one of the best I have ever tasted and their Tamales are amazingly good.  I am a huge enthusiast of Mexican food, especially Chilaquiles Verdes and they have the best Green sauce I have tasted.  I will definitely be returning and recommending them to friends and family. Thank You Leidy Z. la Casi Casi for recommending me to this nice little restaurant!
