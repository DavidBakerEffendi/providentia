Think about this for a second. SAMPAN has been open almost 5 months now. 3 Managers, 11 out of 14 servers and 5 out of 6 bartenders have quit. SAMPAN is the most negative restaurant in all of Philly, You feel it as soon as you walk into the place, even with the beautiful colors. The Chef/Owner calls everyone of his employees retarded. (Hello it's 2010) what's up with using that name. I guess we all can't be as great as you Chef Schulson. Keep copying other Chefs recipes, your doing real well. STARR made you, your a face and a so-so COOK. OR How bout the "C" word used towards one of your food runners and the constant name calling of what her sexuality is. The GM is a DOPE. Doesnt know the difference between a glass of Chardonnay or Merlot. This character is the most DISINGENOUS person in the history of the world. (I'm not over stating this fact) Randall noone wants to hear about you leather parties and the Chaps you were, or your Nipple rings. Keep stealing others ideas saying they are yours. Then back stabbing them. Your REP sure does proceed you all these years in this city. Why is it that your own group of people dont come to SAMPAN. Maybe its because they know your a joke and your not liked by them. This restaurant is full of HARRASMENT. Your menu is WAY OVER PRICED. The next time you dine at SAMPAN check out the dishwasher who just took out the trash, prepping your food. What is going on with the 2 by 4's now on the face of your restaurant? What's up with the Graffiti bar? how does it fit into what you going for ? Your Main bar is a joke, way to shorten it for no reason other then make it harder for your bartenders to work out of. CHEF & GM, neither one of you 2 have a clue on what you want out of your restaurant nor do you know what goes on. you 2 need to "STAY TRUE" Â arent they your words. you 2 are terrible people when its all laid out on the table. KARMA will be a bitch.
