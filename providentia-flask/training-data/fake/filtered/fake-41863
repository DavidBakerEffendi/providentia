I went here with my husband by chance - we were just passing by and it was a good thing to because we had one of the best bolognese sauces we have ever had. We keep coming back and each time we argue over who gets to order it and who had to try something new. If you are in the neighborhood give this place a try - the ravioli (which they change daily) is always good.
