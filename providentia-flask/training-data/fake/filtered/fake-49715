We have just dined at Frere de Lys, what a wonderful experience in NY and a great find for UES. We are visiting from Australia. The meals were excellent my husband had the salmon and I the chicken, beautiful flavours, what a delightful restaurant, the decor is simple but beautiful so enhances the AMBIENCE, the personalities of these two young men running this restaurant make it a memorable dining experience.
