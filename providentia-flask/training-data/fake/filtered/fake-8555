After returning to NYC from my SanFrancisco home, first stop (seriously, luggage and all) was Toloache!  Have been looking forward to the Triple Guacamole appie for months, the huite lacocha was even better than I remembered, and the truffle-gazed black cod was off-the-charts. I wish we had a Toloache in SF!!!  (I know, ironic, right?)
