We decided to go to Mamoun's because of the rave reviews on Yelp.  However, we were totally let down. I have celiac disease and am reactive to MSG.  I went there last night and I would NOT recommend this restaurant to people with food sensitivities.  While the service was really bad, the waitress did try very hard to accommodate my needs. Unfortunately I got sick.  The main issue was that they didn't know what was in any of the food.  I find this fact particularly surprising as it is a small, independently owned restaurant with a limited menu. Setting all of the above aside, I still wouldn't recommend this place.  We got two chicken kabob plates and a side of hummus-- it was nearly 30 dollars with tip! We def. overpaid as for our dry chicken and iceberg lettuce.
