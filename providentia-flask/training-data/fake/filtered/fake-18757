What Penelope does that many restaurants do not, is it totally delivers what it promises.  You walk inside and immediately sense that it's a comfortable community place.  The vibe is laid back, with personal touches added everywhere.  Many of the staff have been there for years and they are friendly and down to earth.  This is home, comfort food and all - but generally with a delightful twist. In some cases, Penelope truly surprises: their Spinach Artichoke dip is devine and chunky, the best I've ever had.  The "Nice Chicken Meatballs" (either with the lighter salad or substantial sandwich) are moist and cheesy and full of delicious herbs.  The Red Velvet Cake truly might be my favorite in New York (their baked items in general are delicious). Brunch is totally worth the wait.  Buying their homemade granola to-go is totally worth the money, at least once! Come to Penelope and find your favorite dishes, and then come back again and again and again... Just like coming home!
