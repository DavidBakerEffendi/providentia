Had a fabulous New Year's Day dinner from Banh mi Zon! The beef stew is amazingly light, with just the right amount of subtle flavors that add up to a great entree. The pork sandwich was perfect, with crisp, fresh bread, and incredibly fresh veg layered with tasty pork filling. We also tried the green papaya salad as well as the mango salad--both winners. Remember to have the Vietnamese coffee--it's like dessert with a kick of caffeine. The ingredients are so very fresh, it brought to mind Hale Vietnam in Honolulu.
