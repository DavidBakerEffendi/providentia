Sorry guys. Not a fan. Have met the guy owner once or twice and didn't seem very into the local/organic/vegetarianism things that they are trying to supposedly sell through this restaurant. Other points: PRICEY for NOT that good food. Horrible dessert, very hard cake and cupcakes (like they had been made a week ago and had just been sitting there). Breakfast sandwich thing with cheese was tiny, expensive and actually very, very disappointing and wilty-looking. I just kept going here to make it a point to like it and then at some point I just had to say enough.
