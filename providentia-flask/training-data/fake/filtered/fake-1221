Despite the long waiting, I'm a regular here. The best time to go try their epic ramen is probably after 10pm on weekdays, so you only wait for 30 mins or so. The line's just consistent, never even thought about going there as a big group, although they have a very spacious eating area for a ramen place. I know it's crazy but it's that good. I would just wait & hang at the bar meantime, their ramen's worth the waiting.
