A great example of how the work at the front door, and excellent food can be ruined by campiness...and just a poor attitude from a server.  We arrived at 9:30...no reservations...and were told that it would be about an hour wait..we decided.let's stay..nice atmosphere..fellow yelpers like it..so why not.. The hostess were all very nice and courteous...the atmosphere was nice..although a bit hot... To our surprise 25 minutes into our expected wait time we were given a very nice table...The sommelier came to visit..we ordered a very very nice..and expensive Barolo...but well worth it.. The pasta was amazing..we had the fettucine with olive oil, butter and pepper...simple..and well executed..we shared this.  I had the Saltimbocca and my guest had the spicy peppered chicken...all amazing as was the escarole. Ok..so here is where all this is ruined..our waiter was elusive at best...when we sat and received the wine I asked him..can you bring us a couple..few pieces of Reggiano Parmigiano to nibble on...his response was..well we dont do that here...but I will see what I can do..again...it was indeed on the menu...the dessert menu..which i did not know at the time..would have made it worse for me...15 minutes later he materialized with a well presented cheese plate..not what i wanted at all..but nice..I mean..i just wanted a quick little piece of cheese for the first taste of the wine..was not looking for a freebee...its the principal..and its not like we were making a nice order...and wine.. We had to basically chase him for the cheese over the pasta, never did anyone fill our water glasses...and finally, he left in the middle of our meal and passed us off to his colleague...I don't think we would be back...a shame...that the service experience is what would make the difference here...but it is.excellent food, great hostess..great wine...great atmosphere...pitiful service..
