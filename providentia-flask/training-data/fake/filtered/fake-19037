I need to prefeace this yelp by saying I am very passionate about my pizza. I am in fact a pizza snob. Artichoke is the absolute top of my list. Their crust is thick and amazing. Their sauce is a real zesty full flavored sauce. Not like the average cheap sugary immitation sauces that a lot of places use. And I've seen the way they make the pizza, with huge chinks of different types of cheese. They put alot of love into what they do and it shows Â My only complaint about Artichoke is that they don't have a location in the Upper East side yet. Please come north Artichoke!
