Well Ippudo doesn't need  reviews anymore. But this is one place which compels even the lazy me to write one. Went there on Saturday evening at 7pm over Thanksgiving  weekend & as expected the wait time was ~3 hours (yes you read me right). We just decided to hit the bar around the corner. One nice thing...they text you once your Once ushered in we gorged upon the heavenly steamed buns and Shishito. & then it was RAMEN time. I had opted for the Akamaru Modern while my friends tried the special Szechuan style spicy tonkotsu (ahhh good but not my style), Tori & Miso. Well clearly  Akamaru Modern was the winner..perfect blend of spice, flavor & texture. It was a big serving & boy I finished the whole bowl. Can't wait to go back there. The trick: as i was told by the hostess in the front desk...come around 10:30 pm ..the wait time is minimal.
