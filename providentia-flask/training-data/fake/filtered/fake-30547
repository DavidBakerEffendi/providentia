I was very excited to find this location after going to the Old City one for so long. The food is the same quality - always good. The roof deck is fun in the summer time too. A great place for drinks and light fare. Sometimes it's so busy there's hideously long lines to get to the deck - but it's usually worth the wait. Not always my kind of folks there to rub elbows with, but you find that in every place. Love the decor and cute server outfits. A staple in Philly!
