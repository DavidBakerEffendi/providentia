Absolutely my go to neighborhood inoteca.  As a first generation Calabrese, the number of italian restaurants I am willing to pay for are far and few between.  This is one of them.   Standouts include the octopus salad :A sauté of potatoes, micro greens, octopus, and dressed in a light herb infused olive oil.  I could eat this every day!  The octopus is artfully cooked and never tough, probably due to a sighting of the prep-cooks massaging the octopus legs into perfection.   Other standouts include the lobster risotto and ossobuco.  Fantastico! At this intimate two room hole in the wall with long communal tables, surrounded by a library of vino, you can expect great small plates, a good Vermentino, and fun conversation with locals from the neighborhood.
