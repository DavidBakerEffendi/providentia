It was the evening of Mothers Day. Eight of us were at the Wadsworth Atheneum and needed a nearby restaurant that was not filled with the mothers day crowd. Vivo fit the bill perfectly.  Located in the Marriott, it is an informal place (no tablecloths) . It is spacious and relatively quiet, and has windows looking out on the street, which is nice contrast with the more cavernous settings found elsewhere in this city.  If you go there ask to be served by Giancarlo.  He was lively and took excellent are of us, but only after he established a conversation and could tell us about his brother back in Italy, and the son he wants to put through college.  To get the best bargains in wine, go to the end of the list.  The steak was good, and for that matter, so were the hamburgers. However dont order Expresso because they dont have an expresso machine.
