Very nice ambiance and pleasant staff, but the food was below average. I couldnt agree more with other reviews about it being disproportionately priced for the quality and taste. I ordered a fennel and arugula salad and swordfish entree. The salad was loaded with vinegar so I couldn't taste the fennel or arugula. The swordfish had very little taste at all to the point that I know I was eating fish only because of the consistency. Even the polenta lacked flavor. Friendly staff and ambiance can only take a restaurant so far but for these prices, Hearth should have one of NYC's top chef's, which they clearly don't!!
