I was blown away by the quality of food served at Wafas.  It's probably the best Middle Eastern food I've tasted in NYC.  The babaganoush was outstanding as was the fattosh salad, hummus and cauliflower.  I'm a vegetarian so finding Wafas was a dream-come-true. Furthermore, the prices are reasonable, the quantities are generous and the ambiance is pleasant.  It's a family-run restaurant and so there's lots of love and caring in all that the family does to satisfy customers.  I can't wait to return.
