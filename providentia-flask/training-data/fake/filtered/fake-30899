Went recently with a group.  The group leader had called ahead to let them know when we were coming and asked for a series of tables for 4-6 rather than waiting for a large single table.  When we got there we were told it would be about 20 min. for the table to be ready.  20 min later we asked again and were told it would be 20 min and they were waiting for the second table to open up--meaning they had given us 2 large tables (i.e. automatic tip included, no separate checks).  Still we waited in the very warm waiting area as they did not want us in the cooler (but still hot) hallway.  We waited the second 20 minutes and were told the 2nd table was just opening up and it would be 20 minutes.  When I looked in the dining room, there were 6 tables for 4-6 empty, and already set up (granted, I do not know their staffing situation...so perhaps they were understaffed on a holiday afternoon.) After an hour, we thought we should wait no longer as another restaurant nearby could take the entire group right away.  Still, since many wanted to go and the management kept hinting that we would be seated soon...we did wait a bit longer. It was about 10-15 min later with no effort at communication by the staff, that our leader informed the manager that we were no longer willing to wait so were leaving. At this point, we were argued with that the table was being set right then.  Despite 3 requests to know how long that would take, we received no answer (just repetitions that the table was being set up right then.)  Most of us had already left, but I learned that it still took another 20 min. for the remaining group to be seated (I can't confirm that because I was seated at another restaurant.)   This was my first experience with this restaurant, and my last!
