My first Parc dining experience was for a friend's birthday this past Sunday.  We went for Sunday brunch -- what a disappointing experience.  The waiter tried hard but the omelette was served lukewarm at best.  The pate tray was full of fatty meats.  Ick!  My guest ordered steak and eggs.  The "steak" was a small chewy end piece.  Truly awful!  He was gracious and didn't complain, but I was quite embarrassed. For all the hype, Parc was a real disappointment.  Even dessert couldn't save the day.  Will I return?  Don't think so. At $180 including valet parking  and tip, I'll go elsewhere.  I should have taken my buddy to the Reading Terminal Market for coffee and a bagel and bought him a nice gift.
