I'm a huge fan of the pizza and beer at Bar! Â I've been going at least once a month for years now, its one of my favorite comfort food destinations. I like that the crust on the pizza is really nice and thin. Its a lovely break from the classic New Haven crust which I find a little too chewy for my taste. The salad is great too, always refreshing. The beers are usually pretty yummy(though as another review mentioned I have had the occasional flat or skunky glass and sent it back without issue), the ambar ale is my usual fave followed close by the pale ale. Really the only complaint I've ever had is concerning the waitstaff. It really seems like they TRY to hire the most inept waitresses and hostesses possible, not friendly, not helpful, and most often oblivious. They all have similar measurements though... Its something you can ignore though for the great eats.
