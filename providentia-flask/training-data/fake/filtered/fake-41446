Food was great!! If you're planning to eat at this place make sure you come early. It gets packed. The food was delicious although service was not the best. I guess because it gets to be pack that the waiters forget things here and there. Asked for tostados didnt get to recieved it and I have to ask for the reciept since they just handed me back the change without the receipt.  Over all it was a good experience.   Will come back Will recommend
