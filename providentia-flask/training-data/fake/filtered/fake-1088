Yet another brilliant restaurant by Stephen Starr.  This is his french place- and like Butcher and Singer, you step back in time. The atmosphere is great and what amazes me is that he pretty much dominates Rittenhouse square, yet evreything is perfectly executed.  He manages to make each restaurant completely unique, yet somehow strings them together with his Stephen Starr touch.  The guy is a genius, and if he ever decided to go public, I would certainly buy his stock.  Though you would think that it wouldn't be a success to completely saturate an area, Stephen Starr does it effortlessly. I've only been to Parc for dinner once, but loved it.  It literally is like a French bistro.  For starters I had the macaroni gratin- sooooo delish!  For my main dish I had the salmon- very nicely done but I wish I had ordered something different.  I've also tried the tuna tartare,  and the onion soup, and my colleage was RAVING about the sardines. Haven't sat outside to eat yet because I went in the winter, but in the summertime they do have outdoor seating which probably makes the experience ten times better.
