Our favorite restaurant in Burlington!  The Penne Bolognese and Arugula salad are my wife's favorites and I typically experiment with the pasta's and specials.  My favorite pastas are the Gnochi with balsamic, cherries, and slow roasted pork (as a starter), and the seasonal risotto's - always great if you like the ingredients.   They have a great wine list, mostly Italian varieties, and I love the Basil ice cream with balsamic and strawberries.  The service is typically prompt, but can be a little inconsistent when there is new staff. In mid- to late- Winter, they run a series of special menus on Mon through Thurs from various regions of Italy.  They are 3 courses for $35 and are a great value.
