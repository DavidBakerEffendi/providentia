Let me tell you this place was packed! Even on a Saturday night we were still able to get a good waiter and good drinks which in downtown New Haven is usually a rare find. If you come here you must try their jalepeno margarita and the hanger steak. My wife had a pork stuffed pepper which she said was also amazing (neither of us were willing to give up a bite of our food to eachother!)
