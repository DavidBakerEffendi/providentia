Pizza ok but waiters - nightmare!! If they could do sth to make us eat it faster they would do it ... good they didn;t have whip. We ate in like 15 minutes and while this time they checked on us aprox. 9 times. "did you finish already? did you finish alrady" what the hell was that? Of course we didn't leave any tip.
