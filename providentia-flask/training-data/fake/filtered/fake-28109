If you are in for a romantic date or just a low key wine and dine night this is the place to go. I'm happy to have this place so close to where I live, aside of the great tunes and nice atmosphere, the food is actually surprisingly delicious since this place does not have full kitchen. I highly recommend to try the chorizo and avocado pizza, the meatballs and my favorite a simple beat and goat cheese salad. Great selection of cheeses and good wine all around!
