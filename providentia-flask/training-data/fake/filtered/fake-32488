Yeeesssss! More please. Everything here is amazing. From waiting at the bar and having divine cocktails made by Latifa to all of the items we tried on the menu. I ordered the sea bass which was superbly done and loved the delish sauce on the side. Desserts were too amazing for words. Creme fraiche panna cotta, berry crisp, you say? We will definitely be back for more.
