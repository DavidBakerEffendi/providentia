Its a shame that people try to scam their way into a fully booked night at Kanella. As a regular I always try to make my reservations at least 3 weeks in advanced for Friday and Saturday night seating. i also recommend calling up for brunch spots especially for a big party. I have had to wait a few times on Sunday for even a 2 person party but it was worth it. I have loved the food since i have moved here from California 6 months ago and try to get there as much as possible. i try to keep to a healthy diet and Kanella's fresh menu is perfect and the cost is well worth the quality. The Valentine's Day dinner was one of the best meals I have ever had! At first i was a little hesitant about ordering the marinated ducks hearts. I am so glad I did! I don't know anywhere else in the city to get these but i could eat them all day long. They were served with a watercress salad that had a unique blend of tahini and pomegranate that complimented that meaty grilled ducks hearts.   Next was a perfectly seasoned chopped vegetable salad. Cucumbers, onions, tomatoes, etc tossed in a lightly garlic olive oil and lemon. For the main I went with the Salt Cod stew. If you like bacala you need to go here for it. it had potatoes, tomatoes, olives and garnished with crispy zucchini.  Some bread to soak up all the liquid was perfect. Lastly i had the chocolate marquise. it's like the best little fudge brownie, but with hazelnuts. It was served with some house made ice cream and  chocolate sauce. During the meal the Chef/Owner came out and rounded the tables fast to make sure everything was perfect before darting back into the kitchen to finish up the night. It's nice to see someone care so much about what they created. I definitely recommend this BYOB to anyone who wants amazing food that is not like your everyday boring fare.
