I went here for the first time last weekend with the family to celebrate my mother's birthday. I like the place, and the food was very good. It was an enjoyable evening. The place is loud, and I get that most restaurants are, but I have been to french bistros and WHAT is the deal with the loud techno music and just BAD music.  French bistros and france don't play ANY music.  It made it very difficult to carry on a conversation and took away from the experience. We asked the server to ask to have the volume at least lowered, nothing was done that I could tell.  So, very good food, but I advise the management to read this review and others that note the bad music and make a change. I can tell you, we might have stayed to have dessert if the music did not chase us out.
