After having Mickey's hyped to us, we were anxious to try it. The experience was very disappointing. The food was mediocre--blandly prepared (at best). The selection did not work well with kids. We say skip Mickey's. If you have kids, dive over to the Chili's on Dixwell Avenue. If you're looking for good Italian, drive on up Whitney Ave to Luces.
