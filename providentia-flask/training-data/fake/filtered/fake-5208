Thanks to a neighbor who recommended it, I've been there three times in 2 weeks. What a wonderfully authentic restaurant. Beautiful decor, great friendly service and food that's marvelous. Am a fan of their shrimp dishes which are cooked to perfection. The best guacamole I've tasted in a long time. The portions are huge, with enough to take home for another meal...or two! They don't rush you through your meal, even if the restaurant is full. I appreciate that. Staff members helpful with food choices and explanations. Even if you're not a fan of Colombian food, they open @ 7 a.m. Stop by there for coffee and a treat. Takeout and delivery available. It's my new fave place in town, just a short walk from home. Best of luck to them, and I hope they stay open for many years.
