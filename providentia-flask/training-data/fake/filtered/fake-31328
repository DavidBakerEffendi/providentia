Food is very tasty and reasonably priced. Damon's wings are BOSS and so is the BBQ Chicken Pizza. Drinks are reasonably priced with great specials. The only downer is that I'm lactose intolerant and dairy products make me unleash hellacious stinks. The wings are saturated in delicious cheese sauce, which compels me to unleash the stink that lies within. It pisses my wife off after we complete our visit to Damon's, as her night is filled with the scent of putrid gas delivered by a powerful butt bomb. My farts are potent and executed with precision and the intent to deliver maximum stink power. That aside, the food is great and totally stop in!
