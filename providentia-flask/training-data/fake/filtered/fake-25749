Let me start by saying that I love Jewish deli-restaurants, and I've been to most of the great ones in New York.  If you want authentic Jewish deli food in CT, Katz's in Woodbridge is the place to go. They start you off with a nice bowl of delicious coleslaw and a sliced half sour and sour pickles (I like my pickles whole; but this is a minor thing).  Their menu is extensive.  I have most often ordered pastrami and tongue on rye or corned beef and tongue which are always excellent.  The rye bread is nice and chewy.  And the sandwiches are stacked high (but not so high that you can't get your mouth around them.  The matzo ball soup is perhaps the best I've had--big flavorful matzo ball, noodles, carrots, shredded chicken and a really great broth.  Great in the wintertime to ward off the sniffles.  They have great fries and onion rings too and the portions are enormous--good for sharing. The staff at Katz's is lovely.  They're all so very friendly and the service is fast.  The food is a bit pricey, but fair considering the excellent quality and hearty quantity.  This really is one of my favorite places to eat in CT.
