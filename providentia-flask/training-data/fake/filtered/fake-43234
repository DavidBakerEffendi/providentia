Don't judge a book by its cover, and in Makoto's case, don't judge a restaurant by how it looks on the outside. The food is incredible, the seafood is fresh, and the service is impeccable. And for all-you-can eat sushi and hot items from the kitchen for $22.50--drinks included!--it can't be beat. It's a 45-minute drive (without traffic) from Manhattan and well worth the trip!
