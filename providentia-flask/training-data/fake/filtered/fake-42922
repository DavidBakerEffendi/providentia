I went with my team for lunch - we had a wonderful time. I highly recommend their Punjabi Goat Curry (one of the best that I have had in New York), Kakori Kebab, and Andhra Chicken Curry. They also served an unusually good mixed pickle yellow sauce in addition to the green and tamarind dipping sauces. The service was great, trendy decor, and they gave us free rice pudding at the end of the meal! This is my new fav. Indian place in downtown and will definitely go again to check out their bar/lounge!
