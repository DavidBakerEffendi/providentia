I work downtown in centercity and order everyday. Began ordering from NYPD Pizza the week of 11/10, trying foods from buffalo wings to quesidillas, and my last oder grilled chicken ceaser salad. Salad was huge and tasted great but they only sent me 1 small salad dressing. When I called to order the following day I inquired about an additional dressing. I was told I had to pay for it. Not a Problem, but when I spoke with the owner and he rudely told me I did not have to place the order that day. I was shocked. I have NEVER BEEN TALKED TO SO NASTY BY SOMEONE SUPPOSED TO BE IN CUSTOMER SERVICE..Food is good, customer service HORRIBLE, actually going on better business bureau after this. I will never purchase here again ..Try Pandoras on Chestnut Street, Great food, great customer service. 215-922-2333
