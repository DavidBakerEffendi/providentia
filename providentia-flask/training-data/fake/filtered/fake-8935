Hot dogs are good.  Fries and such are a complete ripoff and no different than what you can find in the grocery store's freezer aisle for exception of the onion rings, which are the biggest ripoff of all.  I got 7 onion rings for $4.50+tax.  And cajun fries are really curly fries so don't be fooled.
