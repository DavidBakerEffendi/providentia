Located very close to the Chef's Table, this rooftop bar has an unparalleled view of midtown buildings. The atmosphere is classy, rather than clubby, with jazz and samba music playing all night rather than teenage dance music. When the sun sets, you'll get a great view. The cocktail menu is small but the one drink I had (tequila based) was good.
