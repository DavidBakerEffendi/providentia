If you want to overpay for your bad service, bad food, and a very frustrating evening go to this restaurant. We were excited to visit this neighborhood restaurant but were very disappointed. The service is very condescending and arrogant. The food added salt on the wound. We were having a birthday celebration. Talk about a let- down!!! Â I will not be visiting this establishment again!!!!
