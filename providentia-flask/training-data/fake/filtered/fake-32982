Food wise this place is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!  Very reasonably priced.  You get your money's worth in the food both in taste and quantity.  My only complaints are that sometimes they delivery much later than the time given when the order is placed and that they don't have longer hours.  If I had things my way Jose's would be open 24/7 it's that good (I want to eat it all the time).  In fact it's worth the wait when they run late.  Seriously do your taste buds a favor and order from here.  Everything I've had off the menu so far has been A+!
