As a poor college student, this is definitely a good place to grab a decent lunch :) However, I'm a bit afraid to get food from the buffet cause i know i'll end up with a tray worth more than 10 dollars. This place can get really crowded at times (lunch and dinner), luckily, i  usually get a table in a few minutes.  Overall, definitely recommended!
