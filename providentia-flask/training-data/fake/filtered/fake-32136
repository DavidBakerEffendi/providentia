stopped in there for lunch expecting great things. we were 1 of 3 tables in the place and our food was brought out to the wrong table as it turns out they were doing us a favor! the garlic fries and french dip were both nothing more than a pile of mush on a plate with the sandwhich resembling pulled pork more than steak. the cheddar ale soup was so thick it was hard to swallow unless you use it to dip the asparagus in so it makes a decent fondue. the server seemed more interested in flirting with the hostess than waiting tables as he was oblivious to the fact he was clearing full plates, also had to get up and find him sitting in the back to get steak sauce in a failed attempt to add flavor to the meat. the manager seemed lost in what to say or do as he approached our table resembling a deer in headlights with nothing more to say than heard you didnt care for lunch...to top it all off we actually had to wait over 10 minutes for someone to bring us our check!!!!!!!!! Overall a TERRIBLE AND DISAPPOINTING EXPIERIANCE!
