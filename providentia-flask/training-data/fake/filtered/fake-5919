I walked in on a Friday at 8pm with 3 friends and the place was empty. The host, however, still refused to give us a table saying they were ALL reserved for 8pm. All of them? Really? We said we were willing to wait...20 mins later, the tables were still unoccupied. He finally sat us down after we waited for 25 mins for nothing. That was an unnecessary nuisance. The waitress seemed not to know what she was doing either. She raved about the Gnocchi, with both my friend and I thought were so-so. Perhaps some of the other dishes are better.
