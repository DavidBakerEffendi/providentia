Came here with friends and family before seeing Chelsea Handler at the Wellmont.  While the food was acceptable, the service was beyond awful.  After waiting 40 minutes, we ordered and not getting much of a response from the wait staff, my mother approached the owner/manager to tell him the about the lengthy wait time.  His response - (I kid you not)- was, "You should be grateful that you live in this country." I still can't believe it.  Finally the food came (no thanks to this awful man).  As we were leaving the restaurant, I went up to him since I was so irate about what he had said to my mom.  After listening to me for a minute or two his response to me was.."I don't have to f - - - ing listen to this!" Needless to say, this place will not get my repeat business.  Unbelievable, right?
