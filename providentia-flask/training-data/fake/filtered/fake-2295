Pretty chill place.  You order your crepe (hence the "skinny pancake") at the counter, they give you a number, and they'll bring you your order when it's ready.  We had the Lumberjack (cabot cheddar and ham) with a side of salad and the Heart Breaker (Nutella, Strawberry and Banana with whip cream).  They were both yummy!  It was packed the day we went bc of the Dragon Boat Festival, but I'm not sure if it's usually that packed.  It's right across from the bay which is also worth checking out!
