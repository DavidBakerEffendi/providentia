By accident I went to Taqueria, and  I can say that was one of the best burritos I ever had. The servers are very helpful and friendly, the food is excellent with an assortment of sauces and lots of taco chips. The fish tacos were excellent,  fresh and delicious. I must return for more. I highly recommend this place!!!
