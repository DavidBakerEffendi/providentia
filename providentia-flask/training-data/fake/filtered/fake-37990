I have never reviewed any restaurant but the way we were treated at Jacobs Pickle causes me to want to warn others. Granted, we were a bigger group (8) at a busy restaurant needing to be seated. We were told it would be about 45 minutes. We were willing to wait outside in cold since it had good reviews. We waited for over two hours. Â They consistently said it would be another 15 minutes. They never apologized or acknowledged our presence. When we kindly offered to split up the host condescendingly said that he would take that into consideration. Finally we offered to sit outside where it was less busy since it was so cold. Once again no acknowledgment that we had been waiting for so long and no apology. Even the waitress who waited on us was rather cold. I've never had such bad service. Not one of the eight that we were with will go back.
