I will not recommend this restaurant to anybody at all!!!! First of all, the server was overloaded with customers and always forgot our order.  She even frgot what our drinks were (duh!)  She should have wrote them down.  My son and daughter wanted a shirley temple with a little bit more cherries and she couldn't even give that.  The server did not even ask us how the food was because she was too busy with other people.  I have a baby with us and she even forgot the hot water I asked her in a glass so I could warm his food.  Then my husband asked for an arnold palmer drink and she didn't even give him one until we reminded her.  I asked for a bag when she wrapped the food and she forgot to give that to us.  We had to ask another server for a bag so we could get out and leave the annoying place.  After the unsatisfying time at this restaurant I finally went to the manager and complained.  I actually think he was the owner.   HE WAS SOO RUDE AND WALKED OUT ON US AFTER WHAT WE TOLD HIM.  HE WASN'T EVEN APOLOGETIC FOR THEIR MISTAKES AND HE HAd THE NERVE TO TELL US THAT SHE WAS WORKING WITH TOO MANY CUSTOMERS.  I have never experienced such bad service in my life until we ate at this restaurant.  We will definitely spread these words to all the people we know.  It is not worth our time and money to spend in this ugly place! YUCK!!!
