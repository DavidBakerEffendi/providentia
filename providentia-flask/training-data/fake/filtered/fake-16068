Went here late on a Friday night- around 12am with 3 friends. The drinks started off pretty good, no complaints there- but once we were seated it went downhill from there. We waited over an hour and a half for our food-literally- and watched as 3 tables next to us that came AFTER us received their food a half hour before us and were already gone and paid by the time we were even served. To top it off, 3 out of four of us had appetizers, and one burger at the table- all which came out warm (being generous to even say "warm") We asked 3 times about our food and our waitress told us each time that "it would be another ten minutes"-- so finally we asked to speak to a manager named JONATHAN. Gosh, he was just as bad as the waitress. He offered us nothing- no apologies or explanation. He said, "come in next time and ask for me, ill try and hook you up" Oh gee sir, that's really gonna work because non of us will EVER be back there again. terrible experience- so many better options in this city! bummer!
