We were in the area, and trying to find a place to shelter us during the flash floods, and ended up going into Laetus for a couple of drinks while the rain stopped, and we ended up staying there for almost 4 hours. The friendliness of the staff, the relaxing setting and an amazing cocktail list lead us to diverting our friends from our orignal destination to spend the evening there. Few of us ended up ordering food, which was delicious, authentic, and just complimented the evening. The last pleasant surprise was a DJ that was playing that Saturday. The prices were amazing compared to the quality and quantity. Definitely going to be one of our top destinations when we're in Hartford next time.
