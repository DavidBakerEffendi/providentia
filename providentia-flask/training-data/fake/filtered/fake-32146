Yeah, that was a mistake.  Having just come back from Ireland, I was in the mood for more of the same sort of food I had over there.  This sticky-tabled dump should be sued by the St. James Brewery for using their name.  The Guinness was overpriced ($9/pint!) and improperly poured.  The food, despite the menu implying that it was freshly made, was clearly nothing of the sort and came with a packet of "thousand island" dressing and a little plastic cup of presumably canned cole slaw.  Two pints and this mediocre sandwich brought my total to nearly $30.  Shame on this eatery!
