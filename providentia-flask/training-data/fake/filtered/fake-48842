The only problem is that they have yet to make a dish that I can criticize.  But if you are ever fortunate enough to try their seafood crepes...its to die for (its the most elusive item on their menu).  This is gourmet food at take out prices. When ordering seafood please keep in mind its made to order and does take a little time but its worth the wait (you wouldn't ask your own mum to rush her food).  For those who complain about the wait time...fast food joints abound about the place.
