This is the first time I bothered to sign up for yelp.  I could not help but try to warn people away from this place. Absolutely horrible food, poor service.  How can you have pizza in the name of your restaurant and serve such a poor version.   My pizza came out with pepperoni looking barely heated up and the pizza looked as if it had been under the warmer since the night before and tasted worse.  Do yourself a huge favor and walk to any other restaurant in sight there is no way it could be worse than this place.
