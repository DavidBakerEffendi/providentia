When this place first opened up, it was my favorite place to order from, food was always good and prepared well especially my favorite, penne with vodka sauce. I used to recommend it to everyone. Now though, it's terrible the dish i once fell in love with is now the worst I've ever had. The sauce is watery and has very poor flavor and is just down right disgusting. I've even gone as far as giving it a few more chances to keep the faith and each time it has been different and inconsistent, never once enjoyable though. So with this review, it will be the last time I ordering from there.
