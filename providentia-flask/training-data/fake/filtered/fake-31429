Best pizza in the area and surrounding area by far!!! real authentic ingredients used and they stay consistent. the place has been around for almost 30 years and they are actaully REAL italian owners. i always have them cater all my inhouse parties and my family and friends look foreword to it always!! large trays can feed ALOT of people and its not expensive. there prices are inexpensive when compared to the great food quality. this is my go to place for good satifying food and pizza!
