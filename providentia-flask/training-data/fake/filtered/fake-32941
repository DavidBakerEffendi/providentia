The PSD will be or should be one of Burlington's treasures!  The food is fresh, hot, and creative - there are always new things on the menu and the chefs are willing to adapt a menu item to your tastes/needs.  Service is great, too - I have to say my favorites thus far are the vegetarian benedict and the beyond amazing grilled cheese sandwich.  Simply divine from the bread to the oooey gooey flavors of the cheeses used - I was excited to see patrons sitting at he counter, introducing themselves, and talking while enjoying their meals (these were a man and young lady - different generations) and it was a moment at the heart of a community diner. I asked the owner, Pam, to help cater a special event for me this week, too - the food had to be gluten free and vegetarian. She presented me with several options and it was AMAZING!  We had Mint Melon soup, Gazpacho, and salad with house dressing and balsamic vinaigrette.  The soups were amazing - and those who were at the event couldn't stop eating and saying how good each one was, but the idea of cold soups and salad was a perfect suggestion for our small event and with the weather we've been having.   It's the special heart and passion she puts into her foods/service - and the community that make Pam and her Pearl Street Diner  a wonderful place.  I would encourage anyone to stop by for some diner food and friendly banter.
