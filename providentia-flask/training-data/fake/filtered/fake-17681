This place is great and I am really happy they came to Williston. I went here with my girlfriend two nights ago, and it was really good. The pizza is WAY better than American flat bread, the beer selection is awesome, and the people are friendly. What more could you want? I also loved the meatballs...best ever. I read "Matt C's" review, and the guy should chill out. Seriously. He goes on their first night being open and then tears em a new one. I have been twice and never experienced anything like he talked about. The one complaint I do have is that they didn't have Lawsons beer which is my favorite, but I talked to the bartender and he told me that they are trying to get it, but Lawsons simply does not make enough to get kegs to everyone who wants em. So, not their fault and that's why I gave them 5 stars instead of just 4. Anyway, the place is awesome and beats Chilis or Longhorn or any of the other chain-garbage in Williston. I will be a regular.
