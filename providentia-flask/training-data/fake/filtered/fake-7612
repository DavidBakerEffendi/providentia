My friend and I arrived a few minutes after the official lunchtime ended, and since we were both eager to try Balinese cuisine and it seemed like a cozy spot in the winter (2012), we sat down and waited until dinnertime. Close to dinnertime, the kitchen sent us sambals and prawn crackers, which were flavorful and appreciated by hungry tummies. Both fish curry and the nasi goreng (fried rice): more complex, less spicy compared to the Thai and Malaysian food I've tried in the respective countries and in NYC. Fresh and neither under nor over-cooked. Nasi goreng might leave one unfilled in terms of quantity of food, as it's fried rice, after all. I'd try it both again if they were less pricey or for a special occasion! Ambience: candle-lit, white minimalist but not pretentiously so, intimate. Tables are close to each other. Friendly and attentive waitstaff. Date-ish/good for a catch-up with a close friend. Inclined to give it four stars but the prices are pretty steep. (I'll update this review when I try other Balinese cuisine :))
