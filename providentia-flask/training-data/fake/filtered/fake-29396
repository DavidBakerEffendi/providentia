Food is okay, nothing to rave about  I've experienced much better at other NJ diners.  Orders delivered to table were incorrect.  Waitress however was pleasant.  Our biggest problem was when we went to pay the bill. We had some Sacagawea dollars on hand and decided to use them.  The Owner/Manager nearly cursed us out saying What kind of money is this?  Why don't you take it to the bank.  The last time I checked, this was valid U.S. currency for any transaction.  Not only will I NEVER RETURN, I have advised all my employees and clients that they will NOT be reimbursed should they EVER frequient this establishment again. Neither I nor my family will return.  I guess they don't like making money in a depressed economy.
