This place is great, but I recommend skipping the insane brunch lines and getting those blueberry pancakes at dinner. They serve them at night as well, and it's never been hard to get a table Â for dinner. Unfortunately, the french toast isn't on the dinner menu, though. The fried chicken here is perfect, and they also give you a little basket of mini biscuits before your meal at dinner. They also have a little bakery section here where you can get things like scones, muffins, biscuits and coffee to go.
