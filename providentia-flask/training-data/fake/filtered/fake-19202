I have been coming to Burrito Bar since I was a kid. It's great for lunch or after work drinks. The weekends are also fun and they always hold events for holidays, etc. It can be fun for a night out with your friends but it's also kids friendly. I bring my children here to eat often. The owner and his wife are also very sweet. This is also the only place i have found on the island that has amazing wings and fried ice cream. Highly recommend!
