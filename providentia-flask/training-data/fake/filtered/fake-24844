i wish i could give this 0 (zero!!!!) stars!!! i was meeting up with friends for drinks and i had the worst service i have ever had! from the incompetent staff messing up my check, be condescending and talking back, to being  id' 3 times for the 2 drinks i had.  i cant stress enough this was the worst experience i've ever had! never going back to this place and i hope it burns down.
