My first Yelp... I've been telling everyone else about this, so here goes.   We were headed to the Tap Sat. night and while walking by the window front of the blind pig, looking in to see the crowd, we noticed Chef Gorden Ramsey, Yes!.. Gorden Ramsey. He was sitting at a round table in the corner by the window eating with friends.  We said to each other, could that really be?, and If so and it's good enough for him, of coarse we have to go in and try something.  So we did. The atmosphere and staff were great, food was great, and the beer selection was great as well.  When Chef Ramsey was leaving, he walked by us, so we said hello and he replied.  He was complimenting the owner, so I guess he liked it too.   He seemed much nicer than he does on TV.  We ended up staying late. I believe we found the best of No. Libs.   We will be back for sure.
