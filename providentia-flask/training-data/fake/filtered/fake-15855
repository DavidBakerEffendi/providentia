Visited Junior's while on vacation this summer.  The restaurant was right across the street from our hotel in Times Square.  The place was packed but they were quickly able to seat our group of seven.  Nice menu, may different things to offer.  I went with bbq ribs and chicken.  Delicious!   I wasn't a fan of the sauerkraut and pickles they brought to the table.  My wife and I went back later for cheesecake...wow...best I've ever had.
