We have never dined inside the restaurant so this review is based on delivery only and I have to say, Royal Palace is the WORST restaurant for delivery.  The are consistently late, this last time we waited an hour and half and another  time we waited 2 hours, and the food is nothing to write home about because it is always cold. The person who answers the phone always says it will be 45 minutes, it never is, and then when you call back it is always the same excuse "we are busy" but then the driver will tell you he got lost....they just don't care, never compensate and can sometimes be downright rude when you bring it their attention.   We have given this restaurant too many chances to get better and this last time was the final straw. Almost 2 hours late and then the order was wrong to boot. We give up.
