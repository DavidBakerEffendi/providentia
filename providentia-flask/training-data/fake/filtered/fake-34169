I think its a pretty good place if u jus wanna eat. but its not a spot where u can take ur date but for families and stuff it a good place coz their prices are so cheap and food is good i dont like the owner ov this place but employees are great, they treat u good and try their best. plus they r open 24/7 so its convenient too. Ok so the Sahlimar down the street who serves Chinese as well is second best fo desi food and prices and they aright when it comes to service but not too good tho. and the big shalimar right next to it is the worst one people over there dont know what they are doing they always mess up ur order and if u order more the 2 dishes they will serve one and then u have to wait another few minutes for the second one which looks awkward if ur eating by ur self where other ppl r jus starring at u and its kinda hard not to eat when ur really hungry lol and their service sucks. They ALWAYS over charge u. They ALWAYS over charge u. They ALWAYS over charge u. well atleast they over charged me i dont know if they have the POS system now. Well over all shalimar gril 24/7: 9/10 Shalimar Chinese: 5/10 Big Shalimar: 1/10
