One of my favorite treats on my way to work:  a "Rybread" sandwich - crabcake on brioche bread.  In addition to  several creative sandwiches, I recently found out they have a delicious carrot cupcake, salads, soups, hot Naked Chocolate and a variety of teas.  And the staff is so friendly they know me by name even though I go there only once every other week!  Hopefully, they soon will be able to increase their space and offer more tables.  As of now, this place is mostly a take-out.
