It's almost comical, reading about people's complaints that the place is in a strip mall.  Come on!  That's the walls & roof!  It's like complaining about the box your birthday present came in.      On to the restaurant; it's very good sushi.   I've had good sushi, I've had bad sushi and some GREAT sushi.  I've had tepid sushi in Tokyo, where it started and GREAT sushi in Alabama.  This place makes "very good" sushi.      If you put in an internet order from their website, follow up with a phone call.  They might get it right, they might never get it.   When they do, you'll like it!  I'm becoming a regular.
