Aside from the service being slow, the food did not taste nearly as good as everyone here on yelp said it would.. I ordered the fillet Mignon sandwich and my Girlfriend ordered the Duck special. We came out disappointed. I have to say though: the place does look nice and cozy, really nice ambiance to it. I just wish they took as much care about the food quality as they did for the decor
