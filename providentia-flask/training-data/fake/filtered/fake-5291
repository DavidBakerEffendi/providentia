This place is great, if you can get in!!  I'm not fond of waiting around to eat and this place seems to always be packed.  Maybe it's because I only go on weekends, but either way this place rocks!  Everything here is very fresh authentic.  They  also have great margaritas and sangria for right around $10.  I haven't tried everything on the menu but my go to is always the beef tacos.  You can't really go wrong!
