This is my go to restaurant, I come here all the time, I walk by it all the time.  I can't get enough of Bianca.  The loud atmosphere, the closeness of the tables, the delicious smell of it all.  Reasonably priced, great tasting food and the familiarity of it all makes me come back every time. I bring all my friends here at least once, not because of the price, but because they treat you like family and the food is amazing.
