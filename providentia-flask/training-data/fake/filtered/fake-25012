Cheap eat and best deal for dumplings, buns, and soup in the Manhattan. Not only its cheap and great eat the foods are well prepare and quick too. yep! Â $5 all you can eat to pay for your meal which can fill your big stomach. The dumplings you can get three for just a single bill w tax free, the roast beef cake which costs u for just 1.75 and the pan fried buns are nice as well. Small and crowded area to wait and seats are usually limited that ppl are fighting over the seats. So yea when I am thinking to order dumplings for take-out for the day i definitely thinking of this spot. Take out fans here!!
