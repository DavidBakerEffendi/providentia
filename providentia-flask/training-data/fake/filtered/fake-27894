Love this place, here's why: the roast chicken. Â succulent, lemony, herbaceous. lotta joints the chicken is a bland mediocre option, not here. order it, you'll see. pasta is great too... love eating here on a warm summer night, garage doors wide open... only reason I docked a star is i don't like paying $16 for a martini...
