This was the 2nd restaurant I visited with my good business-personal friend from England who lived some time in South Africa, so what better way to find a place with a South African and Middle Eastern taste that is common to both of us, by chance!We actually headed out to Balthazar, and after being told that we have a hour+ wait we hit the street and walked down Spring to Lafayette. There was a place on the corner but it wasn't buzzing this early evening hour as I would think it should. Then we saw this canopy and the sign Jack's Wife Freda. What a name, but also what a place! Just as we walked up to the entrance we were greeted by the hostess who welcomed us to the city, to the restaurant with a smile that will be remembered. The place was hustling but there were a few places open. We were truly treated like guests throughout our sitting, which was way over an hour. My friend and I shared a Greek Salad which was spiced just right - sharp and not too hot. I had the Chicken lemon pepper which melted in my mouth and my friend had a medium-well New York Strip steak, which he claimed was seasoned and cooked to perfection. Would definitely recommend this place to a friend... so while we came by it by luck (thank you Balthazar for the long wait...), you will find it by reading this.
