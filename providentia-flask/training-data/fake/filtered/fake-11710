I was recommended this restaurant by many of my college friends so I figured it was time to let go of my sushi ego and check it out. As a college student, hearing, "all you can eat" is nothing but music to my ears. Lets be honest, you are not coming to this place to have a thoroughly self indulgent sushi experience. Its for those of us who love sushi, yet, can't afford to drop over a hundred dollars on an "authentic" establishment who gets there fish directly from tsukiji market. We arrived on a Friday evening and it was very crowded. As expected, the decor was a bit cheesy but I was there to eat, not evaluate the interior. Once we were seated, we were handed two check lists. One lets you select the appetizers/side dishes while the other lets you pick out your sushi. After selecting what seemed like everything on the menu, we placed our order. When the food arrived they made a couple of mistakes; however, we let it slide as we were all very hungry. The yellow tail and mackerel were quite good and it was great to know that we could order as much of it as we wanted. The udon noodles were also surprisingly delicious although they took my dish away without giving me a chance to finish my soup. I generally stay away from sashimi at all you can eat restaurants; however, we ordered the salmon and it wasn't as bad as I thought. After an hour of non stop eating, we ended our meal with green tea and red bean ice cream which was pretty good even though the red bean was artificial. Â  I entered this restaurant with moderate expectations and left getting exactly what I expected.The food was generally good, the service was mediocre, and the atmosphere was great. I would recommend this place to anyone who is hungry, loves sushi, and wants to BYOB. Oh yea, and make sure you finish all your food, otherwise they charge you extra. Cheers.
