Honestly I go to so many indian restaurants and it is really hard to find one with an authentic taste. The prices are reasonable (as of now) and the quality of the food is excellent. Just by looking at the food you can tell it was freshly prepared and the service was great too! Spice Grill is definitely worth the time and money.
