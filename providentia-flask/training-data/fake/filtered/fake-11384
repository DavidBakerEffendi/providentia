Heard so much about Momofuku and it lived up to its reputation. We were lucky and were seated right away at the bar. The place was packed to the gills with hip music blaring throughout the restaurant. We had excellent oysters, steamed pork buns, expertly grilled octopus, and spicy pork sausage & rice cakes. The service was friendly and efficient.
