We had dinner last night at Big Fish.   Honestly the worst meal I've ever had, especially at a seafood restaurant.   My family ordered a variety of dishes: pizza, fish and chips, a potato-encrusted halibut special and shrimp scampi.    With the exception of the scampi, everything else was significantly below par.   Cape Codder Salad was basically chopped lettuce and they left off the dressing.  My halibut was non-existent, all potato no fish.   The service was slow and snarky. A few years ago, this was a family outing we enjoyed but we will not be coming back now.
