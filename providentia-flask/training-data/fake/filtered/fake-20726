I dont do the review thing, but I must do it this time. I want pp to understand where Im going here. Is nt about the food because is great, although the portions could be bigger...anyways my concern was service. Im sitting there along with my party and I saw one of the waitress screeeeeming to the other one for no reason. That girl look like she was about to cry and the other kept talking to her in a very mean manner. I was about to tell her that she was being so loud the entire restaurant could hear how stress out she was because of some reservations waiting. She used the f word and everything... I mean, if you cant handle to do your job in a busy nite at least show some respect for your coworkers. My point here is that her behaviour made me feel so uncomfortable that I couldnt wait to get out, we only had one appetizer, entrees and bye.
