Ibiza is by far our favorite restaurant in Hamden. The food is exceptional, the service is phenomenal!!! We go here at least once a month. We just had a very pleasant meal with Eddison -he's the man! We highly recommend  the marinated Tuna and the goat cheese tapas. We get them every single time we go.  The braised short rib is also something you cannot pass up. We love everything about Ibiza and would highly recommend to anyone!!! Go go go!!!!
