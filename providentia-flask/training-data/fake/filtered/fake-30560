It's been a while since I've been able to find really good fresh pho. In my curry dish I was pleasantly surprised to find better vegetables such as broccoli and sweet potatoes over plain potatoes that fell apart and sloppier cheaper veggies before. The food was really fresh and delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone!
