Do not patronize this restaurant.  The food is ok even though the cleanliness of the kitchen is subjective.   The customer service is very poor.  Even when asking to speak to the owner we (my family who are all in our fifties) were treated like trash.  The bar tender was rude.  The owner was rude.  We couldn't get service on a Sunday afternoon when the restaurant was very empty.  Stay away. If you want good Italian food in the Italian Market go to Ralphs.  We were so appalled by Villa de Roma that we stumbled onto Ralphs and loved it.   Not only was the food awesome but the service was outstanding.  Villa di roma could learn a few things about customer service.  Especially the owner.  Do not believe the hype.  They should not be supported until they learn how to treat their customers.  We were appalled.  I can't stress that enough. Do not support this restaurant.
