Honored the reservation. Always a plus before a show. Host staff needs work though. The dude was having a heated argument with a customer right at the front door. Cramped quarters, but that's to be expected in the theater district. What wasn't expected, however, was how gruffly they push they table in toward you once you're seated. No big. The food rocked it. Had the lobster roll with those skinny fries. So good we came back the next night. Chocolate pudding cake was off the charts and I'm not a dessert guy. It also wasn't my dessert. My girlfriend was pissed because I chowed most of hers.
