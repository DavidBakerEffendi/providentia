My wife and I are triple-confirming all the great Yelp reviews for Taim on Waverly!  We ordered two Falafels on wheat pita with Harissa hummus - outstanding! We arrived about 2:30PM on a Friday for a late lunch, and the restaurant was busy but moving, and the counter service was friendly.  Yes, there are only a few bar stools inside - you can patiently wait, or eat outside (there are a few spots on the sidewalk.) We walked down to Abingdon Square Park, found an empty bench, and had a nice lunch there (nycgovparks.org/parks/ab…). All the ingredients are super-fresh, and the Ginger Mint Lemonade is THE BEST.  We will definitely be back again to Taim soon!
