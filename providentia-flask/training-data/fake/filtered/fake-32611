This is by far the worst restaurant I ever eaten in !!! Filthy and unsanitary.... I found a hair in my food, the food was brought raw to our table, and my rice was so hard it seemed like it might have been days old. Just reviewed the restaurant on nyc.gov/health and it has so many violations and their grade is pending. NOT a place I would recommend!! Â Had to post it with one star, but it deserves no stars!!
