I always pass this building and it has changed hands so many times i was skeptical to try it. I checked out the menu on their website and decided to try it for my birthday dinner. The food was amazing!  My sister said "it's so hard to find a place that cooks my steak the way I like it" and MEAL got it exactly right!  The service was incredible too. Now that they have there liquor license I think this restaurant will last!!
