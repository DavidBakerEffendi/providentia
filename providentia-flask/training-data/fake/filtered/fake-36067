The customer service was horrible. On a Saturday night shortly after 9:30 (they close at 10:30), my boyfriend and I walked in to have a pizza and some wine. After squeezing past the hostess (??) who gave us blank stares, we asked the chef to the right if he was still making pizzas. "We stop seating at 9:30" he yelled, weirdly angry. The hostess said something to him (but nothing to us) and then he just said, "We stopped seating," again. The hostess just stared some more as we turned around and walked back out. It's fine if they stop seating at 9:30 (though they could say that on their website; most places that close at 10:30 will still seat you at 9:40). But the way they spoke to us was rude, as if we were a huge imposition. We were just two hungry guys in a good mood, popping in to give it a try. The least they could do is say "hello" and "goodbye."
