fter two years of planning my son's Bar Mitzvah the event was marred not only by what occurred the night of the party but by the attack on my character by one of an owner . I was told that my guests ate too much, I was cheap, and that I was lying about various things that occurred While driving to the party I got a call at 8:20 from a guest indicating that the Moshulu staff was not allowing people into the party as they were not ready. My party was scheduled to begin at 8:00 and did not begin until 8:30. When I arrived the cocktail area was crowded, hot and had only one exit. It was so uncomfortable that people left the area and moved down into the dining area which was supposed to be closed until dinner. During the cocktail hour they ran out of hors d'oeuvres. I had ordered what was recommended by Moshulu. I hired dancers who had to be paid extra due to the delay when they couldn't perform due to the delay. After dinner, when we moved on deck for dancing (an hour later than my timeline called for), the dance floor was not arranged as agreed to. Approximately 50% more space would have been utilized had the floorplan been followed. In the agreement with Moshulu it requires 20% gratuity. I had no problem with this but since I was paying a gratuity there were to be no tip jars on the bars and that the bartenders should not be accepting tips since that was included in my price. I was shocked when I went to get a drink and saw cash resting on the bar clearly indicating that the bartenders were accepting tips. Moshulu had committed to valet parking and the valet staff left at midnight forcing guests to seek out assistance in getting their keys/cars. In the end, it is what it is, but since Moshulu takes no responsibility for what occurred is just wrong which is why I am sharing my story. Trust me... you don't want to have your party at Moshulu
