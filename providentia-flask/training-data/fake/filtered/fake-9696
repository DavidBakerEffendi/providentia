Had a craving for sushi while shopping across the street and saw how close the place was so we stopped in.  we got some miso soup, a California roll, shrimp tempura roll and something called fire island, all were delicious!!  finished off with some green tea ice cream. only complaint is no free refills on soft drinks, but I didn't think that was worth taking away a star!!
