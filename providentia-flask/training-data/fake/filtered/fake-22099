This 5 star review is for Carmen's. We are from San Diego and are die hard baseball Padre fans. Both My husband and I both born and raised in San Diego Ocean Beach/Point Loma, visit a baseball park every year and this year was the Phillies vs Padres. The Phillies Citizens Bank Filed was Beautiful.  Our hotel desk clerk told us about the terminal Market and to go to Carmen's  for great food. OMG the Market is insane how much food and as you enter you smell the fresh pastries.  Going to Carmen's was the best choice we made all trip. It was EXCELLENT from the service to the delicious food. We ate their 3 days in a row and enjoyed talking with the owner Carmen and his family Michelle who took our order everyday.  She was great! His crew was friendly, clean store and the food was to die for.  We had the Phillie cheese and Italian hoagie.. We suggest this place to everyone who visits Phillie.  We even had gone this week to another well talked about Phillie steak places right across from each other and CARMEN'S tops as the BEST for customer service, a lot of food and the prices were affordable. The terminal market was amazing. a MUST SEE... We already miss going to Carmen's.  The BEST!! Thanks for a wonderful time.  We can't wait go back and visit Carmen's in a few years with our grandsons.
