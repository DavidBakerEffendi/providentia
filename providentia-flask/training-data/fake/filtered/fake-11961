my experience was the food was great and the service leave you ecstatic. I believe every time you eat there you'll feel full what the first few bites I would recommend this to my family and friends and come on special occasions to this exquisite diner. and I recommend any birthdays to let staff know what the person likes as a cake because they will come out singing happy birthday and leaving you feeling embarrassed but happy.
