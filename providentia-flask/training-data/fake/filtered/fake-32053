Heard this place was good. Came here for Valentine's day and was dissapointed. First off they do not have a parking lot, its valet only and there's was like a 5 dollar fee. That's fine and all but it looked like it was contracted out to two guys with a beat up SUV with a homemade key board. I passed on that. They were extremely busy that night (understandable, it was a holiday) however the hosted didn't even take my name when we walked in. Several other couples who arrived after us were greeted first. I spoke to her and told her she overlooked us and reminded her we had reservations. We were promptly seated.....at the worst table in the corner by the fire extinguisher... Waiter was friendly but was overwhelmed, not his fault, the place was obviously not ready for the amount of people that came in. The menu was very limited, I understand why but there was nothing out of the ordinary. She ordered the pasta with clams, muscles, shrimp, and scallops. Honestly everything was over cooked and bland. Pasta wasn't drained and sauce was meh. Next to us was a pair of older couples and one of the dudes was obnoxious to the point of me having words with him. Decor was old and the place was dark. Probably just went on a bad night but for the money I won't risk going again.
