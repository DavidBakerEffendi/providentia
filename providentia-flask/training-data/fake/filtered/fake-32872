This is a very sophisticated yet relaxed restaurant. Having eaten here and at other Jean Georges restaurants before, I was primed for excellence. My friend and I had the Prix Fixe lunch which is three courses for $28. I ordered the burger, my friend, the chicken. Sadly, I received, instead of the juicy, medium rare patty I requested, two very thin patties a la McDonald's, cooked to a deep brown. Such a disappointment! Perhaps the lowly burger, that most basic of foods, is not worthy of the chef's focus.If so, Â take it off the menu! However, the rest of the meal was excellent, as was my friend's chicken.
