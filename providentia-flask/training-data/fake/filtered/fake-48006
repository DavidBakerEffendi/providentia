Went here with a few girlfriends, and was pleasantly surprised by their Chardonnay and Pinot Grigio by the glass. It was late and early on in the week, so it was pretty quiet, but I could tell that it probably gets pretty crazy on the weekends. The bartender was polite and nice, though not overly friendly. I was looking for a quick flirtation and a little banter, but I could tell he probably wasn't in the mood to entertain. However, he was very easy on the eyes and probably has girls drooling over him all the time. Prices were reasonable for midtown, and I'll definitely try this place again.
