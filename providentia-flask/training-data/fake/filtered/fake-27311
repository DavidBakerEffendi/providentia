While our initial experience at this bar was terrible, I feel compelled to update my review.  I have since been contacted by the owner and we have discussed this matter fully.  It is clear he takes great pride in the Park Avenue Tavern and the service it provides.  He handled this matter professionally and thoughtfully and I'm convinced future service will be greatly improved.  Based on Stephen's handling of this matter, I have increased my rating.  Best of luck in the future.
