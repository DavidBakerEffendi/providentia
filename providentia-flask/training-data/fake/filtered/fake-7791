I really enjoy the atmosphere (the outdoor seating is pretty solid), and the margaritas are pretty great. Honestly, I go back for Hugo, who is the man. He has got to be the best waiter I've ever seen, and I've seen many. He remembers us every time, he brings us free drinks and food, and he's just generally pleasant and upbeat. Great, great guy. The food here is good - you will enjoy whatever you get. I think it is moderately overpriced, but not so much to deter me from going there quite often.
