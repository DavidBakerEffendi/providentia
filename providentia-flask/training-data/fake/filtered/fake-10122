The owner received us - the welcome felt as if we had made a mistake or disrupted him. Got us seated and we found that our chairs were broken. He din't bother to help and my friend had to replace chairs at our table. Same attitude from lady server. The food was horrible. We ordered the chicken quesadilla. It was overly filled, soggy with no flavor. It felt like a first attempt at quesadilla gone wrong. Lucky for me i had ordered the appetizer size. My friend ordered the chilli with rice and a corn cake. Everything was stale. The chilli was dry . The rice cold and the corn cake dead. I wouldn't even call this a mexican place - plain bad food
