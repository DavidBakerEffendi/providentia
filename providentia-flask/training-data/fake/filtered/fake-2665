My husband and I went here for dinner tonight and we enjoyed the food very much. The place isn't all that fancy, fairly typical of a lot of Thai restaurants. I had the Pad Kee Mao, which is thick rice noodles with chicken, shrimp, basil, eggs, and chili sauce. It was really good and spiced exactly how I wanted. which was VERY mild. My husband had the Pad Mie Singapore, which was thin noddles with chicken, shrimp, onions egg and curry powder. He asked for it to be seasoned MILD, which was quite spicy but really good. We ended our meal with the thai iced coffee, which was delicious. The prices are reasonable, the staff was friendly, and we would definitely go back again!
