One of our favorites. Terrific cuisine in a warm, open and glowing atmosphere. We went late and the weather was perfect, so they had the windows open and we had a wonderfully light breeze. I had the gazpacho as an appetizer and the scallops as an entree. My son always orders the cookie dough desert - it may be the best guilty pleasure in the city.
