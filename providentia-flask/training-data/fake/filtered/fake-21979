I love Reading Terminal Market!  It literally has anything and everything you are looking for.  I sometimes go just to look around, and I probably go there every weekend.  I love the falafel place and Bee Natural , which has honey chapstick, candles, soap, and regular honey.  So many surprises like really cheap produce and a used bookstore.
