Would havr given this place zero stars but cant because the site doea not allow iy , worst place ever to grab a bite, place is noisy , wait is ridiculous and food is not worth tasting , servers do not pay attention to what you want , tables are small so a party of 4 cannot even eat properly because there you cant put all the food in a small table , absoultely horrendouse service
