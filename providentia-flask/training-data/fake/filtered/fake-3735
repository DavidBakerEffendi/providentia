I LOVE super hero!!  Jersey City was definitely lacking a good sub place, and I'm so glad that I now have this gem to go to for all my sandwich needs.  They usually have specials going on too- which is a plus.  Got a free (yummy) potato salad with my purchase of a sub this Sunday.  They have everything- subs, wraps, paninis, salads..what more could I ask for.  And their prices are great considering the size of the super hero (large) sub...it's always 2 meals for me because it's HUGE...like larger than a small baby, I'd say! They've always been friendly and patient while I stand there and decide what I'll be devouring. :)  Definitely will be putting my loyalty card to use.
