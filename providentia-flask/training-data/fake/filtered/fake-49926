Went here while in Hartford on business.  Excellent service, the waitron was very knowledgeable, gave an honest review of the available food.  Our party ordered and we were all impressed.  When we were leaving, we met the manager who was very pleasant, professional, and came across as someone who takes great pains to ensure a good experience.  Highly recommended.
