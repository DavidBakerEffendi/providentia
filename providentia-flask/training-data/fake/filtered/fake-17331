To start with, the food here is amazing. I've been here twice now and it's honestly so good. So, why only one star? Well, we ordered delivery this evening, and over half an hour later, I received a call saying they don't deliver to where I live; if I want the food, I have to come pick it up and I have to pay in cash. Now, I only live 15 minutes away, and their website has no mileage limit on their delivery. The website also allowed me to input all my credit card info, despite my using the 15% discount coupon, which was apparently the reason I had to pay in cash when I picked up. When I arrived at the restaurant and voiced my concerns, their response was that I should have called to place an order and not used the online system. I'm sorry, but if you have an online system, I should be able to use it and so should you. This problem would be solved by simply notating how far your deliveries go.
