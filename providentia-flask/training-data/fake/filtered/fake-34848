Seeing the weirdly low reviews of Union League prompted me to join Yelp. After trying every "nice" restaurant in New Haven (Ibiza, Pacifico's, Zinc, Heirloom, etc.), I always choose Union League for special occasions. They're very consistent--I've never had an off meal there after 4 years. Moreover, unlike many other restaurants, their multi-coursed meals are portioned so that you feel very full but not bloated/nauseous after. The tuna carpaccio, duck confit, and scallops are delicious for appetizers; the carpaccio is perfectly and delicately seasoned. For entrees, the duck, veal tournedos, filet mignon, lamb, and anything with parpadelle have been excellent. They used to have a Thai-influenced lobster that was mediocre; stick to classic French and you should be fine. In my opinion, the desserts aren't as extraordinary as the appetizers or entrees. They're delicious, but not sublime. I've tried most of the dessert menu, and the house-made sorbets are standout. Don't judge the restaurant only based on restaurant week--their RW menu doesn't look very representative. Also, if you're getting a table for 2, try not to get the seats behind the giant marble pillar in the corner. :)
