Last minute 8pm Reservation for a party of 12 two days before New Years Eve? No problem! Super wonderful staff. Seated exactly at 8pm. Place was busy, but not crazy. Lovely Christmas decorations. We were seated upstairs, tables were not too close together. They do not have a kids menu, which would have been helpful, but they did have highchairs, which was necessary. We ordered the Fritto Misto. Delicious, the marinara sauce for dipping was amazing! The Caesare salad was a little bland, but the Italica salad looked delicious. The bread basket was warm and fresh. I had the Risotto Mare e Terra. Tons of fresh shrimp and scallops, and tender asparagus. My husband had the special sausage lasagna. He is VERY picky, and he cleaned his plate with bread! Chicken Parm and Spaghetti ala Bolognese were enjoyed by the kids. The portion of the Spaghetti ala Bolognese was a little smaller than expected. Flan dessert was good, the whipped cream and fresh berries on the plate were really good, and were actually better than the flan! Double espresso was perfect. Prices were really reasonable for the location. 10 entrees, several drinks, a bottle of wine, desserts and coffees, tip included (automatic for a large party like ours) was just over $500.00. Would definitely recommend, and would eat there again!
