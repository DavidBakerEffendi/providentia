One of my Favorite Locations to visit when in the city! Great for gourmet shopping delicacies, grocery fresh produce pick me up's, a stop with a loved one for a cafe or wine & cheese, or bring the gang and enjoy one of the luscious eataly restaurants inclusive of fresh fish and meat market! After a bite, try the shopping for fresh beauty products, or maybe a Chef's gourmet cooking & baking collection! There is a country shelf too with fresh homemade preserves, spreads, and fresh picks!
