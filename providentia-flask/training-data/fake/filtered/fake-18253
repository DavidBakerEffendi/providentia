haven't tried the dinner menu but the poutine (sp?) and mac and cheese sticks from the bar menu are insanity.  the interior is absolutely breath-taking.  well dressed, super nice hostesses.  and fyi, they take orders from ipods to the individual who made a comment about staff being on their phones in the middle of service.  your comments are ridiculous.
