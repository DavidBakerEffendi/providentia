We have been customers for years even before it was Say Cheese.  (It was called Vinney and Sons.)  We put in a take out order and were given the incorrect order to take home.  When we got home we realized the error and call the restaurant.  We were told that it was our fault that we picked up the wrong order and that they would do nothing to make good on the order.  Since we live very close by, we brought the food back, left it on the counter and walked out when we were ignored by the staff.  After a couple of minutes, as we were starting the car, someone came out to ask if we still wanted our original order.  We will NEVER step into the restaurant again.  We were treated rudely and blamed for their mistake. In case they didn't know it, the customer is always right and in this case, we were.
