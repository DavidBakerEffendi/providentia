Had read about this little place online and my wife really wanted to try it.  Stopped by yesterday to see about reservations but they only reserve 1/2 (seats maybe 30) so they said stop by an hour before we want to eat and get on list.  Went tonight just before 7:00 and hit it perfect, less than 10 minute wait!  Salads we great as was pork chop and halibut.  Chop was very large and one of the best we have had.  The halibut was very good but a bit small portion.  It was over a fantastic salad.  Had the mushroom side which was average.  The service could not have been better.  During our hour plus dinner we had all 4 servers at our table,  ot too much but impeccable service.  The owner/chef was not there but it made no difference as the staff worked as if they owned the place.
