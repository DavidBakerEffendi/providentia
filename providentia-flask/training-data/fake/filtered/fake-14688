I'm really torn about writing this review. We eat here a decent amount, because the food is good and reasonably close to my apartment. The outdoor area is lovely when the weather is nice. They also have really good drinks (jalapeno margaritas, among other things). That said, the service is really hit or miss. I've had experiences that ranged from fast, attentive, sincere waiters to waiting 20 minutes to have my drink order taken. I love the food, so we will continue to go here--but certainly not when we are in a rush or wanting prompt service.
