Uninspiring food, presented by uninspiring people (and as the old yiddish proverb goes, small portions too).  Came here on a recent weekend and were underwhelmed by the overeager freshman "bouncers" (basically the cast of Girls) and the aggressively mediocre food, which compensates for its meager flavor with the drizzle foodporn factor.  Avoid this place at all costs!
