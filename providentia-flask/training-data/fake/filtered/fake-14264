To be completely frank, I wasn't expecting to like this place very much; however, I was pleasantly surprised with the cheese pizza and hot wings. The food was decent, not overly greasy. With prices this low, I will certainly be ordering from here again. One thing I didn't like is that the delivery took a while--an hour or so for a small order less than 5 miles away. The delivery men were very kind and polite though.
