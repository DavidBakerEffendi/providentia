I wouldn't bother waiting outside for an hour for brunch - totally not worth it, it's all hype. Notice none of the locals do it. Go to the diner instead (Remedy diner on Houston and Norfolk) - no wait and great pancakes and burgers, much cheaper too :) Or 7A (7th street & Av A) or Frankies directly opposite Clinton St BC. If you really must go, do it during the day, early in the week when there's no lines. The food is fine but just not worth the wait. ooh, the diner does great malted chocolate milkshakes which you can't get at CSBC
