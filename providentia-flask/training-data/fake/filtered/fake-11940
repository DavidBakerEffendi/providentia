Lil burgers more like lil trash! I know burgers and when i say i know burgers i mean it. Burgers are one of my favorite food and this place didnt serve burgers they served me garbage! I couldnt even finish one burger and those things are sliders it tasted horrible shame on me for ordering a dozen for my family no one enjoyed it what a waste of money you can get better service and food at white castle.
