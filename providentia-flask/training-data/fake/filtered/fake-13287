Food is way over priced for Filipino street food!  Went there on a date night and bill with tip was $200!  We had 3 beers, 2 appetizers and shared an entree.  Staff is very polite,music is great, but place over all is very tight in seating.  I don't think the head chef was there either so food was mediocre.  I could've went to a trendy restaurant in the meat packing for less.
