What if I can go back to those lean years in school and eat here almost daily...LOVE three roast meats over rice. The Chinese pass on the chicken and go for the salt cooked shrimp and squid.. The duck is great and check out how you can eat for less than $8. Lines during busy hours but they go fast.
