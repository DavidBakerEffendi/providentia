This restaurant is always on my list of go to center city of Philadelphia every time. This place is clean, cute, and quiet. My family and I like this place so much. We visited there again this Friday. The food was still so delicious as usual. Three of us ordered two appetizers and four entrees. We picked up the lobster dumplings and Crispy Calamari as starter. Everyone liked them a lot. We ordered three entrees to share. The Grill Lamb Chop, he lamb meats were cooked perfect and come with tamarind sauce and spinach. The Crispy half duck. The duck meats were so tasty and good crispy, come with bok choi. The Seafood pad Thai with shrimps, scallops, and calamari. They were crinkly, smooth, springy, and soft to the bite. We all enjoyed so much that day.
