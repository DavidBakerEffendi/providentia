This is for the new ownership Ocean's Buffet (formerly Century Buffet) OMG it's not even worth ONE star!  If I could take star's away I would.  Food was cold, old and tasteless.  We got up and left after 10 minutes.  Complained at the register about the food and person said  "I tell the chef, $27 dollars".  We told her we didn't even really eat 1/2 plate each.  "OK, $27" ... Seriously lady?  "I give you discount .. $25" .. UGH      Drive past this place - don't even stop!
