OMG the food. Great atmosphere inside and out! On a warm spring or summer day it's a great place to sit outside and socialize. On chilly nights or for fine dining, the inside bodes well to make you feel "high class" as well as offer GREAT service by their waiters and waitresses. That upside down pizza is great! The heros are phenomenal. Awesome, awesome, awesome.
