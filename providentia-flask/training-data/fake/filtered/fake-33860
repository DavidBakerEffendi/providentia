Highly unsatisfied. Very Bad for Home delivery.!! They dont give enough sauce even after I had fought with them 2 times, they still give me 2 sauce containers (small) with 5 Kati Rolls.! Very Stupid and Idiotic. Their delivery boy comes on a Bicycle in this shivering winter. The owner is very selfish, cruel and idiot person with no business skills. Unless they improve their attitude and believe that Customer is King, they wont last. Very Very Unsatisfied. Food is good though.
