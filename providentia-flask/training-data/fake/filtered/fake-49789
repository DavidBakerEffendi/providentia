4 of us did the tasting menu with wine pairing early on a Friday evening.  Overall the food was excellent. Service - I expected more for a $700+ evening. We notified the waitress multiple times about a nut allergy.   Still my first course had nuts, even though I also added "Without the almonds, please". At the end of the night,  we were served cookies made with almonds and had to ask if they contained nuts instead of being warned by the waitress. We waited something like 40 minutes between the first and second course, and maybe saw the waitress once... maybe. I would've expected a check-in or more wine or something. After that they picked up the speed but we started to feel rushed,  as a server twice tried to take our plates away before the last person was done.  At the end of the night, the manager asked us to get up for another group even though we were certainly not lingering at our table.  To his credit he offered to buy us a round at the bar which we accepted.  Other than what I mentioned, the service was good and the food was delicious. But you don't mess with food allergies.
