This place is awesome. I feel right at home when I walk in. They have a HUGE bourbon and wine selection. As well as a pretty awesome cocktail list with some house infused liquors! It is a nice place to go late instead of somewhere on court or smith. The kitchen is open late too. It's also a fun place to bring a date or a group of friends. Â This is not a fancy place it's quaint and comfortable!
