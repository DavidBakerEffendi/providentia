Ruined my first wedding anniversary with my husband last Saturday night.  We were looking for an Italian restaurant in Tribeca, and had heard good things.  The interior was loud, but manageable.  I ordered the mussels appetizer, which tasted okay at first, nothing to write home about.  However, before we even ordered dessert, I found myself madly dashing to the ladies room with severe stomach pains.  I barely made it on time!  Returning to our table, my husband and I declined to order dessert, since my stomach was in agony.  The bottom line is that the mussels gave me shellfish poisoning. I just returned from the hospital about a minute ago, after two rounds of stomach pumping and eating charcoal.  After nearly dying, the rest of NYC needs to know to avoid this place.  Here's to hoping our second anniversary goes better.
