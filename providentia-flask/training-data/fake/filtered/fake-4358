I have loved this restaurant for over 20 years, and the current management is as friendly, the food as good, and the place as exciting, as it was under the original owners. The food is reasonably priced, and absolutely delicious. There are scores of dishes that go well beyond the standard Mexican-American food stand-bys (tacos, burritos, skirt steaks, tamales) - although they also have all of these dishes. You will often find members of an excellent mariachi band wandering about, and their music is wonderful! The bar is very well stocked, and their drinks are very well made. On special holiday nights (including Cinco de Mayo, Mexican Independence Day, and the anniversary of the restaurant), however, despite the decent-sized parking lot at the rear, it can be difficult to find a parking spot, even on Main St and around the corner on the side streets. So if you have a reservation, plan for a little extra time to find a place to park your car. No matter how busy the place is, they are efficient and keep turnover moving smoothly along, without making you feel rushed or hurried. You can sit as long as you like after your meal, lingering over coffee or a drink, and no one will approach you with your bill until you look up and glance around for your waiter - and yet, I've never seen anyone wait longer than about 20 minutes tops (and often less), even on busy holiday nights. I have no idea how they manage that while retaining the generous hospitality that they are known for. Don't forget to spend a few minutes wandering around to look at all of the beautiful murals painted on all of the walls, and other objects of art all over the place! This restaurant is a feast for your eyes and ears, as well as your taste buds.
