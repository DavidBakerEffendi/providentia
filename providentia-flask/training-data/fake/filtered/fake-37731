Just tried the place for the first time. I kept seeing the billboard on 95 and figured I would give it a try for lunch.   I thought it was very good. The  mushroom salsa was interesting.  I used it on my chicken taco to jazz it up.  I was disappointed that the chicken looked  like it was from a Hormel can  and not off the bone,  but adding that mushroom salsa and some salsa verde  made it much better. The rice and refried were pretty good.  The other part of the combo was the chili relleno.  It wasn't gooey at all.  Almost like it was stuffed with a very dry cheese. Not sure if that's how they always come out of the kitchen, but it did  occur to me it might be old. In any event it all tasted really, really good. I was super hungry.  The sad part was later that evening I got terribly sick!  So maybe too much salsa additions to add spice backfired on me (lieterally!)  or that relleno was way beyond it's shelf life.   Still, I'll give it 3 stars  the staff were on top of things and professional.  But Next time its gotta be Mexican I might check out the competition nearby before I go back.
