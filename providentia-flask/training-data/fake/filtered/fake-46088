Brunch/breakfast here is not to be missed.  All of the food, be it sweet or savory, has been delicious.  The servers are all extremely nice and helpful- they are honest about the dishes and explain everything in detail.  For brunch, the prices can't be beat.  The pork alternative breakfast meats are awesome.  Haven't had a bad bite here yet!
