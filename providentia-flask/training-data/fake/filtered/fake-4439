Fork is still one of the most lovely restaurants in Old City. We frequently dine there before attending a play at the Arden, and if you let the waiter know in advance, you will be served in plenty of time for the curtain call and also receive a dining discount as Fork is a partner with the Arden. Our most recent visit was last week - loved the kale salad - fresh and flavorful - it doesn't taste anything like other kale dishes. I must say that I wasn't wild about the other dishes created by current chef Eli Kulp and miss the prior chef Terrence Feury. But we'll try it again - we can't give up on Fork.
