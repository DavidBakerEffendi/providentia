Solid choice for a casual dinner. Service was friendly. Great beer selection focusing on local breweries and their seasonal offerings (i.e. Magic Hat Howler, Trout River Chocolate Oatmeal Stout when we visited in December). Tried the calamari appetizer--it was perfectly cooked (unlike the rubbery stuff you would usually find at a restaurant) with a delighful aioli dipping sauce. Two of us had the chicken pot pie--it was fine, but the pastry-to-filling ratio was skewed to a little too much pastry. Other folks we dined with got the lamb shank, which fell off the bone, and the pot roast, which was also tender enough to cut with your fork. I'd definitely go again! The prices were a little high in my opinion, and we were sat in the room adjacent to the bar near the door. That would've been ok, but it was cold out, so anytime someone left we were chilled! You can buy $25 gift certificates for $10 (or less with a coupon code) for this restaurant on restaurant.com too which is always a plus!
