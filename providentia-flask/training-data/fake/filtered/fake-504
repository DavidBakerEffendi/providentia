Geno's steaks is a staple in Philly cuisine, and for a good reason.  As evident by the wall of photographs, celebrities and common folk alike flock to this mecca of Philly cheesesteaks.  Admittedly, I ordered a steak sandwich and some fries, which only took a couple of minutes to wait (but they do not come together and require waiting in two different lines).  The price is ok for a quick bite, but nothing spectacular.  The sandwich is tasty, albeit a little greasy.  I decided to add some hot sauce, which I immediately regretted.  There is no warning posted about how spicy that sauce is.  Use with caution and have a lot of water nearby.
