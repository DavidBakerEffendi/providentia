This is my first review on Yelp. I often visit here to read other people's opinions, but the servce I received last night at La Viola angered me so much that i had to vent. I went to the restaurant with 10 other people. We had reservations. When we were seated, we could barely move and we are all THIN women. I'd rather them turn me away then have me sit like i would in a crowded basement. When i had to get up to use the bathroom, i could not becuase the table behind us was so up against us! Now onto the service, when our waiter read outloud our specials, i was putting my camera phone away in my purse after taking pictures of our group, the waiter said to me in a VERY unpolite way "PUT YOUR PHONE AWAY" Excuuuse me! Maybe i did not want to hear about your specials. Maybe i was putting it away. who the hell are you to tell me what to do, i thought the customer was always right! When we ordered, my cousin just wanted a salad. The waiter looked at her with such disgust. 'how could u order just a salad in our establishment!" then when our plates came out, it was so crowded that i tried to move some plates around to help out the same waiter who was so rude to me . he yelled at me again 'IT is hot plate!'. i tried to hand him my dish when done so he did not have to squeeze into the 1/2 ft distance we were from the other table and he said 'no rush no rush' I felt like i was in a crowded basement. i could barely tlak to the people in my group. i was also appauled to see that they sit couples who are probably out for romantic evenings at the same tables with COMPLETE strangers. my meal was mediocre. actually they can stick it up their viola. there are so many other BYOs in the city that would appreciate my business. i will not return.
