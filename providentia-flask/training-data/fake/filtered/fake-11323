The food is excellent here!  The eggplant with olive always made my day.  I also love the crowd in here, it's filled with young artists and gallery assistants.  The price is great the for the value.  Just as long as you stay off staying at the hotel or hanging at the tiny bar/club you'll be more than satisfied!
