Love the food here . one of this places i want to try the menu at the same time if i just could :) i love to go there when friends from outside the city come over to visit , and its always do this magic over and over. people love it. not to mention the great menu of deserts , i personaly like the banana cream with chocolate. but really everything is delicious .
