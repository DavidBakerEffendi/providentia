Have to give a 5 star for the price and the food and the amazing service of bartender, Joanne.  Have you ever had one of those nights, without a reservation at a packed restaurant that you were just sure was going to turn ugly? We walked in, it was packed. The couple In front of us was rude. It was looking like it was not going to be our night. But we got to the bar and the gloom lifted. We found a seat and Joanne (who should deserve a nomination for best bartender in the city)!  She is chipper without being annoying, always there for a filled wine glass or a great recommendation and makes you feel like a regular even when you are hopelessly uncool. The "meat butter" and almond crusted sweetbreads to start were phenominal. Then the special pasta and cockles followed. And finally, the waffle and apple crisp.  Joanne led my choices and she never steered me wrong.  It was a fantastic meal and then the check came. I have had mediocre pizza for more! Thank you!
