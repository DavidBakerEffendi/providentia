New York Times gives this place a great review and rightfully so. I have taken my family and friends there a half dozen times since first going in July and I and everyone in my party have always been totally satisfied. The service is very friendly as the waiters give you time to chit chat with them and they are quite entertaining as well. The atmosphere is comfortable. It's always full of patrons so it has that "I'm someplace that's great" feeling. The owner offers a free drink of his choice at the end of the meal. Nice touch.
