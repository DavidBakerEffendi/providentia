I am getting older now (only 46) but going into the city is not as fun as it used to be. I am so tired of the snotty bartenders and this place was no exception. We get it, you're young and adorable, but you also work for tips! We were there Saturday night 3/24 and had the rudest bartender in a long time. He spoke not one word to us nor made eye contact. You have to be a regular at these places to be treated nice. Philly gayborhood bars DO NOT LIKE OUTSIDERS. This is not my opinion alone, my friends from NYC and DC feel the same way. We won't be going back.
