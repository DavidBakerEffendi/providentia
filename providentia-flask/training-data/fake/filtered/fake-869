I stumbled upon this place by accident coming from my attorney's office, a little down. Yikes!-did this place raise my spirits! I tried the California Dog with guacamole and small fry with Thai peanut sauce. AMAZING! The guys behind the counter were very cool, and waited while looked over the many, many, choices. As great as the dog was, the french fries were the best I have ever had. The sauces for dipping topped the meal off well. 'Gourmet' hot dogs seems an oxymoron at first blush, but this place absolutely deserves the superlatives other raters use. Five stars belittles this establishment-it's even better than that.
