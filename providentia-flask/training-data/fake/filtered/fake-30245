I work in Wetherfield and enjoy City Fish take out once a week.  They have a new dine in option with TV which is a nice addition.  Great clam chowder, scallops, clams (whole belly & strips) and suprisingly fantastic burgers.  This is where the great restaurants get their sea food and you can see why.
