I decided to get a delivery order from this restaurant at 9pm on Saturday night. This should be close to the end of the dinner rush, and it gave me a 30-45 minute delivery time prior to ordering. After completing my order, I received an email stating the same 30-45 minute delivery time. After 1 hr I called the restaurant to find out where my food was and the guy who answered the phone said all orders already left the restaurant and it should be there any minute. When my food finally arrived almost 1 hr 40 minutes later, it was cold and my order was incorrect. The only bright side to this order was the tasty (but cold) tator tots.
