I've always considered this a good place to eat until today.  Everyone makes mistakes and today they gave me the wrong sandwich.  I work an hour north so I didn't find out about it until I got to work.  I called and they were outright rude.  No appology, just bring it back.  When I explained I couldn't now and had paid for a more expensive sandwich then I received, they just said well bring it back. I wasn't offered the difference back until I asked and the owner made me feel like I was bothering him.  So if you get something to go, open everything up and check.  Its going to be a while before I go back because of the rudeness.
