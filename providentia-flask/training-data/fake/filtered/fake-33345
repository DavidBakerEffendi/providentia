The place has a wonderful feel with unique food. My food was fantastic, my friend's wasn't as great. Our waitress was snotty (telling us the specials and asking if we have any questions, then leaving before anyone could ask anything). Then when she added the bill she included gratuity (for a party of 6) which was actually 30%. Though she was nice enough to correct it to 20% when we pointed out her mistake. I probably won't go back. I hate feeling cheated.
