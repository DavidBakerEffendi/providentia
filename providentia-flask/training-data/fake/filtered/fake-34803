Hands down, one of the most overrated restaurants in -- not just Hartford -- EXISTENCE. Sure, I'll go there for drinks after work.  I may even munch on some of those handmade chips they have (which are pretty decent).  I've tried going for dinner, and each time has been a failure.  When I go back, it's only because my boss chooses the place and it's down the street. Menu is completely uninspired and the generic version of "New American" (Max's patent must be up).  Bartenders have little to no intuition, or for that matter, peripheral vision.  Service (servers and bartenders alike) might approach being amongst the worst in Connecticut. Wrap all that up in a pricey menu, and you'd be best off going a few blocks down to Max's for dinner.  Sit in the tavern if you're not interested in a white linen type of night.
