I am a certified beer snob. I lived in San Diego for 8 years, the IPA mecca.  Bay Ridge is not a hipster part of Brooklyn at all which is good but the downside to this is that there are few places in this neighborhood with legitimate IPAs and crafts beers.  The Lockyard answered my prayers. I love all the staff and bartenders, they're all funny bastards and the regulars are an eclectic mix of longtime bay ridgers and hipster transplants.  The back area is great for people with kids like myself and bar is great for bar hoppers. They have an excellent trivia night on Wednesday also.
