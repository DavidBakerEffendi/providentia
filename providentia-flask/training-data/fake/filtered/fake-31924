My daughter and I were visting NY to attend the US Open this weekend. We stumbled upon Calle Ocho after having a sister restaurant recommended to us - Rain - closed for rennovations. Calle Ocho is righ around the corner. Â It was a fantastic surprise - we had a wonderful time, the food was amazing, the atmosphere was great and the Sunday night Sangria bar was perfect... thanks for a great memory.. we will definately return.
