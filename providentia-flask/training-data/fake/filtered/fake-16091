This place is absolutely rude and disgusting.  I have been a fan of cafeteria for a couple yrs now.  My last experience will be the last there.  I went there about a month ago with my girlfriend for dinner at 4 am and ended up waiting in line with 20 other people for half hr til i had enough.  You have a line of people and random groups of girls or a guy with a group of girls walks by and goes in this place without getting in line or the door man saying anything.   Then I hear the buddy guard inside the place comes outside and tells the doorman that only beautiful girls or groups of girls go in first while everyone waits.  After i tried going in this place to confront the guy for saying this , he gets in my face and tells me to go somewhere else and that if i want to eat then maybe i should open a restaurant.  Can you believe this clown?    I promise i will shut this place down or at least throw the garbage out thats running this place.
