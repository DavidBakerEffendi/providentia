It was super crowded packed with lots of hipsters when i got there.  There were plenty of asians in the crowd which hopeful to me, as a sign that the food would be a bit more authentic.  while waiting a bit unbearably long for the table, tried some of the drinks -- had an interesting cocktail made with calpico which is a milky soda -- it was called a winter snowflake -- I thought that was pretty cool, if very sweet but i dug it.  my friend had some other kind of drink which seemed to be made with grapefruit soda and lycee -- that was pretty tastey -- all said -- i give the drinks a A- for being girly and interesting. back to food -- my ramen had a rich savory broth and i ordered it with extra pork -- though quite tastey, i was disappointed that the pork wasnt tender enough -- Tampopo it wasn't but still, quite a savory bowl, better than most. atmosphere -- a bit too techno (really loud music) and seats were abit too close together.  it wasn't relaxing or zenlike by any means. that said, interesting crowd -- as i'd mentioned, plenty of hipsters, more arty types of asians, and bit on the younger 20's crowd. worth a visit, not sure about the revisit though.
