I ate there tonight for the first and last time! I went because I wanted to sit outside for the Thursday concert they have on the grounds. I ordered steak fajitas with beans and rice. Rice was the only edible element. The steak was burned, not seared, burned. it was so fatty and stringy, I couldn't cut it with the knife they gave me, let alone chew it! The beans were also burned, Â and just looked awful. Can't believe a chef would serve that food! I left it. Even the margarita was bad, I had one sip and left it with the "food." These are not cheap prices, and the food is better at Taco Bell!
