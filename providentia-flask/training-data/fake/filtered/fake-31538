Awesome establishment! Great food, drinks, music and ambiance. We ordered arepitas, wild mushroom flat bread, lobster flat bread and the tuna tar tar as appetizers. They were so good and just the right portions. As an entree I had the lime crusted atlantic salmon. It was accompanied by cilantro mashed potatoes, asparagus and a few peeled cherry tomatoes with a great pineapple reduction. The food was well cooked well, the bitterness of the lime crust and pineapple reduction mixed very well. A glass of their Chilean chardonnay went very well with the meal. The service over all was exceptional, our server Kayla Marie was very pretty, attentive and respectful. Â I recommend everyone to come here at least once in their life.
