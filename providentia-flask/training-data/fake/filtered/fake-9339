The service here is excellent, the food delicious, and the atmosphere very nice.  While the price is slightly higher than expected (each dish is about $12-$15), it certainly is so high as to make the food not worth it.  To the contrary, this restaurant is a must-visit for anyone in NY who has not tried it.   We had the Chicken Adobo, Kaldereta (beef), and Liempo (bbq grilled pork), and all were perfectly cooked.  Also had the filipino lemonade, and that was excellent.
