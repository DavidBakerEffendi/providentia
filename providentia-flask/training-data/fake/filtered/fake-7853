Visited in June of 2012 - and felt compelled to share my thoughts. It was on a wk day and was very busy. We managed to get seated rather quickly inside. Service was good, but the food was even better. My husband and I both agree that this was the BEST tasting hamburger we have ever had. It had nothing to do with the toppings/sauces which are usually used to camouflage what the meat is lacking. Â Prices were reasonable with good sized portions. Great place and would highly recommend!
