Haven been to this place for lunch on 09/05/2014. On this busy day of friday when everyone is here for lunh, i had ordered a veggie platter and i found a cockroach in the daal served in the platter. Upon notifying the staff about it, they replaced it with a new portion of daal within a minute as if it was fresh. When informed the manager about it , he just walked in into the kitchen as if he was to take care of it and never returned out. The staff was so rude , that no one even apologized for their mistake. Really disappointing. I would not go to this place again.
