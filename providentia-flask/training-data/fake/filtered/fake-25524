We were at this restaurant last night.  It seems that all of the waiters, service and serve all the tables. Our service seemed hap hazard, due to this. The grilled calamari was fair. The pasta dish ( rigatoni) was perfect. The entrees were fair at best.  The bronzino was small and slightly dry even with a sauce on it. My husbands veal had to be sent back and he got another veal dish, but at that point he was not that hungry. We ordered dessert to go, and I must say they were good. The place is cute, small, but very noisy.  Probably would not go back unless I read a fantastic review. I went because of  a good review  that I had read.  Diane G.
