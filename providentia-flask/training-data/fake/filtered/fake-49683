Six of us went there for Happy Hour and dinner.  We toured the grounds prior to Happy Hour and they are worth seeing, but the evening went down from there.  Service at the bar was just OK, however, our waitress was busy.  At dinner, my skirt steak was tough (in fact I choked on the meat), and fatty.   So food was not very high on my list.  Atmosphere?  I agree with several reviewers, where they stated that the people/service are stuffy, and they have an attitude of "if you do't like it, don't come back".  We were asked to leave the place because we were too loud, and never were offered dessert.  When we complained, they stated that they would call the police.   I would not recommend this place for a group.  They could accommodate a group, as they do have separate rooms, but they seated others in our area.  I have never in my life been treated this way, and I will never return.
