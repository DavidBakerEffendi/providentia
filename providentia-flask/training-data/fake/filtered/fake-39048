After walking up and down the street looking for a place to eat we found Ri Ra Irish Pub. It was just what we needed. We had the wild wings which were just hot enough. I had the fish and chips and my fianc√© had the Ruben sandwich--they were both delicious. Our server was super friendly and attentive but not overly so that you get caught having to talk with your mouth full. We'd definitely come here again.
