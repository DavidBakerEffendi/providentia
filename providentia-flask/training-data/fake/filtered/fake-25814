Not "the boundary between earth and underworld" as the pun Stix might allude to, but a place with atmosphere, deliciously straightforward, "clean" food and absolutely fantastic service that is the real deal here. Came here on my own and with company - and all of us cannot but be delighted by the manager who greeted and treated us as if we were friends of the house, giving us friendly and detailed Â information about the concept and the menu. I suffer from a lot of food allergies and often encounter difficulties when asking a million questions about ingredients etc. Not with that lady. She patently listened to all the questions I had and made any alteration to the dish that was necessary. The service was attentive and friendly and although the place was packed to the last seat, the atmosphere was pleasant and not hectic at all. Will come back again and again - for a meal amongst friends.
