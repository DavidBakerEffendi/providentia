I love this place.  I've read some of the reviews here and I do not agree with most of them.  The waitresses are very pleasant to me and go out of their way to help me and my wife.  Some people have to understand that these girls are on their feet for over 12hours a day and can not remain pleasant all of the time.  They seem to try to help everyone to the best of their abilities.  But you got to understand, there are at least 20 people on line at any given time.  The important thing here is the food.  And, the food is fantastic!!!!
