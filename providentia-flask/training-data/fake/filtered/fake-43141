I have tried Noodle Station too many times for it's worth. The owner's daughter was rude and incorrigible. (Peter Chu owns and operates both the Noodle Station and China Station- which rocks!) I have a few allergies, and when I asked what was in some of the sauces, not only did she not answer my question, she became very rude and defensive. I ended up with Peter's Special, because I was told it was the same as China Station. It must have been prepared in Africa because it was nothing like China Stations. The noodles were not cooked, the vegetables were not cooked and the chicken was exceptionally rubbery. Also, do they wash those metal bowls between customers? I don't want my dinner prepared in the same dish as the customer before me... The service is slow, the managers are rude and for $9 a dish, I'll drive to China Station. I wanted to love this place since I love China Station. Peter- you need to come here and show these guys how it's done!!
