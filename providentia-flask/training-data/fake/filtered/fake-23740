Well, I have to say this is the place to bring out-of-town friends. My guest have raved about the place; food, location, atmosphere, etc.  Yes, I've waited anywhere from 20-45 mins for a table, but that's part of it and it's worth it.  I would suggest that you ask for a table upstairs, it seems less crowded or cramped.  Enjoy your surroundings while you wait for your food. ENJOY!!
