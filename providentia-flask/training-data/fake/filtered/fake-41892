It is always the case that when a restaurant is good, you can't really find much to say- besides the food is delicious, the staff is attentive, and the overall experience is spectacular.  It's much easier to write a negative review, in general. I went to this place before a show on a Wednesday evening.  I had a reservation at 6 p.m..  By the time we got there, the place was already packed.  The restaurant gave you a homey feeling.  And the wait staff was friendly.  There were only three appetizers to choose from.  We ordered the shrimp and calamari.  It was one of the best that I have had.  And my main course- a chicken dish- was very good too.  All the ingredients on the plate tasted fresh.  This place is a lot better than I expected.  Thumbs and toes up!  FIVE SOLID STARS!
