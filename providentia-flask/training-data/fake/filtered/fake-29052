You get no points for the bread, you only bought it. You get no points for The pork is "wet," not "moist" -- like eating tuna from a can without draining first. It's a good thing that it's small, or I'd feel worse about having to throw half of it away -- I had to wash my hands twice and chew three sticks of gum to get rid of the taste and smell of this thing. Maybe the other options are better; I'm not holding my breath (nor holding out my wallet).
