I've lived in the village my whole life and never had such and amazing meal and experience even in 27 years. The meal was not only delicious but unique and for the quality of food shockingly faired priced. The service was perfect. I've gone twice now and both times the servers were nice relaxed personable and professional but not too personable. They are only at the table and never for longer than necessary but when you leave you feel you need to say bye cause they still make you feel like a personally unique customer that they value. Atmosphere is perfectly lighted and decorated. Romantically lighted for a nice date night but decoration is perfect for a fun night with close friends. I have never written a review on yelp but this place was do great I just had too!!!!
