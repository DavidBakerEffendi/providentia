Very disappointed in this place . The first time we ate there , service was horrible and the food was even worse.  Chicken marsala was so plain and taste like boiled chicken in oil, they gave me a side of pasta with plain tomato sauce. It was the most horrific meal I've ever eaten out .  I tried this place a month later and I have to say , same thing , food was horrible and definitely not worth my money , appetite and time .
