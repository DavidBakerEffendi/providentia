This place is god.  The Meta meta pizza is great with the stromboli part being the best.  This Meta meta is half pizza and hlaf stromboli.  Tonight the place was very busy and our service was quite slow and the waiter was inattentive to us.  He never asked if things were ookay nr did he ask if we wanted anything else.  At one point, I had to ask anoother waiter to please provide some black pepper.
