As a white girl with no knowledge of Filipino food, I absolutely love this restaurant. My boyfriend, however, is Filipino and loves it too, so that makes me feel better. We frequent Maharlika for the Longsilog, Lumpia, and Spam Fries. The atmosphere is great, they play awesome music and, even if you're in close quarters with another table (because it is Manhattan), it's still comfortable. The service is always impeccable and the cocktails are delish - all the makings for 5 stars.
