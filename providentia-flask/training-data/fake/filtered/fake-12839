The chicken satay tacos with spicy are amazing! I feel like the combination and amount of chicken, peanut sauce, lettuce, tomato and spicy stuff is perfect. If you were put three of these on a plate in a fancy restaurant and charged $18, I would still be going back. It's that good. It takes me nearly 30 minutes just to walk from my office and back otherwise I would be here way more often! It's also a bonus that the guy that runs the truck is seriously one of the nicest people I've ever come across in the food business-even if it's crazy busy around lunch time, he is pleasant. Not that it really has an effect on the food, but it's nice to buy from someone like this! Can't wait to try one of these iced teas next time
