I have to say I've been going here for a while, and when Boneshakers closed (tear!*)  This became the go-to brunch place.  I used to go just because it was close and easy to meet up with others, but since the renovations to make it a vegan diner I absolutely LOVE it!  The booths are a wonderful addition, the new menus are streamlined and easy to read, the paired-down baked good selection much fresher than before and more interesting without being overwhelming.  I love getting the Sag as an old standby, but everything I've had here has been delicious.  The only thing I would change is to organize the waitstaff a bit better with a designated host, and more prompt table service, but although they are a bit disorganized they are very friendly. Oh and add juice!  But this place is a great atmosphere - try the cinnamon rolls!
