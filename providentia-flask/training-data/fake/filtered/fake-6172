My friends and I have driven pass here many times: a small corner place with ONLY 2 tables if you're looking through the window...then we made a reservation and went inside and the place opens up with an arch, iron rail decoration, and a wall painting that reminds me so much of an Italian restaurant in Sea Point (suburb of Cape Town), South Africa.  It's a tad crowded with 12 tables in the dining room. It's good for a small intimate group of say 6.  The food is amazing! I had the pork shake...tender off the bone and flavorful.  I also love the tomato salad with rice, greens, and a fist-size fresh mozzarella ball.  The chocolate torte is as dense and rich as a neutron star; yes, I studied astrophysics.  You can BYOB & Wine. The staff is very polite and attentive. We actually end up having a conversation with the 2 table next to us as they were curious about what we ordered.  I'm glad we came here and had a fun night.  Definitely will return. Only complaint: bread was a bit hard and wasn't fresh.  But the appetizers and main dishes more than make up for that.
