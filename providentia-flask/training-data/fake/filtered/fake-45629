It's a popular bar in Hartford so with that aside, I'd like to point out the biggest flaw. Service. The service is so slow. One night, we had a party of 5 and all got the 2/$25 deal. They never bothered to bring us a dessert menu and we got tired of waiting. Another night, it took 10-15 minutes each time we wanted something like a menu, ketchup or a check. When it got busier towards 9-10, forget about finding a waiter.
