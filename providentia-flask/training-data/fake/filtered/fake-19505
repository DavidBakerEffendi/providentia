I've tried Osteria twice now, and I really don't get the hype it seems to get from local media.  The first time I went was in the winter, and I tried the Margherita pizza, a sweetmeats primi and a duck secondi.  The pizza was good, but it was a $15 pizza so it should have been great.  The sweetmeat was bland, and in a miso soup-like sauce that was just not appetizing.  The duck was prepared a little too au natural for me: you really had to tear at it, and bones were still embedded in the meat.  I don't like being that close to my food.  I don't want to be reminded that my meat was ever an animal. I tried Osteria again recently, hoping I had just been finicky during the first attempt.  I had the Lombarda pizza and split two primi meals- chicken liver rigatoni and pork neck cannelloni.  The pizza was great, and the two primi courses were good.   I don't plan on going back to Osteria again.  Great pizza in an expensive restaurant is not enough of a lure.  Also, the meat-heavy meals are just too much for me to handle, and to be quite honest both times the place gave me the post-meal meat sweats.
