We found this place during restaurant week and wanted to visit a different neighborhood as we live downtown. It was a monday night which is their $5 cocktail night, the cocktails are amazing. Then we took a look at the menu and of course did not want to order from the restaurant week menu, and so glad we did not. The bread they brought to the table was warm and soft dumpling type i could not help myself. The waiter was very helpful and new the menu very well after giving us great recommendations. We left very full and satisfied and cant wait for our next trip uptown too Calle Ocho
