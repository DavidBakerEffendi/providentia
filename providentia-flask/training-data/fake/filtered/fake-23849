Went here for the first time this weekend, and loved it.  It is casual, down-home style, very comfortable.  I've had plenty of Latin food but not specifically Venezuelan, and the food here was interesting and great!  I had the beef soup, which had wonderful flavorful chunks of beef and root vegetables (perfect for the frigid winter night that it was).  Then I had the Asado Negro - a cut of beef in an unusual and really delicious sauce of brown sugar cane and garlic.  I love trying new things, and this was both new and delicious.  The owners are very friendly and made us feel very welcome (it was Sunday night so pretty empty, and they had plenty of time to chat).  We enjoyed it very much and look forward to coming back and trying some of the other dishes that would be new to us.  I wish we knew about this long ago!
