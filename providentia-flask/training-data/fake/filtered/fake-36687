I have been here several times. The food has never been an issue. However, the service simply LACKS. Unfriendly, bickering, slow, forgetting things, etc. I give the 3 stars b/c as I said the food is decent even though service LACKS. Middle of the road is as fair as I can give. At some point the poor service will come back on the establishment good food or not and this place will suffer.
