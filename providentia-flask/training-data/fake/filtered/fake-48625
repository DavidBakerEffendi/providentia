I've been to Genteel's several times over the past year after I found out they serve Gluten Free Pizza.  The place is your typical family run pizzeria with a nice seating area if you plan on dining in with a typical italian pizzeria menu (pasta, chicken parm, antipasta, etc).  Its also BYOB which is nice.  I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking for fine dining but if you're looking for a quick bite to eat or if you're gluten free like my family and are craving a slice of pizza (they also offer gluten free pasta) then you've come to the right place.
