Fantastic pizza, a coffee and gelato bar worth the wait (I recommend the Torinese coffee), amazing bread, pastas, prime rib sandwiches, vegetables, fresh cheese -- at first it was disorienting, but I've been back enough times that I have gone from being lost to being found there.  There are few Italian restaurants can compete on any of these types of food.  None can compete with them all, so they get the 5. The waitstaff at the restaurants is excellent.  Much of the food is world class.  It is the best place in Flatiron by a landslide.
