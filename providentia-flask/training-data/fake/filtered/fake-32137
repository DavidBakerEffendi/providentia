Food is decent, drinks are decent.  Nothing I'd go out to specifically, but it's an okay enough place if you're already in the area.  Basic menu with nothing special, but everything on the menu is good, and executed precisely as you'd expect,  No ambitions, but no failures.  The servers are standard servers.  They smile, the bring your food, they come around once or twice and ask how things are going.  Nothing exceptional, nothing bad.  A very standard place to stop being hungry in.
