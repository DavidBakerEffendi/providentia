Ended up going back another time. Bar/Restaurants have this complex where they can forget which one they are exactly. The answer to this everytime is, you must fully be both. Sorry if you really just wanna be a bartender. I would too. But you gotta really get in it and take the orders and ask the necessary questions and make bills with multiple people and orders on it. Orders of, you got it, drinks at the bar and food from the kitchen. I would not recommend this place to anyone who really wants a good service.
