Like the reviewer below I also got food poisoning a few hrs after eating here. Had the fish tacos and braised beef. We told the manager the next day but the most he could offer was to buy us a drink..didn't even offer to comp the meal. definitely not oing back and wouldn't recommend it unless you want to risk getting food poisoning as well!
