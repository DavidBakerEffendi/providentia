One of my favorite brunch places in Williamsburg. This place is so unique, the decor is beautiful and you feel at home when you go eat here. The outdoor patio is incredible, there are plants all around and its a wonderful escape from city life. My favorite are the eggs benedict, they come with a yummy salad and home fries and are $9. Their beers run approximately anywhere from $3 to $6 Â and the desert is aweeeeesoommm!!!! All home made by the owner (the last time I went I found this out :)
