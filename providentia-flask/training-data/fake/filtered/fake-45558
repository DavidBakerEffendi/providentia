Wow.   It's as good as it gets....From Ronkonkoma L. I.    I Love the Baked Clams, and the Linguine with clam sauce.   you never tasted anything so good.   Being brought up in an old fashioned Italian Family from Italy..... mom cooked close to this...but wow, progress has made it even better.   Don't waste your money in other restaurants....here's where its at....it don't get no better than this.    I can t wait to go back.
