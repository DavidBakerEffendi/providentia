You can not leave a guest hungry. I mean the portions were really small and for a carribean dinner I would NEVER EVER bring my family. I just don't get it, I will Never come back. I will just go to Mixto restaurant, like for real not trying to boost mixto Â up but like come one Caribbean or Latin cuisine are know for their portions. I gave 2 stars because it tasted ok... Biggest disappointment of 2014
