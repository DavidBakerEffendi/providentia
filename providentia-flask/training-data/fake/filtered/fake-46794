I was dining at this establishment with friends I was visiting and if I was not with friends I would have walked right out.  We ate at Ten Stone on May 31st and I had the worst service and food I have possibly ever had and I have been to every major city in the states. We were told by our waitress Meghan that the kitchen was switching over and no food could be served for 45 mins.  This was pretty crazy.  They would not even bring us bread and then 20 mins later a table sits next to us and gets nachos brought out to them.  They had a different waitress.  Not only was the waitress poor at giving decent service the manager was behind the bar talking to one of the cooks.  She was no help at all and when I asked that the manager comg over the waitress suggested that she not.  The soda was flat and the managers answer to me was to throw them in the sink and tell me that if mine was flat they all would be flat and made no offer of any other drink suggestions. Lost money right there.  While we were waiting for our food 10 other tables had food delivered.  This made NO SENSE if the kitchen was switching over and they coud not make anything.  Run don't walk from this place no matter how tempting it looks.
