BEA and it's very kind owner + staff care for their guests like family. It is so refreshing to find a place here in nyc that has the perfect balance of service, menu and atmosphere.  The cocktail and wine selection is well curated. The menu offers a scrumptious selection of both comfort and sophistication foods. The Atrium area is perfect for small parties as well.  I have been here a few times now and the most important thing I can share is that everyone that works there cares about you and if you're having a pleasant experience. BEA is a true gem! Please check this place out for yourself. Cheers!
