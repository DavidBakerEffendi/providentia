Do not order sandwiches or pizza from here.  Granted, I've only had a regular cheese slice once and it was nasty even with garlic powder and red pepper flakes to mask the taste, so I would never order a whole pie.  I ordered hot pastrami from them 3 times they skimp on the meat and it's like you're eating a bread sandwich. The only thing that taste good are their chicken fingers and the fries are decent.
