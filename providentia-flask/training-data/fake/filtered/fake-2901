I went to Cuban Petes last night, and this place has the wrost management and the worst service EVER. After being seated immediately, we waited 20 minutes for a waiter to even acknowledge us. When we had to get someone to take our order, it took another 10 minutes to get our 0.05% alcohol "sangria" - which leaves a lot to be desired. It took another 10 minutes to get our apps. After I got up and complained to the manager (who I later found out was Dominick, the owner), he told me to "Go F' Yourself, you Gringo A-Hole" and told my party to leave. WHAT?!?!?! How is anyone allowed to talk to a customer like this? STAY AWAY! Spend your money elsewhere, because this guy does not deserve it.
