So disappointed in the way they handled the hepatitis A issue at the restaurant.  i received a phone call from the dept of health., so I called alta directly and was put on hold for 15 minutes.  When they finally were able to speak to me (briefly), they said they would call me back the next day.  I never received a return phone call nor an apology from Alta.   My dining companion has a compromised liver, so this is huge deal.  She has to go to her immunologist to handle this and get the appropriate remedy.   I have eaten there several times and do like the food (ironically the dessert was the biggest disappointment!), but won't go back....
