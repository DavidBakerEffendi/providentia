This is the BEST artichoke pizza ever!  We were visiting from CA and it was suggested we go there.  The place was small and everyone was sitting outside eating there Pizza out of the box.  We got 3 slices in 2 boxes.  The slices where huge and we enjoyed every bite.  I would recommend this place to anyone and when I return I will be back!
