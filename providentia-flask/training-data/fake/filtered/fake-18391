Oh man. If this place was closer to where I lived, I would be here all the damn time. The best way I can describe the restaurant atmosphere is that it feels like a family dining room. The walls are brightly colored, there are no big partitions between tables, and there are people eating happily, filling lots of tables. I came here on a Saturday dinner, with my boyfriend. We both stuffed ourselves silly, and I think I even out-ate him. The food was widely varied but all high-quality and tasty. The pakoras were crisp, the curries were rich, the meat was tender and flavorful. The desserts were great as well. I ate what felt like a pound of naan, and if I could have fit more platefuls of food into my face, I would have.         Most important,,well experianced smart waiter(perfect server).its a kind of unusual for indian restaurants. But alas, I will have to go back at another time to do that. And I will, because kochi is just great.
