My husband and i were in this week and just found out that our favorite waitress left, seriously she was the best! The food here is always great and very fresh but the service is what always kept us coming back. I'm not sure what changed but it seems like they have a hard time keeping a steady staff now. I'm sure the service will continue to be friendly but as a regular I miss the days when you could go in and the waitress knew your name and how you took your coffee- it once brought a lot of charm to the place. Â The classic and always delicous egg sandwich will keep us coming back but i'm not sure its worth going out of the way for quite as often.
