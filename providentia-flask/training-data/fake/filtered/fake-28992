My friends were raving about this place, so I decided to check if it is really that amazing. It is!!! Beautiful decor and great service, and the food of course-excellent. I will be coming back soon with more people to have more of the meditereanian delicacies. Cant wait to get another bite of the crepes-very different from the ones we all got used to in New York.
