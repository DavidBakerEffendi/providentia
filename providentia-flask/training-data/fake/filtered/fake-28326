My friends and I went to Taverna after one of my girlfriends raved about the seafood. She pre-warned me about a possible wait on a Sunday evening and she was right, the place was packed!  We sat outdoors and we shared a gigantic salad and huge appetizers.  All of it was amazing!  The calamari and scallops are incredible and they don't hold back on the portions.  The selection of drinks were a bit limited and I get that they're not Esca, but I wished they had a wider range.
