This place truly has some of the best Brazilian food I ever had!!  It's so quaint and the hostess is really nice.  We first had the sangrias which were excellent.  I had the beef stew which was better than my moms.  The prices were reasonable as well.  We never felt rushed to leave.  I would eat there everyday if i could.
