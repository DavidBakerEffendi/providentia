One goes on-line to review a restaurant because they either love it or hate it. In this case, it's the latter. If you come from a real Italian background, the decor & ethos of this place will blow you away. It's a real diamond in the rough, given that it's located in a strip mall with no real landscaping and a parking lot that leaves much to be desired. The food is EXCELLENT! The prosciutto is some of the best I've ever had outside of Italy, and the presentation of every dish we ordered was superb. Having gotten to speak with the owner/chef, it is clear that this restaurant is driven by a passion for great food and attention to the details, as opposed to food cost & profit as in most cases. The gnocchi were so good that I might even go as far as comparing them to, dare I say, nonna's! Luca's Ristorante exceeded all of my expectations, and I will undoubtedly be making routine dinner appearances there.
