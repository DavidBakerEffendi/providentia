The Best NY Italian Pizza, The Place is well stocked with Italian foodstuffs.   There isn't really a list of options, so better ask for whatever you want.  The staffs here are friendly and helpful, so go talk to them as they will help you with a smile and complete your day; feels like you're very important.   Anat,
