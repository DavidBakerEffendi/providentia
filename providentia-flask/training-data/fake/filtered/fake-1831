EDIT (10/23/12): too bad ippudo.  our love/hate relationship has to come to an end.  you treated my mom very poorly.  your manager haru does not know how what customer service is.  you told her to eat her not-quite-but-almost-spoiled-because-it-was-left-­out-too-long food and refused to replace it.  in fact, you denied there was anything wrong with it as you told her to eat it.  (i mean, c'mon.  really?!  if she got sick eating the food, i'm pretty sure she would be suffering, not you.  definitely not your call to make).  even after a week, she's still upset at the way she was treated at your restaurant.  in the moment she sat there and took the mistreatment - but after she got over her initial shock, she was filled with a feeling of injustice and rage.  your welcome for discouraging her from going back and causing a scene.  you are officially being boycotted by the family.  thank you for making it easier for me - since the last time i went (2 weeks ago) the wait was too long, the food was underwhelming and the service was nonexistent.
