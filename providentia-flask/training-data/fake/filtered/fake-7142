The service here was absolutely amazing! I had the farmers skillet with roasted potatoes. However, my server was less than satisfying. He looked "under the influence" and didnt pay attention to me AT ALL. I dont want to give a name because i dont know it but his appearance was rather disheveled and tacky. Not very well kept. Â  I am not happy with him but everything else was great.
