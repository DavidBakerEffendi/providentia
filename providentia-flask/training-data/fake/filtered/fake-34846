We're visitors to New Haven and decided to treat ourselves to a lovely meal at Union League Cafe. From beginning to end, the experience was exceptional.  The wine list is extensive, but fortunately our server knew it very well and helped us choose a great chenon blanc. The mood at lunch was relaxed. All four of our party had fish - cod and bass which were simply done, to perfection. We also enjoyed cheeses which our server selected. She listened to my tastes and delivered on them.  My Mom had the icecream which was just slightly small on size.  I don't find a place like this expensive as it stands out a long distance from the rest -- people you pay for what you get.  If we didn't live in North Carolina, then we'd be there all the time.
