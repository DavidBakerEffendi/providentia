I don't know what Pete Wells was talking about- the people here are so nice and courteous. My girlfriend and I were greeted and seated immediately. Had a great meal and wine from their fantastic wine list. Upon leaving, just about every staff member said goodbye to us. It's family-style service like that that will keeps us coming back.
