The waitress with the Stevie Wonder "Visions" tattoo is rude and offensive, going so far as to argue with customers (especially black customers). I watched as she argued with a black customer who was having beers with his buddy. The customer was talking, and it was apparent he was expressive when talking as he used his hands to express himself, as some people often do. The waitress kept walking back and forth and eventually told him to watch his hands, he gently placed his hand on her shoulder, told her he did not see her as his back was turned and that he was expressive and used his hands when he talked. He apologized  whereupon she again told him to watch his hands and not touch her....eventually he told her to go to hell as he felt offended.....MY QUESTION IS: SINCE WHEN IS A WAITRESS ALLOWED TO ARGUE WITH LET ALONE TELL A CUSTOMER TO WATCH HIS HANDS WHILE EXPRESING HIMSELF IN A CONVO (ESPECIALLY SINCE HE WAS NOT PLACING THEM ON HER)----NEEDLESS TO SAY THEY LOST ME AS A CUSTOMER AND I  FAIRLY CERTAIN HE WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN------
