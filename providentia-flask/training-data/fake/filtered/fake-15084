Excellent food and great service. All servers took extremely good care of us in a very genuine way. Would definitely recommend. Also, my wife is gluten-intolerant and they catered for it extremely well. Not only does the menu have heaps of gluten-free dishes, but they made sure every they told us each dish was gluten-free when they brought it back out. Thanks! Just a quick note - they were booked out when we went (Sat night) so recommend you call ahead.
