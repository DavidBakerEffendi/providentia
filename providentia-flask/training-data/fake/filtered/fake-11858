This gets 5 stars because of the spinach gnocci - simply outstanding.  Everything else on the menu you can get anywhere else - so go with the spinach gnocci, you will not be disappointed.    That dish alone makes this one of our staple go-to places in the city. Wait staff is friendly and attentive.  Good wine list.   A perfect spot for a nice meal with friends or with a date/spouse.  Just remember, CASH ONLY.
