Yumm!!! but not the healthiest vegan but it is definitely the best diner style vegan joint I have been to! you will leave feeling like you ate home cooking. The atmosphere is cute and cozy and the waitstaff were very friendly. The choc chip cheesecake was the absolute best vegan cheesecake I have ever had.
