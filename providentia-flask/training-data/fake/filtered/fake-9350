Just order from here for the first time and i was so happy i decided to try it! Although it took about 45 mins for the food to get here everything was hot and tasty. Got the chicken fingers with french fries and the honey mustard it came with was out of this world! The french fries were nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. also got the chicken francaise dinner which was a great value because it came with pasta and a salad. The francaise sauce was a little in the watery side but it was still good. Definitely going to eat from here again but will probably just pick it up next time!
