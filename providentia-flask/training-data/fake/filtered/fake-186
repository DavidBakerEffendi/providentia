Sadly, since it's such a trek to get there, Geno's was just about the only thing I did in Philadelphia, and it left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Wish I read the reviews first! Hard to enjoy sitting outdoors (in winter) eating an overpriced blah sandwich in the picturesque Italian/Mexican market neighborhood, with disturbing anti-Hispanic signs on the wall. I'd rather have had lunch just about anywhere else.
