Champs is my favorite vegan restaurant! Most of their staff is just wonderful, they automatically give you a great big bottle of water, and have so many options to choose from. Their baked goods are phenomenal, I had the cheesecake brownie--it was just divine. I really really love Champs for breakfast, I had the greatest vegan pancakes with scramble and a little salad. I will forever be a patron to champs, death before decaf!
