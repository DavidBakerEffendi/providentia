Fantastic!!! The food, the service (Johnny especially) and the vibe were all on point! They even had live music, which I believe happens every Wednesday night. Definitely try the Jerk Chicken appetizer, Salmon, Tamarind Chicken, Mac & Cheese and Sauteed Spinich! Went for the first time this Wednesday and may be back on Friday!
