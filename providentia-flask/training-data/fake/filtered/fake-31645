Better than average brunch food (we had the fried chicken,shrimp po boy and french toast) and incredibly attentive, friendly service with the huge exception of the prickly, attitudinal hostess, who kept us waiting at the tiny bar for 25 minutes, despite the fact that we had a reservation and the place about 1/3 full for the entire meal.  Despite the friendliness of the bartender, she stood around with nothing to do, finally trying to give us a table for 5 that 5 adults clearly would have trouble sitting comfortably.  When we asked for another table, she  nastily put us at a table and warned us not to sit on a certain side.  There were plenty of other tables that she could have given to us, without inconveniencing anyone. The meal was saved by the waiter, who immediately saw that we weren't having any of her and couldn't have done a better job.
