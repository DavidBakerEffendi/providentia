+Big selection of craft beers and whiskey. +An always rotating beer selection. +The rustic interior and theme fits perfectly with there offerings. +Food is always good. -Music is too loud (for a bar), it's club loud. -The place gets ridiculously packed on Friday and Saturday nights; you can't even walk.
