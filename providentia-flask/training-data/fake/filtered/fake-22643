First I would like to say the service staff is very attentive. There was not a moment I wanted for water, or felt as though I needed to flag someone down to get what I wanted. Keep up the great work FOH. As for the food... Disappointing is an understatement. We got the antipasti plate. The meats were ok, but nothing memorable. The broccoli rabe was under-seasoned, and the two cheeses were sad. Parmesan was dry and the second cheese tastes like bad American Swiss. The cavatelli boasted brown butter but in the end it just tastes greasy. The pappardelle noodle was well made, but it came in not a sauce but rather a broth, which was rather bland. The saving grace of the meal were decent meatballs and polenta. I have avoided creating a yelp account for so long but I thought this was a dining experience I needed to share. It's unfortunate that Frankie's is taking up so much real estate in NYC with mediocre food, when there are so many establishments doing amazing food that get no attention. Please Frankie, either get better or move your franchise out of a city that knows good food.
