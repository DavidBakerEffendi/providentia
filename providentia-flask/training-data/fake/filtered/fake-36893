Breakfast! I love everything on the menu (5 stars). I brought my whole family here and the verdict was unanimous--the food is great. It's ok for lunch and dinner (3.5 stars), but I only eat breakfast / brunch at the Nassau location. Spanish continental breakfast is my favorite, but the breakfast burrito is also awesome. Huevos Rancheros? Yess'ir! Super good. I brought a friend from Spain here and he approved. Black or pinto beans are available, which isn't necessarily "authentic" (at least with my experiences traveling in mainland and Baja MX), but I love black beans so this is great (who wants to eat lard anyway? that's "authentic" and gross). They serve some gringo food as well, but don't order that (and don't complain on Yelp when you get pancakes and you're not full--dumb gringo!--go to P.J.'s where you know the pancakes are great). What else? Horchata is pretty delicious as well (way better than Tortugas, which one time tasted like dish water). However, if I had to choose between Tortugas and T.O.M. for dinner, I'd probably head over to Tortugas (but it would be close).
