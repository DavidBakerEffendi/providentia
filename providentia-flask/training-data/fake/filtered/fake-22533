Went there again. This time went with husband & kid for Memorial Day Dinner. Wanted to order kothu paratha but ended up ordering Egg Burji, Gobi 65, Shrimp Manchurian to start with. I, normally, don't like to eat non-veg, esp, seafood. Yet tried couple of Shrimp Manchurian pcs. Very tasty. Will try the same again. The appetizers were very filling. For entree's, we ordered Masala dosa, Kal dosa with Vada curry and chettinad style Ennai Kathirikai. Liked everything very much. Though ennai kathirikai was a bit spicy for me, my husband liked it very much. Honestly, no after-effects at all. I am happy that we had a wonderful evening dining as a family. To finish, we did not have enough space for anything else. So, decided to drink some canteloupe juice and left happily.
