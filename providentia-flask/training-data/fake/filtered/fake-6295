I had a Bahn mi with grilled chopped chicken and summer rolls yesterday at this relaxing and friendly place. Each ingredient tastes so distinctive, while making an amazing harmony. This is definitely the best Bahn mi spot ever! I will go back many times for sure, since I want to try everything on the menu! Loved it!
