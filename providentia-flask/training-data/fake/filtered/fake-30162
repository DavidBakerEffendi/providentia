I was very excited to finally try this place, since I heard so much about it. I gotta say, i was a bit disappointed, the best pizza in new York? I can't imagine! It was an ok pizza, but I've had much better! Nothing like a real nice pizza from Italy! The staff was very nice and service was great though and it didn't take long for the food to be delivered
