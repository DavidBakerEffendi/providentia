I love this place.  You will not find a better Chicken Parm ANYWHERE!  Seriously, it is my one of my favorite foods and living so close to this restaurant has truly spoiled me!  The atmosphere is excellent and the staff is very professional.  The owner is a super nice guy and he is often seen walking through the restaurant talking to his loyal regulars and making sure that everything is going smoothly.  If you haven't tried this place, do yourself the favor and do so!
