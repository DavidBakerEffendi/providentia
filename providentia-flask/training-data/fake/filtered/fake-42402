Love coming here!! Great food! Love their tacos and tortas! Although the place is small it has a great vibe to it! The only complaint is that i feel like they aren't equal with everyone. I being hispanic enjoy going to good restaurants that have that perfect taste. The neighbor hood is nice and many americans come here. its been couples of times that i don't receive the same service as the rest. I not being racist but i feel as if they serve white americans better than hispanics people that come here.
