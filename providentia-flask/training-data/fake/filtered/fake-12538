Great Greek Pizza.  Always tons of cheese yet the crust stays crispy.  This is not foo-foo designer broccoli pizza...this is burn the roof of your mouth, gooey string cheese,  lots of pepperoni, pizza.  There is a reason they have been open for 50 years and it is because it is family owned and family run.  Lots of booths and great service.  Best pizza in greater Hartford...and that is saying a lot!
