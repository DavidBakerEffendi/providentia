From the moment I walked in the door I was greeted by a friendly host. I was led to a quaint, nicely decorated corner table. After looking over a fantastic menu with my family, we opted for the mussels milano, calamari, and grilled octopus for our appetizer. WOW! The mussels milano may be the best thing on the menu! Be sure to get extra bread on the side to soak up the delicious sauce. The calamari and octopus was excellent! For our entree I got the filet mignon, my wife got the fish of the day (bronzini) and our daughter got tomato fusilli. We each tried a bit everything and continued to take further bites. The waiter, the youngest brother of the three, was very polite, accommodating, and answered every question we had. We will definitely return when in the area. The food was delicious; the service fatastic, and our desert, WOW!
