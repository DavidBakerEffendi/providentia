After my first visit from early on, experiencing what I considered "slow service" we made a second trip this past Monday night.   For a Monday at 9pm they were pretty much full and vibe was very Soho scene.   Wife and I split a Truffle Burger that we had read so much about and loved it.   Not sure how they only charge $45 given the amount of shaved truffle on top but let's hope they don't jack up the price now.   Also shared a chopped salad and the tuna tartare as we were not that hungry and sampled the wine on tap, which was decent, especially for only $8.   I see from the Yelper below he was upset because they would not take a rez but they would not take ours either.  It's a walk-in restaurant not a burger joint a la Shake Shack or BLT Burger.   Sounds like you got a bad phone girl but my bet is you might be surprised if you saw it.
