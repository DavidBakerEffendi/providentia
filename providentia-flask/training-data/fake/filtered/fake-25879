Delicious Italian food! Been dining there with family & friends for at leat 20 years and it is always consistent & good. They have a villa salad (for 2) which is awesome, and their veal dishes are always excellent. Reasonable prices; only downside is no reservations so you can easily wait an hour on weekends...however, wait is worth it!!
