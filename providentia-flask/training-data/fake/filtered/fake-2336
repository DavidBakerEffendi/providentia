The wait is worth it, the best breakfast (or brunch) ever! I had the french toast, my friend ordered oatmeal with blueberries and some sort of omelet. The best part was, the waitress and kitchen had a miscommunication and thought the order of oatmeal with blueberries was blueberry pancakes! They brought both out to us, and lucky for them, it was the best mistake they've ever made. The pancakes were literally the best I've ever had. The french toast was incredible. The potatoes were very good. The mimosas were delightful and pretty. The service was wonderful. The wait wasn't that bad and well worth it. You can call to make a reservation. The crowd is pleasant. Does it get much better...? I'll be back... all the time. YUM!!
