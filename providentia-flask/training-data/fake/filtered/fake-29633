I wanted to try this place for a long time mainly because the Yelp reviews have been so positive. I called up for a delivery and they told me that 8 blocks was too far because there's a new delivery guy. That's odd, but fine. I'll pick it up myself. Got the pulled pork and the rib sandwich. They both come with french fries. No other option. I think it was $25. Maybe more. Anyway. The fries were cold and soggy, but still kind of good probably because they had so much salt on them. Too many fries though, really. Had to throw away the second side order. A salad option would have been nice. But real problem reason I won't be eating at Juniper again -- the sandwiches. The bread was good, pickle nice. OK, here's the deal-breaker. These are the sauciest sandwiches ever. Do you like sause? Heaping amounts of high-calorie, sticky sweet McDonalds BBQ sause-style sauce? Then maybe you'll like these sandwiches. I didn't. Admittedly, you know you're not have health food when you order this kind of food. But still, it's possible to have a meaty sandwich without feeling disgusting. Disappointed.
