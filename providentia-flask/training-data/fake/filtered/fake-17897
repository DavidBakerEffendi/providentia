My wife and I had dinner this evening at Osteria Giotto. The food was average at best, not good and not bad. I believe that there are other Italian restaurants in the area which have tastier food than we experienced. The BYOB is nice since it saves money but the food was mediocre. We probably will not return any time soon.
