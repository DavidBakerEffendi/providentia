The food was awesome.  No problems there.  Much better than food at other pubs in other cities which attract people who don't want to blow their budget.  Kitchen Staff need to be commended. What sucks is their service.  Absolutely not impeccable, which I don't expect anyway but come on. 45 minute wait for beers after ordering them?   Same amount of time waiting for food. Brought out the food, no silverware, no napkins, nothing, just food.  Not even our drinks. Eventually brought everything else out. Came back and brought us the bill, divided up into 3rds.  We pay him, then he brings back the receipt for 2 bills with our change, then walks away.  Sorry but you don't get tipped for sucking at serving.  And when you come back to us and say "oh I only gave you two receipts, sorry, my head is all over the place and I'm all confused," don't expect sympathy from us.   I'm sorry man, you shouldn't be working in the food industry if you can't keep track of something so menial as a receipt.  I don't want to sound harsh, I really wanted to like this place, and again, the food was great, but the service is terrible.
