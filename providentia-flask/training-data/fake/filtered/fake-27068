My wife and I were there last night and really enjoyed the experience. The place is quiet, so we could actually have a conversation. The food was wonderful and the service attentive and unobtrusive. We had the meatball, pretzel nugs, scallops, and the pork large dish. We shared everything and were more than full. Check came in at under $60, but we had nothing to drink but water and no dessert. Everything was delicious. The pretzel nugs were my favorite along with the meatball. The pork was also good, but our least favorite (the cut was rather fatty). We would go back!
