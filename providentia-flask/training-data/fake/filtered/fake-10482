Small little restaurant in the walk of the piazza. Waiting for your fun is fun. You get to play games and eat popcorn! The waiter was the one of the nicest waiters I have ever had. The food was delicious! American cuisine! The have GREAT weekly features (or specials). Probably my favorite thing about this place
