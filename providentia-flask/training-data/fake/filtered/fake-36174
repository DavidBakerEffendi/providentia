We had never eaten at this Lissoni's but we decided at the last minute to have a small party of about 15 people there. We ordered off of the banquet menu. There was sooo much food...everyone was stuffed by the time the actual dinners came out. The food was really good. The app's were genrous and delicious. I especially liked the eggplant. The service was very nice and attentive. The prices were very reasonable and we ended up really happy with our choice. It was great. Very pleased.
