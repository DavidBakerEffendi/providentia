I was doing the walk of shame when I passed by this insanely wonderful breakfast spot. I think it was a Tuesday at 11:30a and there was a line out the door! I was solo and had to wait 30min to sit... it was worth it. I debated on what to order and settled for the blueberry pancakes. They will knock your socks off! Ended up sitting next to a lovely lady from California. Got her number. It was a win win all around. :)
