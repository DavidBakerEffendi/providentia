I absolutely love this place. Can't get enough of the Ricotta Pancakes. So far, I have been here 7 times. 5 of those times the service was great. The only thing bad I could say is that the service should be more consistent with such a great place. I can understand when it gets busy the server may get a little overwhelmed, but what needs to be remembered is that we are all humans. Just explain to me that the kitchen is a little backed up, I will completely understand. But don't leave me sitting for 20 mins waiting without even a glance in my direction. I would definitely recommend and I personally will be going back. BUT if I get spotty service again, I'll have to take my money elsewhere.
