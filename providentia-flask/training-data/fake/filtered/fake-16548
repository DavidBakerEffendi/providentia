This is definitely the new hot spot in jersey city, especially with its vast west indian community, this business will do nothing but rise! the food is astonishing and i would surely recommend this restaurant to anyone. Im so glad its within walking distance from my home, this surely will be the place i pick my dinners up! i was truly impressed with their menu, and when sampled all of the tasty foods, i couldnt pick my favorite however the JERK CHICKEN WAS ON POINT!
