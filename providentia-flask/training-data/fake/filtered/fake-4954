This is the cleanest diner I've ever been in!   The windows between our booth and the front area where the register is were so clean that one of our party didn't know there was glass there until he noticed the etching ehich was higher than eye level!  The food was very good--I had the portabella and chicken sandwich.  The bread pudding was warm as requested and it was very, very good.  The waitress was attentive but not intrusive and very nice to my grandson.   We did have a little mishap with the stuffed animal grabber game/machine in the lobby but the staff was amazing in resolving the problem.  Many thanks to the sweet woman at the regster who gave me back the $2.00 we lost in the machine/  I ended up returning that money because another very thoughtful server took the time to test the machine which worked without a problem for her.  She got a little stuffed allegator out of it and brought it to my grandson who had been very upset about the whole "nothing happened" problem.   So, for the food, the cleanliness and the very, VERY nice people who work there, I give the Montville Diner FIVE stars!
