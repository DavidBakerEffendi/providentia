One of the worst sushi experiences ever. Found a beetle on my friends lettuce right next to her rolls and brought it up to our waitress and the only thing she said was "I don't know how that got in here. We wash our lettuce every day". Didn't offer to comp our meal or anything. She took off the appetizer and that was it and acted like it wasn't a big deal at all finding a nasty bug in the food... I wouldn't come back here if you payed me to!!
