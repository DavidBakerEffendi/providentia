Pros:  varied menu, friendly staff, interesting sandwiches--something for everyone.  The sandwiches I have tried have been delicious. Cons:  slower than Subway (which is a couple doors down) and pricier than Subway.  However,  I would rather support a local small business, as a small business owner myself.
