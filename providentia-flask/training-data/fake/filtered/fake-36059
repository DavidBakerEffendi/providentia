Great pub! They take reservations, which was convenient. We went during happy hour and there were some good options ($5 beers). Our server was friendly and didn't rush us at all even though the place was packed. The food was delicious: the Smithfield burger and the lobster mac and cheese were amazing. One thing to note: it was REALLY loud downstairs. We almost had to shout to hear each other. In short: great food, loud environment, seems like a fun place to watch a game.
