Tuna Tataki was fabulous. All the seafood and greens were fresh, just perfectly cooked, and served neatly. Buddhakan offers a good mix of ambience with its high ceilings and large buddha statue, and taste. Our server was very hospitable and forthcoming with recommendations. They adjusted the number of pieces in a starter from 3 to 4 as we were two of us to ensure we don't end up fighting for the yummy appetizers. The cocktails and sake are a great compliment to the food.
