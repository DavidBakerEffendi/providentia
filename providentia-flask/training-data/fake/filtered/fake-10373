My boyfriend introduced me to this place after my numerous complaints trying to find good German and/or Austrian food in New York. I grew up in a mixed German/Austrian family, and all of the dishes they offer are quite familiar to me. To date I've had the Austrian Beef Goulash, Chicken Paprika, Spaetzle, Wiener Schnitzel, and Seafood Ragout and all were FAN. TAS. TIC. Even the Weiner Schnitzel (which is essentially chicken friend steak but with veal) was still good the next day; fried back up in the pan, the breading was still crunchy and delicious! The deal with Cafe Steinhof is that they have a limited menu, and everything they do is traditional but solid. They don't go out of their way to try anything new, but I know when I'm looking for this kind of food, it's the comfort food I go for, not new takes on the classics. And every dish is well paired with its sides. Just when the wiener schnitzel was starting to get too heavy, a bit of the cucumber salad balanced it out and the potatoes were crisp and perfectly salted (a surprisingly difficult feat for most restaurants to accomplish, it seems!) The spaetzle as well is a must side-dish. I get it no matter WHAT dish I'm getting, and someday I'll try the cheese spaetzle, not just the plain. The waitstaff is a little sluggish but always friendly, and the food comes out LIGHTNING FAST. They have a smart little system here, and it works well! Except to have to wait for a table on weekends, and definitely NOT Â a place to take parties over five. They also have a delightful selection of German/Bavarian/Austrian beers, not a huge selection, but all of which pair well with the food, and tasty on their own! I don't know what people are talking about the food being too salty, though. Maybe I'm used to it having grown up with this kind of food, but to me, everything is always perfectly seasoned for the dish that's being made. Favorite dish so far? The Austrian Beef Goulash.
