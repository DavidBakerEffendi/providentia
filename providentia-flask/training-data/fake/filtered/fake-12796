A friend took me to Samudra last night.  It's a simple restaurant, clean, good service with particularly tasty food.  We shared the Mysore Dosa plate-spicey as you like it (with Vada-light, idly, dosa-liked the filling particularly  and condiments.- good value; added  Saag Paneer which was fresh and savory. Samudra is better than a lot of restaurants many times the price.   I'm their new customer. Samudra's a winner. We ate for $14. ea w. tip.
