This is a great place for Turkish food.  Been a regular for both lunch and dinner since the groupon introduced us to this place a few months back.  Chicken shish kebab is the best I have ever had in the area..  Juicy, tender and flavorful..  Not a big fan of iskendar kebab, which this place is actually famous for.  But don't get me wrong.  You will enjoy the shish kebab as well as the fresh warm bread and the big bowl of red lentil soup that's complementary for lunch orders.  Also, I would like to recommend la mah jun (thin crisp dough w ground meat on top) under hot appetizer.  Wonderful attentive staffs and reasonable price is a definite plus.
