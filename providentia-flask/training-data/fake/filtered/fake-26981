My wife and I went to Guild last night.  Had heard prices were high but I really don't think that's the case unless you're comparing to a place like Outback.  The Steaks (we both had the sirloin) were seasoned and cooked perfectly, were really good cuts of meat, and sizable to boot.  The salad (included) had a great dressing on it and the sides were well prepared.  The ambiance was good - its a large place, so not intimate, but the interior was very well done and had 2 fireplaces going.  We noticed that fellow diners were all dressed nicely with many men donning coats.  Nice to see in VT.  Overall, a great dining experience, and thought it was actually a good value with the steak prices including the salad and sides.
