Visited the Eagle Rock Diner today.  Every single member of the staff was outstanding ---waitresses friendly and efficient, hostess attentive and helpful, and the place was amazingly clean.  One room was closed off to clean while the other had guests, and then the situation reversed.  The food was fresh, plentiful, and good.  Hope to revisit asap.
