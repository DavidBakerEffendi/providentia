I love National Mechanics. The food is really good (homemade hummus), the beer selection is decent (plus $2 yuengling pints everyday), and karaoke on tuesdays is always a good time. The atmosphere is awesome. The building itself is pretty sweet, and the tables may or may not be old church pews. The music is pretty good, last time i was there i remember RJD2 and the beatles. The crowd is usually minimal and the service has been spot-on lately. Overall - good food, good beer (magic hat #9 on tap?), good tunes. Â if you haven't been there, make it a priority.
