Service - Great service. Every time we have gone we get a table right away. Drinks come out fast and the food follows soon after. Atmosphere - Friday nights are the best. there are local bands with no cover charge. The pub atmosphere is warm and inviting and the outside seating is nice too. Food - The bangers and mash are so good. Pair it with a Guinness and I'm in heaven. The fish and chips are comforting and fried to perfection. The french fries are a good snack, but the sweet potato fries are by far Â the best. Value - Good bargain. Large portions, tasty food, and live music? Yes, please.
