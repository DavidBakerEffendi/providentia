came here about 2 weeks ago with mom, sis and the wife.  We liked the appetizers.  We had the octopus salad, mussels and escargot.  They were pretty good.  The entrees were okay.  My sis and wife had the steak with foie gras.  Sis liked the sauce and wife thought her steak was under cooked.  Wife wanted it medium, but it came out medium rare.  Mom didn't say much about her hangar steak.  I had the cassoulet.  I was not wowed with the one I had in Paris and wanted to try it again.  Maybe it's just me, but the cassoulet was only ok for me.  I was not floored by it.  It was a rich, hearty dish good for winter though.
