Our group of 5 was treated like "royalty" by our waiter Emin. He attended to our every needs and thoroughly explained what we were ordering. Â We were surprisingly seated in a lovely upper level curved shaped booth overlooking a fantastic view of the entire restaurant. This was our first visit and it won't be our last. The food was excellent and professionally prepared and served. The deserts were over the top and exceeded our expectations! Tony's Di Napoli is located at a very convenient location next to several theaters in the area. Don't pay attention to Dana C's review. We got more than what we paid for. A true bargain in mid-town!
