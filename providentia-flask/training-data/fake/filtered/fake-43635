SQUID SALAD SPECIAL Again and Again and Again you will fall for the ultimate bullshit; this time, it's about Heath Ledger's ghost. Five Leaves is a beautiful Nick Drake song - it is not, I repeat, NOT, a beautiful restaurant. Come forth, all ye fools who toil in the bowels of corporate hell; show yourselves, put your money out - show that you are in the know. You know nothing. YOU KNOW NOTHING. This is just another tourist trap. Heath is no longer with us, and this little sliver on the end of Bedford is run by vampires hoping to make $$$$ on his name. Overpriced, over-hyped, and altogether a lie. Proceed at your own risk, trustfunders Those of us in the know laugh at you.
