This is by far the best Vietnamese in northern Jersey!  Reminds me of mama's home cooking.  I've eaten almost everything on their menu and they have yet to disappoint me.  And everything is so affordable.  I even order 3 days worth of food for later meals.   I grew up eating goi cuons that had sliced pork and shrimp but could never get a restaurant to have a combination of both in the rolls.  Finally a place that makes goi cuons like my mom made 'em.   Then my favorite appetizer is the banh xeo.  This place makes better banh xeo than any place I've been to in NYC and Philly.  Again the combination of shrimp and pork.  I don't know what they use but they are so crispy.   Definately a place you have to try.
