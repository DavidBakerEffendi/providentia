I posted recently on this site that I was upset with the customer service at Prime 16.  (My friend and I were hustled through our meal and then asked to leave our table for "taking too long." ) The manager of Prime 16, however, saw my post on this site and responded to me personally and promptly.  I'd like to thank them for their apology and for dealing with this issue very professionally.  Seems like they do take customer service seriously and that my experience was just an unfortunate one-time thing.  Now I can return to Prime 16 for their amazing selection of beers, as well as delicious food!
