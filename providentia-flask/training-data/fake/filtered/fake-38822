What a gem! I absolutely love this little spot. Cozy, warm inviting. Everything you want in a neighborhood cafe. The staff are always kind and the food is delicious. Their bread is out of this world. I love their coffee as well, and I rarely drink the stuff! Iris Cafe is the perfect little lunch spot the meet with friends to have great local eats.
