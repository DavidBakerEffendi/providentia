Dishonest Mgt... Went there after a funeral service w/ 32 people. Ended up being charged for 45 people, Manager (Francisco) said we told him we were bringing 75 people, this despite the fact that at his suggestion we called from that morning with a final count of 32. Food was plentiful and just ok.
