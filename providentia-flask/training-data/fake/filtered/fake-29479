Amy Ruth's did a great job in getting us our food quickly and it was tasty but the customer service and hospitality were sorely lacking and that means as much to me at a food establishment as the food. We had a large crowd of about 15 people. After we paid and gave a tip and were preparing to leave the host came over to us to say we were loud and then noted that he's not kicking us out because "he loves our money". No idea where and why someone would say that or why they would wait until we are leaving to tell us that our large group sitting by a loud speaker of music made their other customers uncomfortable. It was weird, strange and left a bad final taste in my mouth because they no longer cared about us AFTER we paid. No thank you... I can get good fried chicken elsewhere and be treated with more respect.
