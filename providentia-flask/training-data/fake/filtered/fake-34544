Wonderful is all I have to say. The service and quality of the food is one of the best I have been served. I went here with my girlfriend last week to celebrate our two year anniversary and we had an amazing time. We started off with the tuna pizza which had a delightful crunch to it along with the compliments of soft spicy tuna and tomatoes on top. I ordered the Yummy Special roll which was a great size and had pretty decent sized pieces of fried lobster inside and the sweet tai chilli sauce it came with was a perfect combination of sweet and spicy. My girlfriend ordered the thai red curry shrimp because she loves spicy stuff and I have to say she was very satisfied with her dinner. For dessert, we both shared a lovely hot rockslide brownie with ice cream, whipped cream, and crushed pecans on top. Even though we were both stuffed after our dinner, we couldn't help but finish the entire thing! Overall, the price of our entire meal averaged about $55 which was pretty fair. The service of our waiter was very friendly and we definitely had a very welcome feeling entering the restaurant. Anyway, a great place to spend our anniversary and we defnitely will be returning soon.
