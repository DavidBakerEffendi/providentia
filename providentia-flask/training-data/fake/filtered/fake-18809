Waitress serving us Â had a lot of attitude and made us extremely uncomfortable. She didn't greet and was behaving as if she was doing us a BIG favor by serving. Owner and all staff seemed to be busy with some private party with Owner's friends. Brushetta was cold & soggy and was replaced when we returned it. Food wasn't the best and definitely won't be a place I would ever visit again.
