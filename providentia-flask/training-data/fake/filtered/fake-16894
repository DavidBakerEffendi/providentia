This restaurant is amazing.  The menu is fairly large, and always changing with foods that are in season.  I have been numerous times, and have loved everything I have ever ordered.  My favorite way to experience it is to order lots of things to share with the rest of the table.  The brunch is really good too.  It's hard to get a reservation, so I tend to book several weeks in advance.  Definitely worth being "appointment dining"!
