Last night, I had some family over and so, I decided to call in for some Chinese food. I was greeted by a warm young lady who waited patiently as I recited the order through the phone. When she gave me the final price, I was surprised at how reasonable it was. My order ended up being around $35 and I received a free order of general tso's chicken. She explained that if you order up to a certain amount, you could get a free soda, free egg rolls, or an order of crab rangoon. There are not many restaurants that will openly tell you these offers. They will not mention it until you ask. I could not be happier with how I was dealt with. Might I add, the general tso's chicken was a hit. Their sauce was rich that it lingered in my mouth the whole night. I can't wait to call back!
