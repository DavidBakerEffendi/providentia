My favorite happy hour in all of philly!!!  you must go for dollar oysters...its a slam dunk... the oyster shooters and the drink specials are typically fantastic... From the menu, my favorite item is the lobster roll.  I bring people from out of town all the time and they love this joint.  Great date spot too...
