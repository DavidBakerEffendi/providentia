The burgers here are awesome!!! The best burgers I have ever tasted (and I have tasted many, trust me!). However, for those who like a lot of condiments on their burgers, this is probably not the place. They serve with just cheese and some tomatoes (no ketchup or mustard). This place is worth the 6 hour drive (round trip) that my bf and I made to try these burgers.
