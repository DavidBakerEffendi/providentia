Amalfi's offers a great, friendly atmosphere along with great food! This family run establishment has unbeatable happy hour specials, phenomenal Brooklyn pie, awesome salads, and one my all time faves in the sandwich line, the grilled chicken with roasted reds and pesto sauce! You gotta try this one! I must admit I have only had one entree and it was a special for the evening - chilean sea bass, filet, and seared tuna combo - for only $24.95 it was outstanding! The wait and bar staff are attentive and friendly as well. Entertainment couldn't be better as well featuring the area's top bands and entertainers and NEVER charges a cover! I would come from out of town to visti Amalfi's but fortunately for me it's around the corner! Well done boys and girls!
