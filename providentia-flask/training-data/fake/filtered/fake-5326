Love, love this place!  Not pretentious at all, as some reviewers wrote.  Drinks are fantastic, fresh, flavorful and worth every penny.  Food is ridiculous.  Brunch is anything but just eggs and potatoes.  Try the Molettes.  Hidden secret: try their tequila shots with a sangrita chaser.  Best I've ever had.  Service is smooth and relaxed just like the vibe.
