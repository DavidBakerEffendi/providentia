This place is the absolute best! The wait is well worth the food. I strongly suggest the Eggs Benedict, which come served on perfectly cooked biscuits. Fried Chicken is delicious too. I've never had a bad meal here. The staff is so nice and comforting. I have nothing but great things to say about this warm, comfortable restaurant that serves excellent food.
