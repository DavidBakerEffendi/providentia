I have worked at Yale for 20+ years, so have eaten at Claire's many times over the years. I agree with the negative posts. The service is terrible and often rude...and Claire, that includes you! Claire actually asked my daughter and her two small sons to leave because one of them was crying. Shameful! She should have made an effort to help. I will say that the cakes are good, and the soups are too. But the prices are outrageous, and certainly not worth the aggravation.
