What a great find!  I stopped in on my lunch break and have already been back three times since.  The sandwiches are generously heaped with quality meat and the homemade soups are incredible.  The cheesesteaks and fries are delicious too.  The service is friendly and the place is immaculate.  Aggie's is really the perfect little deli and anyone who lives, works, or goes to school in the vicinity should really give it a try.
