I came down to NYC and spent over 60 dollars in this bar only because of the Barcraft event that was happening. From the moment that I got there my friends and I had problems with the management who attempted to not let my 20 year old friend to the advertised 18+ event. The did only let the group use one TV and played the music so loud that no one could hear the game let alone hear others talk. The place was getting business from a demographic that they would never normally get Â but they did not want it just because we were too nerdy or geeky or whatever.
