This place is a hidden gem of Bella Vista.  Don't be fooled by the somewhat cheezy looking sign out front!  I started with the lobster tacos which were small but very high quality and well presented with good fresh ingredients.  The house salad was also extremely fresh and the basil was a very nice touch.  The pork shoulder was done to perfection with whole roasted green tomatoes.  Overall, the food blew me away from what I was expecting from bar food!
