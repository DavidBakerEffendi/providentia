Love this relatively new addition to the neighborhood.  Rucola's brunch rivals the best in the neighborhood.  The offerings are seasonal, that said their beet salad was delicious (and I'm definitely not a beet person).  My wife loved the poached eggs and the bread was awesome.  In spite of being full, we managed to find room for the fresh bread with peach preserves.  Decor-wise, the place was very Brooklyn-rustic.  Wait staff was really nice. Looking forward to trying their dinner service, in the near future.
