I heard all the hype about this little place and was all excited, that is until I received my order.  I ordered 2 sandwiches, the "Cubano" & the "Dominicano".  I couldn't believe my eyes when I was served, there was hardly any meat on the sandwiches, I felt like the old school commercial "Where's the beef",  the flavor was good, however for the price, it was not worth it.  I paid $6.25 for the "Cubano" & $5.75 for the "Domincano".  The Italian creme sodas were not as sweet as I expected, I could taste the seltzer, which was not good at all, it would have been better if it was sweeter.  I would give them 2 thumbs up if they add more meat to their sandwiches, but right now I give them 2 thumbs down :(
