It really is rare that a Mexican restaurant is able to surprise me, a Mexican American girl raised eating authentic Mex dishes. Somehow, Las Bugambilias did it! My husband took me out for a "Sunday on South Street". We trolled the shops and finally came to the famous Day of the Dead Maiden that stands at the front door of the restaurant. We walked into a beautifully decorated restaurant that seats about 50 people. It's definitely an intimate place but we had even more privacy since we walked in around 1:30 pm. The entire menu looked DELICIOUS so I had to carefully make my choice. I decided on the Cochinito Pibil and my husband got the Chicken Breasts marinated in Adobo. Our food was phenomenal.Both of our dishes came with rice, beans, salad + tortillas. Only mine came with plantains. Everything was perfectly seasoned, the pork was so tender that it just melts in your mouth. His chicken was so juicy yet slightly toasted on the outside. We coupled our meal with Guacamole (fresh & zesty but in a rather small toasted bowl), Ceviche Roja (shrimp in a tangy red sauce w/onions + avocado + tomato), Mex Hot Chocolate (tasted mysteriously like the ABUELITA chocolate you buy at Mex grocery stores but I don't care b/c I love it) and Agua de Orchata. The Day was capped off with a shared dessert, the Jericalla w/Grand Marnier/Caramel + fruit. It was so smooth...like cream cheese. A+ The sauces were definitely freshly made, not like the bottled crap at other places. WARNING: The brown sauce is definitely hot. I just considered it spicy but I'm used to it. I had made reservations but found that it was unecessary. I would suggest doing so for dinner time though. I can see how easily it would fill up in the evening. The service was pleasant and timely. Our waitress constantly checked on us and she always had a smile. Definitely one of the best dining experiences in Philly.
