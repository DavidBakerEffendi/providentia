Regular pizza bar place. Nothing special about it. Actually one thing....... it's so overpriced!!!!! I can get better pizza, better service and better atmosphere in Manhattan and spend less money. The place is in the middle of nowhere. I dont understand the management for what they are charging so much. I was annoyed. When we were leaving I asked to get the rest of the pizza to go, bored bartender wanted to charge me extra for the pizza box. So I told him to keep it, the pizza sucks anyway! Yeah, and they have minimum - if you wana sit at the table, you have to spend at least $15 and pick up everything yourself at the bar. No service. By the way, I read the review downthere saying the management is hiring bartender and asking the girl to check it out. How lame the manager must be to give himself 5 stars by using that post. I guess thats how this place is getting stars!
