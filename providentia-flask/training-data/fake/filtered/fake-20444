fortunate am I to have been made aware of JWF! pleasant and inviting atmosphere coupled with great food, who could ask for more? everything on the menu is exactly what i want, simple and delicious, great coffee too! definitely going to be a regular in my dining rotation, not to mention the cute waitress in the stripes that has served me that past couple of visits.
