Really loved this place! Great place for a date. The atmosphere is romantic and they have a nice wine list that is not too pricey. Went on a date and shared the prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella appetizer- AMAZING!!! I had the duck for my main course and it was good but I was not all too impressed. I also wasn't extremely impressed with my date's pasta dish. They just didn't seem like anything special. But I give a 4 Star rating for the ambiance, appetizer, and wine choices. I got an inexpensive bottle and a more expensive bottle and I was pleased with both. This is deffinitly a great place to take a date, or go have a bottle of wine with friends. But don't bring too many, the place is very tiny and I felt I had to rush at the end of my meal while finishing a bottle of wine because more customers had arrived and we had already paid.
