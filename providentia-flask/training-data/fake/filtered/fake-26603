Pizza was so bland, I've had better frozen pizza.  We ordered "bread sticks" and it was simply a round pizza dough with cheese on it that had been sliced into six pieces.  the pizza was so bland, the sauce tastes like it comes in a jar and there was absolutely no flavor. Also the staff weren't very friendly, they were all hanging out behind the bar as I sat waving my credit card in the air. Will never go here again unless it changes management.
