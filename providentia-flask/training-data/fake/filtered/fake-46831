I have been to Drunken Munkey more than a few times in the recent past, and have never been disappointed with the food and drinks .It's a cute, warm, intimate place, unlike some other Indian restaurants  which make me feel as if I've just walked into a warehouse that's been turned into a restaurant. Never before have I had  Anglo-Indian influenced craft cocktails until my first time at Drunken Munkey and it is one of the best things about this place. My favorites are Bramble, Aviation and Army and Navy. The drinks are stiff and the price too, one could argue, but it's well worth it because I would advise you to go easy on them as they pack a punch. The food is delicious. Hats off to the kitchen for producing such yummy food that doesn't taste like "restaurant food" if you know what I mean. The crispy okra and paani puri make for perfect appetizers.The pork vindaloo, Sindhi fish curry, and railway chicken curry were just rightly spiced. Loved the carrot halwah for dessert  btw. The service was very friendly and welcoming. but the staff could do well to remember the drinks orders as on one occasion we had to remind them about it. Otherwise, no complaints. Lovely ambiance punctuated by  vintage Bollywood films on silent mode, eclectic music selection that was playing at just the right volume without drowning out conversations, and interesting paraphernalia  from the yesteryears. Very tastefully done. If you are in the neighborhood this place is a must visit. Actually, even if you are not in the neighborhood and love to experiment with craft cocktails and Anglo-Indian cusine you should go. it is absolutely worth visiting. Weekends are busy so I'd advise to make reservations especially if you are a large group. We can't wait to go back and try a few more new cocktails and dishes. Drunken Munkey is a wonderful addition to Indian cuisine in the city and expands it beyond the regular fare dished out at Indian restaurants.
