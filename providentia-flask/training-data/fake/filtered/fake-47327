We love this place. The seafood is really good - much better than other places in the same area. We often get the "Treasure Chest" and take it to the beach. But we really wish they could improve their French Fries. They need to be double dipped in the oil to crisp them up or something. We're always impressed with the seafood and disappointed with the fries. Why can McDonald's do it?
