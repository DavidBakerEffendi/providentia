I could probably end my review of Bella Anthony's right there with that one statement of a word. (WooHoo!!) But... let's get some more descriptions going! Since I came with a partner in crime, we each ordered a different menu item and decided to share and conquer. Â  Everything went together perfectly...Great start! Unlike some other Connecticut restaurants, it was like having three restaurant in one. There is a romantic quite room for special dinners & occasions, a tavern on the other side for drinkers (we went there after dinner) and a third room for family style dinners for kids & young-ens. We were seated at a small table next to the windows in the more quite room where we had a great view of the outside and was very subdued and relaxing. since the portions are quite large, I was first worried whether I might not be able to finish it all, but I was VERY full at the end and took some home. LOVE LEFT-OVERS!! Overall, I had great service and delicious Italian food. This definitely was higher standards than i imagined and i will be visiting again for sure!!
