FYI the restaurant does NOT accept credit cards! CASH ONLY! Having checked the Yelp profile before I left and there it is stated that the restaurant does accept cards. Please someone update their profile on Yelp. BTW there is an ATM machine at the back for one's convenience i.e. for an additional fee. Salad: The signature salad was pretty interesting, great fresh ingredients, but they were a bit stingy on the vinaigrette. Main: Steak the meat was excellent in taste, asked for it rare but got bleu instead but it was still fantastic. Unfortunately this should have been served with home fries as a side not a salad. Desert: Flourless chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream, the cake was cold but tasty, ice cream was average, nothing to write home about. Service: Excellent, the servers knew the specials and gave additional information which is always a plus. All in all it was a pretty decent meal, it got there but failed to impress.
