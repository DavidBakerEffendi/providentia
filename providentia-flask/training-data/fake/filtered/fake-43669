I love Almond!  I came on a busy Friday night and at 8:30 I didn't see a single table empty, glad I made a reservation.  The mussels and blue fish appetizer were very good.   Loved how warm and friendly servers where too.   Delicious Rack of Lamb was the Friday night special, cooked perfectly.  The menu is huge!  Lots to choose from, but it makes sense as the space is big.   Free billiards room with couches and warm lighting in the back!  What a great place!
