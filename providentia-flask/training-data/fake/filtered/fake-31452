Let me say that I am a stickler for cleanliness and treating everyone with respect. I guess I was at the wrong place. I've noticed the chubby guy speak rudely to some of the customers on other occasions. I thought maybe he was having a bad day. Nope!!! Same story.  When I arrived, he was outside in a friend's car, smoking and shaking hands,  with his plastic glove on. I waited to order, to see if he would come in and change the glove, yes, only one, before he started handling the food again. No luck. As he came in, he rudely asked a customer what he wanted, as he walked right in, and picked up a sandwich bun. He didn't wash his hands or change the glove. I know this place has been here a long time, but at what point do you stop treating the people that support your business with respect.  I still have JIMMY BUFF'S!!!
