Wow! What a wonderful little BYOB in Fishtown. The food, atmosphere and service was outstanding. Dined here on Saturday. The staff was so friendly, as were the other patrons. The food was delicious. The porterhouse was cooked to perfection and was the best I have ever tasted. cannot wait to go back!
