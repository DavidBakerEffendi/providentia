I love the food but it does not have a big selection. It's a basic Chinese food menu. The 2 things I don't like are that they do not accept credit cards and the staff are NOT FRIENDLY at all!!!!!!!!!!!. Seems like they always have an attitude for some reason. None if them have one ounce pf personality. Sorry, that's my opinion.
