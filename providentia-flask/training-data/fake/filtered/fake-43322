First of all can someone define what is weekday and weekend? They have a big board outside stating 8.99 for weekday and 10.99 for weekend. Where does friday fall? They charged me the weekend price on weekend...which books and under which definition is Friday a weekend? This is ridiculous, I will report this instance to consumer court, they are ripping off the customers.
