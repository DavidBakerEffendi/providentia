It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. I went for brunch with 3 friends and decided to try the "Belgique Rancheros" (poached eggs atop white beans and fried potato hash with salsa). Would you like to know what it smelled like? Cat breath. Yes, cat breath. The stench just kept emanating from the plate. I ate the two eggs but the salsa was so bland. I dared myself to eat the cat breath beans but the mush just tasted like nothing. I don't like to complain though so I didn't. Our server looked like she just rolled out of bed, but so did I so I shouldn't judge. However, it took her way too long to get the cat breath plate out of my presence and we sat there for entirely way too long. Maybe she was busy puking in the back after having to carry my cat breath breakfast. It was a good thing I was surrounded by good company because my day could Â have been ruined. On the other hand, I also went for dinner and it was a completely different experience. I had pumpkin beer(s) and decided to try a special (braised beef with gnocchi and some sort of brown sauce) which was phenomenal. I loved it and would eat it every night if I could. Hopefully the beers weren't clouding my judgement. I also tried the frites with their special dipping sauce and they were magnificent. Our server was nice and timely. I'd go again for dinner and give this place 4 stars as long as my next meal doesn't smell like cat breath. I'll never forget it, it was unreal.
