I have been going to this place since they took over almost 2 years and I must honestly say that their food is excellent...the Oxtails, jerk, fish, stew chicken and curry rock...hands down.  Even the baked mac&cheese is a must have...everything has flavor that makes you want more.  I noticed one bad review sounds like a customer who probably was having a bad day. you can't please everyone.  I assure the food is worth the visit...
