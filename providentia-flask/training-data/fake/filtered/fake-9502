The place was old and smells wired when you walked in. The famous fish and chips has no taste at all which was ordered by my wife.  I ordered fried scallop which taste ok but I have stomache for next four days. I went to see the doctor and being told I got food poisoning. I guess the scallop wasn't fresh at all.  Will never go back again.......
