Let me start by saying that I am sorry for not posting a review for this joint for so long, but I think its time now. Already being a fan of the Margarita I tried the Vodka slice yesterday. As soon as those flavors hit my world was spinning. The experience was almost surreal. The flavors just continued to hit me stronger and stronger every time. The world around me seemed very pedestrian compared to that prodigious slice. I fell in love with that pizza. I also want to give artichoke props for being one of the few good places with vegetarian options in the city ; I will keep coming back for more. Maybe tomorrow ?!!!
