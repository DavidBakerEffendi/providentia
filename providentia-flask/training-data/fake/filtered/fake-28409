I had Grilled Shrimp with lemon potatoes that were amazing.   Don't know what was better the shrimp or potatoes.   Last time I was there the Greek lady sitting next to me returned a huge beautiful grilled fish because it had one drop of beet juice.   She could have never finished that whole fish anyways!
