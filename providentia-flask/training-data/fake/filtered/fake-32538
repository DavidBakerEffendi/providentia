I've been to a few of the "BBQ" places in New Jersey and this is by far the best.   They do not sauce their meat before they serve it to you which I love.  Good BBQ is about the meat and the meat should stand on its own.   The way and I went and we had Brisket, pulled pork, spare ribs, and chicken.  All the meat had a light hickory smoke flavor.  I prefer it a little smokier then what they have.  All the meat was moist and tender, but some of the meat was over cooked!  I don't mean it was tough, but in BBQ terms when you overcook it becomes too tender and loses any texture.  The brisket was cut to the right thickness, but it fell apart when I picked it up.  The chicken was spot on though. Both their sauces were good and its nice to taste an actual hot BBQ sauce.
