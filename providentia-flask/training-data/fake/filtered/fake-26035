The pulled pork and cornbread were excellent. That's the best I can say for the food. The  cheese grits and potato chips would have been great if they were served hot. The fried green tomatoes had a nice crunch but along with the ranch sauce it was served with was flavorless. The coleslaw was like a wilted  salad without dressing. The ribs were disappointing. The beef brisket was fatty and should never have been served. it was replaced with a new dish which was a little better. There was a lot of food left on our plates uneaten.  I would not recommend this restaurant to a friend.
