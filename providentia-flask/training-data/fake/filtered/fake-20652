The service is beyond EXCELLENT they are very friendly. The roasted bone Marrow was beautiful! The cocktails while you wait (forever) are original and delicious. But I have to say the Burger was a bit of a disappointment, and I could not taste any truffles in the cod as it says it has in the menu. Lastly the crepe desserts where delicate and everything I could ask for in a dessert. Too bad the crowd has much to be desired. Reminded me a lot of the scene in Chicago, and very banker friendly.
