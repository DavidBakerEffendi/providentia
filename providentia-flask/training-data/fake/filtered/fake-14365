You can not go wrong at Rita's. The food is delicious and the price is wright. The feel is old school and so warm. Want the ultimate experience? Show up any day during the week around 2:30PM - the place is almost empty. Sit at the bar, order your favorite dish, glass of vine and...just soak it all in. I promise you will do it again, and again, and again...
