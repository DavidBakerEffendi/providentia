Usually, my philosophy is "When in a bar, order bar food".  City Tap House is one of the very very few exceptions to that rule. I had occasion to eat there twice recently; once with the whole family for brunch, and once with my wife for date night.  I was, frankly, blown away.  Let's talk brunch first; 7 adults and a 4 month old.   We were seated at a long table in front of the open kitchen, which is always my preference - I love watching choreography of a well run line, and this place was one of the best.  We got there fairly early (before 12), but by 12:15 the place was jumping and the kitchen was slammed.  You couldn't tell it from the food, though.  We started with a couple shared courses, namely the Hangover Pizza and the Sweet Potato Fries.   Go there, this Sunday, and eat the Hangover Pizza!  You'll thank me later.  And while your at it, have a glass of the Victory Scarlett Fire.  No better breakfast beer, period. As good as brunch was, dinner was simply perfect.  Our waiter, Steve, knew every beer like they were his personal friends.  Each course was better than the next, right through the cheese plate we had for desert.  We sat out on the patio, the weather was perfect, the service was great, the food fantastic, the beer - fagedaboudit!  Oh, and lest we forget, the Phightin's beat the stinkin' Fish.  Great night all around
