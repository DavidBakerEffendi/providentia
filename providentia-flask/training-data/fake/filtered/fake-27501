I LOVE this place. A few hundred different bottles of whiskey and scotch running the gambit from $2 a shot "rot gut" corn whiskey to $200 a shot single malt. What more can a whiskey drinker ask for? I'll tell you, their cheese balls and thick slice bacon, my mouth is watering at the though of it. One warning, the place is kind of small and always packed. Reservations probably help, but drinking and apps at the bar while waiting for your table are not the end of the world.
