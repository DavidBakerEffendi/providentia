While I've heard a lot about this place from family, I never got a chance to try the food! I arrived around 7:40pm on a Thursday evening, we were told the wait would be 30 min. We said we'd wait. 50 min later, we were told we were next. When I asked the hostess where we were in line, she gave me a snippy, "you're coming up soon" and ran off. 5 groups AFTER that we were finally seated. Once seated, someone came by with menus and sliver-ware and that was it. For 10-15 minutes, we sat as the waitresses passed us by. No greeting, no asking for drinks, NOTHING! At that point we got up and left. It's a shame that I never got to try their famed grilled corn, but I will certainly not spend one penny at a restaurant that does not treat their guests properly... no matter how busy the establishment may be! If you go to this restaurant, plan on waiting MUCH MUCH longer than they tell you, and don't expect any fast service after that either!
