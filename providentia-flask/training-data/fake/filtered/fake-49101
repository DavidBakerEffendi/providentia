My fiancé and I have been here 2 weeks in a row so far, each getting a savory crepe and a dessert crepe. The ingredients are the freshest you can get and everything is served up promptly. I'm a huge fan of their home-made shallot dressing that I get on my side salad; I've never had anything like it! The lady and I are in absolute agreement that Buttons is the place to take our out-of-town friends in order to show off  local specialties. It amazes me that the Trenton-Princeton area has not had a creperie until now, and I am very thankful that we now have Buttons to enjoy :-)
