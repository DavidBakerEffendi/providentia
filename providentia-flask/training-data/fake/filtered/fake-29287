THE BEST. A true highlight of our visit. This is awesome stuff. Try it because words can simply not do justice to the good, basic food you can get here. Avoid the chai tea-pathetic. We did not try the overpriced drinks either. The sandwich is bettter value than the platter -in my opinion, even though the platter is sufficient if you are not sharing. Â  Enjoy the neighborhood too....lovely area to walk about. PUHLEASSSEE GO HERE!
