went to nori's with a friend for dinner. we arrived at the restaurant around 8pm. i checked that the restaurant closed at 1030. food was ok. for the prices i have been to other sushi restaurants that the portions are bigger and better. the reason i am giving it 1 stars is because it has the worse service there. they were so quick to rush us out of the restaurant. they gave us the bill without offering us dessert and were hovering over the table until we paid the bill. we stayed at the restaurant for 1 hour. they did not refill our glasses at all during the dinner. i will tell everyone that i know that there are better places to eat for the same price with better service.
