OMG my first review on Yelp and i get to write about my new favorite restaurant. Emporio is so cool, i have been there like 3 times already and every time i fall in love more! Last time we celebrated my friends Birthday and we had such a nice evening. I love everything about this place. Their Â thin crust pizzas are crispy and so light, u don't even have to feel guilty eating them :) We also shared a bunch of appetizers. Croquettes with mushroom risotto and cheese, endive and beet salad with hazelnuts and the octopus which was so tender. After our pizza we shared the Branzino, which by the way was the most reasonably priced Branzino i have ever had ( $18), which was grilled with some lemon and herbs. The fish tasted so fresh, it was done perfectly. Creme Caramel and Lemon tart for dessert were equally delicious. Like i said i have been there a few times before and have not been disappointed yet!!! See you soon Emporio!
