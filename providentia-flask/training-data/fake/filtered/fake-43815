Family friendly atmosphere and menu made dining out in the city something my kids actually enjoyed. Bowls of their favorite cereals and some cotton candy were both a big hit. The staff was very helpful and got me a table without a reservation in a packed Saturday night. Definitely a "go to" family dining spot.
