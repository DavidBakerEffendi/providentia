SKIP THE CHIPS & SALSA. I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could.  it was ok but I can't say that it will make it on my regular restaurant list. I had the soft carne asada taco and it was good and flavorful.  My boyfriend had a pork burrito with everything and I liked his better than mine.  He said it just on par with any fast food Mexican like Taco Del Mar or Chipotle etc. My major complaint was the chips and salsa we ordered.  The chips tasted like they had been sitting out in the humid NY heat and were stale and the little teeny tinsy itsy bitsy side of salsa was enough for about 5 chips. It was seriously like 2 cents worth of salsa.  And all the salsa consisted of was chopped tomatoes, onions and a little cilantro. There is only seating for maybe 15 people inside so if you see an empty table grab it while the other person orders.
