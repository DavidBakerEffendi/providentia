My wife and I decided to have dinner early tonight.  We were drawn to the 5 star rating.  Upon finding the restaurant we were even more impressed by the cozy decor.  The kitchen was right there, allowing us to watch our food being prepared.   We were greeted by the owner chef, and served by a lovely lady who took our order quickly and made good suggestions.  We both had a lamb dish and shared a traditional salad.  The chef actually took the time to tell us to eat with our hands.  It was amazing!  We were chatting with the staff and enjoying a relaxing meal with a real personal favor To say the food was exceptional does it a great disservice.  We were happily eating things that we normally avoid.  They noticed any time we were out of bread and brought more.  The tea we were served was sweet but not over-sweet, as was the fruit sweetened lamb's meat.  I'm going back tomorrow to pick up some couscous for my mother in law.  I WILL be visiting again and recommend it to anyone in the neighborhood.
