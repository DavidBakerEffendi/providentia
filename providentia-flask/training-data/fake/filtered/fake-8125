Aboslutely love this place!  My sister and I decided we would go downtown to try something different from our usual meeting spots.  We decided to stop in at the Instanbul cafe, everything we had was fantastic and the bonus was the attentiveness and sweet nature of our waitress. I highly recommend trying this out if your looking for authentic Turkish Cuisine, oh and try the baklava!
