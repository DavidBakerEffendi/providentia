Completely in love with this place! They have a great service, very attentive and the food is to die for! I ordered the flan for dessert which is home made and my mouth just waters every time I think of it. I recommend it to all my friends and family and anyone who asks me of a good traditional portuguese restaurant to go to around this area!!!!
