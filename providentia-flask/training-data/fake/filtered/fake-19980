This restaurant was delicious! I went there during restaurant week and really enjoyed my meal.  Everything has just a little twist to it.  The service was great, the staff is very knowledgeable.  They have an big variety at their bar.  The only thing I didn't like was we were stuck at a very large table with several other couples! I wish we had our own table.
