The food in this restaurant is fresh and traditional. They are a wine bar with many choices. I found this place on yelp and it was a very good surprise. I went there twice, once with my mother, once with my friends who are Brazilian and Japanese. I wanted them to try French food. We ate French specialties like Foie Gras, Pate de Campagne and many kinds of salami with French bread and cheese. For the desert we ordered French apple pie and Nougat Glace. We really appreciated the place and the food. It was new for my friends. This place reminds me of France and I really appreciated it. They servers are very kind and some are French. I will comeback many times and I really recommend this place !
