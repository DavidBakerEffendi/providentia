Stopped in this restaurant on a whim with my brother the other day.  Luckily we beat any crowd and had zero wait time on a Friday at 5:30pm. Cozy feeling with a nice Thai atmosphere, the wait staff was incredibly friendly and constantly refilling water, replacing napkins, asking if we needed anything additional and checking on how the food was.  It felt great. I ordered the crispy tofu and a dish that had mild curry and calamari.  To keep it short and to the point, the calamari was the best Thai dish I've had (across a dozen plus restaurants) and the tofu exceeded expectations.  Definitely worth visiting again.
