this is by far one of my favorite ny restaurants. the food is so amazing. i've had so many dishes but those that stand out are the hummus (all flavors), the brussel sprouts, the lamb kabobs and many many others. the drinks are to die for, the service can be a bit slow but just plan on it being a long dinner and head there accordingly. i can never miss a chance to go to ilili when going to ny and can't wait for my next trip to ilili. always recommend it to anyone that asks for a restaurant recommendation.
