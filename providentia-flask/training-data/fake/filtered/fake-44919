I have lived in town for 30 years and years back I always ordered from them, but then they just starting slacking sending all the food ice cold, and when you would call the owner would get real defensive instead of just making things right so I stopped ordering completely well tonight I said let me give Vinnies another shot first of all I waited over and hour for a pizza that showed up ice cold, I called the owner and basically he is arguing telling me there is no way the pizza could be cold, I told him to come over right now and have a slice and see for yourself. I will no longer waste my time or money on Vinnies Pizzeria, the owners attitude and the food is ice cold and has no flavor. Sorry pal gave you another chance and you blew it!
