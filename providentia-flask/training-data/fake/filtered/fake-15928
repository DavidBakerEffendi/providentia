We were looking for a pizza place in Little Italy and this place popped up on Yelp.  It's just a few blocks off the beaten path and totally worth it.  We sat outside and ordered the Mozzarella & Prosciutto Crostini and the Diavola Pizza.  The spicy salami was perfection.  I would definitely come here again.
