My ex boyfriend and I used to come here every Saturday, I fell in love with pizza..didn't like it so much before, I fell in love with the Sicilian pizza to be exact...Stopped going cause I don't have much of a reason to be in that town, but definitely do stop by when I'm near! Hands down the best pizza I've EVER had.
