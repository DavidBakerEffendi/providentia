Brought my friend in yesterday for brunch. We are brunch-loving divas. A good décor/atmosphere, delish cocktails and food, and anything above mediocre service is what we're looking for. First, this place has outdoor seating and nice big windows that they'll open, weather permitting, so we chose this spot because the weather was really nice. Since there weren't any seats available outside, we opted for a table inside near the windows which was perfect. Service: ehhhh. It was very mediocre. Every time we asked for something we felt like we were annoying our server. My friend and I have both worked in restaurants so we're pretty good about how to behave as patrons but any time we asked him something it made me cringe a little. That was whatever, but what bothered me more was our food took FOREVER. In real life, it was more like a 45 minute wait. For eggs. And the place was hopping but not overwhelmingly packed so something was off in the kitchen. Maybe not enough staff? Anyway, our server did occasionally check on us and kept our drinks coming (even though his attitude was blasé). So all in all: mediocre. The food was okay too; nothing glamorous. I had a personalized veggie omelet, my friend had the eggs benedict. The portions were nice but I just think that after that long wait, our expectations were inflated. Like, if it takes 45 minutes for our food then I hope you're giving it some serious TLC. On the other hand, I LOVED the mimosas. I don't like dinky little mimosas that are served in champagne glasses (aka the traditional way) but these were deliciously served in nice big wine glasses. THANK YOU, Barrel House :) Overall, its a nice option if you're in the neighborhood and the weather is great and you have a good chunk of time to spare. Prices are very reasonable too. But otherwise, if you're looking for show-stopping service and impressive food, there are better options nearby.
