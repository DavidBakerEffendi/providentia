This truck is a great change compared to the greasy food of normal newark food trucks. Many authentic mexican options that are mouth watering. The owner is a really nice fella who knows you by name. For a truck that cooks to order it is a reasonable wait. I am also exctited to here that they are opening up a restaurant on Broad street in bloomfield.
