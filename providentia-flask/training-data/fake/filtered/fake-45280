This might be the worst Restaurant in East Orange.  They say they accept credit cards but I found out, they don't accept American Express.  NO Air Condition in the restaurant!  We ordered Ox Tails for a take out dinner and when we arrived home, it was the worst looking ox tails we have ever seen,  The fried chicken was okay and the yams were sub par.  The greens were missing something.  When I tried to order a side order of yams over the phone, they gave us a hard time and when I arrived within 20 minutes-they mysteriously ran out.  The gravy over the rice was burnt.  We threw the oxtail dinner out with the trash simple because that's what it looked like. Maybe they should rethink this business establishment and turn it into what is needed on Springdale Ave.   a Parking Lot!!!!
