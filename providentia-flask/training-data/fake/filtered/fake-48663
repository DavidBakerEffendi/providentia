We use them for our corporate catering and the guests always love their food. They live praising the chicken with rice, and all flavored empanadas (never too much). Everything is flavorful and hearty portion. They are always fresh, hot and on time. The service is great, Gustavo is very tentative in making sure the order gets to us on time and accurate.
