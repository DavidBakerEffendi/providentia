I wanted for the longest time to check out this cozy spot on Atlantic Avenue .. So finally I decided to make a reservation for my birthday .. Inspite of my party being late they held my reservation which I am very thankful :)   The food was amazing .. Tuna tartare and risotto top of my list not to mention  the beets & goat cheese The waitress was friendly as well as the host . Will be going back soon ! A million thanks you made my night very special
