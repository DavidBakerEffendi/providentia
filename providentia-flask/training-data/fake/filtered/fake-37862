I have driven past Starlite 100 times but never stopped in.  Well i was pleasantly surprised.  The Waitstaff recommended plain pizza well done, chopped salad and stuffed artichoke.  They were all great. but just order the pizza well done and crispy.  Lots of flat screen tv's to watch the game.  Great place to bring the family.  Ill be back
