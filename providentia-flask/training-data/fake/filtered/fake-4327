i am so happy to have found this excellent korean food option on south and 12th.   the bibimbap is excellent:  not overly spicy or greasy, and made to order very quickly. the vegetables are fresh, and the meat is high-quality.   there are only a few items on the menu, but the bibimbap is so much better than Rice+Mix (which is just an awful bastardized american version of korean food).   i always see korean people in here when i come to eat (which is an important indicator of its traditional authenticity and quality). also, the korean owner is so cute and courteous -- he usually includes bits of "service" when you decide to eat-in (e.g. extra rice, more sauce, kimchi).   i always feel so good after I've eaten lunch here:  full and satisfied without the food comatose. it's healthy, it's cheap, and the owner is so friendly!  go here!
