Wayne has been in DIRE need for a pizza joint with good, crispy, thin, not sloppy, delicious pie. Too many places around here serve oily messes, but NOT Anthony's! My dad is SO picky about pizza, so we were skeptical to try it. Well finally, a place in this town got his stamp of approval! The pizza was thin and crispy, well-done as promised, and had a delicious flavor. There was no need to blot the top of the pie with a paper towel because of oil, and the cheese wasn't sliding around. The coal-fired wings are absolutely SUPERB!! They were meaty, definitely not frozen, cooked well, and just plain delicious. The waitstaff was extremely friendly and helpful. Anthony's knows what its doing, and my family and I will definitely be back!
