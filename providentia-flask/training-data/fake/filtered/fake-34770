GROSS. Wings are greasy and prices are high for what you are getting. Seems like they are trying so hard with the decor and stuff but it's just not working out. Service was whatever so robotic and food comes out really slow and timing is really off here. So if you really really want to try this place out, go ahead but you are literally throwing your money away. ew.
