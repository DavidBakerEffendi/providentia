Excellent space, very reminiscent of a sushi bar (20 or so seats, all at the bar).  We had a reservation for three and had to wait about an hour to get seated.  Somewhat understandable given the limited amount of seating.  I thought the food was OK.  We tried pretty much everything on the menu -- my opinion is that the asparagus dish was the best.  The squid stuffed with short-ribs was interesting, but ended up tasting more like squid with refried beans.  This would be a great place to bring a date, but the long wait could put some people off.  OK food, good service, great space.
