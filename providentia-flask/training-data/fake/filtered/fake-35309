went to sea witch for the first time last night. completely impressed by the decoration and the beer selection, not so impressed by the atmosphere and music. I mostly just wanted to take a nap on what looked like a comfy bench along one wall of the bar. I'll attempt again, hopes the sea witch picks up some wind and sails in the right direction.
