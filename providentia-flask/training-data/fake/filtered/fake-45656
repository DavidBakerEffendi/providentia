I travel the global and happen to be stuck in Windsor Locks and needed some great food. My wife and little daughter in toe food two Whole Foods in West Hartford for breakfast and food this very charming town center filled with resturant and fabulous shops. As we strolled around  we stumbled on this great tai restaurant. They had a great special for happy hour $2 apps between 4-6 at the bar only, so we tried them all and they were all great! The owners are very much involved and was a pleasure speaking with. We never new West Hartford had such great options for food.  Looking forward to coming back.
