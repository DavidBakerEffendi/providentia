I've been here twice; the first time, right when they opened, was pretty good.  The sushi was made-to-order and all-you-can-eat, rather than the pre-made stuff that's been sitting out for god knows how long at buffet places, so it seemed like a good deal.  The second time we went out, just today, I was very disappointed.  The rolls were almost entirely rice with very little fish, some were literally overstuffed with rice.  I picked through all of my rolls (because chewing on chewy flavorless rice is not my thing), and got more than a cup of excess rice out of my rolls.  The service was fine, and other dishes were ok, but I won't be going back any time soon.
