A decent selection of wines although lacking compared to the more extensive lists available in the city.  The lack of a proper wine preservation system keeps them secondary to the likes of Vintage and Panorama which feature cruvinet systems.  If you are just getting started with wines it's a nice place to go to be "seen" but is not serious about its wine selection for the more experienced Oenophiles.  Prepare to be jostled quite a bit by unruly guests and surly servers.
