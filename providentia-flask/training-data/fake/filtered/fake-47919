Kelly's I found a few months back ....I am rather new to the New Haven area and was drawn to the pleasant atmoshere of Kelly's ....The patrons I found was very friendly and made me feel welcomed...Most are very down to earth, casual and well meaning folks....Kelly's employee's are warm and thoughful and appropiately engaging including management who are very visible extending care to the patrons which I find very attractive and something that  keeps me coming back.   Great Food, Great Drinks, Great Company which are socially diverse.....another plus...I am truly a fan.
