Went here based on people saying how long it's been around and how good it is.  The food was decent- nothing to rave over- but EXPENSIVE!!! There are way too many delicious restaurants in philly that have better price points to waste your time here.  If I am going to spend that much money on dinner it better knock my socks off!  This place def did NOT.   The decor- WOW upstairs is like walking into a time warp- mirrors, purple velvet drapery on the ceiling.. need I say more?
