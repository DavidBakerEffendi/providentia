I really enjoyed this place! I'd read about it in the 2013 vegan guide and was excited to give it a try. I ordered lots of food for takeout- 2 rolls with 2 a la carte pieces (like how they'll give you that little piece of fish on rice in a regular sushi bar), one large ricepaper roll, and one small, for about $30. I was impressed with how much food that ended up being- everything was a good size. The ricepaper rolls were especially large! My favorites were the spicy sushi with avo and mango inside and the mushroom wrap which was my favorite overall. Gotta be a mushroom lover for that one but if you are, it was really good. Good friendly service and well packed for takeout. I will return!
