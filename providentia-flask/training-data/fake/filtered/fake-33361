This place was awesome.  I took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner last night and it was amazing.  I got the seared tuna and he had the rack of lamb.  Evrything was perfect.  The hostess overheard us talking about it being a birthday dinner, so our serve brought us out a soup that we didn't order which was on the house, and also a dessert for the birthday boy also on the house.  Our waiter was excellent.  We will be going back to Audrey Claire to eat again.  The portions were perfect and the price is great.  Just be careful that this is a cash only restaurant.
