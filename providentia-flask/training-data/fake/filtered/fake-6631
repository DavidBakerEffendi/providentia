This is a great local restaurant that we go to once every few weeks.  We all have our favorite dishes, I love the Pad Cashew, my husband loves the Green Curry & my brother always gets the Massaman Curry, all of which taste amazing.  I'm so happy to have this restaurant in our neighborhood, we are never disappointed.
