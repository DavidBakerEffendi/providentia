Forget Pat's, Screw Gino's, Because There is no other Cheese Steak In Town:  The Tartufo Rules All.  Unless you hate truffles.  And I don't mean the chocolate ones!  The Meat is incredible, not barely edible.  The truffled cream is amazing.  The onions are caramelized to perfection.  And the Tartufo Pizza is tops. The best combo is to add the Pulled Chicken Salad.  Be sure to order extra salsa verde- they always skimp.  I heart rustica!
