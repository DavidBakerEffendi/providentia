Unique dishes. Korean inspired. There are many amazing appetizers you can't go wrong and excellent for sharing. The salads are delicious and make wonderful starters. Definitely can't wrong with the mussels and scallops if limited to seafood. Oxtail terrine, Pappardelle Pasta, Hanger Steak Salad, Long Island Duck Breast, Crispy Pork Trotter, and the Shaved Hudson Valley Foie Gras are my favorites. Desserts are must. The ice cream is made fresh so the flavors vary each visit.
