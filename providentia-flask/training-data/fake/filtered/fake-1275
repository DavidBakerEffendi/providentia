It's a shame what I had to go through with this restaurant the day before my baby's baptism...stress...crying....loss of money.  This is my first child and I am very excited to do all these first time experiences with my son.  I called the new owner of restaurant for 2 days to let him bo how many people would be attending my sons baptism no answer I passed by Friday night to see the place was closed at 7:00 pm I knew something was weird so next day around lunch time passed by again to find the place was closed.  I then knew I had a big problem just 1 day before my baby would be baptized I would be going crazy looking for a place to entertain 70 guest.  Thanks to mr Bruno's in lyndhurst they helped Me by serving my family n friends the best food n service.  I would never recommend this restaurant to no one.  The old owners need to come back because at one point bella roma was a great restaurant.......
