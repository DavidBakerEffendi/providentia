Had dinner here one night last week and the waitress really ruined the experience for me. She kept touching me and patting me on the back and calling me dear. I am a grown women not a child!! Food was mediocre at best but the service was awful. Someone should tell this woman that hands off is a good rule of thumb with strangers!! Maybe if she had concentrated on providing better service instead of telling me her life story I would have left a better tip! By the end of it I knew all about her kids and her dog. Give me a break!!
