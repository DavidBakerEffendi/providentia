Quite possibly, the worst service I ever had ever.  The waitress was extremely unfriendly and had no knowledge of the menu.  I asked for an iced tea but the machine was broken.  She made no suggestions of what else was available so I just had a water with lemon which took long to come out. The menu we were presented with only had hibachi however the place is also known for its sushi.  I asked for a sushi menu and got the same menu again without sushi. I told the waitress there is no sushi on this menu.  She told me "this is the menu". I told her that I saw their menu online and they serve sushi.  Finally she brought out a menu which had sushi.  I pointed to her on the menu exactly what it was I wanted. The manager came out and asked me what I wanted.  I pointed to the menu and told her the same thing. The food was decent at best.  However, the service was so terrible I can't give this more than a star.  Also they never brought out the soup but we were refunded for that. There are other Japanese restaurants to go and next time I will select somewhere else.
