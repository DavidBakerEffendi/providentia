This place is bad.  The waitresses are ditzes who try to sneak extra drinks on your tab if A: you're in a large group so you might not notice or B: you're in a small (seemingly inebriated) group so you might not notice.  I've been part of both at this place.  Don't F*** with my money.  You will NEVER see my business again.  The manager also seems like a jerk from the way he talks to people.   I'd rather spend my money in a place where the food might not be great, but the staff are friendly and honest.
