Cafe Cluny proves that cute and cozy are not enough to qualify for a respectable restaurant.  Service is inept, particularly with the drinks/wine service, which is slow and done with enough attitude to part the Hudson River.  Portions are tiny--two deep-fried squash blossoms, filled with ricotta and served over chopped tomatoes--for $13, an appetizer--not an entree--portion, as it is listed.  Meagre list wines by the glass, which itself is very small for the price.
