NO. way too crowded all the time, food is ok, things are pricey, but i don't really care. I can avoid it or just not buy anything, however, when i chose to spend the money, service turned out to be horrible. What we experienced couldn't even be categorized as "service". It was an angry woman at the panini / sandwich station yelling at me and my friend and continuing bitching about it with the rest of the panini-making staff and yelling into the air while swinging her arms and rolling her eyes like a manic. We both ordered their at-least-4-italian-word-long sandwiches. Given the chaotic line and crowd constantly pushing forward, we didn't quite have enough time to decide and remember the sandwich names, so we just picked whatever looked good in the display box. At the serving point, this woman turned around with a bagged sandwich and said Prochetta or something. We asked if it was the 2nd one from the end of their display box? While confirming on the menu to see if it is indeed what we ordered, due to a chaotic mess at the paying point and many people waiting for different stuff. Instead of doing her job, she just started screaming back to her staff while facing us, as IF we didn't understand English. Â "What the hell? they don't even know what they ordered... who ordered this?" (kitchen staff pointed at us, then she continued) Yah and they're just fucking standing around. (threw the sandwich on the counter and continued cursing) My friend and I were so traumatized by the whole nerve-wrecking line process we couldn't even react to that extreme rudeness! like many reviews said, a totally over-rated place. Of course they wouldn't care, they've got all those one-time tourists traffic to rip off from. Service is a key that I value heavily. This place is full of people who don't know the meaning of it. That's it for me. never spending any money there again.
