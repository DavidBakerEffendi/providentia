I took a friend here for birthday brunch last weekend and it was delicious!  We started off with the bread basket and each got our own entrees, breakfast poutine and ratatouille.  (Full review here: aspiringgastrognome.blog…) The ambience was cozy and the server was patient and friendly.  Definitely a place to hit up again, maybe for dinner next time.
