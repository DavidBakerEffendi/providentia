Yes, yes, it's NYC but still a bit pricey.  $17 grilled cheese sandwich?  Really now. Also, don't like the rigid kitchen. No substitutions... not even an easy one?  My sister-in-law just wanted to switch the cheese on the burger from blue to cheddar or whatever. Nope.  Not allowed.  Again... $17 for a burger and we can't get it our way?  What's with that? Our waiter was very nice about it... just the messenger I know.   Won't recommend; won't be back.
