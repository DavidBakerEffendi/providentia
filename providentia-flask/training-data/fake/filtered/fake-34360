As a neighbor, I was pleased with the arrival of INJERA.  I really wanted to enjoy the place.  It's a small, beautiful room, lovely atmosphere (but noisy).   The tables along the wall are too close for comfort.  (There are a couple of tables, for two, in the middle of the room that afford more space). The injera is different than others I've had in town; it's a bit sticky (which I like), and the Shiro is really good.  However, I requested spicy food--it was rather bland. They only accept Cash or Amex.  Upon arrival, I had to leave to get cash.  After dinner, I expected correct change after payment; it was short $10.  Noticed this a block away, which necessitated return. People make mistakes; that's understandable.  It would be a mistake on my behalf to give this place another try. During this last month, I've been to five different Ethiopian restaurants in NYC (with a couple of return visits).  This was a disappointment.
