I travel all the way with my girlfriend from Westchester to go to see Dr. Maher at Perfect Smiles in Totowa. After a visit with my dentist, our first stop is Sam I Am Bagels. They have the best Jersey bagels! I can't believe the selection they have! No one and I mean one has this many varieties of bagels. I must try each and everyone... It should definitely be on everyone's bucket list!! I suggest you starve yourself before going so that you can nosh like a king or a queen!
