Service was awful but food is OK. In the course of one hour we had like four different waiters, they brought food out of order, so when my fish finally came, the rest of the table had already finished eating. The Branzino comes with a side of Romaine that looks straight out of a Earthbound Farm bag. I thought it was a joke....Fish was good tho, but probably not worth 24 bucks.
