Govindas has an amazing chicken cheesesteak. The flavor came in all together. The only thing i wuld have liked was more peppers in it. The reason in which im giving govinda's 3 stars is because when i was there the service was horrible. I was waiting like 15 minutes before they even took my order because the guy at the register was counting the register. He was counting it over and over again. After like 20 minutes of standing there i ended up giving my order to the cook (which should not have happened) and then on top of all that, when the register guy finished counting the register he started to make jokes with the cooking guy.. i mean you can do whatever you want but atleast help your customers (which was like 20 people in line) would most definitely order again as long as hes not counting the register lol
