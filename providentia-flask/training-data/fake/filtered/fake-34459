We stopped at Country Girl Diner on a Sunday afternoon, about 1:30 pm, just before closing.  Split a BLT with my wife.  The bacon was excellent, the tomato lacking taste.  Accompanied with nice chips and sweet pickles.  There is a slight charge to share a sandwich, but worth it.  They are huge.  Service was pleasant and they have a number of homemade desserts.
