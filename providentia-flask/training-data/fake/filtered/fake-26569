I went the first time with a friend who did not like the food which made for an awkward experience however, the staff was more than helpful when it came to describing the dishes on the menu (it was midday on a week day). I went back again a month later with my father and we enjoyed the food and the experience. Overall, the food is good and I would go back again. I have recommended the place to my out-of-town friends and they have stated that they enjoyed the food and service.
