My husband Â and I dined at Bibou for dinner. The restaurant was charming and when we arrived were greeted promptly by the hostess. The servers were attentive and polite throughout the entire evening. The co-owner, the chef's wife, chatted with us in French and made us feel very welcome. The food was very good, classic French fare. The chef definitely has a gift for executing well thought out and well prepared cuisine. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to other diners and would return.
