What an amazing evening at the Spotted Pig last night in the West Village! Not only is it so festive, warm, intimate and soulful, the food and drink were perfection! We started w Warmed Spiced Wine--how much more holiday can you get? The chicken, burgers w shoestring potato's, brussell sprouts were amazing (the best ever)--but the very favorite was the chicken liver pate on toasts....delectable!
