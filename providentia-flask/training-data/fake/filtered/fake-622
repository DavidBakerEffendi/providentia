First of all, I ordered takeout and was told it would be 30 minutes. I arrived when they told me to pick up and i had to wait another 45 minutes just to get 5 bland boring rolls. They didn't even apologize for making me wait 1h 15 minutes and I got it on a slow Tuesday night. There was no special sauces and the specialty rolls literally looked exactly the same as all the others but with a higher pricetag. I've had MUCH better sushi (Sumo Sushi & Fat Salmon) within the same price range and will not be going here ever again.
