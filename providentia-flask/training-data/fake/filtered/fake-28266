This is the best food you can get late at night in midtown. It's only $6 for a full meal which is hard to find in midtown. It seems that the line is long no matter what time of the day I go but these guys are very quick so the line moves quickly. I don't usually eat lamb so I like the chicken over rice better but even the lamb is very good. Definitely better than all the other 'halal food' stands around the city
