I am not a typical yelp user but after my experience at Vitae on Friday, I decided to provide a review.  Friday was my second visit to Vitae; 1 time over the summer on business and this past Friday as a personal visit which was my wedding anniversary.  We are not fussy types - mid 30's, married 8 years - and actually didn't ask them to treat us in any special way when I made the reservation. To start, we were greeted with complimentary champagne. Throughout the meal every person working in the restaurant said happy anniversary to us, and I mean every person.  Agree with others that the menu isn't the largest, but everything we ordered was very good.  1) cheese plate, 2) pork taco's, 3) salads, 4) pork chop, 5) cod.  Note we also unknowlingly ordered a fish that my wife may have been allergic to (the artic char) and the restaurant took it back without a blink.   After declining desert we were presented with a plate with small chocolates, homemade ice cream and the words Happy Anniversary written in chocolate.   As we exited they again wished us a happy anniversary and thanked us for coming.   Thank you Vitae!
