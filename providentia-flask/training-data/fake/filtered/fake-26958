THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!!!  Food = incredible.  Service = in the top 3 of the best service experiences I have ever had... possibly at #1.  Prices = fair exchange for the fantastic quality, thoughtful preparation and insane deliciousness.  We will certainly return, primarily because we can't stop thinking about the food (turkey soup, turkey chili, ribs, burnt ends, slaw, beans, sauces, corn muffins with honey butter and the best root beer I have ever had) and also because we love to support people who clearly care about and love what they are doing.  (There is also a nice warm feeling that comes from supporting other local producers of antibiotic free, nitrate free, grass fed, free range meats.)  :)  When you go, be prepared that you may need to wait for a table though because this place is booming and it is well worth the wait!
