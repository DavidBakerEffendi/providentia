What A disappointmant!...we went there on 5/2/13 at 8:15 and didnt get out of there till 10:45...Foodies BEWARE..the place is about 1200 sq ft...small, 2 waiter, wasnt crowded , 45 min before even a pc of bread or salad reached the table I ordered the chincken Tajine and 1 hr later the waiter decides to tell me there out of it, I said just give me a beef shawarma, he said there out of that too!....finally he said try the chicken kebab....well 30 mins later it came to the table the size of a appertizer!!! WTF!!! I was about to explode...i kept my cool...when the waiter came back to clean the table...i said check please! ...he gave us some complementary baklava which was good, but did not in any way make up for such poor service and food....this place was Zaggats rated???? I think zagatts better get there heads checked....2 thumbsdown!....the owner should hire some professional with culinary skills and not have cheap migrant workers cooking, and hire some waiters with experience... Shame on Uncle Moustache!, Ruined my daugfhters Birthday Dinner! Â Never Go Back!
