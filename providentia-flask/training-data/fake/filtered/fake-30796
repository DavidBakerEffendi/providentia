4.5 stars, but I feel almost guilty giving a street cart 5 stars. I've had this place drunk off my off, starving during dinner time, and casually for lunch so can definitely vouch the quality is the same each time. Chicken is consistently good, that white sauce is clutch, and the hot sauce is deadly. I always feel like crap after I eat this but it's soo worth it in a very sadistic way.
