Worked with HObbys to supply catered food for a trial team for 2 weeks. Eating from the same restaurant everyday for 2 weeks can be exhausting and by the end you could be fed up- but not Hobby's! They provided a wide range of options, from sandwiches and salads to delicious hot lunches. They delivered everyday, on time and without needed anyone to be present to setup. It was a perfect arrangement and I highly recommend ordering from them for a large group- although, their portions were so big that by the end of the 2 weeks I was adjusting my orders by about half!!! Delicious and worth every penny!
