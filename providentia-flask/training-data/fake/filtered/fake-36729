This place is AMAZING. Start off with the yuengling from the check in offer, and definitely order the pickleback burger. Then get the pickleback shot (whiskey with a spicy pickle juice chaser), it sounds odd but is so good. Then finish up with an adult milkshake. You may need to wander around the piazza a little bit before driving home, but it's so worth it!
