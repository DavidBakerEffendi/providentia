It is a nice place and such a pleasant  way to hang with friends (outside ) but  the portions were small. App's were delicious and served quickly , great staff members , dinner was delicious but seriously I thought they mistook my dinner order for an appetizer order.  Dessert again was a huge hit with great choices and they were amazing .  Left feeling hungry. :-(.  Made jokes that now we now how our husbands feel!!  Next just drinks/apps or dessert
