Basically my favorite seafood restaurant just about anywhere.  Super fresh and delicious fish that is never frozen.  As environmentally bad as it is, the Chilean sea bass is to die for.  I've also had great luck with the barramundi, sockeye salmon, tuna, and several other fish entrees.  I inevitably find the menu a bit overwhelming, so usually a helpful server can help you make a choice.   They don't take reservations which has greatly limited the number of times I've been able to enjoy their food.  Their preparations are also very simple, don't expect anything elaborate done to the fish.  If you don't want to pay the pricey dinner prices, the little shop next door will make fresh lunch sandwiches which are often delicious and filling for $7-8--a well kept secret.  It's also BYOB which I love.
