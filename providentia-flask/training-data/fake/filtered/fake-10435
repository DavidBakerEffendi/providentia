I know this place is called PIZZAlicious, but it's the soup my husband and I come back for again and again. Excellent lentil, pasta fagioli and THE BEST minestrone our little island has to offer. We think it's the paper thin browned garlic slices. Keep in mind if you drop in it takes 15 minutes for them to prepare the soup. We always call ahead. This is one local business that is always happy to see you, makes you feel at home and delivers the delish. Mangia! (It's also worth noting they make an excellent whole wheat dough and great mini pies.)
