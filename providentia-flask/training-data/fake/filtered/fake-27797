My fiance and I go here every Thursday, which is his weekday off and the day we do wedding planning.  Sometimes the service is off, but mostly they're really good.   They discontinued by favorite vegetarian option, which was a black bean and wild rice burger, but I was suggested the Zucchini mini cakes... They are awesome.  They don't taste like Zucchini.  Their biscuits are delicious (think Red Lobster), their queso and chips is to die for, their fries are the best, and decent selection of craft (ish) beers, or so I'm told by the fiance. They weren't always the best, we didn't go there for a while after I had a bad experience years and years ago, but they've really, really gotten better. Very clean (I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about), pretty friendly. Their Tiramisu is to die for.
