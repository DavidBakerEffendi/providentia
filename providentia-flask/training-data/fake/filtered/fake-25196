I've been to Champs many times and I really hate to give this place a bad review. The way we were talked to by the hostess (Bratt) was extremely disrespectful. On a Sunday it's normal to wait and we were fine with that. She told us when we arrived it was only going to be 30min. It took almost 1h40 before we were seated and we weren't even able to sit together. There is not much Champs can do about that, but the non verbal arrogant and disrespectful way the hostess was acting when we were just asking how long it was going to take makes me not want to go to this place anymore.
