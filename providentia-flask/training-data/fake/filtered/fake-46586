i like to take food seriously. i try not to get upset when things go wrong, though i am ecstatic when things go right. ordered the gamay/pinot noir natural wine from the loire valley. started with the gnocchi and clams and quinoa. both were up to standard. gnocchi dish was definitely better, but as a salad dish, the quinoa was well received. then crispy duck breast and hangar steak. the crispy duck breast is insane and everything you could hope for. i think the chimichurri sauce was a nice complement to the steak and felt satisfied. ended with apple tart and panna cotta. i liked apple tart best, but both desserts were well worthy of praise. when i'm at a restaurant, food is my main concern. the server helped me pick the best dishes and she was accurate in her wine description. Â i've been to quite a few of the most respected nyc joints on yelp, most fall FAR below hudson clearwater. i say fuk yea. try this place.
