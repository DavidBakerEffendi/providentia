My firend and I had dinner at Blue Cat, last evening.  I have eaten in si=ome of the best restaurants all over North America and Europe.  The food here is AWESOME.  Presented in a top notch fashion.  The service is relaxed casual, but very good. It is almost like the food out does the location and service.  We will absolutely be back!!!
