Lovee this awesome bbq joint in my neighborhood! Ive ordered delivery a couple of times and its been pretty stellar. Went last night to eat in with some friends finally. We got there a bit late so they had run out of a bunch of smoked meats but we were able to get ribs and burgers and mac,beans,and corn. Our waitress seegen (spelling??) was awesome she brought us cornbread on the house as soon as we sat and helped us figure the menu out since a lot was missing- the complimentary apple cake was a nice southern treat too! Will continue to deliver but the dine in experience was great ill be back again!
