I eat at Yama at least 1-2 times a week.  Their miso soup is delicious.  I've had all of their sushi rolls and they are really good.  The service is always very quick.  The food quality and portions are always consistent.  The Yama in Hanover is almost as good with a different environment.  Either way I would highly recommend to any one eating at both.
