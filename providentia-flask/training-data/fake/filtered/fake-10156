I heard all good things about this bakery, but I had a very bad experience with them.  I attempted to send cookies to S.C. and twice they never were able to get there.  Both times, It was never communicated back to me.  In fact it may of been the delivery companies fault but I do not know that in fact.  Nevertheless, I was never credited the money or my attempted calls were not answered.  I am very disappointed.
