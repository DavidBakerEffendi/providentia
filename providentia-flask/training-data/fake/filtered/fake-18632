My wife and I went to the Gramercy Tavern for our 15th anniversary Friday night.  Originally the only reservation I could get was for 10:30.  I had heard so many good things I was willing to take it.  I added in the reservation that if they had any earlier cancellations, I'd be glad to take the spot.  They called me two times on Friday, first to move me to 10:00, and then to the perfect 8:00 spot! The food and service were top notch.  We loved everything we ate.  My wife was allergic to shellfish, so the chef made a replacement dish for that course just for her!  When we started out dinner, I causally said to our server we were celebrating  "15 years of bliss".  When out dessert came out, there was custom writing that said "Happy anniversary, hope for another 15 years of bliss"  It was so great that she picked up on such a minor comment and made it special! We have been to two other NYC high end restaurants: Per Se and Le Bernardin.  While they are both also great, the quality of the food and service, compared to the cost, Gramercy Tavern blows them both away.  If considering either of these, I recommend passing, saving a few bucks, and heading to Gramercy.  Trust me, you will be thankful you did!
