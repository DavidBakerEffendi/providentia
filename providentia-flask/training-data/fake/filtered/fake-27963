I have been here twice with my girlfriend and we have both really enjoyed ourselves both times we came. The Filet is fantastic. I got it both times we came. Menu is a bit pricey but its BYOB so that cuts the cost of alcohol considerably. The place itself is very clean and has a very relaxed vibe to it. The owner is very nice and has come to ask how the service was both times we came. Will be going back. Hope they stay open.
