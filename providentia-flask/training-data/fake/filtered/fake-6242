Every time I go to the East coast I have to get my Mambo Tea Hose fix. This place is amazing. I'm not a steak guy but you've got to try the Bistec de Lomo Encebollado. If you love Cuban food this puts a Dominican Asian twist to it! The ambitions is really chic and the service was great! Â I can't wait to go back.
