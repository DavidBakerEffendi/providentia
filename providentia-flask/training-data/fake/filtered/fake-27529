I really like this place...but I don't come for Â the famous squares...nope...not a fan of saucy pizza...I like some cheese on mine...no I come for the FOOD...the brocolli rabe is the best and I can honestly say I have never had a bad meal here...the same can be said for anyone I have ever brought here...sometimes (especially weekends) it can be very crowded so expect a wait....but soooo worth it!.......
