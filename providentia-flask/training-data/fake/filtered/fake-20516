OMG this place is amazing!  My friends and I go out for Restaurant Week Philly every time it comes around and have been trying to get a reservation for the past 3 years at Zahav.  We finally got a reservation this time around last Friday and IT WAS FABULOUS!  I love the small plate idea and with the prefix menu we had way more food than needed.  The homemade salads, hummus and bread (pita-like) was to die for and could have been a meal in itself!  Four of us ate for three hours and enjoyed the wonderful tastes, atmosphere and company!  The background music selection was quite an interesting mix but added to our conversation haha   I would highly recommend going here and we're already planning to go back in late March!  Just know that for a weekend reservation around the "regular" dinner time hours you'll have to book well in advance, say a month out or so.  But completely WORTH THE WAIT!
