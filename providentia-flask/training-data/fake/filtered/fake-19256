Fabulous place for a quality dinner or lunch. I went to riverpark for restaurant week which is a great time to try a new place and get the most for your buck! Service was spectacular waiter we had was totally approachable and patient with a group of 9 of us. I had radiator pasta with pork sausage kale. salmon with some type of squash basil reduction thing and and peach sundae. Sorry for my amateur description as this was a few month ago and I dont remember the details. BUT I RECOMMEND 100%!
