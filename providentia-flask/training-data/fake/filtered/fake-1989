Really liked this place! Nice environment and really delicious food. Definitely a more upscale option for Chinatown, but the cleanliness and service is worth it the few extra dollars per plate, in my opinion. I got the Pork with Vermicelli and added on a spring roll (which was seriously one of the more delicious spring rolls I've ever had). The rice in the rice dishes was a bit on the soggier side than I would have liked, but overall this didn't take away from a nice and satisfying night out!
