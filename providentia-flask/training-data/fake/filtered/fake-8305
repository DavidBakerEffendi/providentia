I can't understand the popularity of this spot other than it is lively and loud. The atmosphere is big and fun, but the food falls very short and the prices appear low but you don't get your money's worth. There are a lot of better small restaurants nearby. Even South Street has much better food. I like ONeal's for sports -- with a crowd that knows their game. Also food at Copa and Foy's is a step up.
