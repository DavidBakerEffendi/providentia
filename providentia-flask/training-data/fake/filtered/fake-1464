**GUEST WRITER** Salvador Dali is mad played out.  You see that melting clock s*it on three-quarters of all dorm room walls, usually either right next to a Phish poster or right below an actual clock that doesn't work because the batteries are dead.  Aside from melted clocks, though, everything he does is crazy obscene for no good godd*mned reason. I watched Un Chien Andalou once sophomore year with a bunch of stoned people, and it seemed like some bullsh*t too.  Unless you're ready to be extremely enthusiastic about shockingly vulgar nonsense, there's no point.  When I explained this to a friend, she commented, "[s]o basically he was like the guy from jack*ss, but a long time ago."  Right on.  George Orwell said, "his talent ends at his elbow."  That's not bad either. Café Sabarsky is too good to be on Yelp.  Never had anything that wasn't delicious, from salads to main courses to coffee to dessert.  Just go.
