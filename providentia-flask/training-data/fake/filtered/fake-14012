The Industry is 2 blocks away from Â my house and I couldn't wait for it to open. I fully planned for this to by my new stomping grounds and am truly disappointed. First time I went was in June during a heat wave. It had to be 85 degrees inside. The hostess told me it was because of the open kitchen 40 feet away- what? I ordered the pulled duck sammie. If I hadn't read it on the menu, don't think I would have guessed it was duck. It was swimming in BBQ sauce which made the ciabatta bun a soggy mess. Next visit, I steered away from prepared food, figuring they couldn't mess up a cheese plate- wrong! $12 for 3 thin slices of cheese and both the bread and cheese were dried out. Maybe kitchen staff should visit Tria or Stateside to figure out how to serve cheese. In desperate need of decent food. I like Good Dog, so don't know what the issue is. I have worked in a number of restaurants and agree that the comments aimed at "ignorant" customers are rude.
