You could't get worse food if you tried.  This is hands-down one of the WORST options in LIC.  Okay, the location and view is definitely a plus, but the quality of the food rivals only that of your average street cart.  Please save your money and eat any place else.  The chef really lacks creativity and any passion for quality.  Just awful....
