So I went to Toms for the first time yesterday and after being convinced by a friend that my usually impatient self wouldnt mind waiting in a line wrapped around the corner....Well she was right!! Once the waiters began coming out to the line with plates of pumpkin walnut pancakes, mango blueberry pancakes, waffles, frenchfries, fresh fruit, cookies, and hot coffee....the wait seemed all the more worthwhile..I consider myself to be a bit of a comfort food connoisseur and Tom's did NOT dissapoint. Figured out early on though that its all in what you order...however I can't say anything I saw didnt look amazing. Point blank though, you're at an all american eatery famous for brunch and breakfast offerings..so if you want to leave with a HUGE smile on your face like I did, try any of the amazing pancakes that come with deliciously flavored butters, make sure you have crispy bacon, omelettes are amazing, as are the cherry lime rickeys and hot chocolate....oh and go for the french fries in every case!! They are the best I've ever had! All in all Tom's just won themselves yet another LIFELONG customer! The food, atmosphere, service, and decor were just wonderful! Im ready to go back TODAY!
