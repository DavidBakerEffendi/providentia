Love your restaurant. The food and atmosphere make it feel like having dinner at Mom's!    However, not this time. My family and I were so upset, we felt the need to let you know how poorly we were cared for. We've been to Gennaro's 8-10 times, and we would like to continue coming to you.    Jamie was our waitress. She was very aloof, non-caring, and seemed like she was preoccupied on something other than us. She made our experience LESS than perfect as it always has been. I would like to suggest that Management speak with this young lady asap. Jamie needs a lesson in manners, and frankly she is a terrible reflection on your restaurant.    PLEASE fix this. If it happened to me and my family, it happened to others, and will continue to happen to future guests.
