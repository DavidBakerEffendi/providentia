Last week was going to be just another ho hum Wednesday night until I found myself at Cedar Point Bar and Kitchen Â My girlfriend and I met a friend for dinner and drinks. She's a vegetarian, we are die hard meatasauruses, but Cedar Point had choices for all. From the fried pickles to the kale burger to the pulled pork sandwich, our meals were presented with artistic flair and amazing flavors. The mac n cheese was awesomely delicious as always! Our waiter was extremely knowledgable re: what drinks to pair with our appetizers and main dishes. The night turned into a 3 hour planning session for my friends upcoming speech, but we never felt rushed to give up our table. Cedar Point will continue to be my go to place for a quick yummy bite or a wonderful taste of Philly for out of town guests.
