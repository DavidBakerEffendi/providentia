Great service, Great food every time. Comfortable and even though it is decorated as "gangster" theme, it is done tastefully. The overall decor is very nice. Wine list is extensive, they even had a wine from the most random vineyard in Tuscany that we visited back in 2006 and boy were we excited about that. We have only been on Sundays and Im starting to realize that I like this place more and more every time I eat at another place. We always say, "should have gone to Cafe Goodfellas". Enjoy their famous Filet Mignon or the delicious veal saltimbocca. mmmmmmm
