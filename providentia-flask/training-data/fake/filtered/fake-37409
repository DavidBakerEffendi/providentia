My experience was very pleasing , I had no complaint the service was great the food needs a little more attention taste wise. The hostess gave my two daughters small cocktail umbrella's which i taught was really nice , the ambiance is something completely different, nothing like that on oak tree road. much nicer than the new moghul. friendly and courteous staff, nicely dressed. -make sure you don't wear shorts trousers , it just dont go with this place Â  Tapen Shah
