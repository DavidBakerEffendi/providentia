I rarely go to restaurants that won't accept reservations since there are so many excellent restaurants that do.  I decided to try Battersby to celebrate my friend's birthday given the restaurant's reviews and the availability of reservations when ordering the tasting menu. I have contacted the restaurant twice by email and twice by phone (recorded message since no one ever answers the phone) without a response.  This restaurant may be the best in Brooklyn but it will never receive my business. The poor customer service exhibited by this establishment does not bode well for its' future, regardless of the quality of its food.
