Came in for breakfast, sat at the bar and had a great experience. I ordered the special mushroom quiche, a green juice and coffee. Loved that they had almond milk for my coffee and the food was really good. The staff was really friendly and attentive - even the owner came over to say hi and ask for feedback on the food. A lot of reviews have mentioned the prices being high but I would say they are on par with any other "organic/local" restaurant with a juice bar - its not the local diner.
