There is no restaurant in Park Slope, Bay Ridge or on Smith Street that can compare to this place.  It's around the corner from me and it's like an answered prayer.  For as many restaurants as there are in Bay Ridge, most of them are for the steak and hamburger crowd.  The delicate flavorings and freshness of the food at Petit Oven are an amazing addition to this neighborhood.  (They even make their own butter.)  The service is fine.  I eat there once a week and have never had to try and get the servers attention, and the chef is usually the one to come out and ask you if you're enjoying your food.  Don't ask for pepper or extra cheese in this place!  Cat, the chef, tastes the food 4 times before it gets to your table.    The food here is wholesome and for more refined palates.  If you're looking for the biggest steak you can find, or a big messy chicken or shrimp parmesan (ugh--who invented that dish anyway?)--this is not the place for you.  For $35 the tasting menu of appetizer, entree and dessert leave a normal appetite more than satisfied, and is a bargain when you consider the quality and ingredients.  Great wine list and even the background music is wonderfully unique.
