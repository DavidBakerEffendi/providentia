I went here last week looking for a meal with a some friends of mine, one of which had worked in the restaurant. The atmosphere is soothing and beautiful art is hung from the walls. We ordered a dish that we shared, it was amazingly delicious. We asked for so many rice Â refills that I was stuffed by the end of it. I'm definitely going back.
