Stopped in on a Thursday, the wife was boycotting so I was solo with the 2 kids, host was nice and friendly from the start. I asked if there was a spot to watch the game, they had a table near a large party in the back which would have been fine had I gotten there first but I figured the group was hanging out after work and I didn't want to keep saying "earmuffs" so we just sat in the dining room. There was a group opn the patio, another group next to us, the place was busy enough. Our server, nice guy, can't remember his name, did a good job, didn't wait long for the greet, beer was cold, pizza took about 20 minutes. All in all, a good time, parking was cool, we walked through the lobby, not much personality from the people manning the monitors but hey, it's not like it's Nakatomi Towers right!(Die Hard reference!!!) - Can't wait to go back, you would think coming from Redondo is easy enough.
