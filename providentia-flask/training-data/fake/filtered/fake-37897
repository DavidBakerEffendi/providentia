Coming from the San Francisco Bay Area, where we have plenty of amazing food options, we can be a little picky...but this place rose to the challenge.  Definitely one of the best meals we've had since arriving on the East Coast.  We went for lunch.  The grilled cheese with pulled pork sandwich was amazing, and so was the squash soup. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the apple cobbler...it tasted smokey like it had been cooked in the same oven as meat (which it probably was).  Our server was GREAT, and when we asked for just a sample of the fig ice cream, he brought us a whole scoop.  It was pricey, over $100 for the 4 of us for lunch (including 4 beverages and 2 desserts), but sometimes good food is worth the money.
