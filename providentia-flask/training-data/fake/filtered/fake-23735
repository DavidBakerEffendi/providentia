Great place to sink a few beers - they have lots of great stuff on tap including the lovely Old Speckled Hen. We've never had any great issue with the no reservations thing. It's a nice place to hang out in 'til a table frees up which never seemed too long or traumatic. The staff are almost all great. And the food for the most part is spot on. Deviled eggs - check. Devils on horseback - get some. Chicken liver toast - delicious. The burger is good but....what is with those shoestring fries? Waste of time in my book. So thin that by the time they hit your table they have lost their heat and are cold. What ever happened to good proper fat chips? This place if any, being English pub inspired, should sort those fries out. We'll always come back here.
