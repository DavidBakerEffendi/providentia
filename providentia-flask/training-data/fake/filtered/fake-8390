I heard a lot about Anthonys through friends and Baristanet so i wanted to take my girlfriend there for a lunch date.  The place was pretty crowded on this quiet street.  what we liked about it was that they dont have a standard menu.  The owner said he changes the menu daily which  I thought was a cool idea.  There is only about 10 items on the menu--from vegetarian to italian and even mexican.  everything sounded great so we ordered a great salad with fresh fruit and grilled chicken with goat cheese and an awesome dressing.  we also had stuffed peppers which i have to say was even better than my moms.  you get a lot for your money.  the bill was just about 20 dollars for the both of us and we each had a drink and we shared an amazing carrot cake cheesecake.  couldnt believe the price for all that.  these guys have an awesome concept here and we will definitely be back!
