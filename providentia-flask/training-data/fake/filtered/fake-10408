Avoid at all costs. Two of us stopped in for lunch on a Sun.  The service was horrendous.  There were 3 occupied tables (we were the 3rd) and 2 watiresses on the floor.  We were greeted promptly then ignored for the rest of the meal.  The food, when it finally arrived, was mediocre at best.  We did have one new experience -- we were given soup bowls instead of plates to share our pizza.  Seriously.
