This place can get crowded at night but the burgers are delicious. I found a piece of plastic in my sandwich (mistakes happens). The manager immediately apologize to me and get me on new order for free. Â The adult milkshakes are a little strong for me but overall experience was great. Outside seating available and it's dog friendly. Great place to come with friends!
