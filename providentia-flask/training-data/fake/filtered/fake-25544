Do not know whats going on with Gina's but last time I order from them. Pizza awful . Ordered a Sicilian half sausage and half pepperoni, shows up after 45 min. It was half pepperoni no sausage. Called and they said we were not charged for it. Paid 21.50 for Sicilian and 2 liter bottle of coke. Never again. Â La Pizza it is from now on.
