I've lived in NYC all my life and Gramercy Tavern has continued to be one of my favorite restaurants in Manhattan.  The food is delicious and the waitstaff is professional and attentive.  If you're looking for a pleasant atmosphere and a fairly priced meal, have dinner in the Tavern (the main dining room is more pricey).  They don't accept reservations for this section, so try to get there before 7pm for dinner and have one of their delicious cocktails by the bar as you wait.  You won't be disappointed!
