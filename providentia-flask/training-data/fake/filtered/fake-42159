I took a friend of mine to Royal Seafood over the weekend and I can't believe how rude the cashier was.  She gave us such a bad attitude just because we simply asked her to double check our bill because we weren't sure about the charge that was on our check since we were sharing a table with other customers. Overall, the food was not that good, most dishes were over priced.  we were being charged $7.99 for a plain tofu dish which we thought it was a mistake on our bill.  Again, the cashier was a bitch plus everything is in Chinese so never again will come back to this place.
