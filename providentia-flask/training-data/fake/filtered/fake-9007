Holy Crepe --I am dying from happiness after meeting my new sweet and savory friends near Wall Street. I wandered in there accidentally without crepe expectations.   Thoughts of the great philospher Ricky Bobby from Talledega Nights fame danced in my mind as I perused the menu: Ricky Bobby: 'Oh, I love the crepe suzette.' Jean Girard: 'With the sugar and lemon juice...' Ricky Bobby: 'Yeah, the sugar and the lemon juice. Sure.' Jean Girard: 'Grand Marnier.' Ricky Bobby: 'I wish I could crawl into one of those right now. I'd eat my way out from the inside.' Well said my inbred Faulkneresque guru...who doesnt love crepes--they contain my holy trinity of proper nutrition: 1.  cheese 2.  a salty meat 3.  a liquor based creamy sauce. Crêpe Complète Sunny-Side-Up Egg, Ham, Jarlsberg 9 See what I did there-I cut and pasted from their menu---I am going to do it one more time: Braised Beef Short Ribs Jus Naturel, Seared Tomatoes, Cheese 12 I dont even have to insert a witty expression here--because BAM Crêpes Du Nord Smoked Salmon, Scrambled Egg, Dill Crème 10 Stop groaning at me-or else I wont be able to tell you about their 2 for 1 happy hour from 4-7....and their non-crepe bistro offerings like Blue Shell Mussels Shallots, shaved garlic, tarragon, white wine cream broth 12 Lacking any semblance of creativity, wit or a soul (at least that's what I think my therapist said?)--let me tell you about their savory side: Nutella & Banana Chocolate Sauce, Vanilla Bean Ice Cream 7 Am I nut (ella) ella ella?   Have I lost it?  Am I thinking of applying for a job there for the free food?   Do I have cravings: Midnight Sun White Chocolate, Fresh Raspberries, Whipped Cream 8 Is it considered stalking if I have my mail delivered there? Is this actually a review or a love letter? Am I going to cut and paste something else? Stay tuned-readers-you know where to find me--17 South William Street.
