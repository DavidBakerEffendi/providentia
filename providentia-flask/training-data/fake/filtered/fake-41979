This place is not pretentious by any means - it's a great place to go on a weeknight when you just want some quick, well-priced, satisfying food. The service is friendly and like I said, prompt. The prices are amazing, especially considering you get a huge amount of food (the pad thai was enough to feed two). I ordered the vegetarian pad thai and it was delicious with lots of good tofu in it. My friends really liked their dishes as well. I would definitely recommend this place! They also have a full bar, which is always a plus.
