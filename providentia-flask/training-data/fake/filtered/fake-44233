I'm not gonna lie.  I'm cheap.  I went in here with cheap expectations and you know what, they met them.  I got a been enchalada with taco shells on the side.  The beans and cheese were fresh and it had a nice kick overall. It felt like I was at my grandmother's house and that's a great compliment since she is the queen of Mexican food.  Really enjoyed this place and will be back without a doubt.
