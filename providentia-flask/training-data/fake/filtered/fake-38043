Jacob's Pickles is the great new hot spot on the UWS. I have been a fan since it first opened. I have been there about 5 times now. It is great. Usually, I get the Mac and Cheese (to die-for) or the Chicken Bacon Egg and Cheese which is a mind-blowing explosion of flavor. I love the lemonade. i would just want the music a little louder. I definitely recommend this to everyone!
