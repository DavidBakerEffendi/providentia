Recently my boyfriend and I headed to NYC for a weekend to celebrate my birthday. I was really in the mood for some good (and not too expensive!) Italian food. We were seeing a matinee of a show that day and wanted to stick fairly close to the theater so we did some research and made a reservation at Trattoria Trecolori for after the show. I'm so glad we did! The restaurant and food were both wonderful! The location was great (right on 47th) and close by which was good since it was so cold that day. The restaurant itself is very cute and cozy....not too loud or overcrowded. We got to the restaurant about 20 minutes before our reservation since it was so cold outside figuring we would just wait, but the hostess took us right away and gave us a cute little corner table. It was very cozy and not cramped at all. The food itself was delicious. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful but was not pushy when we didn't want to order the special of the night. Our food came very quickly which made me a little bit concerned that they would try to rush us out but this was not the case at all. Our food was just prepared quickly that's all. I got the chicken parm and my boyfriend got the Veal Sorrentino and we both loved our meals! My chicken parm was delicious and well-cooked and the marinara sauce was so yummy! And for only $18. Best of all, we decided to get a dessert (ricotta creme cheesecake-highly recommend it) and happen to just mention it was my birthday. Next thing I know they're bringing me a cheesecake with a candle in and the entire wait staff sang me "happy birthday". It was a real surprise and very nice. Also they did not rush us to pay our check and get out and let us enjoy our food which was very pleasant. Overall, I was very impressed with this restaurant. Lovely atmosphere, authentic delicious Italian food at an affordable price, friendly staff, what more could you want? I will most certainly be visiting here again next time I"m in NYC.
