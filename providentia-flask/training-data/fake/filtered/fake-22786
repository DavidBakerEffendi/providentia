They have very good food! I love this resto so much. Excellent food for dinner. I enjoyed my date here since we both love to eat a lot. Lucky was never gettin' weight. The service is good too and the waiters are really nice and service oriented. You can also have a group celebration here for a birthday , wedding maybe and of course for a night-out!
