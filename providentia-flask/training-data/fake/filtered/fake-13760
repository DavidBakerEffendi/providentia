Amazing authentic mexican food. I've been to Taqueria once in downtown jersey city, and shortly  after visited El Aguila Dorada, because one of my friends was complaining how overpriced the food was and how the quality of food wasn't as good as El Aguila's food. Turns out, my friend was absolutely right. Taqueria gives you about 3 tacos for 9 bucks, but El Aguila gives you something like 5 for the same price.  Also the quality of the salsa is much more thicker and richer instead of something watered down like Taqueria. The service and waiters were nice and the pricing isn't bad at all. It has a nice homely environment so if you want to have a quiet dinner with a date this is your spot! If you live in or around the Bayonne area definitely check out El Aguila, you won't be disappointed!
