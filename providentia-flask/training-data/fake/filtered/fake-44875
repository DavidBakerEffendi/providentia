i could have given it better rating if its only about the food. however, what happened two days ago when i visited would make me stop going there again.  and i am writing this just to warn my fellow foodies. this is what happened and it probably will make me stop going to Wajima. i liked wajima since my first visit there, and i think the food is good, the price is cheap for $25 / set sukiyaki with all sides, miso soup, and the dessert however, when i went last night with 5 friends for our reunion, this older lady, our server was really pissing me off.  I do not mind people making mistakes but i hate people being dishonest. we order 3 sets sukiyaki, shabu-shabu,  plus 2 sushi combo  and a couple appetizers. however, we didn't realized any of the sides didnt come until the middle of our dinner (since we were laughing and talking to each others) so I asked this older lady about our sides, and she responded in a very annoying tone that ' no sides for sukiyaki, SIDES are only for teriyaki!' because of her really bad english, i didnt want to argue with this old lady, but i asked another server for the menu and read again myself. after i made sure the sets i ordered should come with those sides, i asked this older lady again by pointing at the menu ' but here it says the set includes these items...' what surprised me WAS, before i even finished my sentences, she immediately said 'ok, ok, you want them, i will bring you.'  OBVIOUSLY she knew those were included in the set but she was just being lazy or wtever reason that she didnt want to bring us!!! I am really fine and easy if she just forgot about those sides (too busy ) or if shes new and didnt know about that. but i just hate people being dishonest esp when we found out about that and she made excuses to deny.    hey!! I ordered a set and thats what i would be paying for.... how could you not giving me what i ordered and denied instead?! HORRIBLE.
