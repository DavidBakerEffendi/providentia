The owner of this new Restaurant did a fabulous job with the renovation! It's awesome! The food is unbelievably reasonable and excellent!  Very busy and I believe it is a 'winner'!   I have seen young and older people in there drinking and dining so it meets the criteria for all ages.  A big grand space, smoky lighting and young diversified music.   If you get there in time, you may be lucky to sit right in the front window and watch everyone walk by.  Fresh air flows in through the big doors in the front and it's like dining right outside.  Steps from the Long Island Railroad and the E/F/M&R trains.
