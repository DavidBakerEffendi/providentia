I am a Better Gourmet Kitchen addict.  Please help me! lol I eat here every day.  its the only place on Staten Island that I feel like I'm getting a healthy balanced meal.  There are other health food places but the food was so dry. Plus the workers are so happy and helpful.  its such a nice atmosphere.  the music is cool and the decor is great too.  i feel like im in soho.
