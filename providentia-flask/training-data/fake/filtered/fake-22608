Wow!  The pizza at Red Moon is horrible!  The sauce has no flavor, the dough is "doughy and not crisp at all, and the cheese tasted artificial.  With so many great pizza restaurants in NJ, it is hard to believe that anyone would ever go back to this place for a second time.  When we complained to the guy behind the counter, he told us we didn't know what we were talking about...  Hey what is there to know?  It taste lousy and all he could say is too bad!  Don't even think of eating at this place.
