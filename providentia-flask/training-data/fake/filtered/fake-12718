Three words: Al dente. The noodles are so perfectly cooked it makes me forget how to count. There are many places that really know how to just leave those noodles in the water until the ring gauge is about the width of a petite cigar, but this place isn't on the list. The bavette cacio and pepe is my favorite. For me, it contains the right amount of formaggi and pepper. It doesn't overpower and it pairs well with any of the white wine on the menu. The prosciutto testa was also mouth watering but that's not really a fair statement because I'd eat prosciutto even if it was cured in a homeless man's shoe. Overall, another great place by Mario. If your tongue likes a good f*cking from delicious Italian, you should consider visiting this she-wolf.
