I don't usually waste my time with these reviews but I was overwhelmed by the sheer forces of a group of gods some where who actually care about taste and quality in their food. Brunos is by far the most atrocious food I've ever placed in my mouth, the fried calamari was soggy and as I choked on the horrendous calamari I reached out to grab my tasteless generic RC cola in hopes of washing out the distaste from my mouth. They should place a big warning sign at the entrance, stay away !!!
