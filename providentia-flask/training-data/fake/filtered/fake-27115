HORRIBLE service. The food maybe okay, and yes, good restaurants is hard to come by in Princeton (which is shocking in this kind of caliber of wealth), but there's no excuse for bad service. The wait staff as well as the hostess were incredibly POMPOUS. The patrons at the restaurant are the ones who pay, and thus the wait staff's employers - and why would I go out of my way to be treated disrespectfully? I would never go back to Teresa's.
