I would like to take this opportunity to thank Dino, Joanne and his staff for providing a wonderful afternoon for my cousin.  A surprise 90th birthday party was planned and perfectly executed in their banquet room.  The buffet was delicious, with many people going up for seconds.  Any leftovers were wrapped up and we took them home to enjoy them again.  The waitresses could not do enough to make our guests feel welcome and very comfortable.  They were efficient, cordial and very helpful to everyone, offering special help to those who needed it. We were encouraged to bring our own music and the birthday guest of honor was truly enjoying them.  Any special requests I made were promptly take care of.  An important necessity -- the restroom was included in the private party room making it convenient for guests.   Having planned this party from out of state, Dino and I spent many phone calls discussing the details, with reassurance4 from him that things would run smoothly and that the day would go off without a hitch.  Needless to say, I was able to thoroughly enjoy the event and spend valuable time with the guest of honor. I cannot say enough about ELAINE'S, its owners and the staff.  When planning a special event, I would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant.
