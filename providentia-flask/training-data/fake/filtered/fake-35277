I was really sad to have such a mediocre experience with Nolita because we had heard good things, but unfortunately it just wasn't great. We ordered delivery and it arrived very cold. The delivery guy was super nice, so we were optimistic, but they forgot our drinks, which I had called the restaurant about after placing the order online. Amongst other things, we ordered the shrimp scampi pizza, which sounded delicious, mostly because of the sun dried tomatoes and lemon aioli, both of which were NOT on the pizza. The rest tasted ok, but had to be reheated right away, thus drying it out. As I said, we were really sad; we wanted it to be good because we order out several times a week and are looking for our new favorite spot. I hate writing a negative review, and will consider trying Nolita again. If we do, I'll keep you all posted.
