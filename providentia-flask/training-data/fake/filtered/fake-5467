I was excited to try this place out since it opened. The decor is pretty sweet and the beer selection is very good. Did not have any food so I'm unable to critique that. However, there was a ton of people wearing plaid shirts with beards. I suddenly felt as if I was in Brooklyn and not Astoria. Staff was pretty attentive during our stay. Bottom line, if you're into the whole hipster/plaid/beard scene, then this place is probably for you.
