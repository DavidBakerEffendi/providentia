What can I say? One of the best casual restaurants in town. I love Tribeca and was thrilled to have Locanda Verde as part of the neighborhood. Ricotta with grilled bread, lamb meatball sliders, perfectly cooked pasta and the fresh radishes with tuna vinaigrette are all spectacular! Very affordable wine list and good selection of tap beer. Too bad that the popularity are making reservations difficult to come by.
