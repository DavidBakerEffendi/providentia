I live in North Jersey and needed to find a venue to have a brunch. There are very few restaurants that can provide a respectful menu, with drinks for a reasonable price. There were about 7 restaurants  in Northern New Jersey that could even be considered. The Short Hills Hilton and Woodcliff Lake Hilton were amongst the finalist as well as the Summit Grand.  Although the food is excellent at these locations, the cost was cost prohibitive and there was no room for negotiation in this down economy.   When I spoke to Antonio and explained my requirements, he was extremely accommodating in showing me their several rooms, going over the menu items and honing the event to fit my budget requirements.  I had an intimate event of 40 people. It included a variety of brunch offerings to include a carving station and omelet station. It also included Mimosa, Bloody Marys and Screwdrivers.  There was also included a delicious canola & rum cake. Everyone of our guests raved about the event and I would not only recommend the Paris Inn to business associated and friends, but plan on having any other of our corporate or social events there.
