This is not the first time I visit this place. They are all good experiences. The Singkapo Laksa is very good. The broth is light and creamy, and there was a lot of meat in it(pork belly and shrimp). I also ordered a cocktail. I'm not sure about the name. Maybe Obao Sunray. It is so good. the service is very good as well. The staffs are nice and friendly. I will definitely come back again.
