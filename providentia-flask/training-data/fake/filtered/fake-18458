This place has a good variety of low calorie meals that still seem to fill you up. My favorite is the Chicken and Gorgonzola on a wheat wrap, pressed. It can start to get expensive if you are eating lunch there every day, but the food is good, healthy and well worth it. They have a variety of shakes to try but my favorite has always been the protein buster. I like to pick one up around gym time. I would call it more of a neighborhood restaurant that does take out. Most importantl;y it is different from everything else you find in the city. Whether your a tourist grabbing a meal, a local, or you work in the city, you can not go wrong by giving this place a try.
