my first and last visit ....went for my daughters birthday..we were the first ones there (and valet for a short walk SERIOUSLY?????)I would not valet my car....and as time went by tables filled and then I notice everyone around us had been served and we were STILL waiting for food...when were finally got our food my daughters linguini was hard clumps ....side of tomato sauce for pizza was just canned tomato paste (if it wasn't it should of been) it was gross....I had monkfish...it was good but they hit me for 32.00 dollars WTH wasn't worth 22.00 my fault when he said prices of specials I didn't realize it was THAT expensive for what it was....my sister in laws raviolis were hard also...I've had much better pizza my sons shrimp scampi had barely any pasta in it at all wasn't filling...yelp showed 2 $$ for pricing and causal ....I disagree MUCH more expensive...rather would of eaten at the Martini grill....and Yelp made it sound inexpensive and causal very disappointed
