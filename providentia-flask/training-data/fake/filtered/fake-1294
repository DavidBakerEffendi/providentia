Great food. Owned by the same people who have Penangs over in the Nassau Park shopping Center. Don't ever order delivery from here. They have only one delivery person and they are not familiar with the area. My apartment is a few blocks from the restaurant and the driver spent 45 min trying to find my place while on the phone with me giving directions. Eventually they drove back to the restaurant where I had to pick the food up.
