I went for the first time this week after hearing all the hype.  The staff was gruff at times, but did profusely thank people for coming there.  The $5 burger was tasty and juicy.  But here is the catch.  As someone just mentioned, sanitation is not their thing.  I watched the "cook" use a putty spreader to place raw burgers on the grill.  He used the same utensil to remove cooked ones.  He used a gloved hand to form the burgers.  He used the same glove to serve the sandwiches.  And when a piece of raw burger fell on a slice of toast waiting for its cooked burger, he just removed the errant piece of raw beef and continued on.   I can say I have been here now, but not likely to return.
