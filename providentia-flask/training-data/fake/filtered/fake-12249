This place is the worst---everyone I've talked to agrees---the service is TERRIBLE!! My friends and I went there, and it took forever for our burgers to arrive. On top of that, my friend who has a cheese allergy got cheese on hers and had to send it back---They just scraped the cheese off and put it back in front of her!! When she asked them for a new one, they brought it out and the center was raw and cold. They didn't even apologize. Never going back.
