I'm only reviewing the sushi on this one.  The cafe also has a variety of prepackaged sandwiches, salads, yogurt, juice, etc.  If you can get sushi for cheap anywhere else, don't bother with Thain Family Cafe. . If you're pressed for time and on the meal plan at Yale, you have a couple options for lunch, aside from quickly stuffing your pockets with hot food from a dining hall.  Edo Express Sushi is one of those options, and can be found wherever lunch swipes are accepted (i.e. Thain Café).  Most rolls are under the lunch swipe budget of $7, but a few specialty rolls price as high as $8.99.  There are vegetable, fish and chicken rolls to choose from, though options tend to dwindle as we progress through the week, leaving mostly California rolls by Thursday. When I went to Thain Café in Bass Library, I bought a Seafood Cucumber Sampler.  This roll had four types of rolls (shrimp, crab, tuna, and salmon) with julienned cucumber wrapped in seaweed and rice and sprinkled with sesame seeds.  The rice in both rolls had a good texture and a mild flavor.  It was definitely my favorite part of the sushi for both rolls.  The nori was definitely the worst part.  It had a leathery texture and way too much salt; I ended up eating around it and leaving it on my plate.  The tuna and salmon didn't have much of a flavor at all; I could only taste the cucumber and rice (once the nori was out), but the texture was okay.
