We ate here mid afternoon on a wednesday so the place was very quiet. We were famished and the food did not disappoint. Having found this place via the show 'best thing i ever ate' Alton Brown recommended the crepes. We ordered a sweet and savory crepe and both were delicious beyond words. The sweet crepe; apples honey goat cheese and creme fraiche, was a high point. The goat cheese brought something to the crepe that balanced out the sweetness and elevated it to a level of food I have rarely experienced. We also had the bison burger, and while the establishment is known for crepes don't be afraid to order the burger, for it was delicious. My wife fought with me for more of the burger I'd ordered. At first I thought I'd made a mistake ordering a burger at a place renowned for its crepes, but boy was i wrong. The ambiance was intimate and the staff courteous and attendant.
