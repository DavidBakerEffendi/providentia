My favorite bar in Philadelphia.  Great place to watch a game, grab food and/or spend a whole night drinking.  Bartenders are are what really makes the place though.  They are a good mix between friendly and attentive (i.e. you don't have to wait for drinks because they are too busy talking to other patrons).  I'm pretty sure they serve food till 1AM 7 days a week.
