Walked in, 20 minutes later ordered our food. Never saw the waitress again. 45 minutes later I asked a different waitress for the manager. I tell the manager that we have not seen our waitress (or the food) for almost an hour. The manager says "What do you want me to do about it?" wtf? Eventually he sends us a different waitress, who AGAIN takes our order. 30 minutes later the food arrives.... cold. I will never go there again. Â tbh, they were VERY busy but there was no call for this.
