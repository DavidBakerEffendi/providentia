I have been going to Jose Tejas almost on all occasions. The food there is as good as it gets. From mexican to Cajun, it has it all. The only turn off, if any, is the long waiting. Forget about friday or Saturday nights there. You better be prepared to wait for like atleast 30-45 minutes easily.. Besides that I am a huge fan of Jose Tejas.
