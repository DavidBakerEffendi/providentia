I went to the restaurant after a Student Congress Competition with a couple of friends. Worst Place to eat. There were bugs everywhere. But you know thats not terrible. First of all the waiter had such an attitude. No water even. He was no help ordering either, telling us about Indian food, even though me and one of my other friend was actually Indian too. Food comes along, fairly tasteless. Until the captain of the Congress team stumbles upon a pepper, and it makes a high school junior cry! Other than that it went fine...till the bill came. Well the bill was for 53 dollars between 4 people, so we gave them 55 because we didn't have change. We expected them to come back with change and receipt so we can give them a tip, they NEVER came back. So we waited, and waited. Until at roughly 3:30 the waiter comes along only to our table saying their closing, when there are 2 other tables merrily enjoying their meal. I mean he really didn't want us there. Terrible Experience. But that wasn't it. We weren't going to let them win. We come back 2 days Â later, and go from 4 people to 12 people eating there. The waiters were furious. They didn't take our order for 10 minutes. The food was even more tasteless than the first time. Another pepper for another kid. The kid starts having "spice seizure" where he begins to move at lightning speed. Waiter looks on, till manager shows up and offers him yogurt. This time we weren't going to leave a tip. But my captain felt bad and left an extremely large tip for their ridiculous service. We left and vowed never to go back their ever again. I say whoever wants good food, never go. And if your going, feel free to let loose on the waiters. They deserve it. Even for takeout, we wanted to give thanks to our bus driver so we decided to buy him stuff for takeout. There were only 2 pieces of chicken in the entire platter. Just avoid this restaurant at all costs.
