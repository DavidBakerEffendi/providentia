Beautifully prepared chicken and lamb dishes in a wonderfully authentic setting, and the family serving us were especially friendly.  It's the kind of place that you feel great about having found (instead of going to a chain restaurant!!).  We definitely intend to go back, despite the long drive from Whitestone, Queens!
