This could be my new favorite Vietnamese restaurant!  I went on back-to-back nights for dinner, & both times, it didn't disappoint! The 1st night, I tried their Bì Cuon (Shredded Pork Roll) as an appetizer. Not bad, but not out-of-this world, either. The 2nd night, I tried their Tôm Lan Bot Chiên Giòn (Crispy Battered Shrimp) as the appetizer. Great presentation & taste! I also had their Goi Gà (Chicken Cabbage Salad) on both occasions, & loved it both times! On both occasions, I ordered their Hu Tieu Mekong (Mekong Special Rice Noodle Soup w/ Saté Beef) as my main dish. My tolerance for spices is somewhat low compared to many Asians, but this wasn't bad at all. Very tasty with its noodles, meats, bean sprouts, spices, & pineapple wedges! Overall, this has probably become my new favorite restaurant.  Along w/ the tasty food, it's also got a great layout / atmosphere -- not too loud, w/ a back room in case you needed even less noise / more privacy.
