One of my top 5 favorite places in the area. I am super picky with my chicken, and this good NEVER disappoints. It is made with only the best ingredients, so different than any other place I have tried. To top it off the people who work there are AMAZING! The owners are wonderful people, always full of energy and eager to meet their customers. The delivery is fast and easy! Love it!
