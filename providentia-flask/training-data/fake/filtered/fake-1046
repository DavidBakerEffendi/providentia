Everything But Anchovies, locally known as EBA's, is one of the worst pizzerias I have ever come across. There are a number of reasons that I believe this. First of all, the quality of their pizza is NOWHERE close to their rivals. When ordering pizza in Hanover I would highly recommend C&As Pizza. They offer the lowest price and the best quality pizza. The only reason EBAs stays in business is because it monopolizes the late night delivery to drunk hungry college students. The only place available for delivery past 12pm is EBAs. This means they turn a nice profit while disregarding the quality of their pizza. Additionally, they constantly screw up orders. I can't tell you the amount of times I've ordered a side of ranch and they've either forgot it or given me bleu cheese instead. Overall AVOID EBA's at all costs.
