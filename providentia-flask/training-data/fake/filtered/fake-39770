Mirands's is a poor excuse for a restaurant and a throwback to the days of tasteless overcooked 1950's style food. I will not be returning any time soon for a repeat performance. I was brought a dinner I hadn't ordered and asked that it be replaced with the meal I had ordered. What was delivered instead was stink eye by the manager and a cook who came out into the dining room to deliver hostile stares in our direction. Our apologetic server could not explain why after over 40 minutes there was still no replacement food to serve. The food that was served to the rest of our party was nothing special; as stated previously, a throwback to the 1950's. When our party finished eating we left with a bad taste in our mouths. I found dinner elsewhere as it was never brought to me.
