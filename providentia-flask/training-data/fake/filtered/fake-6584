Perhaps the best restaurant in New Jersey, and it certainly ranks with the very top ones in Manhattan (most of which we've been to). We've been to Fascino about 10 times now - everything has been perfect every time, from the greeting to staff to the excellence of the food and gorgeous presentations and the freshness, and they are very catering to individual preferences (you should alert them when making a reservation if you have special dietary issues or food allergies). The portions are generous. Alert: the pastry chef is to die for, so try to leave room for desert.  Reservations are essential - often more than a week in advance - but you can always call to check if there was a last-minute cancellation.  They also have a sufficient range of vegetarian entries (and will adjust other offerings) so this is one of the upscale places you can go if there are vegetarians in your party.  No liquor license so it is BYO (as with many other NJ restaurants); no corkage fees. Extremely friendly staff, owner and chef.  It is not inexpensive, but you get great value for your dollar.  Do consider the various tasting menus.
