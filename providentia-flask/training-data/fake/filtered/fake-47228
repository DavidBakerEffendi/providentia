All Italian restaurants serve pasta but for Luca's, pasta is only one gem of Chef Andrea DiMeglio's kitchen of jewels.  Lasagna, risotto, gnocchi, braised and roasted meat dishes, soups, salads and appetizers - all are of the highest quality, served with care by an attentive and courteous staff.  But the seafood requires special notice since only someone who grew up near the ocean has the light touch that fragile fin and shell fish demand.  As one might expect, Andrea DiMeglio did grow up near the ocean - in this case the Tyrrhenian island of Ischia off the coast of Naples.  For those readers who notice I do not mention desserts, let me assure them that my lack of attention to desserts is nothing more than my personal  lack of interest in sweets.  My dining companions are as enthusiastic about Andrea  DiMeglio's desserts as I am about the rest of his menu.  Don't wait another day for an unforgettable lunch or dinner at this restaurant that is located on the Somerset side of Rte 27, not on the North Brunswick side.
