I keep going there for dinner! Food is always a nice threat. Staff is so nice! Service is more perfect for the price. Always a young and trendy and classy vibe. If we look at price quality it is defiantly a place to check out. Most of the time I take the delicious tartare as a starter and here is my only remark. Last time the tartare was premaid and came right( with bowl) out of the fridge. It was still good but it was to cold and I guess not as fresh. BUT in their defense we did came in very late that night. Bottom line : go and check it out!
