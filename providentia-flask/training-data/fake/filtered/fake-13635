This is a different place than it used to be. I live on the same street as Cuba and used to bring people here all the time. Maybe it's just their brunch, but the quality has gone so far down below edible, I just cannot justify ever coming back again. The brunch mimosas taste like something out of a can, the food itself is dry and couldn't eat more than a few bites. I am really disappointed as I used to love this place. I don't understand why places that do so well (this place used to always be busy), decide in order to save money to scrimp on quality. One meal later, you have lost a customer. Too bad, it used to be great.
