Sushi Yasuda is where one will find the most exquisite sushi on the planet.  I recently dined there with my daughter when I traveled from San Francisco in March 2009 (while she was auditioning in NYC) .  We were quite honored to have been seated at the counter with Master Yasuda.  I attended college in Tokyo and have dined on the best sushi in Japan.  Master Yasuda's creations far exceed any sushi I have eaten at the most prestigious sushi restaurants in Tokyo.  Master Yasuda is passionate about serving sushi in the traditional Japanese way which is a form of art requiring expertise not found in the States.  Dining at Sushi Yasuda is not only exquisite, it is an opportunity to learn how sushi should be served in its true form.   Do not "drown" the delicate sushi with wasabi and soy sauce.  That would be an insult to your sushi master.  Ask your sushi master for "omakase" and ask for his guidance.  And when he recommends that you eat the toro within 10 seconds, take his word for it.  It oxidizes within 10 seconds and the flavor will be distorted.  After all, he is referred to as a master because of his expertise.
