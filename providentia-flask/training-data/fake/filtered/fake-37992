This place could truly not live up to my expectations. I guess reading the reviews of others I can say that maybe this is not my type of food, I do not find value on getting 2 lbs of greasy French fries and a small piece of chewy (not crunchy) fried chicken. Also the music was very loud and distasteful, I guess rap plagued with obscenities is also not my cup of tea for dinner. Given my comments you may think that I am 60 years old and that I lack the coolness factor of New Yorkers, but I am in fact 28 and still not amazed by anything this place has to offer.
