The mediocre skimpy cooked food was a huge disappointment. The tiny two Scallops appetizer for $15 was thievery and blatant customer disregard. The entree Cod for $28 was maybe 3oz with very skimpy (maybe a tablespoon) of vegetables. And the fish was barely cooked, was bland and very unimaginatively prepared.It might have been an appetizer at a restaurant that cared for it's clientele, but prepared better. The menu writers are brilliant, because everything sounds great. But in reality it's Â not. I was starving afterward and very annoyed. I even asked the waiter before I ordered if the fish was a decent size , he said it was substantial (lie). We had two side dishes , the mustard mashed potatoes. Too mustardy, too creamy and too skimpy again and the cauliflower au gratin which was fair but way too much rich (boil in bag type) sauce and barely any vegetable.The wait staff was cold, nervous, stiff and seemed terrified of management finding out they did not rote recite every last ingredient in every dish. The food servers could not even serve the ordered food to the person who ordered it (we were only two people).And when they did, proceeded to recite again every ingredient in the dish. The owners spent a lot of money on the atmosphere and the rooms feel lively and comfortable. The bathrooms are really nice. I guess they have to rip off their customers to pay off the huge bill for decor. If you decide to go ( and I wouldn't rush to, there are so many other satisfying restaurants in the city), just have an over priced drink and cold seafood apps or charcuterie. Unless they get it together, they will be empty in less than a year once people realize how expensive it is for what you actually get. we spent over $200 for two. It's too bad, i wanted to love this place.
