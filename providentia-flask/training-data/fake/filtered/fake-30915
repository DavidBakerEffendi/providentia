I don't usually write negative reviews like this, but I was really disappointed with Jimmies. We had a friend from out of town who wanted to go to a seafood place on the beach. I'd been to Jimmies over a decade ago and remembered it being pretty good. I had the shrimp and scallops. The breading on the seafood was thick and tough. The scallops were inoffensive, but not great. They may have been overcooked. The shrimp were definitely overcooked and rubbery, and at least some of them had not been properly cleaned and deveined, leaving a foul taste that remained for hours. I felt a little queasy afterwards. The Rhode Island-style clam chowder was pretty good, though. The waitress we had was nice, but was very young and had only been working there for a couple of days. She could not answer basic questions about the food, but otherwise the service was OK. The beer I had was sloppily poured, and the bathroom reeked of stale urine - you could tell it had not been cleaned recently or well. If you're looking for a good fried seafood place, go to Stowe's right down the beach. Whatever this place had, it's lost it, and the bad-to-moderate seafood you'll get is not worth the prices they charge.
