I have lived in NYC and San Francisco, and this is perhaps the best Ethiopian food I have ever tasted. There are plenty of delicious, authentic choices for vegetarians and meat lovers. Lalibela is run by a very sweet couple--the woman works the kitchen and the man runs the dining room. They both do their utmost to make your visit a special and warm dining experience. When it's slow, they will talk to you at length about the food and Ethiopian culture. If you live anywhere in the Tri-State area, or are just visiting, and you love Ethiopian food, Lalibela is absolutely worth the trip!
