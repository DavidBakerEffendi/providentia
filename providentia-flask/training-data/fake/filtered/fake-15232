Day By Day did the most amazing job catering our rather difficult wedding. From having to move 100 people into our reception hall due to rain, to dealing with a broken oven and a missing table, Day by Day managed to deliver, to quote more than one guest, "The Best Wedding Food I've EVER Had". The catering manager Stephen and his entire staff was helpful, kind, supportive, and generous throughout the entire wedding process. We had a fabulous, smooth, successful, well-fed wedding and I maintain we never would have done it all without Day By Day. Thank you all!!!
