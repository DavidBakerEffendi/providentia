Warm cozy hug of dark wood, candlelight; beers, booze galore. Place nearly screams whiskey. And beards. And turkey legs. And heaving d√©colletage. And cockney drawls. And peat stained Wellies. Big wraparound picture window begs for toasting an afternoon away. Staring out into this corner of the BK world. It's Windsor Terrace, technically, just off the southwest corner of Prospect Park, the Pavillion Cinema and the incredibly inaccurately named Bartel Pritchard Square (it's a circle), the roundabout connecting Prospect Park West with 15th Street, the West Drive entrance of Prospect Park, and Prospect Park SW. But perhaps most importantly, great service from Todd, the best bartender in the tri-state area. Unparalleled wielding of libations AND tracks: You essentially get an encyclopedic DJ and mix-magician, all in one feller. He treats us like good friends (probably 'cause we are) every time we come in. It's truly the royal treatment in a Richmond Hill (the one on the Thames) meets, say... a Leadville, Colo.,... -type saloon. But it's Brooklyn baby: Go get yer cheers on.
