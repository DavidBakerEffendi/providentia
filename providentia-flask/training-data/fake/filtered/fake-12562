You can't get better Korean/Japanese fusion than this.  Perfect food.  Superb atmosphere.  Its like being back in Korea again.  I've lived in Japan and visited Korea and grown up eating Korean food in restaurants worldwide.  We tried the Bulgolgi Taco, and the Bulgolgi lunch box.  It came with Miso Soup and the starters.  They have a very good and unique Celery/ Daikon shoyu starter that I never had before and it blasted us away with its excellent taste.   The lunch box had it all:  Salad, California rolls, Tempura, Bulgolgi, Fried Gyoza rice and so on.      The Gyoza (Dumplings) were some of the best fried gyoza I have ever tasted.    5 stars!
