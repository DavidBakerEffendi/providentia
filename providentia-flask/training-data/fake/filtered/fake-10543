I feel like I am in Seoul again at this place.  Something about the ambience, staff, and the food!  I was honestly really surprised to find such high quality in a city with little other competition in terms of Korean food.  It's better than anywhere I found in Boston, where there is more competition.  We also brought our young toddler and the staff was very kind, bringing her plain tofu cubes and other mild things she could chew.  I love everything about this restaurant, always a treat to go.  The pa-juhn is particularly masterfully done.  The kim-chee is excellent too.
