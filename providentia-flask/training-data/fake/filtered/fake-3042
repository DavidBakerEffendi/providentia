Went to have dinner at Thai Essence restaurant.  Our friend in Nutley has recommended.  Very nice dinning area.  The place was a little crowded...  I guess everyone is out enjoying the nice cool weather... They have very good Pad thai and nice portion.  We had Duck Honey which was house special... very crispy and delicious. Reasonaly price.
