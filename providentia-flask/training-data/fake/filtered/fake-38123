This place is amazing. The food is great. There're options when it comes to ambiance as there are three different floors with three different atmospheres. There's usually some good competition on the pool table and the drink specials are great. All of that being said, it's the staff that make this place. Every single person that works there is the shit. Their smiles aren't fake, they take care of their regulars, there swag is on point and they keep it sexy. Word up to that staff.
