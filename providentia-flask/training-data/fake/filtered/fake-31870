We were looking for a restaurant near Central Park's Great Lawn.  Saw these reviews.  The Sangria was delicious.  They have a selection of about 12 different combinations.  We had the snapper ceviche which was very tasty.  I ate the Cuban Skirt Steak and my husband had the duck entree.  Both had a lot of flavor.  Even the rice was addictive with its smoked flavor.  The atmosphere was pleasant, but a little dark.  If you're looking for a bright place, open to the street on a nice day, this is not the place.  I would say that the prices were reasonable, but not just $$--- $13 for ceviche, $26 per appetizer and the pitcher of Sangria was $33. Definitely go back and try some of the other selections.
