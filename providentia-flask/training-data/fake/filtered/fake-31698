I live right around this place. When they were first opening I was excited at the thought of possibly having a decent food place nearby. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. I gave BBQ Barbacoa several tries in hopes they would redeem themselves. That never happened. ThIs is a BBQ place that serves BBQ sauce on the side. The meats are dry and hard, I almost lost a tooth eating their steak. The seasonings are pretty bland, that goes for all meats including the sauceless ribs. I tried their chicken fingers and they had barely any seasonings. I ordered them thinking that no one could mess up chicken fingers that bad, I was wrong.  The rice tasted like instant rice. The macaroni and cheese was overcooked bits and pieces of elbow pasta with barely any sauce, it tasted like it was from a box. The prices are pretty high for subpar food. I live two blocks away and it took them over an hour and a half to deliver chicken fingers and macaroni and cheese. I really wish the owner would get in touch with his customer base and ask for suggestions on what could make the food better. Another sour point is the fact that now you have to worry about a car driving through the front window of the store while you eat, or wait for your food, cause it's near an intersection that has the potential to be dangerous  :(
