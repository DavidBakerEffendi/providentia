Although I love the soup, I have to say that their business practices have turned me off for good. Â The server charged me twice (once before tip, once after) and I contacted them immediately for a refund of the pre-tip amount. The manager said it happens (as I'm sure it does everywhere), and they would have the bank revert the charge. Two weeks later, I followed up because nothing had happened. Several days later, the manager returned my call, acting very condescending and said they "don't give away free food." I offered to bring my statement, but the manager said I needed to have the bank provide a slip with an invoice for both, which of course does not exist because they don't issue invoices for sales, they just process sales. Not worth the trouble of $10 lunch buffet, but left a terrible taste in my mouth.
