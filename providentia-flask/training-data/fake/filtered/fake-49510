Services was perfect. Our waitress was friendly and attentive even though it was a busy night. The food was sensational. We went with a large group and everyone was happy with what they ordered. This is the kind of place I would take people to when they come to visit Philly because its classy, delicious, and welcoming. Absolutely nothing bad to say.
