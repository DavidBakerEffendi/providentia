Maybe it was just too chichi for me, and I'm too old for this sort of grand nonsense.  $190 including tip and tax for 8 tiny plates of Tapas, 3 desserts and a tiny carafe of wine. Of course it's not about quantity, but that amounted to about 16 ounces of food. To add injury, two of our party fell ill afterward.  I won't be back.
