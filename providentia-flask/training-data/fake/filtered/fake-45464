My husband and I were here with friends on Friday night.  Given that we live in Carlstadt, we were very excited to try Terre a Terre.  It did not disappoint.  Service is excellent, the food is fantastic (the chef is a master with duck and pork), and the ambiance is lovely.  We will be back again and again.  Just sorry it took so long for us to try it.
