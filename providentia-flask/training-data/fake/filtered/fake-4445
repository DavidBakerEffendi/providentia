My husband and I dine here for lunch on our Date Days!  We love their falafel, hummus, kibbeh and rice.  We could definitely dine here weekly if we lived nearby.  A definite gem!  The food is very good but the hospitality would benefit from improvement.  Much of the staff are not warm and welcoming.  If you love falafel, this is your place!
