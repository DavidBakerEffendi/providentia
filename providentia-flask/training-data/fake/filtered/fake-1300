I am part of a group of 12 people who eat out and then go to a theatre production. The service in this restaurant was the worst which we have ever experienced.   We had a 5:30 reservation, ordered at 5:45, and still had not received our entrees at 6:50 PM- more than an hour later!!! The staff was totally indifferent "forgetting" to refill the water glasses, refusing to see what the hang up was, etc.  Needless to say, we did not enjoy the meal which came so late that we had to put it into take out boxes and run to the performance. If you have a group of more than 4 people and cannot spend the night waiting for your meal, skp this restaurant.
