The place is really small and cramped so it is hard to enjoy if it is a bit crowded. Food wise, when first tried it soon after they opened, it was fresh and delicious so I came back several times. However, I had a meal there lately, which I was unhappy with. Everything felt like it was refrigerated and greasy. The fried eggplant was refrigerated, which supposed to be fried the same day it is served. It was obvious and kinda smelled bad so I felt at liberty to tell the person behind the counter. She responded saying that "I will let the owners know" which I though was the wrong answer as to at least compensating me. I paid to get a fresh meal and their prices are a high and not even organic. The tomatoes are dark red and taste stale, cucumbers are not fresh as well. The only thing that I liked was the pita bread and the Hummus.  The shwarma meet is dry and oily. The quality of the food is certainly different than when they first opened.  Reminds me of corporate america.....
