My wife, Daughter and I loved waking up on Saturday mornings knowing we were going to Green Eggs for brunch. The food is great!! However after going there every week for 3+ months the service took a dive! One visit my order came out wrong, I let the waitress know, the manager then comes up to accuse me of not ordering properly. Afterwards, the correct platter came out. I still left my normal 22% tip as I always do and never thought twice. The following week we go back and was told it would be a few minutes. That was no big deal, however after about 20 minutes of waiting and numerous other people were seating with a party of 3 or 4 I ask the server, "what's going on"?He calls the manager over ( the same one as the week prior ) he then says to me "I thought I heard you say a party of 30 not 3". Then proceeds to say " sometimes people think they something but misspeaks". Then says " just like when you ordered last week". Needless to say my family and I left furiously and will NEVER return!!! I still admit the food is excellent but if you want to be treated with any respect I strongly recommend NEVER go to Green Eggs!!
