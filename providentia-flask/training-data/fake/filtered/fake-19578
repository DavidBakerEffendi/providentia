I ate at Tres last night for the first time in a long while.  We used to love that place for a quick bite, just two blocks from home.  Last night, was a total disappointment...the guac was good, the chips were stale as all get out and my tacos were just meh. The menu is a take out menu....what happened to the real menus?  Has this place changed hands???  Not sure I will go back, despite having always loved this place.
