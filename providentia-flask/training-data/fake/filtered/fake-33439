I'm going to get right to it: Root & Bone is as good as it gets. There are so many places to eat in East Village, that it can get overwhelming. But if you're ever in the area, I hope you find some time to get a bucket of bird because it might be the best fried chicken I've ever had. Each time my boyfriend and I go, we order half of a bucket of bird, the mac and cheese, and whatever else we feel like having. The deviled eggs are a MUST! It gets very crowded at times - my boyfriend and I have yet to sit at an actual table. But we'll gladly sit at the counter, knowing that we're about to get a quality meal.
