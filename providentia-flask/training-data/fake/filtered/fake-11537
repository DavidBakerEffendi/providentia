The Asian Grill has fresh quality sushi. The prices are inexpensive and the service is great. The food is prepared quickly and they always get my order correct. I recently found out that they do take-out orders and I have ordered take-out twice. The girls who answer the phone all speak perfect english and always get my order correct. The food is ready to be picked up within 15 minutes. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to friends.
