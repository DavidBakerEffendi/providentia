I've been hearing about the corn from every person who has ever stepped into SoHo ever since this place opened so a friend and I finally gave it a chance. The corn is, as everyone else agrees, out of this world.  Not only is it smothered in the perfect combination of butter, cotija cheese and lime but the corn underneath is delightfully big, juicy and lovingly grilled.  At $4 for two (sit-down, or $2 for one take-out), this is one treat no NYer should do without. We decided to save the entrees for a later time as we had a big lunch earlier, more room for cocktails, no?  The Chelada and Michelado was some kind of twisted (yet disturbingly tasty) combination of Corona, tequila, hot sauce, etc.  Good but definiitely not for the mild-mannered. Show up before 5:30 during the week in order to beat the inevitable wait  or just hop next door to the take-out portion of the restaurant for a quicker fix (unfortunately, that side does not carry the entire menu of the sit-down portion). Oh, and you have to try the corn.
