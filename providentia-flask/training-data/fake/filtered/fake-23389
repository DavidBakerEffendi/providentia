I was wandering with a friend looking for a restaurant where we could listen some jazz and we entered in La lanterna by chance. And what a chance ! Great food, great music, great atmosphere ! And it is very affordable. The cocktails are really good and the desserts are delightful... So far, it is one of the best Italian food I've eaten in NY. The group who was playing the night I went was good and it was really nice listening it in this dark but cosy place. Really intimate. It is definitely a place to go...
