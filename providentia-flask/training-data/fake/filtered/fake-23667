After 2 years in NYC, I finally made it through the 1 hour wait for a table at Spotted Pig for their infamous burger.  What a let down!  What a disappointment!  They should change the menu to a bag of salt accented by a toasted buttery bun, a scoop of roquefort cheese (super salty), some burger on the side and a mountain of garlic-rosemary fries (which were tasty - and not as salty). Some context: Let it be known, I am a huge fan of the Shake Shack Burger as well as a delicious, freshly grilled burger in a sit down restaurant like Corner Bistro.  Like those on NY Magazine's Food Editorial board, I am also keenly aware that the best burgers are 80% lean, accompanied by lettuce, tomato, some mild cheddar cheese, and sandwiched between a toasted potato bun and served with shoestring french fries. So, overall it isn't worth the wait for this burger.  The ambience is very nice, the staff is good as well. Perhaps it was the salt-loving chef who was working this Sunday (Feb 27 around 2pm) or  perhaps this is really their style.  Either way, I'm definitely not going back there for a burger, but I'd give some of the other items on the menu a try.   I'm up for 2nd chances.   Lastly, How can this place really be a michelin star restaurant? According to NY Mag articles, they win for superior ingredients. Perhaps it is the high quality of their ingredients, like their salt?
