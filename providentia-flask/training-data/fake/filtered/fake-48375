'Dissapointed' best describes our reaction to our 1st Philly Cheese Steak.  While the service was (alarmingly?) quick, and the experience altogether charming, the steak itself tasted like a distant cousin to packing foam, flavorless and leathery.   Maybe it's better if you're drunk. As a recent transplants to Philadelphia, we were looking forward to reporting back our friends in Brooklyn on the quality of Philly's Cheese Steak Sandwiches. Several people suggested that we check out famous Pat's for our inaugural cheese steak. We're still on the lookout for a great Philly Cheese Steak, one we can treat our friends and family to when they come to Philly to visit.   We hear we should try Tony Luke's.
