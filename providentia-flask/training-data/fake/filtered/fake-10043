Me and my friends decided to go here because its supposedly the best brunch place in Park Slope. Boy were we wrong. We waited over an hour to get seated and about the same to actually get our food. We didn't mind waiting so long because we figured the food would be worth the wait. Unfortunately for us it was not. I took one bit out of the pouched egg and couldn't eat anymore. The swordfish cake was too fishy and not tasty at all. Overall, I would recommend ANY other place to have brunch.
