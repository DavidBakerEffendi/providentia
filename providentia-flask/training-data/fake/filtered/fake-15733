One if the best pho IF NOT THE BEST you'll ever taste ! , I order here and eat here all the times not only since it's extremely convenient for meh but as well as being a very wholesome and YUMMY place to eat. They only serve one item which chicken pho or noodles but you know what they say ... Simplicity is the way to go and this establishment really lives up that saying I recommend of your in the Huntington or the Philly area to stop by this place and have a delicious classic vietnamese cuisine that I'm gurrl teed you won't regret ! Am I right?
