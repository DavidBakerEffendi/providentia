We ordered 4 entrees, 3 appetizers, 2 desserts and one drink. The total charge, including 18% gratuity, was $195! The food was not bad but it wasn't great either. Nothing made us say "Wow! I'm coming back here for this dish", which I expect to say after spending that kind of money. It is definitely overpriced. You may think that you are paying for the atmosphere and/or the view from the 22nd floor. But there is not much of an atmosphere or view. More specifics about food: The inside of a creme brulee should be a thick liquid like a custard, not a moist solid like a cake! The fish and the scallops were cooked perfectly but were generally bland. The scallops did not pair well with the sides. The bread was sub-par. On the other hand, the chicken was good and so were the potatoes with it. The tempura was alright and the lemon aioli that came with it was pretty good. The service was fine. It was exactly a 3 out of 5 star experience. I'll not go back unless I'm staying at this hotel and the meal is paid for by my office.
