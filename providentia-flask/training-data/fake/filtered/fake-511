Just got back to AZ from a 10 day trip to Brazil and Argentina with Gate1 Travel. They do a superior job with their escorted tours. Not only great value for the dollar spent, but a chance to experience travel in a meaningful and thoughtful manner. For those seeking a break from the beaten paths of Europe, Gate1 offers a number of Latin American tours that blend the best of urban culture with history, archeology, and exquisite natural phenomena like Iguazu Falls which we visited on this trip. The feeling one gets when peering into the abyss that is our Grand Canyon is matched by the senses that are stirred by the power and energy of these enormous thundering waters on the border of Brazil and Argentina. Gate1 always offers comfortable hotels, experienced and personable tour directors and plenty of time for independent exploration. I have also visited Peru, Ecuador and Costa Rica as well as Egypt, Morocco,Turkey and the Baltics with Gate1 and suggest that any serious devotee of travel check this company out. You will not be disappointed.
