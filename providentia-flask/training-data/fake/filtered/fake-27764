Definitely one of my favorite restaurants on Staten Island.  The food is excellent and the service is pretty good.  I like the Cajun theme and the inside is a bit larger than some of the other limited seating restaurants on the North Shore.  I use to go to their sister restaurant Besos until I went here and now I prefer this over Besos.  Make sure to book a reservation otherwise you'll have to wait for a table.
