This place is great. The Wontons are delicious, the shu mai, the beef stew over noodles (I like Shanghai style noodles) and the clay pot casserole dishes are all really really good. Service is normal for Chinatown and there are some waiters who don't speak English, but they know how to wear a Hawaiian shirt, believe it. But you don't go to Chinese for great service, do you? No you go for the awesome food. And this is the place on Mott street, best as I can tell.
