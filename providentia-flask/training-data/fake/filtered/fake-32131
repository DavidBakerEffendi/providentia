The owner and staff at Edison Ale House cares nothing about the patrons that dine in their establishment.  I got ill from an entree that was served, and I immediately called the restaurant and spoke with two managers, Rick and Nicolette, who promised to refund my tab as a way of apologizing, but never did!!  I also asked to speak with the owners, Tom or Nick, numerous times.  They never returned any of my calls.  As a restaurant where customer service is essential, they fail miserably and turn their backs on the patrons that keep them in business.  The food and staff are horrific and would never recommend this restaurant to anyone!!  Shame on them!
