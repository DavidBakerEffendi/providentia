I don't know the anatomy of Sicilian pizza or why the tomato sauce is over the cheese... but it is probably the reason L&B's square pizza one of the best things my tongue has ever had the pleasure of tasting. The moment I bite into a hot slice, I can feel the goosebumps rising from the surface of my skin. (Warning: This might get a little graphic.) When I take a bite, my teeth descend into a thick, soft pillow of cheese and bread--a delightful distinctness that separates this pizza from all the other pizza joints that serve them hard, dry, and tasteless. After passing that deep layer, I meet the crispy crust. The crust gives the pizza that nice contrast in hardness... for lack of a better word. OH! Now lets talk about the sauce! Getting past that initial bite and then moving on to chewing... it's no wonder why this pizza is so famous. The tomato sauce is honestly the best part with it's fresh, sweet, and slightly tangy sauciness... All in all, L&B is a great place to go to for lunch, dinner, and even dates. Some other things I thought I should mention are that the spumoni (ice cream) itself is actually very good too, the wait to get into the restaurant isn't that bad, the service is great, there isn't much of a wait for your food, the atmosphere inside the restaurant is nice (it kind of has that date night feel with the mirrored ceilings and dim lighting, if ya know what I mean), and lastly the bill isn't going to leave your wallet feeling empty. Five stars all the way! Some might think my review is... dare i say... cheesy ;)
