My girlfriend Kelly and I were there friday night, and got in right away to be seated. we both ordered the mango chicken dinner served in a mango shell. It was very good but did have way too much mango then we could finish and not so much chicken. We also ordered the coconut rice, which I think is a must to order just for the fact that it is so unusual to find. We also tried to order the watermelon drink, but they were out. We ordered the Lychee drink, which was awesome and you can save the whole fruits at the botom of the glass for a dessert at the end of the meal. Total cost was around  $55.00 with tip, a litle pricey but hey it is the city. Also make sure you write  down where you parked at, as it is easy to get lost and at night and  is a little scary for some to walk around the streets. All said, I think it is a great place to go, being that south street is a few minutes away.                                                  HAPPY EATING!!  TC
