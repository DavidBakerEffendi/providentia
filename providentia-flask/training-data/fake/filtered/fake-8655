I just got off the phone with a surprisingly rude delivery rep. I have Celiac disease, which means I can't eat gluten and I just found out that a couple of Mexican restaurants in the area have corn tortillas that contain gluten (which is news to me), so I called to ask if Guerro's tortillas were or were not gluten free. The first person I spoke to was male and was extremely unhelpful. I asked him if the tortillas were gluten-free and he told me he assumed so. I asked if he could make sure. He left and Â came back on the lines shortly and told me they were gluten-free. I asked if he was sure. He said I had asked him to find out and he had asked someone and he didn't know what else there was that he could do. I said it is as simple as reading the package. He said oh, okay, in a sarcastic tone of voice, put me on hold, and a few minutes later a woman came on the line who told me the tortillas were gluten free. She was quite pleasant about this, until I asked her if she was sure and she also got defensive, saying that there was nothing on the ingredients list about flour so unless the ingredients list was wrong there should be no problem with the tortillas. I apologized for my overly-cautiousness but explained that it's a very serious allergy and I just wanted to make sure. I then proceeded to ask if I could place an order for delivery and in the middle of this sentence she hung up on me. I work at a restaurant that takes customer reviews and satisfaction extremely seriously, and I am really frustrated at the treatment that I just received. I understand it's Saturday night and it's busy, but representatives of restaurants need to be capable of dealing professionally with all customers, including those who have food allergies that are out of their control. I was going to place an order at the restaurant, but the last thing I want to do now is call these people back and jump through hoops to make sure the food I buy won't make me sick.
