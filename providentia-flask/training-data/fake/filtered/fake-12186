While Blue Back Square is dotted with empty storefronts, the restaurant scene is booming. Newcomer Umi Sushi is a novelty, the first Kaiten restaurant (think Japanese automat) in Connecticut. Take a seat at the bar and grab whichever dish you fancy, as mango/tuna rolls, veggie dumplings and all manner of sushi whiz by on the conveyer belt. No germ worries, individual dishes are covered, and the selection ranges from the familiar (California roll) to the adventurous (sea urchin). Â Bring the kids: it's fast and fun, and the drinks alone will keep them well-entertained, if not sugar-buzzed: surprising cubes of green jello float in the sweet watermelon tea.
