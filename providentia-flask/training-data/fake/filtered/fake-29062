Normally I really enjoy their sandwiches.  They are delicious!  However I'm pregnant and still wanted to enjoy their sandwiches.  My only concern was the chili mayo especially with uncooked eggs.  I asked if I could have a sandwich without mayo.  They told me it was company policy they could not do so. What ever happened to customer service?  What if someone has an allergy?
