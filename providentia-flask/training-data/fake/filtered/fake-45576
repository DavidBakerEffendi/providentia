Denino's has one of the best thin and crispy pies you can find out there. Its a great place, been there many years and I have been enjoying it since I was a little kid a few years back. Cool place to go with your friends to grab a beer and watch the game at the bar or a great place to bring the family on a Friday night with a pitcher of soda and a crispy pie. They cook there pies perfect, I love thin and crispy pizza, you never even have to tell them well done like everywhere else, its cooked to perfection. I highly recommend their pepperoni pie and the MOR pie (meatballs, onions and ricotta) very unique and tasty. They also have some of the best fried calamari, very very tender, melts in your mouth. Parking's a bit tough and keep in mind, cash only $$$ and closed Mondays, prices are very fair however especially for the their quality. I go here any day of the week.
