A friend planned a gathering at Wafa's last Wednesday night.  It was my first time there.  I don't know why I hadn't noticed it or been drawn to it from the outside before (since I'm often drive on Metropolitan Avenue).  Well, I am so grateful to my friend for introducing me.  I love Mediterranean food, and especially Lebanese food.  We shared the hummus and fattoush to start and both were delicious.  I had the lamb shawerma with the califlower and tabouleh.  Also very good.  Service was great.  We were the last table there, it was after closing time, and they didn't rush us out.  Oh, and Wednesday was BYOB night.  I'm not sure if that's just a current promotion, but it's nice thing when you can do that.  We were 7 and the final bill with tip came to $15/person.  They delivery too.  I'll definitely be using that service!
