We went in because we saw a sign for 4 dollar lychee martinis - 2 of us ordered the martinis and the other girl ordered a manhattan - of course we had to go up to the bar and tell the waitress our order after sitting and waiting for 10 minutes after she sat us. The lychee martinis were decent but the manhattan was NOT GOOD. After one sip we told the waitress that the manhattan didn't taste good - something was missing. She proceeeded to tell us that they use better vermouth then we are used to instead of apologizing and offering something else. In other workds it was the customer who was wrong and had bad taste and verlaines manhattans are too good for us to realize. We got the check after returning the full drink with the 10 dollar manhattan still on there (menu said 9) We called her over and asked her to take it off - instead she brought over the menu to show us the better vermouth they use at verlaine. Eventually she took the drink off - there is a way to treat your customers especially if you are expecting any sort of tip - we left 2 dollars for the lychee martinis but will not be coming back because of the way we were treated. THUMBS DOWN!!
