I have eaten breakfast at The Country Girl Diner twice now and only wish that I lived closer! It is a taste of heaven, a friendly, efficient heaven at that. Â The french toast is fluffy and comes with as much REAL maple syryp and butter as a girl can stand, the bacon is thick cut and delicious and the portions are very generous. Too bad because I was too happy and too stuffed to try anything more. Next time!
