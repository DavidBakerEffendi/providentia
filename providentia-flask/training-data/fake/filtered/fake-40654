I went with a group of 6. We ordered two pizzas and received them quickly. Our waiter was helpful, but it seemed like he was pissed off the whole time. A smile would have helped. Â I've worked in the service industry, still do, and I know it sucks. We still left him a huge tip even though he did nothing to go out of his way to deserve it. Lombardi's claims that they are the oldest pizza parlor in New York. That's all they can claim. I've had better pizza. Their breadsticks are horrible and tasteless. We were seated upstairs, which I recommend avoiding, because it's disgusting and and stuffy.
