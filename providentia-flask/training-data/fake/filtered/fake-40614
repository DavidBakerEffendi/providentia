was leaving nyc and wanted to try the 1st pizza place. my experience fast to come out... cheese was freshly made but not very flavorful or enough on the pizza sauce was san marzano but had better flavor elsewhere crust was nyc thin style nothing special for the price I would get Di Fara pizza and would never look anywhere else
