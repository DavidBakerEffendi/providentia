It was a nice place to go to eat, the d√©cor of place had a very cozy feeling to it and the atmosphere was reasonably friendly and the service at the restaurant was very friendly and attentive. The woman waiting on us was very friendly and it was nice to see that she had a great personality and it definitely made staying there for dinner a pleasure. The duck confit was excellent as was pretty much everything I had, this was the first time I had duck to eat but it was actually a lot better than I was expecting. Going to this restaurant was definitely one of the best places to go in New York. It was really nice to go to and I would definitely go there again if not for the food definitely for the service. I was very impressed by the service and it's always nice to go to a restaurant where the servers are great people because that's who they are as well as just doing a good job for a good tip.
