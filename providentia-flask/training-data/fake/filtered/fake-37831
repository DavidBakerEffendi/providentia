Me and my friend went there for lunch and we were seated on the patio. 15 minutes into our meal it started raining and the manager gave us a table inside right away. Overall we were very pleased with the food and the service. I had buckwheat pancakes with real maple syrup and my friend had Mela Note salad. Keep up the good work!
