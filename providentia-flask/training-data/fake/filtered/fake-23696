We stopped in late-night for a drink and some deviled eggs. The eggs were really good - I wish I could have them again, but for brunch. The french fries were matchstick-thin and delicious, with fried garlic and rosemary and LOADS of salt. So much salt, I felt pruney. The place is expensive but I'm told to go back for the burgers. I'll definitely try again as long as the wait isn't too long.
