The best Indian food in the USA. I love this place and have been frequently eating there for the last 5 years, the consistency of the food is amazing. I was there last week and saw they now offer 100 kinds of stuffed parathas along with 25 different flavors of lassi. To top it all in the end I had kala khatta gola sharbet like Bombay. This place is superb. It's small but super super big on taste. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! If u go on weekends be prepared for long waits.....but once u start eating their food the wait always seems worth it!!
