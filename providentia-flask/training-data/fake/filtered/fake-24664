Michael Schulson Restaurant Sampan is pleasantly fantastic.   My wife & I had dinner & drinks there "5" time's in the last 10 days.  We cannot stop going to this place.  After we initially discovered Sampan, we invited our daughter & her friend, 3 of the 5 nights.  They loved it too. The food there is deliciously ingenious sampling's from around the world, melts in your mouth, orgasmic, every time.  The drink's, are tasty & proper strength.   The service is delivered on time, wonderfully friendly Philly style, with intelligence & a gentle touch.  Make sure to ask for J.D., he's a pro & been working with Michael S. for years, so he knows how to execute the proper delivery of those heavenly table style creations the way they are intended. The manager Michael M. is always watching out to fend off anything that could possibly distract you from pure focus on your dining-drinking experience. We'll be back, with more new customers because this place is fresh, new, exciting & simply ROCK'S.   The environment is cool & creative like no other in its class & then some. The bath rooms are a unique cinematic experience, I'll leave this for you to be surprised by, "they are so much fun!"  You'll see! Dress code is whatever your situation call's for (within reason).   We love eating at an outside table for the additional entertainment value that only 13th street between Walnut & Samson can provide. Cost, is reasonable, with more bang for your buck than its neighbor's.  Bottom line is, this place is a sure thing.  Take it from me; I've tried them all, twice! Addendum to above:  Last night 6/25/11 we dined at, Talula's Garden on Washington Square & wished we would have come back to your Sampan again.  That was our 4th time dinning at Talula's Garden.  After we were finished, we compared everything to your Sampan, top to bottom.  You won, hand's down, we concluded next time we will go with you, not them, even though we live right on the Square.  I'm not kidding.
