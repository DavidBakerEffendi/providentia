I originally tired my first Pho at another place in Morris Plains NJ that I enjoyed. Since I don't live in that area I figured go to a place nearby.Initially saw reviews on this place for Pho so opted for another nearby place which unfortunately was closed for holiday. I decided to ignore the reviews and give this place a try. What a mistake and disappointment. I ordered the P5 beef Pho to go. They only gave me less then 2 oz of beef , little sprouts and a lot of noodle but nowhere near what I had at the other place. My fist Pho place gave a huge portion of beef and sprouts including noodle which tasted better in my opinion. This is my 2nd viet restaurant Â I am trying Pho. This place may have some other items worth trying but I would not recommend this place if you want Pho. Listen to the other reviewers. Wont be going back to this place. Such a shame because its next to an Asian store I frequent and this would have been an added treat for me. All Pho's not created equal.Lesson learned
