I am not sure WHAT dave W. was smoking the night he went here... Sushi Yasuda is worth every cent he charges! Â The sushi and sashimi are the freshest you'll ever get. (unless you are catching your own fish on a boat somewhere and filleting it right there) It is more than just a fantastic sushi meal, it is a moving experience to sit with him, he is a master.
