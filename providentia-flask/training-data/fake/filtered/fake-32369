I love Paulie Gee's.  The interior is beautiful, and the menu takes a classic--New York City pizza-to an unsurpassed next-level.  The staff is awesome about taking care of vegetarian swap-outs, and I love the creativity in toppings offered.  I've never been in and not had a good time and a delicious meal.
