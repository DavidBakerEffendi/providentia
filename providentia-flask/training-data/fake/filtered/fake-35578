I just had dinner their tonight. Figure i'd spoil myself... The burgers are delish! OMG I have been craving to just roll up my sleeves and dive into a great big juicy burger, and bonnie's grill came correct! I love going to park slope to browse around and bonnies grill caught my eye because it always seemed pretty busy. I ventured in there with a burger on my mind and wow was I satisfied. Please Go!
