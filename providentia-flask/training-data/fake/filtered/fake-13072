After seeing so many positive reviews wanted to try their food for long time and finally had a opportunity last friday. It was around 8:30 and there were two tables occupied before us. We were little shocked to see a 7$ price for paratha and ordered it to begin with. It was not worth its price. it  was nt layered as we expected and found it very hard. The entree did not even have one traditional chennai food which was what we came for. we had to send back the mysore masala as it was served very cold. but the waiting straff was kind enough to replace it for us.  The sambar had MTH masala flavor and did not meet our expectations for a vegetarian restaurant. we were little disappointed with over all taste. but the service was very nice. it was also pleasant to see smiling staffs in an indian restaurant.
