This could be the best bar in mid-town Manhattan.  There is more than enough space, a TV in every direction you look and great pub food.  The kitchen is also open late.  If you are there on Sunday, they have every football game.  What's most unbelievable is that they have a skee-ball game.  Who would believe that a bar on 51st street and 11th avenue would be so good?  They have made a believer out of me.
