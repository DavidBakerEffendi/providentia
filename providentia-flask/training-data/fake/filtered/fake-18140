My husband and I have been going for years. We hadn't gone in a few months due to summer vacations and getting our sons ready for college. I wish we never went. 100 BUCKS later and very disappointed. The sangria tasted like flavored water and the Portuguese sausage was served with pickles and was paper thin and dried out. We questioned the waiter and he said we asked for it sliced which we did not. The menu only serves it one way which is flambe. They charged us for the FLAMBE and it was disgusting. We had to send the SANGRIA back and it still TASTED THE SAME ..WATERED DOWN. Â I will NEVER GO BACK Again!
