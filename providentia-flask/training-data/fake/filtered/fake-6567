I just read a Yelp Weekly e-newsletter about great Indian restaurants in the Hartford area, and I was shocked that Royal Masala was not included.  Surely an oversight, I thought.  But I checked the reviews, and sure enough, this restaurant only had three stars.  I've been to dozens (maybe hundreds?) of different Indian restaurants in the northeast and almost every restaurant in Hartford/West Hartford, and while the restaurant is not perfect (yet), it was the freshest and most flavorful Indian food I've ever had.  I thought the three stars was such an injustice that I decided to write a review.  I think this place is a hidden gem in Hartford.
