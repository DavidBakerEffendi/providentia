STAY AWAY, especially if you're Â hungry. Service was so slow that customers, including us, were traipsing up to the counter to inquire about our meals. They even ran out of forks. The "beet" salad had three tiny slices of beets on a bed of limp arugula, for 9 bucks. When our crepes finally did arrive, they weren't really crepes, but a thicker version wrapped around a glob of sweaty, greasy meat. ICK. If we hadn't been so hungry by the time the food came we would have sent it back. A waste of a meal, never to be repeated.
