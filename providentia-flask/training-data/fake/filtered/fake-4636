Salinas is a great restaurant! The staff is extremely nice and helpful. The food is amazing and always fresh like the bacon wrapped quail which is my favorite! Not to mention the beautiful roses everywhere! Don't bother going anywhere else in the neighborhood. Although, if you don't have a reservation and its crowded don't expect to be seated right away. (This is obvious but apparently some of these 1 star reviewers below aren't so aware of how a high class restaurant works.) Management is wonderfully welcoming and always makes sure you are 100% satisfied. The menu is great and it gives you the option to try new things. You could literally close your eyes and point to a dish and be delighted by the fragrant Â tastes of the food at Salinas.
