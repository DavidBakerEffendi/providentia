really good ramen. the vegatarian broth is so delicious you would swear theres some sort of meat because it's so flavorful. the night we went they had soft shell crab bun things and they were slamming. the only draw back is there is usually a wait for a table, but the bar across the street gives you a discount if youre from chuko so theres a convenient place to wait. absolutely stellar otherwise. highly recommend.
