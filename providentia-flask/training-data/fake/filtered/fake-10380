Pathetic service and rude staff. I am not sure from where you people get the staff member here, but surely not worth a penny.... With my first and last experience with ur restaurant, i will make sure that not even me but also i would refrain my friends to visit this place.... On first point the food was horrible. I am not sure why you ppl says its authentic food. But on the off chances i can manage to go with the bad taste food. But when you insult your customers that clearly shows your mindset. Let me remind you one thing which you have clearly forgotten, Customer can have the different opinion about your food but that will not give you any right to insult them in public. Trust me i don't need you confirmation that if i have every tasted the same food earlier or not or from where i am coming from? Hope you understand this seriousness of the situation here. You people are really pathetic not just the food.
