I'm going to join the three-star crowd on this one. The best thing that I really can say about it is that it's in a great location, and is a nice spot to meet with business associates. By that, I mean clean, quiet and neither too casual or too fancy. The food is really just okay. I've been there a handful of times, and haven't tried anything that I've raved about, but nothing that has been bad, either. The tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwich is always a good choice, and so is the build-your-own salad, which always seems really fresh. Nothing to write home about, but you're going to get a decent meal for a decent price.
