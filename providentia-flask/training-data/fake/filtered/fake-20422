Went with 7 friend from all different countries myself and husband were only New York locals and our 11 month old son.  They made no accommodations for feeding a baby even when we asked simply for some fruit.  Finally we were charged $8 for a few strawberries.   After running up happily a $230 tab in only an hour we all decided we were still hungry.  My husband even asked for a side salad - they brought him some chopped veggies - then when he asked where the lettuce was the waitress was confused - even though there was a $6 arugula side salad on the menu.   She brought him the greek salad which we did not know was a full entree $12 nor could anyone easily tell by the small size.  Listen, the food is good but overpriced for the portions and the waitresses were continually confused about thinking outside the menu.   When I mentioned she charged wrong for the side salad the waitress argued with me - then came to tell us she adjusted the price but never brought back the change!  So, did she adjust the price then add the difference to her tip?!?!!!   Had to go back in and make sure the bill was all settled correctly when the owner overheard me and said - what you want your $5 back here - and handed me $5 like a flippant donkey hole.   I just told him we are never coming back and left - dude it was $6 not $5!  But didn't have the time or energy to argue with a guy who in 10 seconds showed me he was a complete prick.  Go to SoHo market around the corner - more food good quality delicious and priced right.  This review approved by two NYers an Australian, German, Finn, Persian and Turk.
