Sadly I've seen the demise of this place, it started off like a really genuine Irish place, where you could grab a Guinness and a delicious burger. Now however you are met with bouncers questioning your intentions and a selective crowd that strikes you as borderline sad with a side of douche. It used to be one of my favorite spots in Astoria.  Now however, Sweet Afton strikes me as a place on the downward  that is intentionally too overpriced  for me to even have the energy to defend. It's always sad to see a dying star, and for this one, the Lannisters won't even send their regards...
