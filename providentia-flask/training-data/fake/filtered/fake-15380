avocado fries. i just love saying it, man, avocado fries. i had heard a lot about them, and i had also heard that the service here wasn't very good. both things were true and bad service can be a bummer but at least the food was amazing. i mean, you go to a restaurant to eat with your friends, not to make new friends. my friend had the lobster tacos and said they were real good but i was too stuffed to even try any. totally satisfying meal.
