My dinner experience here was amazing from the moment we walked in until the moment we walked out. The service was absolutely perfect. We had different staff members providing us with our drinks and food. I ordered the Roaring 40s Blue Cheese appetizer which was delicious! No one else at our table ordered an appetizer so the waiter told us the chef did not like having anyone eat alone and brought out one appetizer for each person. I thought that was generous of them. They kept the drinks coming and even checked with us to make sure we were ok to drive.  When our entrees came they were nothing short of perfect. We had the scallops and crispy sea bass.  The desserts were wonderful as well. I had a great birthday dinner here and would return for another special occasion. I also enjoyed the intimate ambiance here. There aren't many tables so it is a quiet and relaxing experience. The views were also something to enjoy. I recommend this place to anyone looking to enjoy a different dining experience!
