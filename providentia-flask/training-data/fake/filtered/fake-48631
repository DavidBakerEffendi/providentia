I've been here many times and the Empanadas are excellent. However this time I went a received the wrong order. When I called to tell them the order was wrong the guy who answered said I'm sorry we were really busy tonight. For a place that busy everyday and every night that is a terrible reason. When I asked to speak to a manager he said the manager said to come into the store. Good thing the food is good considering the customer service is appalling.
