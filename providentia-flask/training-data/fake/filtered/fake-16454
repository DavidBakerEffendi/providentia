Best halal cart I have ever been to and they have the "Vendy Award" to prove it. They are super nice and efficient when taking orders. I don't know if it's a bad thing that they always remember me. I think I eat here too much, but it's just so good. Schwarma, Falafel, Chicken w/ Yellow Rice. These are all things you must try from here. The hot sauce is very hot, so I recommend getting some of the vegetables on the pita or plate to cool down. The "white" sauce is also a must. Everything seems to be freshly made every day. The price is right. You should be paying more for the quality and how authentic the food is. That chicken is made with LOVE!
