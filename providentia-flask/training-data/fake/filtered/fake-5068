We are a happy  Dosaiplace's Catering Customer. They catered  breakfast and lunch for our son's Upanayanam in Guruvayurappan temple. We needed a  Vegetarian, no-onion, no-garlic and authentic andhra food. We added a few kid-friendly and non-andhra items as well  but requested  strictly no onion and garlic including a Paneer butter masala. We needed breakfast and lunch to be delivered at the venue. Our extended family that even came in from different states, and woke up like 3 AM enjoyed the hearty breakfast by 7 AM at the Venue -  Idli-Vada-Filter Coffee with Sambar and 2-3 chutneys. Lunch with 2 appetizers was also delivered and organized by 11.30 AM . We picked a typical Andhra menu of punugulu, gutti vankaya, palakura pappu, mukkala pulusu, pulihara, purnam boorelu among other things and they were excellent. Each item was authentic and really like perfect home-made.  I did not know 'no-onion' version exists and didn't realize no onion appetizers tasted so good !!. They  worked with us closely on the menu, numbers and all arrangements,  were patient with us as we took many sessions to finalize and even provided us a checklist for non-food items required at the venue for serving lunch. Going with Dosai Place turned out to be a good decision for us. We are planning to try their signature Dosa buffet next time. They come with the Dosa Grill to the venue to make 10+  dosa varieties to order.
