I've lived in Osaka and Tokyo for a few years, so my taste for Japanese food has been very discerning when it comes to Japanese food in the US. The atmosphere and service are top notch, and the food is pretty delicious! Some better than others, especially the ika goro which is probably one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten before. I had to order it twice, and almost ordered it a 3rd time. ;) The Sapporo draft beer was very creamy as well, which is something I really missed about drinking beer in Japan. Will definitely be coming back here again.
