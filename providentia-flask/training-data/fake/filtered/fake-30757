BIG DISHES. NO FOOD. PREMIUM PAY. Seriously, I hate all these classy restaurants with no food on the plates and each dish cost around $30 (+-$10). My first impression was - WoW... Very nice and lovely. Service is very professional, but... I left the place hungry, so as my friend who came to visit me from California. We spent about $175 and left the place hungry. So if you got a thick wallet and you are on a very restricted diet - this place is fo you. However, I should mention that there is a bar/lounge on the first floor (below the Ai Fiori) - FANTASTIC... and they serve food too(stakes hamburgers, etc). I didn't try the food, because we already had a few pieces of complementary desert at Ai Fiori, but me and My friend ordered a chocolate sampler for like $9... wow... worth every penny. So if you want to sit down somewhere nice I'd recommend downstairs place rather than Ai Fiori (upstairs)... (the downstairs place also have nice live music, not sure which days though). So the bottom line is - Ai Fiori Sucks, just as any of those classy bs-places where they serve no food on the plates and charge you premium.
