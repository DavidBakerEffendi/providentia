Amazing Brunch, high quality food, beautiful presentation. This place is a hidden gem along the west side highway in the meatpacking district. Friendly service also. The eggs benedict was stellar, the ricotta pancakes creatively presented and quite tasty (with real maple syrup) and the asiago truffle omelette is a must. Seriously this place is a standout for brunch.
