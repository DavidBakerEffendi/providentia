Worst place to get South Indian food!!! I went here for Thursday night Dosa special. It was pricy and the food including dosas tasted like mud. No idlis...wow! I complained to the owner but he was very defensive about their preparation and not at all customer caring. Please don't go here to waste your money....better make dosa at home.
