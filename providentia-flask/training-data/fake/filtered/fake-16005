Was looking forward to try this place out and finally went. I was so disappointed w the quality of food. Had Borsh and it was horrible, beef stroganoff were just ok. My husband ordered chicken katlety that were served uncooked!!! We had to send it back. At the end of the evening we both end up w Stomach ache, def not going back there. However the service was good, all the stuff was very nice and respectful. Too bad the quality of the food did not match the friendly stuff.
