We spent a lovely morning touring the Grounds for Sculpture before heading over to Rat's for lunch yesterday (Sunday.).  A reservation was made in advance for our party of four for brunch, but when we arrived, we were given the option of having lunch instead.  There was no wait, but we were there early.  We were seated in the bar area, near the windows overlooking the patio and the pond beyond.  This room has an exotic theme - almost Disney-esque. Our waiter, Hector, took very good care of us.  We started our meal with Bloody Marys - three different kinds.  All were delicious.  We then shared the Mezze platter appetizer.  It featured hummus, eggplant caponata, a cheesy spread, and assorted olives with their crispy flat bread.  All the items were yummy, but especially the  eggplant caponata!  We were also served a basket of crusty bread with a seasoned butter for spreading. We went with lighter entrees - shrimp on a salad bed, hamburger, turkey sandwich, and pastrami sandwich.  All were very good and just the right size.   For dessert we ordered the fancy flavored ice creams and the cream cheese mousse.  Loved them all!! The prices seamed reasonable for what we had and I'll definitely return.
