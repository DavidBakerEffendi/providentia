The food: They could use some vegan options. Maybe some hummus for the bagel? Something besides a salad? The beer: Amazing selection. The price seems to be as expected. If I could have eaten something while I was there I would have given 5 stars but that's currently not very appealing. Everything else: The staff, decor, atmosphere, fireplace, are all wonderful and I'll definitely be there a couple times a week to stock up.
