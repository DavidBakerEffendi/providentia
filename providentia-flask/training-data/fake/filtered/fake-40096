The way people talk about this place you would think it's the best pizza on the face of the planet.   No doubt it's better than average pizza, but because of the long wait, I think people are so incredibly starved that it tastes like the best pizza on the planet.  You know what they say, feed em late tastes great.  In other words, the longer you wait the better it tastes.  I've eaten here a handful of times so my one complaint about the pizza itself is that the guy uses TOO MUCH OLIVE OIL.  I wish I had the kahunas to tell him to throw away that oil can.
