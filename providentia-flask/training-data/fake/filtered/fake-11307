We went to Eataly on Sunday afternoon. It was really crowded with lots of tourists. We got anchovies, fresh mozzarella together with wine at the wine bar close to the fresh produce market. The food was great and wine was what we were looking for. It felt like stopping at a wine bar in Italy. We enjoyed it very much and will be back soon!
