As there are other, extended reviews already explaining the refreshingly unique restaurant concept, I will not waste your time again. Â  What I can add is that the chefs rotate duty schedules, so people like me who tend to go out on particular nights will have a new experience each time. Our meal last Saturday was unbelievable, and Joe's wine recommendations elevated the already delicious food. This might have been the best meal I enjoyed in a very long time. Great food, tremendously full wines, good prices and a staff truly making it a memorable visit. Even though I was stuffed, I couldn't resist asking for an order of white bean and sausage soup to go (for lunch the next day). I drove, but next time I will probably take the ferry (its only a short walk). Maybe because it is in SI. a restaurant like this can exist unspoiled, because if it were anywhere else it would be too successful to survive intact. This place is absolutely tremendous.
