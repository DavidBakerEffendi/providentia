ive frequented this joint a number of times over the last cpl of years... was happily surprised to see that they had  done renovations.. and it looks really cool and hip again!!  Were told the wait for a table would be roughly 30 mins .... and it was packed .. and even tho we were told to have a seat at the bar whilst we waited for our table.... there was no room at the bar... and it took awhile to get thru the crowds and actually get our drinks from the bar ... so this kinda put me into a mood to begin i have to admit that im usually a really polite customer to my waiter.. but by the time we actualyy got to our table it was a good 45mins later ... and i was starving and not in the best mood from the wait!!   My waiter... this south african guy.... think his name was gaddy.... was terrific... totally made me and my girl feel comfortable.. was friendly.. polished and professional... and from word go... got me out of my funked out mood and reminded me why i came here in the first place... excellent food .. excellent service.. cool hip energy!! his recommendations were perfect for us... dates.... absolutly amazing.... mac attack.. crazy crazy good..... fried chicken and waffles.... so damn good!!!  also the wildberry mojito ... was fantastic.!! the price at end was totally reasonable.. and it made me think why i hadnt been here for awhile since my last visit... overall... i had a really good time there.. and will definitly recommend cafeteria to all...
