I have been to Caseus a few times, and I am definitely a fan.   I love the atmosphere, and the cheese.  The food has always been great and the staff is super friendly. I must admit, the service is inconsistent at times, but it doesn't really bother me all that much.  I like the laid back atmosphere and really enjoy the food...they have an unbelievable fresh mozz salad (i think it is only on Wednesdays, though)...I will be going back, probably this weekend....
