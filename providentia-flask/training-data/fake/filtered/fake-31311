My friends told me numerous time about this place, but I always had doubt about the buffet because I had peanut butter allergic. Last week I was in the area running errors and though give it a try. I was really impresses how clean n neat this restaurant.  The place is not only huge but offers a great variety of not only traditional Chinese food, but American and huge selection of sushi.  The atmosphere was nice, they have a unique water fall at the front.  The staff was very attentive and polite, especially the manager.  She was very patient and took time went over each food ingredients Contained the peanut butter.  I loved the hibachi grill ( no extra charge), you get to pick your own vegetables ,meats and sauce, they cook in front of you, n take it back to your table, the way this is good for picky eater or vegetarian. They have fresh fruit, 8 different kind of ice cream, cake and apple turnover.  I definitely will recommend this buffet to everyone.  You can't beat the enormous selection of food they offer for the price of $6.99. A hamburger cost you more than that.
