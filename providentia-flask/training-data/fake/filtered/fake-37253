Prepare to be nickle and dimed. It's an all-right place to eat for the ambiance & food. But just one change or special request will result in extra charges. I mean really - charging extra for bread, especially when it's taken over an hour for the food to come out? And then to be ignored by the staff and management? Â Save your mood/money and find another place to eat...there are so many good ones in Montclair. If it's Peruvian you're after, there are so many other more authentic options around the area that this place just isn't worth it.
