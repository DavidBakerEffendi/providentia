The staff = fantastic The food = fantastic Sarah and Ora were amazing and incredibly knowledgable about the menu and the food selection that I had (crescent duck). This place is a local gem with the flavor and sas of Bloomfield. You can sit down and grab your favorite drink or order from a menu filled with unique and colorful blends of tastes and styles. I haven't had everything on the menu but I've had plenty and not one dish has let me down. You can't go wrong stopping In.
