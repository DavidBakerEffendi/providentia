This place is amazing! I have a number of food sensitivities, but with a gluten free, organic menu, I was actually able to eat food (that's delicious!) that didn't make me sick. Even the day after, I feel great! Had one of the salads...and it was so much more than a salad. Very filling and full of flavor. I would recommend this place to everyone I know, no question! Very affordable, but very high quality ingredients. Will gladly eat here again and hopefully bring some friends!
