We ordered a panini and a vegetarian sandwich and both were completely different than what the menu said they were. The vegetarian sandwich was supposed to come with fresh mozzerella cheese, roasted red peppers, lettuce, tomato, onion, and avocado. I asked for them to leave off just the peppers, however, they also left off the cheese, and onions and added on artichoke hearts. Â The panini came as a wrap and was basically just grilled chicken in a wrap, even though it also was supposed to have some other vegetables. The guy basically just made our sandwiches wrong.
