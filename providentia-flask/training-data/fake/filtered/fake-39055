I've been frequenting Ri Ra's since the day it opened on St. Patty's day 10 years ago, in that 10 years, I have NEVER had a bad experience at this pub. The moment I step in there I instantly relax, I don't know if it's all the woodwork and old Europe feel or the fact that they make great snakebites (Harp and Mangers) but I go there specifically to destress! Now that said there are some things to look out for. Service can be slow, this can be countered by staying on the waitstaff, or sitting at the bar. I see some other people have gotten rude service, never happened to me in 10 years, but if it did, speak to Mike or Adam and I'm sure it would be rectified. Food has always been delicious! Go with the Shepherds Pie, you will not be disappointed. I see there was a complaint about the Irish Soda Bread from another reviewer, personally I've yet to have a piece of ISB that is good anywhere on the planet, but that's just my opinion of ISB yuck, who wants bread without the little yeastie buggers making it fluffy! One small point on Ri Ra's is that it can be pricey for the booze, expect to pay about $4.00 to $5.00 a pint. If you don't want the college crowd don't go on Saturday night. If you want awesome fun and prizes go on Tuesday for the Pub Quiz!
