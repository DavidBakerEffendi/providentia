I usually make my own dumplings at home, but when I cannot be bothered, I come here. They are not the best dumplings, but very good for the price. I'd prefer the fried ones to be more like pot stickers. The pork and chive filling is tasty, but the skin is a bit soggy (I love crispy and chewy). If I bring them home, I always put them on a skillet for a couple of minutes to crisp before eating. My favorite item on the menu though is the sesame pancake. It can rival any street cart or night market stall in Asia. It's perfectly fluffy in the middle and crispy on the outside. The fragrance is intoxicating. I usually buy a couple to freeze at home for a quick sandwich (omelette with green onions is very good). Slice one in half lengthwise, a few minutes on the skillet each side, and stuff it with anything you fancy. 3.5 stars for dumplings, 5 stars for sesame pancake..so 4 stars it is.
