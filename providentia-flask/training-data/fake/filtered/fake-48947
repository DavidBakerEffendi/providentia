CHINESE anything NEVER  HAS AND LIKELY NEVER WILL HAVE GOOD SERVICE. THE FOOD, EVERYTHING IS OUTSTANDING. that being said, the staff is and has been for me on the last ten visits over 2012 been not great for service as many review reads because there is a severe language problem and no noticeable lack of effort. there is an outstanding, extremely nice and well above and beyond older woman that runs the floor and if you give them an honest shot, you will be amazed every time. We  especially love sesame chicken, steak and peppers, anything duck, and Dan Dan noodles. The duck is about as good as the fine dining in new haven and new york. Be advised, as I have read and learned - many reviews you will read compare this wonderful place to the small frozen food fried Chinese place on the corner. you will get fine food, steak, outstanding duck, and fresh noodles, all wonderfully cooked at a reasonable price. Many of the reviews I have seen are far too unfair and seem to be written by fast food Chinese lovers. Albeit there are very few employees that can converse well in English, let alone converse on similar items on the menu or discuss the fresh oyster dinners.. it gives the slight impression of traveling in your hometown, a plus. ladies and gentlemen, this place is an absolute must try as polarizing as it is as far as Internet reviews. There is nothing about this place that will is what you get on your average corner Chinese place and they rightfully pride themselves on that.
