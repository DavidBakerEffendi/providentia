Just had a great meal at Union League. Paid the 400 bill and then was asked to leave by the manager. I have never been asked to leave a restaurant in my life. The manager had no customer service skills. We thought he was coming over to ask how our meal was but instead just said you need to leave now. My family thought it would be a great surprise for my Birthday but instead it left me with a big disappointment. I will never waste another dollar in your establishment again. I am absolutely appalled. Thank you for ruining my Birthday..
