I grew up in San Diego, so I'd like to think I know a thing or 2 about Mexican food! Nothing on the east coast can compare to SD or Texas Mex, but Los Tacos is pretty dang amazing. I had the cactus taco and chicken. So Yumm. Their drinks are pretty amazing too. I was stoked to see Tamarindo Â (water infused with tamarind), a San Diego taco shack staple.
