Trattoria Tre Colori,I'm Â from NJ and dine there 2-3 timse a year.Linguine Nere alla Monsignore is my favorite of many delicious dishes. I always walk in with an empty stomach because I know that it'll be filled by the end of the course,the bread is rustic and crunchy ,the mixed olives are very tasty,we had Calamari Fritti with strips of Zucchini and Jalapenos, Calamaris were so tender. The Wine list is a mile long. You cannot find food so delicious 1/2 block from Time Square with a very reasonable price. Thanks Phil and Staff for making our dining experience so warm and welcomed.
