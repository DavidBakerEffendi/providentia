Overcrowded. Overpriced, Overhyped. We had a truly annoying experience at OM. Crammed into a communal table without even an inch to spare between us and other diners, we were forced to literally shout at one another all night. The noise level was unbelievable, and not helped by the soundtrack of 80's pop. While the food was most often delicious (polpettine, tagliatelle with ragu and branzino were the standouts), it wasn't enough to make us want to come back. The waiter was overwhelmed, service was therefore crappy and for the amount of money we paid, we didn't have a good enough time. Sorry, but there's equally good Italian fare to have in other places, without the general obnoxious vibe of this overrated restaurant.
