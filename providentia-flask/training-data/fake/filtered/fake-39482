Let's start with the positives.  The water was cold.  The place had air conditioning.  The portions were generous Ok, now for the negatives. 1) the host / owner was rude as Chelsea Handler in the morning.  What a great way to start your evening!!!!  Having some rude Asian American guy throw your menus on the table and grunt. 2) The food.  If you liked your meats and seafood cooked with tons of salt and soy sauce then this is the place for you.   The same could be said for the fried rice and noodles.  It's as if the whole plate was doused with soy sauce. 3) The hibachi chef.  Remember Seinfeld and the soup nazi, well, this guy was pretty similiar, "no service for you!!!".  Honestly, if you're in a rush and want all your food prepared in 5 minutes, then this is the place for you.  If you're a normal human being and want your food prepared and presented over a normal time frame (and NOT FORCED TO EAT YOUR FOOD COLD), then avoid this place. 4) Ambience.  This place opened in the 80s.  It's pretty clear that not a dollar of profit has been spent to upgrade this place over the past 30 years.  If you like dark places that feel like a cave then you'll love Shogun. 5)  Price.  For this much pleasure price should not be a consideration. AVOID This place at all costs, please.
