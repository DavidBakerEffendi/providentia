I was looking forward to trying Pat's King of Steaks. I have to say they were very very rude including the manager.  Money is the focus,not customer service or cleanliness. Food safety is not their priority. I witnessed the person collecting the money, making change and handling the sandwiches.  This person, after collecting your dollars  and using the register, actually picks up your sandwich with his hands, adds cheese to it and then rolls the sandwich in a wrapper and hands it to you. One hand had a glove on it, but that was pointless because the gloved hand touched the money register and food.  When I politely asked if the person next to him can wrap my sandwich. He rudely told me,  We've been doing it like this for forty years and he was not going to do it differently".He then told me to step aside. He didn't see anything wrong with touching/handling money and then touching the food.  The manager came out and had the worst attitude, and agreed, "We have been doing it like this forty years, and your the only one complaining".  The manager was arrogant and rude.  Pat's King of Steaks didn't deserve my business.   Further, I heard people complaining that the food isn't worth the trip. It's a lot of hype.  The bread tough and chewy and the steak greasy and of poor quality.  NOT WORTH IT!..........THIS IS A MISTEAK!  Pat's King of Steaks' food practices, and lack df hygiene when dealing with the food, can cause food born illnesses. They are directly and knowingly introducing dangerous bacterias to the food they serve.
