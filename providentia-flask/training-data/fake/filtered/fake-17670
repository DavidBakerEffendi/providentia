My family enjoyed a nice meal and birthday celebration at the Tap House.  All of the staff was friendly and helpful from host to waitstaff.  We had great beers, a fine Malbec, appetizers, salad and pizza.  Everything was d-lish!  We usually hit Church Street but it was refreshing to have service without the hipster attitude.
