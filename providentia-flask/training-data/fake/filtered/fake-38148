I came here after I found out a friend of mine just started working here, I never heard of the place before and decided to drag my girlfriend and best friend with me to check it out this past Thursday. The spot is very nice, def has that hipster vibe to it without being snobby or pretentious. We sat at the bar and were nicely greeted by ZACK. I ordered the cheddar and mozz with tomato soup and it was awesome, it wasn't greasy at all, nicely toasted and cheese melted to perfection, the tomato soup was also very tasty. For drinks I tried a beer called "YIN" it was 10% alcohol and I was buzzed off that one bottle, i'll describe it as the espresso of beers. My company ordered THE GRUYERE and GOUDA, i tried them and they were both great, although the ingredients look odd trust me it's all delicious. I also ordered some coffee, I forget which it was exactly but once you taste the coffee here you won't want it from anywhere else. I took away one star because the beer is way too expensive, I understand this place has beer that you can't find in stores but Â $14 for one beer is kinda steep and I'm not cheap, other than that the staff was great, music they play is great, it's very clean, food is awesome and I'll def will be going back. ZACK was very helpful and informative on all the questions we had about the beer and coffee.
