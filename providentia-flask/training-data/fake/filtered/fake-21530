Olivier, the owner of this establishment is a friend of the family so recently while visiting my brother in NJ we wanted to show our support and drove the hour (without traffic) to have dinner at Olivier Bistro. I am a culinary trained cook with a huge passion for well prepared, fresh and delicious cuisine. OK, I know what you are thinking, we're friends...I would not write a review if in any way this fell short of our expectations and can easily say we would be regulars if we didn't live 4 hours away. Absolutely loved the authentic casual French bistro experience from the warm ambience, the friendly, attentive service to the well thought out and perfectly executed menu...LOVED everything! you must go!!!
