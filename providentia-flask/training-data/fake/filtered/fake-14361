This has been my absolute favorite Italian restaurant I  had the pleasure to dine in!  Believe me, I have dined in many !  Love the small town personal atmosphere and service is excellent!  My always favorite is clams in white wine sauce, homemade manicotti with the best tomato sauce, and for dessert, their apple pie!  It sometimes is a challenge getting there due to the traffic, but well worth the effort!  Only request I still keep asking for, is Please, Please rehang that beautiful oil painting you always had over our favorite booth! First thing you see when you walk in the door! Sunflowers, blue sky! Gorgeous and so authentic/heart warming!
