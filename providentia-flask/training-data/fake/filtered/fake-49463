I love El Vez! During the warmer months, it is an excellent area to sit outside and enjoy a few drinks/people watch! Or, sit inside and enjoy the wonderfully eclectic decor. They have really really good drinks, not to mention amazing food. It is reasonably priced for what you get. I really miss their surf and turf tacos, and it would be a shame if they don't bring them back to their menu. I will be returning to El Vez probably about twice a year, only because I want to try out new places. This is a really great spot and I recommend everyone who is visiting Philly to come here!
