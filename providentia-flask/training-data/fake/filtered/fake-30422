My fiance and I ate there last night, and had a wonderful meal. The bread came in 4 varieties, 2 rolls and 2 scones, w/ 2 kinds of butter, herbed, and maple cinnamon, all very good. Then came the best salad I've ever had, the endive w/ blood oranges. Not at all what I expect a salad to look like, this plate was beautiful, and the taste combinations were just so good. For my entree, I had the housemade ravioli w/ a very unique and delicious citrus cream sauce. My fiance had the skirt steak, which was very flavorful, his only complaint was he would have liked more of the sauce. We ended our meal w/ the chef's special chocolate creation, a dense, flourless wonder we both loved. The service was good, our waitress was helpful, and funny. It was great to have a restaurant w/ such interesting selections not take itself too seriously. We definitely will be going there again soon!
