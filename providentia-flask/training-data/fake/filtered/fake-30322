Infini-T has become a weekly breakfast destination for my family.  It's the only place in town where all of our culinary needs are met:  non-dairy milk teas and coffees, gluten free toast, delicious eggs and sandwiches and my son's favorite, chocolate cupcakes!   Mary and her staff are warm, friendly, and competent- we look forward to seeing them and are always well cared for.  They are especially lovely to our young son, and it has become his favorite spot.   I recommend for family weekend breakfast, getting together with friends, or just decompressing during some blissful alone time.
