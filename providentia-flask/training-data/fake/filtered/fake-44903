Emporio is perfect.  The decor is rustic and warm and the staff friendly, professional and attentive.  The food is always high quality and completely delicious!!!  The wine list also has a great selection at a range of prices.  The thing I love is you can come here and enjoy lots of little plates to share with friends or have a well-prepared and well-priced meal with appetizers, pasta course and entrees - it just depends on what you are in the mood for.  Did I mention the deserts?!!!!  We had the chocolate ganash and lemon tart (both recommended by our waitress) and thought about going back the next day just to try them again.  All around a great dining experience.  Thanks!
