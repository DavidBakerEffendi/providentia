It is hard to get reservations here and the tables are cramped in a small space but there is a reason for that.  The food and service is wonderful. We loved ordering various plates and sharing so that we had a taste of everything. We started off with the creamiest sheep milk's ricotta and the toasted bread was awesome to go with it. The gnocchi were so light and probably the best I ever had.  But the best part of the meal might have been the salted caramel budino. It was so good that I sometimes dream about it.
