The most snooty place ever!! I had a reservation for 6. Â My part of four arrived five minutes ahead of time. We were not seated and left at 6.25. I kept saying to the hostess that we had made film plans for 8 and that is why I had requested this reservation for 6. Above all, my problem was the snooty way in which talked to me, finally offering us seats at the Chef's table. She also said, at 6.20, "OH we have you down for 6,30" which was ridiculous because when I first came in she said the table would be ready in a few minutes. There are plenty of fantastic and less uppity places in Philadelphia to dine in!
