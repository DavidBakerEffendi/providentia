We came here with friends for brunch on a cold Sunday afternoon. Surprisingly, it wasnt packed, which was a great thing for us. We had amazing service, all our requests were delivered very fast and with smile. Food was really good. We have been to a lot of brunches in the area and I though that selection was great and food was delicious for just $13.50. I think it will become our new favourite brunch spot, very cozy atmosphere!
