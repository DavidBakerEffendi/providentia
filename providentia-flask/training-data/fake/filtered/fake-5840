Eno Terr ible!!  Wear your hiking boots and bring a flashlight because if the parking lot is full, you'll have to park literally in the park and cross two lanes of Rt. 27., it;s quite a feat in the dark.  Although they claim Valet Parking, it was not available. I've had better service at a diner. Our waiter didn't know how the bass was prepared.  No one ever came back to check if our water glassess needing refilling. My  "roasted" zucchini tasted like frozen that had been defrosted and served cold. I was looking forward to some deliciously roasted zuchinni and was terribly disappointed. I think I'll stick to the Blue Bottle Cafe. Eno Terr ible was not worth the price although the building was lovely and had a nice ambiance, it was not worth the price.
