The food is amazing but the waitresses and the ladies in the reception area are extremely rude. If you don't make reservations they always lie about the wait time. Last weekend my husband and I were waiting up front for 45 min, which is quite a difference from the "10 min wait" we were told it would be. We heard the lady tell 4 different parties that it would only be 10 min and that the table was currently on dessert. I dont mind waiting 45 min but be HONEST about waiting times because otherwise people get aggravated and walk out. Oh yes and BYOB which is great. The only reason we go back is because the food is amazing. Definitely recommend making reservations and minimizing your time with the reception ladies. The waitresses are rude and the bus boys end up bringing your bread and water out after asking the waitress repeatedly. Oh and don't go too late.. The front staff will come hassle you about closing out your bill while you're still finishing dinner and wine. God forbid you want dessert because they are obviously ready to go home.
