I had lived in Philly for a year prior to my visit to Porcini and frequented many restaurants with my boyfriend.  I had brought him to Porcini's for his very recent birthday and let's just say at the end of our meal his exact words were "This is the best restaurant we have eaten at in Philadelphia", and I strongly agreed.  Not only was the food amazing, the service was too.  My veal dish literally melted in my mouth and we found ourselves licking the plate clean from his ravioli dish.  The appetizers were the perfect portion, just enough to not feel stuffed and wanting more.  One stickler for me though, is the bread, which was not the greatest but I have def. had worse.  Although some would complain the restaurant was very small, to me it almost made the experience more intimate, as if we were eating at the chef's house, who by the way frequently came out to talk to his guests which was icing on the cake for me.  All in all it was a great experience and I was happy my boyfriend was pleased with his birthday meal.  Job well done Porcini.  We will be back and with friends!
