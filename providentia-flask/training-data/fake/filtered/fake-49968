RIPPERS is the proper term for the deep fried hot dogs served here.  If you have ever tried frying a hot dog, you'll understand why they are called RIPPERS.  Heck, throw a few in a microwave and the hot dog will "rip" too, but you won't get the same crunchy taste as a deep fried dog. Anyway, this is a classic Jersey joint.  The guys that work behind the counter are quite the "Jersey" characters, always angry and yelling.  It's what you expect out of a true jersey boy...attitude and straight to the point.  If you ask them for "sauerkraut"....they'll "politely" say..."We don't do kraut!"  Do yourself a favor, don't ask for "kraut"! ORDERING: When I order, I always ask for "RIPPERS".  I never refer to them as "hot dogs."  By asking for "RIPPERS", you are requesting for hot dogs that are ripping through the skin.  Remember, the more rips on a dog, the tastier it is. WHAT TO EAT: Aside from their RIPPERS, I have to say Rutts Hutt has one of the best onion-rings around. These rings are not heavily breaded, but they are delicious and taste better with less breading.  I wonder if they are fried in the same oil as the hot dogs.  If so, then that explains why they are so tasty. FINAL SUGGESTIONS: - Order the dogs as "RIPPERS" - Try the chili.  If your order your RIPPER with cheese, you can throw some chili on top.  You won't be dissappointed, it's simply the best combination. - TRY THE YELLOW RELISH.  It may look weird, but it tastes amazing.  Note, you have to add the condiments yourself.  The guys behind the counter will not do this for you, so don't bother asking. - Onion Rings - Lastly, only have 2-4 hot dogs at a time, or else you'll be RIPPING a few later =)  Actually, you have to remember these are deep fried dogs and definitely not the healthiest snack.  Staying within the 2-4 range is my magic number for staying "healthy".  It's just a suggestion, but normally after 4 I'm pretty full. - Josh
