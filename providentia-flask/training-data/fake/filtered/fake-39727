Drove to the Garden from Unionville,Chester County for dinner Christmas week with a party of 4 after many visits to Talula`s Table in Kennett Square.I have been to many resturants in various cities but none can compare to this overall experiance. Aimee Olexy(the owner)exceeded my expectations by giving us an experiance that made for an enchanted evening in a city I love.Great food,service,ambiance and Aimee`s magical touch gave a holistic approach to dining that was a treat for the mind as well as the taste buds.It has become obvious to me that not only are Aimee`s creative and culinary skills manifested in Her establishments but maybe most importantly Her Heart.I wish Her continued and well deserved success.If it can be said that life is nothing more than a series of experiances then this was one of the best.Way to go Aimee and many thanks.Still digesting and already looking forward to a return visit.Would like to try brunch next!!!!!!!
