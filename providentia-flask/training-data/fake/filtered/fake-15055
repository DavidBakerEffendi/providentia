High prices, poor quality Told the bride I wanted to go local for a steak for my Birthday. I decided on Buds Hut in Avenel. BIG MISTAKE!! $9.50 manhattan made with cheap bourbon, $10.00 shrimp scampi appitizer with 4 shrimp! They looked lost in the skillet. It was however, the tastiest thing I had. My cajun delmonico (ordered medium) came out cooked about 5 minutes past well, with a baked potato not even warm enough to melt the butter (not joking). She got a fish platter with 2 scallops, a hand full of VERY fishy (and sandy) Raritan Bay clams and a filet of flounder she didn't try because the rest was so bad. NEVER AGAIN
