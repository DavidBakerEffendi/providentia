Horrible service. Went to Geronimo for dinner and drinks on a Saturday night with my wife. We sat for 45 minutes waiting for drinks we had ordered while we saw our waitress casually chatting with another table and her co-workers.  After dinner, we waited for another 45 minutes for our waitress to take our check. No apology was forthcoming. Food was average, and drinks were tasty but overpriced for the area.  We won't return.
