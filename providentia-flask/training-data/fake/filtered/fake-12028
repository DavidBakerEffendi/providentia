The Upper West Side has a serious lack of cool, fun, tasty places to go hang out. Thankfully, Jacobs pickle tackles this problem head on. A wide selection of craft beer and interesting pickled items make for a great laid back night of drinking and snacking. Also, an inventive and fun cocktail list (spicy habenero brine margarita!) keeps me interested even when I'm in the mood for something sleeker and stronger. The place itself has a great design, with a storefront that opens up fully, community table in front, and farm inspired decor. Service has always been up to par here as well. They lose the 5th start due to consistency issues. A number of the times i have been, they have been out of stock on certain beers. In addition, the pickles are not always consistent. Sometimes crunchier than other times, sometimes spicier, sometimes sweeter. Overall, an excellent addition to the UWS, and i love anywhere that pays homage to American Craft brews in as big and a fun way as Jacobs Pickle does. .
