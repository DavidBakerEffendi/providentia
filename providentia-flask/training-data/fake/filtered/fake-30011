Lousy food , noisy ambience. Having had really good experience from Somerville restaurant I was waiting for this branch to open. But I'm horribly disappointed. I ordered roomali roti n muglai chicken. The roti looked like a frozen tortilla n it smelled exactly the same. Food doesn't look anywhere near to fresh. By the way this place is quite expensive if it is meant to be a fast food joint. For an extra few dollars in Princeton I could get tasty food n better service n clean place.
