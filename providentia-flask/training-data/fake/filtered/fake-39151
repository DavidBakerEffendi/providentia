Just ate a burger from there about 15 minutes ago. Had the 500 burger, ordered it medium. Got home and was about to take a bite and I look at the patty and the thing is pretty much raw. Now I can understand it being a bit undercooked but this thing was no where near medium. Very disappointing. Had to cook it up and dirty a pan at home. Didn't taste any seasonings. Had the truffle fries as well. While the flavor was great but there was nothing but beat up fries in my bag. boooooo. I'll prob go back and give them one more shot but the first impression is not very good.
