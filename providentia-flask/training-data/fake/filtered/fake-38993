There is a word in Italy, TIPICITA' (tee-pee-chee-TAH), which is employed there as a song of culinary praise, not for the lace-curtain luxury or senses-numbing excess that so many purveyors of haut-cuisine wish us to surrender our hard-won savings for, but rather for a certain trueness to place of origin; a sense of honesty; a sense of typicity.  In this country, on the island of Manhattan, the word tipicità is synonymous with the name Da Andrea. The owner, from what's been said, came to New York from Bologna, and he may as well have stuffed the 2-or-3-Thanksgiving-get-togethers-sized dining room, the regionally-influenced (Emilia-Romagna) menu, and the all-Italian wine list into his accommodating suitcase for the flight over, for this is the degree to which Da Andrea exhibits a sense of trueness to its place of origin.  And after working your way through a platter of hot, flat-pressed Tigelle bread (to be topped with strikingly fresh prosciutto and grated parmesan), a serving of homemade spaghetti (cooked expertly to a firm and shapely consistency) under a delightfully light Bolognese sauce (a quick spread across the flat, white plate reveals a refreshing lack of oiliness), and a chilled bottle of lambrusco (the simple, sparkling red wine of the Emilia-Romagna region often used there as a house wine), chances are you may find that TIPICITA' has just made a permanent entry into your meal-centric vocabulary. A final note: there will be no spoon set on the table for pasta twirling; a subtle, northern-Italian hint that such assistance is necessary only in other places.
