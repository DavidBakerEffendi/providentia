My wife and I had been to the Orange Squirrel one time prior and really enjoyed our meal. We got the smoked tuna dish and it was excellent. The service on that night was really bad and they forgot to bring us one of the appetizers we ordered. They did give us the app when we were leaving to bring home for free, which was nice. Due to the main course being so good, we thought we would give the restaurant one more try (service just had an off night). The Valentine's Day price-fixed menu was a major disappointment. It was a mandatory three-course meal with only two options for each course. The first course was either a soup with shrimp in it or some fried asparagus. I am allergic to shellfish, so I had to go with the fried asparagus. The waitress spoke about a spicy honey mustard sauce that comes with the asparagus for dipping purposes. To my dismay, five small pieces of asparagus came out to an order. They were greasy and lacked flavor. The dipping sauce was not a spicy honey mustard like the menu and waitress indicated but yet melted butter. It was gross and disgusting. The main course option was short rib or a salmon pinwheel. The portion size once again was embarrassing and both were average. My short rib was extremely fatty and wouldn't have satisfied a small appetite. The dessert was the best part of the meal, but after the first two bombs for dishes, it didn't matter. To make matters worse, the bill was $65 per person not including drinks and I left the restaurant starving. Needless to say, I won't be going back to the Orange Squirrel again. The service both times has not been good. Both times we have been to the restaurant there have been arguments between other customers and the wait staff. Just doesn't create a comfortable atmosphere. The portion size on this night was embarrassing and the price was WAY too high for beyond small portions. Very disappointing Valentine's dinner for both my wife and I.
