Louie's Lunch is the classic example of how hype makes a business. Now, god bless the owners for making a business like this work. But let's be real here. It's a hamburger on toast. And spare me the "most delicious burger I've ever had nonsense." That's just somebody wanting something special and seeing what's not really there. The burger is no better than ground beef at your supermarket, and if the service was any slower, they would stop. I will admit they did get me hooked on the burger on toast style, similar to the way Friendly's used to do it. I make one about once a week, and just as well in my own kitchen and for way cheaper. Go to Louie's Lunch once for the experience, but that's all I can recommend.
