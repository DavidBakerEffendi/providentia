Great food, great coffee, great teas! The food is very refreshing especially with limited options in the neighborhood. Yes, the service is slow. I go there a few times a week either for food or just coffee and it seems to be somewhat of a mix between self-service and table service which doesn't bother me now that I understand the way this place functions. At first I was a little annoyed at how long it took to make anything there but everything is hand-poured so I let it slide. The wait staff always seems to be happy and friendly.
