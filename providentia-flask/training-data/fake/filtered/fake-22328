Heard about the Sea Witch so decided to stop by Tuesday night (2/21)  The bar itself is so nice.  Has a great vibe - loved the atmosphere! Ran into some old friends which made the visit even nicer.  Timmy the bartender (he's there on Tuesday nights) was so cool and served us some ice cold beers!   Love the decor and the fish tank is fabulous!  Will definitely go back again and try the food!
