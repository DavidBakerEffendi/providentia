I order delivery from here on a regular basis and I've had most of the menu by now. The guacamole nachos are excellent. The steak fajitas are amazing. My wife thinks the shrimp is fantastic. Everything else is basic and in no way bad, but just average. Except the wings. Don't ever bother ordering the wings. Just not good. But Chinese restaurateurs running a Mexican take-out probably aren't gonna make great buffalo wings, you know? Hamden is not hurting for choices in the wing department. Oh! The spinach quesadilla is pretty dang tasty as well. So is the veggie burrito, and it's massive. Decent food, decent prices, great portion sizes. Amazingly good guacamole (to me anyway).
