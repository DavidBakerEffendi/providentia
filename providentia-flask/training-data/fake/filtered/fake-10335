Went there tonight for dinner, was disappointed. Service was just ok, waiter did not even come to ask us how our food was after it arrived. Had he done so, we would have told him that the $30 stuffed pork chop "special" was tough and overdone. The calamari salad appetizer was tasty, though saturated with dressing. My skirt steak was ok, nothing spectacular. For just this and the 2 glasses of wine plus tip, it came to nearly $100-. When I complained to the manager upon leaving, he offered no recourse, not even comping my wine, which most places will do. We will not be going back. I suspect most of the stellar reviews here refer to the bakery items, which we did not sample.
