Never had I been so disrespected at a business rooted in customer service!  All sense of decency is lost at this place!  After waiting for over 45 min, we were told that our table was given to someone else since we had left.  We had previously checked in several times since we were waiting outside after we got tired of continually being shoved by the wait staff trying to get through the crowded tiny vestibule since there is NO waiting area but the outside patio.  We were told after the fact that they do not call parties that are obviously waiting outside when their table is ready.  But in fact, 2 parties waiting outside with us were called and one party was even picked up & escorted to their table.   We spoke to the man with the moustache (I believe the manager manager) and he said we would be seated next and put us back on the list.  15 min later other parties were being seated ahead of us.. fine he forgot or whatever but when we reminded him we were waiting over an hour now he said that this is how it is, made a prejudice remark insulting our race, laughed and walked away.  In disbelief we chalked it up to him being insensitive & ignorant, but when he later told another party that he would seat them before everyone else because hthey were Cuban and everyone else can just wait - looking straight at me! - we had issue.  He seemed proud of his actions and arrogantly barked that why don't we just go to an Italian rest (as if it was a classless place to eat at!!) and get out!  All we wanted was to get a table and enjoy a night out at what we thought was a fun place.  I would never set foot in that racist place again!  That arrogant, racist manager needs to learn some class and respect not to mention basic managerial skiils.   Restaurants rely on customers... most people I know don't like to spend their hard earned money supporting a mediocre restaurant that humiliates and disrespects their guests.  Keep your dignity and keep away from this place!
