This restaurant is just what Downtown Hartford needs! It has a clean, updated space right next to the XL Center. The waitress told me the menu will be expanding, as I went there during the first week of opening. I was able to enjoy quality Asian food at affordable prices. I especially love the rice paper spring rolls with shrimp and the wonton soup. The rolls are prepared to order and especially fresh and crisp. The service is outstanding....prompt, polite, and friendly...something I don't find all too easily these days. I also love the cucumber margarita specialty cocktail suggested to me by the owner.
