After reading the yelp reviews, I decided to stop in and try the famous Dr. Isaacman. Wow- what a drink!  The bartender Kelvin was amazing and incredibly knowledgable.  The food pairing that kelvin recommended really complimented the drink- or the drink complimented the food. Not sure which, but they should put that drink in a bottle and sell it- it's that good.   Highly recommended place!
