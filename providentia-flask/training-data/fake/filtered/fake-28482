My boyfriend and I went to Acacia this past weekend for a date. The atmosphere was very quiet and relaxed. We were seated immediately at a nice corner table and our waitress was very attentive. There was some music playing, but not enough to disrupt conversation. For an appetizer, we ordered the sweet potato eggrolls. They were fantastic! We both agreed that they were unique, tasty, and some of the best eggrolls we'd ever had. I ordered the salmon for dinner. It was well cooked, and while there was not enough sauce for my taste, it was very good. My favorite part was the crab and apple risotto that it was served with- outstanding! My boyfriend had the filet which was perfectly cooked and very tender. He was a big fan of the mashed potatoes. We did not stay for dessert - I would like to go back and try some. My only qualm is that they don't list prices for desserts, which makes me think they are quite pricey. On our way out we saw the menu for the power lunch, which looks like a great deal. I will definitely try that out sometime! Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant. While it's too pricey for us to frequent regularly, we will return for special occasions.
