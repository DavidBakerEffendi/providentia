i come all the way from bayside to get spumoni!! well i havent really tried their pizza... only cuz whenever i go i head over there pretty late like around 11 or 12... and thats a lil late for me to be eating pizza... BUT i go there for their ICE CREAM!!! and its a nice atmosphere cuz they have a lot of seating outside where pple can just chat and relax and eat their ice cream or pizza.. But i heard great things about their pizza! lot of my friends say it is really good! i have yet to head their early to try it. But definitely get some ice cream!
