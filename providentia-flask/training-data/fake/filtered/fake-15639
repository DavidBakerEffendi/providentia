This place rocks the house. No frills, yet cozy, the interior welcomes you in on cold nights, (like tonight) and they get the food right out to you. I live a few doors down, and wind up eating there more nights than not out of the week. The desserts are off the hook as well; pumpkin pie, apple cobbler and big fat cookies grace the display window where you order. The items that I've had so far have been absolutely delicious. The Philly Cheese Steak on challah bread, the brisket sandwich, and the quesadillas are to die for. All super-fresh ingredients, a great selection of breads, and a nice looking brunch that i have yet to try. This was SORELY needed in this neighborhood with so very much lousy food around. I'm thrilled its there and everyone in the immediate vicinity should give it a shot.
