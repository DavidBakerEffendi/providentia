I don't go here too often, because it's a bit far, but it's pretty good. Taste: A, I've only tried their pork sandwich. I usually get it with provolone. But it taste very good. It's steamed pork (I think?) with spinach and cheese. I wouldn't say it "melts" in your mouth, but it is soft and tasty. Amount: A, I think I could eat 2. But I only have enough money for 1. Price: B, compared to other cheese steak places, the price is pretty standard. But considering that I eat it once in a while, it's not bad. I like it, it's a pretty solid place for a cheese steak. I've seen my friends' sandwiches and they looked pretty good.
