Unfortunately, Molly's is deliberately trying to go out of business with it's rude, sarcastic, and loudly disingenuous staff, particularly the old WHITE Irish bartender.  I brought my Hispanic friend to the bar for a couple of after work drinks.  The Irish bartender kept a keen eye on him and was waiting for a chance to pick on him.  My friend is a renown vintage jewelry maker and dealer.  We spoke of the items he had just purchased and were examining them closely.   My friend then opened up to the bartender in order to break the ice so to speak and asked the bartender to look at a German piece that was laid among the other pieces my friend had just purchased.  The bartender then says, "Did you just find that here?  The two customers who were sitting here before YOU came here were German, and it belongs to them."  My friend showed a receipt for the purchase explaining that it had just been purchased from a local thrift shop.  Stunned, we left and couldn't believe that a place where most of the staff, bartender, and customers alike are a homogenous blend of white-haired, unfriendly, suspecting, judgmental, nudniks that this MAN would attempt his bartender trick of accusing a CUSTOMER of taking something probably only to take home himself, the thief. Racial profiling?  Perhaps not.  Bad service on a paying customer?  Certainly.  The rest of the staff acted the same.  Pretty much questioning where we came from and why we were there.  One waitress screamed at me pointing to the restroom and mumbling a bit about an outhouse then laughing to another customer.  I am white but I think all this was fueled by my Hispanic friend being there with ME. I give this place a thumbs down, much for the service, but more for the weak drinks which are all calculated by this white-haired, aged Jeffrey Dahmer-esque BARTENDER.  He ONLY services his own kind.  Luckily these type of bars are closing down around Murray Hill, Kip's Bay, and the Gramercy Park area.
