Great spot for margaritas and even better during their happy hour specials (Mon-Fri 4-7pm)! The fish tacos and the chorizo nachos (happy hour menu only) are delicious. I'm originally from CA, so I appreciate good Mexican food. They also have outdoor seating in front of the restaurant if the weather is nice.
