I have been here many times, the first time being in 2009 shortly after PYT opened. It was a favorite for me and my friends and we went all the time, it was even the spot we would insist out-of-town friends had to try on their visit to Philly. Around 2 years ago the quality started to take a deep dive. I noticed we started experiencing insane wait times for food, as well as servers who were hostel to any suggestion that there might be anything wrong with the order. Nobody I know wants to go anymore. The last time I went I was burned by a server who thought he was too good to write down our orders and got it wrong, which we discovered when our food came out 50 minutes later (cold).
