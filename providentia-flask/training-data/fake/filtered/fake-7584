This place is a true gem not only of the neighborhood, but of Brooklyn. The wait staff are very polite and responsive, a pleasure. The food and coffee is great. And the owner could not be friendlier or more responsive to the customers. The place is great, but if there is ever anything that you would like a different way, the owner will bend over backwards to try to help you. What more could you ask for?
