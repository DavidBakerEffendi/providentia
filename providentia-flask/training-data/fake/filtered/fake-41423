I've been to Biblio with my wife 3 or 4 times. To take it from the top: Menu is a little overly cerebral - not sure what a rarebit is. Sounds like zombie bunny. Also, had to Google armagnac which is in a couple of dishes. Place is small but nicely decorated with custom wood bar and unisex bathroom. Could use better lighting in evening time. Wines are good with excellent beer selection. Cocktails are a little overly smoky for my taste. Of apps we've had: liver mousse was very good. peanuts and olives were decent. Potato and leek soup was incredible - would not have known it was potato if it was served to me blind. Most apps heavy. Simple salad might be best app on menu (field greens with roasted corn, apples, red onion and light vinaigrette). Mains are good with a few exceptions. Mac and cheese is good but extremely heavy (bacon mixed in) and a big portion. Grandma's crispy chicken is very good but was a little over done second time we had it. The big favorite on the menu is the burger and it lives up to the hype. Beef used is key - tastes somewhat like sirloin (sort of has that dry-aged taste) and if so for under $20 is an absolute bargain. Add-ons are well worth the money - cheese is smoked (great touch) while bacon is crispy. Heard good things about barley dish but have yet to try. Lastly deserts are hit and miss (and few!) madeleine desert is phenomenal but the chocolate lava cake, while good is very 1980s. Overall staff we found to be friendly and reasonably attentive. Main courses and beer are what set this place apart from most.
