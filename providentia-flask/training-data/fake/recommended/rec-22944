I had the best experience ever at this trendy Mexican restaurant. The place is located around other hip restaurants, but Fonda is still one of the best options in the neighborhood. It wasn't that hard to make a last minute reservation on a Saturday night, and I was seated immediately upon entering. The hostess was very sweet and polite, definitely not the rude, pompous ones that I often encounter in similar restaurants. Now to the food... the guacamole and chips was AMAZING. It was definitely the best guac. I've ever had. This is the perfect appetizer to get started on because it can be shared between three people. I also ordered the frozen margarita, which was delicious as well! For entrees I along with my friends ordered Carne Asada Con Hongos and Pescado Al Sarten. The steak was so flavorful, tender, and accompanied by the most delicious mushrooms. The fish was equally delicious. We ended the night with more drinks and dessert. I will definitely return and would highly recommend this restaurant to everyone!
