I drove an hour and a half just to try their Slovakian fried burger. It did not disappoint. Not only was the burger juicy and full of flavor but the beer and whiskey selection was plentiful. The relaxed atmosphere and simple location makes it easy for anyone to find. I have eaten a lot of burgers and this is in my all time top 5.
