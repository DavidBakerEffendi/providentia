I went on Mother's Day and my mom and my sister and I all ordered the lobster burger and even though it includes fried we ordered the truffle fries on the side becuase I've heard of so many great reviews on yelp.The wait wasn't that long though we did come at 4:30.Our waitress was nice the only thing I have to say is I don't know if it was the sauce or the cheese on the burger but it had a strong lemony flavor that made it taste a little weird.My sister and I didn't finish it but took if home I'm going to eat mine for lunch tomorrow .We were seated at the booth which was great.I loved the decor of the restaurant it was very elegant .We were dressed pretty casual we didn't feel too underdressed.There were some people wearing t-shirts and others wearing dresses..It's a great place to dine.
