Jacob, you nailed it. I'm a fan! I spotted you at brunch today and you look as approachable in person as you do in the video on your website. It's nice to see the owner out and about with the staff. Here's why I gave this place five stars. The long wait is a bummer BUT the hostess takes your number and then texts you 5 min before they're ready to seat you, so you can run to a local coffee shop and kill time if it's a long wait. This is 100 times better than waiting in line, especially when it's cold out (*cough* GETE *cough*). The food is awesome and reasonably priced. I had the biscuits and (sausage) gravy with eggs, which was delicious. The biscuits are huge so the serving sizes are generous. The coffee kept coming, which is a sign of a wait staff that is on top of things. Our server seemed a little surly but not enough to turn me off from the joint. All the food looked great and I plan on checking it out for dinner and drinks. I really like the concept of taking a jug of beer home with you. Let's talk about THE MUSIC. It's the best possible music I could've asked for. Beck, Nirvana, Queens of the Stone Age, and The Strokes were all on rotation during brunch today. AWESOME. The decor is cozy and modern. Exactly what helps you to feel at home.
