Believe the hype.  This is the best deal for happy hour sushi.  Everything  on the happy hour menu (sake and wine included) is $3.50. My party of two walked out stuffed and tipsy for just over $30. The place is super small, so get there early to nab a table or sit at the super small sushi bar.  Everything comes out really quickly. Wish I could have gone a second time before I left NY!
