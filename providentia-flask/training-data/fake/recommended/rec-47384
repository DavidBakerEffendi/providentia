I haven't had a sit-down meal at GTC yet, just shopped for cheeses, meats, and pastries.   Cheese- I have a long-running loyalty to the mozzarella at Claudio's, but the other day at GTC I discovered something phenomenal- mozzarella made TO ORDER.  That's right, there are no balls of mozz waiting to be picked up, instead, they magically evolve into being after you place your order with the cheese counter.  The curd is already made, and upon your say-so it is melted and stretched and wrapped into a perfect ball.  Delicious melted on a pizza, mixed with tomato and basil, and even by iself.   Meat- There is a good selection of charcuterie, but watch out- the meat slices are incredibly thin.  Next time I go, I need to ask if they can cut it thicker.   After three visits, the service is inconsistent-- the people behind the counters still seem to be unfamiliar with the varieties of meats and cheeses and are uncertain about making recommendations.  I imagine this will be worked out after a few more weeks.  In the meantime, it is an excellent addition to the Philly food scene.  (and a great stop for the aspiring home-gourmet.)
