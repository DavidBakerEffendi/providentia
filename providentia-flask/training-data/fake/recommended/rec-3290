Stopped in for a drink the other night just a few days after they opened their doors. Had their margarita with mint and jalape√±os and it was delicious! The bar is really pretty and they have it set up with a handful of tall tables up front near the bar and some lower tables in the back. It will be nice when they have the front windows open as the weather gets nicer! The staff was amazing, really eager to please (in a good way). The food menu is a bit eclectic, which some may love, but nothing really stood out to me to order. Definitely a must try for at least the drinks/bar!
