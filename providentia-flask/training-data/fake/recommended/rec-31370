"Our burgers are ground fresh daily in the house with steak" OMG SIGN ME UP. The burger was as good as advertised. Get it medium rare. The texture is wonderful and subtly melts in your mouth as you chew. It's wonderful. I got the classic burger which comes with shiitake mushroom as well as the off menu duck burger special which is ground duck with chinese five spice and sweet apple compote. The duck was also cooked medium rare and had an interesting taste i was not expecting from a burger. It tasted great as well and was a cool take on an otherwise untraditional burger meat. The tempura onion rings are also great. Tempura batter is not as crusty as other batters and its wrapped around a nice thick cut of onion and they are generous with their portions. The sweet potato fries are great as well. Both go really well with their ketchup. Theres something up with that ketchup...it's not your typical heinz... tastes kind of truffle-y almost. In any case it was great! Really awesome burger place! 4.5 stars! Came here on a sunday night with a group of 5 other friends. Line is long as to be expected. and the only reason im dinging a star is because we got a text that our table was ready and we still had to wait 40 minutes? I'd still come back though.
