Despite it's name, you won't be miserable here. The staff is very pleasant and cheerful and it's a no-frills kind of place. As many reviewers mentioned, the fries here are absolutely sublime. They are a work of art. Seriously. Get the fries. Now that you're convinced you need an order of fries, you can start thinking about the sandwich to go with it. We had a spicy chicken sandwich, and a porkbelly and fried egg sandwich. I don't mind boy cooties, so my boyfriend and I decided we would each cut our sandwiches in half and share. I recommend doing this if you go with someone else, because you don't want to miss out on the deliciousness. The spicy chicken sandwich was not too spicy (just under medium buffalo sauce), but deliciously messy, so grab a stack of napkins if you go that route. It is loaded with shredded lettuce and bleu cheese , but I'm sure if you don't want those, they would oblige. The chicken was crisp on the outside, and juicy and tender in the middle. A pretty good intepretation of the classic. The pork belly and fried egg sandwich was just delicioius...the pork belly was a slightly leaner cut than some places, and not overly salty. the mustard sauce on it provided a nice balance to the salt. And the fries and Old Bay aioli went with everything. They also sell Mexican Coca Cola here, if that's your thing. But I went straight for the lemonade which was a great compliment to both the hot day and the food. It wasn't overly sweet, and was not watery either. I couldn't recommend this place enough. I'm going to miss it when I leave Burlington.
