We came here for a late lunch on a Sunday and I just wasn't impressed. The food here was meh to ok, nothing special and I would say it's as Italian as cooking some pasta and throwing some sauce on it.  The service was also meh. The waitress was nice but her excesses got a little old fast that or they really had nothing in stock. For our drinks, I never got mine and later the apologized because they were out of what I ordered, which happens but then we ordered mozzarella sticks for the table they never came and after we got our entrees we were apologized to and told they ran out of mozzarella sticks. My one friend ordered ziti and they gave him substitute pasta and said the same thing... Really you were out of all that stuff... Besides that I don't like how they tacked on the salads. Asking what dressing we like on our salad to get us to order salad is not kosher in my book. If the salad isn't coming with the entrée don't try to get people to order it by asking what dressing they would like on it then tacking it onto the tab. I don't really care about the 2.50 extra as much as it seems like a sly way to do business. The only enjoyable part was the conversations and the crayons where are novelly named after things like florentine, roasted red pepper, and eggplant. Overall, I don't think I would come here again.
