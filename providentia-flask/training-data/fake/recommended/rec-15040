Is there any way to give 4 1/2 stars? The sole criticism I have is it can be a little too loud at times, causing you to nearly scream at the person next to you, but other than that I have nothing but praises for the Khyber. The food is delicious, and if I had to pick my last meal on this earth, the bacon grease popcorn would be somewhere on that final menu. They also offer a plethora of vegetarian options, making sure no one is left out of the good eats to be had at this establishment. The drinks are also affordable and well made: all in all, a great place to grab some food and drinks with friends!
