Before I walked in the shop, I didn't plan to finish whole sandwich so I asked to have it to go. After first bite, I couldn't stop finishing whole sandwich because it's freshness and flavor. Bread is so crush but doesn't lost chewiness. I ordered pilot which is with lemon grass chicken. It's full of flavor but some how you don't fee it's over power. Strongly recommend it for quick bite.
