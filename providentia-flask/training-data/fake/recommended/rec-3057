Spot on! Nothing better than realizing you have this place around the corner. But besides location bias, I have to say that the pernil was the best one I've ever had. Coming from Miami being exposed to this cuisine on a daily basis I have to say that hands down this is the best. Crunchy tostones and on point cafe con leche. I have found my soulmate in the east village.
