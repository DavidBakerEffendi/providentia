I have to admit.  I'm a sucker for iced coffee.  I don't even feel bad anymore about spending $2+ on it because it is like my lifeblood and it keeps me going.  SO, what's a South Philly girl to do with no Starbucks in a 10+ block radius?  Go to B2!!! (or Gleaners, but thats a different review) I always felt like I would be intruding on someones reading group at Benna's, but I have to say, I get a different vibe here.  It's more spacious with more room for customers and beautiful natural lighting.  The layout is a huge improvement over E's, and has a bar counter and bar stools like Benna's (which I think is genius!)   Although there are a ton of tempting food and beverage options written on the blackboard menu, my main mission whenever I hit up a coffee shop is the iced coffee and theirs is a real treat.  It cost between $2-2.50 for a large depending on whether you get it to stay or to go and is  delicious!  Strong enough, not watery, not too much ice - just the way I like it.   Plus they don't charge you extra for soy milk if that's what you prefer.
