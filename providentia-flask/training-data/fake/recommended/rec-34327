We used to go to the Nutley, NJ location, so living in Wayne, we thought we would try their Fairfeild location. We were pleased to see it's familiar to the original location.  The Hotsee Totsee Shrimp was spot on great, just like the Nutley location.  The French Dip was good (not great), the Prime Rib Sliders were pretty good, again, not great.  The creamed spinach was much better than expected, I'd order that again for sure. The Itlaian cubed sirloin steak snadwich was very good.  Service was good, although we were there at 5:30 PM, so it was not crowded yet.  They were very attentive on clearing emply plates ( I like that in a restaturant), and all in all it was a good experience. We'll go back again and make it one of our regular spots.
