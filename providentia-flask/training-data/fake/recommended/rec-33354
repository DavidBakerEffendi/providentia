This is probably my wife's and my favorite restaurant in town these days.  The food is great, the drinks are great, the staff has a culture of nice, and the vibe inside is great. The artichoke and pancetta pizza is my face, but I'd recommend to ask for it with the spicy honey on top -- that really makes it.  All the pizzas are good, that bread the use is our of this world. The salad with the cherries is also perfect.
