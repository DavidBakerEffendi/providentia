From Tucson, was told to check this place out for its authenticity. Manager greeted us, excited that we were from his home state. Very friendly staff. Appetizers and cocktails were terrific. We had the grilled cactus and red onion, the chipotle slaw, and the outstanding fried plantains. After ordering a mojito, we were talked into the Port Chester Reviver: basically a mojito with gin rather than rum and cucumber in the muddle. Good stuff. Tacos were, unfortunately, pretty average. Small portions in this family style restaurant lead me to believe that the tab could escalate pretty quickly. Very interesting variety of filling available; duck, portobello, tripe, red snapper to compliment the standard beef/pork/chicken. We had duck, lamb, portobello and pork al pastor. Unfortunately, they all come out tasting basically the same. Very little difference between the different fillings. I would recommend this more as a late night appetizer/cocktail (very impressive tequila menu, also looks like they have a sort of 'do it yourself sangria' option) destination. Just don't go looking for excellent tacos.
