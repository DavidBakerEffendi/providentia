I went here with my boyfriend Friday night using a Groupon.  We were greeted right away which was nice and were sat down immediately.  Our waitress was very attentive which is always a plus.  She started with the specials of day which I highly recommend typing out every night and handing it to the customers just because there were so many that by the time she got to the fish special I forgot what the other ones were.  We started w/ the hot pepper, sausage and potato special which was delicious if you like spicy.   My boyfriend got the pasta special with clams, scallops, mussels, and shrimp in a spicy marinara sauce.  He loved it!  I got the Tortellini Carbonara with meat tortellini.  It was delicious as well.  The only complaint I have is SOME of the pasta was overcooked.   We didn't get dessert because we were too full from the meal, but all in all I would definitely recommend Castalia 997.  The staff was great, checked on you more than once and were very friendly, and the food was very good too.
