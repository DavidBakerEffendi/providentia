I've heard a lot of great things about this place from others so I decided to give it a try. Maybe I went on an off-night but I must say that I was slightly underwhelmed with dinner here. Especially considering the $100 cost per person (we each got a couple of drinks too). Don't get me wrong - the space itself and the vibe were both very cool. The food and service, however, were just alright. I definitely expected something better, especially given its association to Top Chef. Some of the better items we ordered were the gnocci, sausage pasta with ricotta, and the JW chicken. The calamari was alright, nothing special. As a heads up, I would avoid the cod. My friend who ordered it essentially noted that it was nothing more than a glorified fishstick. Would I give this place another shot? Maybe. But considering how much money we ended dropping here, I think you can do much better elsewhere.
