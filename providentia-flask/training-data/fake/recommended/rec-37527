All right, everyone who is ripping this place a part needs to realize you're paying $7.99 for lunch something like $14.99 for dinner which is SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than any other buffet's prices - so lower your damn expectations and realize you're not going to get a raw bar and a variety of fruit options and all that jazz. You're getting what you paid for and on that note, the quality and consistency of their food is pretty damn good. I went with my friend for lunch so I can't speak for dinner - which I'm sure is better. Their sushi is decent, the pieces are small and the rolls are constantly changing - at least they were throughout the time that we were there - so there aren't any name cards, you pretty much have to look at the ingredients and know what you do or don't like. We certainly ate more than our moneys-worth just eating 2 plates of sushi alone. My friend just stuck with the sushi and had no complaints while I did venture out to the rest of the buffet from the hibachi to the soups - everything is pretty consistent even when they need to refill the buffet which is actually impressive since sometimes when buffets restock the dishes the quality can be rather iffy - I hope they keep this up. Truly my only complaint is regarding the shrimp. The shrimp is unpeeled - that I don't mind - but it also still has the legs on them as well. The shell is already enough work to eat around, couldn't you just de-leg the shrimp for us too? I would complain about the head being on too but it Â doesn't bother me as much as I know it bothers others. All in all, when I'm super hungry and don't have much money on hand I would definitely revisit this place. My friend and I went there as an alternative to spending $20 on a sushi-lunch. I'm willing to go back and try dinner.
