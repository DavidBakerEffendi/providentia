Had dinner w friends here last Sat.  Good atmosphere, good food and service.  I sampled the oysters, crab & artichoke dip, beet salad, Brussel sprouts, and lemon-caper cod.  Onion rings were eh.  My hubby's clam chowder was outstanding.  Desserts were very yummy as well, esp the apple-huckleberry cobbler a la mode.
