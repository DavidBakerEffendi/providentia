god i am so bad with remembering what i eat... but all i remember is that it's delicious and excellent for a brunch/lunch place. mimosa was delicious, i had the french beer. it was a-okay (but seriously, when were the french ever considered manly men and known to produce great beer?). too lazy to update because im going on a yelp review splurge... just look at my picture and just know you can't go wrong with any of these wheat-floured crepes. cash only btw. sexy lady paid for the meal cause homeboy don't carry no cash around! i felt bad.
