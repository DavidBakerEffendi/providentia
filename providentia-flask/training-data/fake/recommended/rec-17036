This was a pretty good restaurant. I came here with one of my best friends that ihaven't seen in a while and we had a good time catching up over some good food. Everyone on here recommends the lemon potatoes and I have to agree. The were quite superb. Also, the bread, customary at most restaurants, was really well made. I forgot what mine was called but I remember enjoying it heartily. The portion was enough to fill me as well. However, the best part of the restaurant was the service. Everyone seemed to enjoy what they were doing and our waiter in particular made sure we had a good time. I'm going to butcher the spelling of his name but I believe it was Themistokles. Twas a very enjoyable night and I will soberly come back.
