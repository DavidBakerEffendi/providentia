I've been here a handful of times, and each time it was just okay.  Not sure what the hype is about.  The chicken is diced and shredded to tic tac size, not exactly juicy or moist.  The rice is basic yellow rice.   It's also served with a slice of pita and some lettuce.  The white sauce is pretty good.  Each time I've been here, the line is about 50 people and the wait is easily 30 minutes.
