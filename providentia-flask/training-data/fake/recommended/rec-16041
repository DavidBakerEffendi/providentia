Opa!  Man oh man is this place superb!  If you go on a weekend, expect a 30 to 45 minute wait to get a table.  But trust me, it'll be the best 30 to 45 minutes you've ever waited.  The food here is that good. I live all the way in Manhattan and I know for sure that I will be going all the way back to this town to eat at Stamna,  It's really that good.  First, you have to love a place this nice that is also BYOB!  And there's a great liquor/wine store on the same street as the restaurant, just 5 stores down, with a great selection.  It just doesn't get better than that. The energy here is wonderful.  I am not sure if we went on a special night or something, but dining here was like being at a United Nations convention.  So many different cultures and languages all over the restaurant.  It was wonderful, and we felt as though we had actually traveled somewhere. I highly recommend any of the lamb dishes.  Greeks are known for their lamb, and this authentic Greek restaurant cooks it perfectly.  We also started out with the spicy feta dip.  It's delicious, but be warned, it's also very spicy and addictive.  That can be a deadly combo, 2 hours later, if you know what I mean.  Spicy addictive stuff.  Lol. The staff are very friendly and attentive.  A truly Greek feel to the place.  You must try this place at least once, even if you live 20 to 30 miles away.  Trust me, Stamna is worth it.
