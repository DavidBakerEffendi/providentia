WOW. This place is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. Food: interesting, unique, flavorful. Get the cactus pad and blood clams. The freshest clams I have EVER had. I died of happiness. I could eat this every day for years. Price: very reasonable considering the quality. Vibe: trendy and fun - good for a fun dinner either as your whole night or as your pregame Staff: so great! We got seated in the backroom so there was a/c there :)
