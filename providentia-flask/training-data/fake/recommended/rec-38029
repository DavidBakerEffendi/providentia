My Husband and I went here for our 4 year wedding anniversary.  It was very good.  The service was great and very prompt (we were in no rush) to the point where we ended up going out for drinks after because we had told our sitter we wouldn't be home until 8.   Very nice wine list and great menu.  I had the Chicken gnocchi and it was amazing, my husband always orders gnocchi but opted for something else this time.  We shared both and we both thought both meals were amazing.  (I cannot remember what he got!)  We started with the calamari and the only thing we wished was different was that there had been more.   The portions are great - we both had plenty left for two meals. We both ordered dessert; I got the creme brulee and the flavor of the day was chocolate and it was wonderful.  My husband got the tiramasu which was also delicious.   We do Italian every year for our anniversary and although we try to do a new place each year I think we may need to come back!!!
