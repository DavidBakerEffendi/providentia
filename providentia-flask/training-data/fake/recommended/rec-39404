This has been one of my favorite restaurants for years.  The food and drinks are delicious... especially the espresso BBQ costillitas (ribs).  The sangria and mojitos are also really good.  Brunch is delicious too!  I live in Brooklyn now but still make the trip back here often.  On Tuesdays they have half price tapas and happy hour drinks which is a really good deal.  (The restaurant is very loud, however, so not the best place for a romantic evening.)
