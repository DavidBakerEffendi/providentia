Just got a beef brisket sandwich plain- no toppings.  I just wanted to taste the beef.   Wait...actually, it's because I saw that the price for a sandwich was $9.00.  Before toppings.  I'm not expecting 5 dollar sandwiches mind you, but something closer to the 6-8 dollar range.   I know this place gets a lot of publicity (via yelp) and lots of good ratings. The meat is definitely good, but not sure if it's "rock-my-world" good. Solid spot.  4 for the food...knock it down 1 for the price.   If I try this place again, I'll go for the toppings...and make sure I split the sandwich with someone.
