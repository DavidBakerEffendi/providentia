This was an incredible disappointment at every level.  We were there about 6 months ago and loved it, so it was to be tonight's birthday celebration as we  were visited by our daughter from Chicago.  The service was o.k. but uninspired.  The food was salty and fatty.  The wine took forever.  We then were told they were out of the label I selected - but we had almost finished the meal so I said forget it.  When we were just about done they bring over three "free" glasses. Weren't they listening - I said forget the wine.  So we left it there and when leaving to get our coats, the hostess asked if we enjoyed the meal with a smile filling her face.  She didn't expect our response, so she kept the smile on and stared at us silently then finally when she realized we were serious said oh sorry - and kept on smiling.  That told the story.  They think they're great.  They aren't trying any longer because they think everyone loves them.. The hostess wasn't listening.  The waitress wasn't listening.  I hope anyone who reads this listens.  They need to start trying to earn the praise they now take for granted.  At these prices we deserved better - much better.  I wonder if they are up to it or if they've already moved on to the next venue.  I won't be back here again - that's for sure.
