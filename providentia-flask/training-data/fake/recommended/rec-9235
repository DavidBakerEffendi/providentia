Tasting menu with open kitchen. The servers take their food seriously. Â The only problem is the length of the dinner. Because of the small portions, each course gets very spread out. Be prepared to leave at least 2 hrs for dinner. A reservation is also a must at this place. It's a refreshing experience and change of pace for serious foodies.
