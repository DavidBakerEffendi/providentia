2 stars for service and 4 stars for the food. What's up with the attitude here? It was hard to spot our server (even for the check) and it took time for our food to arrive. Place is kinda cute but tiny. Love the food. Everything we had - oyster broken crepe, pork salad (Lap meung) and Burmese style stewed fatty pork) with sticky rice - AMAZING. I could have been eating at Vientiane Kitchen in Bangkok for all I know. I will be back for sure. Perhaps for take out. And definitely keen to get the boar collar. Â Sounds yummy.
