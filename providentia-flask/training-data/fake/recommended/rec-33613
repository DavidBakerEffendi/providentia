This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. The patatas bravas are cooked to crunchy creamy perfection, and the blistered peppers are charred and salty goodness. I eat here as often as possible. The prices are reasonable given the incredible quality of the food. From the waitstaff to the sangria, there is no better tapas place in town.
