It took us three tries to get into this place, first two times we went the wait was well over an hour so we passed and went to the other Mexican joint around the corner. They don't take reservations, go early and during the week to avoid a wait. Best margarita ever!! We got the habanero grapefruit margarita and it was awesome!! Enchilada Mole and Enchilada Verde were the best we ever had!! Third time's a charm!
