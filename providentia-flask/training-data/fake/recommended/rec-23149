Today's meal was indescribeable.  Words cannot do justice the complex, raw emotions that i experienced as i took that very first bite at the Americana Diner and Restaurant.  With the heat beating down upon my face from the hot New Jersey sun as i write these words, it is with a great sense of longing that i wish to be back where my family once broke bread, feasted on classic breakfast food, and sampled succulent chocolate cake; home. The eggs and bacon, though a staple of a classic american breakfast to be found at all diners, were a revelation.  Alas, my heart flutters as i attempt to recount the true joy i felt as i devoured the Americana Diner and Restaurant's recreation of a classic down-home favorite.   The chocolate cake i ordered for dessert shattered my universe.  I was rocked to my very core by its moist consistency and impeccable presentation.  The sweet espresso fudge sauce that served as topping for this delectable concoction changed my life in ways that i never thought possible. As i stand here in this dusty parking lot hours after the fact, i realize the world is beautiful.  This notion always occured to me as meaningless until this point in my life.  Years from now, i may be a different person altogether in terms of values and cherished beliefs, but i will always remember that which i hold dearest to me and closest to my heart, the Americana Diner and Restaurant.
