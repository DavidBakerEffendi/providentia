My fiance and I came here for our anniversary. We love tapas and were so excited for this menu. We were seated in the back area which had long, shared tables. It wasn't crowded, though, so it wasn't too bothersome. We ordered a plethora of stuff. Our favorite was ham and cheese croquettes (we actually ordered a second plate). Perfect in every way. Fried chick peas: yeah not like what you would expect (like a falafel ball). They were literally fried chick peas. They were okay but they got old quickly and the serving was generous. Chorizo with sherry: Very good but sauce was strong and rich. Potato, egg and onion omelet: It was good but it was cold (kind of odd) and it didn't come with bread to put it on (like a Spanish tortilla usually does). Marinated pork loin and cheese sandwich: Cute little sandwiches that were so good! The pork was tender and the sandwich was flavorful. Aged cold ham: It tasted like a really fatty, cold cut type ham (or like prosciutto) but it was super delicious. Good all by itself (no bread or anything necessary). They had a fantastic wine list and the server was great with recommending wines to pair with the food. And the price wasn't over the top at all, especially for tapas. Overall, a really great experience.
