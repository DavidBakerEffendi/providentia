I'm a fan of this place. I went here for a friends birthday. We had a reservation for around 9 and they sat us at a nice table right then. The restaurant is cramped but its in a charming, cantina style way. We were a big party and the server was laid back but attentive in the areas that matter. I ordered the jalepeno lime margarita which was decent but i think i would have preferred the habenero. I ate the chicken soup for dinner which was great. They laid out chopped jalepeno and hot sauce in almost a pho style, which i'm sure is indicitave of the "barrio chino" style. I also really liked the plates!
