We stopped here while wandering the waterfront, and since it was almost lunchtime, we decided to try it out. The view was fantastic, you are basically sitting on a dock right on Lake Champlain! We dallied over lunch just so we could enjoy the view across the lake, watch the boats, and see the cruise ships pull out.  Oh yes... our server was very polite and helpful, service overall was very good. We both had chicken salad wraps with fries, they were pretty tasty, better than we expected., and reasonably priced, considering our location. It is cash only but they have an ATM on premises if you need it. We found it clean and comfortable. We had very pleasant early fall weather, and it was very comfortable. I  am surprised that in such a decent sized city there are not more eating establishments on the lake. This has a terrific location! Next time we are in Burlington we will make it a point to have dinner there and try to time it with a sunset. It must be spectacular, as even the view on this day, across the lake to the Adirondack Mountains in NY, was very special. Go enjoy it! It is a seasonal restaurant, so check to be sure it is still in operation depending on when you go.
