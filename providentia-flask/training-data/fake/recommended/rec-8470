This place has gone downhill.  I hadn't been here in a year, just because we always forget it's here when trying to think of a place to eat.  The menu has changed.  I don't know what it was, but nothing was jumping out at us on the menu.  I decided on the short ribs.  The dish was okay, but nothing to write home about. (The best part was the polenta)  Taste down the street on Whitney is so much better.  I can't say I'll be back.  Too many better places to go.  Try Mikro or Taste.
