Most important thing to remember: come here for dinner, not lunch. The restaurant has a very unusual system where almost all of their sushi rolls are half price during dinner, but full price during lunch. The half-price "happy hour," as they call it, makes the ordinary rolls a steal ($2-3 per roll) and the special rolls more reasonably priced ($8.50 or $9 rather than $17-18 per roll). The food itself is very good. It's not the greatest sushi you'll taste, but it's probably the best sushi in New Haven at this point now that Miya's has declined. The yellowtail sashimi is a particular highlight, and probably the best yellowtail around. Its texture is soft and buttery, while the flavors have great balance, with a hint of sweetness and no fishy aftertaste. The restaurant is rarely very busy, though there are a good number of people there for dinner, and the food comes quickly. Dinner will run $20-25 a person, more if you partake of their extensive sake menu.
