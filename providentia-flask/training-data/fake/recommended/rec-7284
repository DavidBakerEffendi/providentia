very very solid burger, but I would definitely not put it as the best in NYC  or anything else like others have said. it is a great price, and usually a pretty chill atomosphere (sometimes gets kinda packed at night).   as a bonus they have mcsorley's beers (light and dark!) and are super cheap as well.
