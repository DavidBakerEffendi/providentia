The food was excellent and the service was friendly.  Now if you've never been to a Latin restaurant, be patient.  Things move a little slower than at an American restaurant. The pernil and arroz con gandules was some of the best I ever had at a restaurant.  I tasted my stepdad's churrasco and it was cooked perfect. The house salad dressing was so good I bought some to take home. It's a decent size place so there's plenty of room. Buen provecho!
