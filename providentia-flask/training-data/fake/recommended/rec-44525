Grill 21 serves up excellent traditional Filipino food for decent prices. In particular, the daing na bangus is delicious. Bangus, a super-bony milkfish, here is deboned, dried, then fried in a unique preparation that is delectable dipped in "suka," a Filipino-style vinegar with marinated onions. Also good is the lumpia sariwa (like a large crepe filled with sprouts and carrots, served with either peanut or garlic sauce, both good), and garlic rice (simple, fluffy perfection). And what a treat to be able to enjoy Red Horse beer, but watch out -- it is 7% alcohol. For the lighter side, they also serve San Miguel Light. I would give Grill 21 4 stars, but the service is pretty terrible. The guy who served us all three times we were there was expressionless, didn't say but 2 words to us, never asked us if we were OK or wanted anything else, and forgot a dish in our order and then proceeded to charge us for it. If we hadn't noticed the discrepancy on the bill, we would have accidentally paid for it. If they can get some friendly, attentive service, I will be happy to update my review. I will be back because the food is excellent, but the waitstaff is the pits. Also, watch out for the friendly non-Pinoy owner. He is a nice guy, but is a chatty Kathy who sat at the empty table next to us and engaged in conversation uninvited. Have to be in the mood for that. But, again, a nice guy, just a bit much. I prefer silent owners.
