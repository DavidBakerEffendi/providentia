My favorite spot in this area. The staff is super friendly. The food is amazing...starting right when you sit down to their olive bread. Order the gnocchi and you'll feel like you're eating a melting cloud. Mmmmm. The chopped salad is also great. Â There are plenty of vegetarian options and they are all delish. This is my go-to-place and I'm never let down.
