Whoa - a charming Italian place with real homemade pasta under $20 in the West Village? Get. Out. The menu isn't huge, but that's a good thing, otherwise I would have spent well over 30 minutes trying to decide what to order. Our table started out with grilled calamari, which was well-seasoned and served with a slice of lemon; it was a bite of summer in the middle of winter. For my entree, I chose the spinach gnocchi with gorgonzola. The gnocchi was pillowy, melt-in-your-mouth, and luxurious; in other words, the opposite of every other gnocchi dish I've had in the past, which has been doughy, dry, and unbearably heavy. The gorgonzola sauce got a bit boring after a while, but luckily I was able to snag a few bites of my friend's lobster fettuccine (that night's special); the zing of the tomato sauce on that dish was a welcome break between mouthfuls of rich gnocchi. It's easy to see why the line is out the door at Malatesta. It feels like you're stepping into an Italian home (probably because it's on the ground floor of a residential building in the middle of nowhere), lined with bottles of wine and cute pictures. The servers are friendly, you get these amazing pasta dishes cooked perfectly al dente, and you don't break the bank. Seriously, it's like a miracle. Cash only. Bring a date who will be impressed by your taste, not your wallet.
