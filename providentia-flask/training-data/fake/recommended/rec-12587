Went in for breakfast during the week and it was lovely! The steamed eggs with salmon (lox) topped with creme fraiche was delicious on perfectly crisp bread with olive oil. The belgian waffles with fruit was also tastey, but nothing spectacular. The avocado toast on whole grain bread is great. As for drinks, try the Aperol Spritz -it's a winner.
