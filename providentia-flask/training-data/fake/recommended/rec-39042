Horrible service. Clearly in the minority, but I've never been treated so poorly. Two friends and I came here in mid-April for early Sunday brunch. Our waitress was condescending, flighty, and downright mean to my friend. It was the first true spring day of the season--about 75 degrees outside--and the restaurant was boiling. No fans, no AC, no breeze coming from outside. It was pretty uncomfortable. After ordering, my friend asks, "Is there anyway to make it cooler? We're pretty hot." Our waitress snidely replied, "Yeah, we will make it cooler...just for you." Unnecessary. We were charged for bottled water that we did not ask for nor drink. When my friend brought this to her attention, the waitress rolled her eyes and huffed away. That being said, I enjoyed my meal but not to the point of every stepping back inside. Â Shame.
