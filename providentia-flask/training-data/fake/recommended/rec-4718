Probably the best burger in th entire world! Â You just can't appreciate it until you have had a burger and duck fries from Village Whiskey. The place is a very cool but small inside. Definately to to get there right when they open for lunch as the wait for a table rack's up as soon as they open. The Bloody Mary's were also fantastic. Was a great selection for Sunday brunch after a night out in the city!
