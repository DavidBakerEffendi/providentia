On vacation from CA, my boyfriend and I wanted to find a local place to grab a beer away from the tourists and to get a feel of the NYC scene. After some googling, we found Corner Bistro and, according to Yelp, they had some solid burgers. Sold. And boy, did we hit jackpot. It was packed with regulars/locals watching the 2010 ALCS Game 6, Yankees vs. Rangers. We made some friends in line and had a few McSorleys (I'm a fan of the Ale), because according to them, drinking in line is a New York tradition. We got a table, split with another couple, and after ordering were promptly brought out our food. The burger was cooked medium rare, juicy and tender, with lettuce, tomato and bacon to top it. Really great. The fries were alright. The waiter even brought us a round of shots post-meal. And people say NYC is a rough and tumble town. Oh, and this place is CHEAP, too. $2.50 for a beer, around $7 for a burger? Amazing. Unfortunately, the whole mood of the bar was low due to the outcome of the game, but with great food and service, it was hard not to feel upbeat during the meal.
