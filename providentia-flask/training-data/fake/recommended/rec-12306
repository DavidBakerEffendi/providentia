So after all of the rave reviews that I've heard about PHH, I decided to give it a try especially since I lived within walking distance.   All in all, it was good.  Nothing stood out as the most amazing anything.   Let's start with the chicken: it was ok, definitely not the best fried chicken that I've ever had. I love spicy food; however spicy needs to be flavorful, not just hot.  This chicken (extra hot was what I ordered) was just hot. The spice seasoning was sprinkled on the top.  The meat itself was bland.  The BBQ shrimp with crispy grits was delicious!! I would say that was the highlight of my meal.  To drink I had the blueberry bourbon lemonade smash (or something like that), it was good but it lacked bourbon for sure. I'm all for supporting neighborhood eateries, so I will give PHH another shot - but the chicken won't be an option.
