This place was ok. I stopped in based on reviews (plus it was literally across the street from the Romeo and Juliet show I was seeing). It is a little on the grungier side but the man who greeted me when I walked in was super chipper. It's a TINY place. There were 3 people eating at a counter I think it was? And 3 more people grabbing drinks and I could barely fit in. I tried the ham and pineapple slice and it was pretty good. Not the best pizza I've ever had but it was enough to fill me. I was a little misled by their sign that states slices are $3 and sicilian style are $4. My non sicilian slice ended up being $4.25 + tax (I used a credit card and thus had to pay tax). I can't say it was worth over $4 for that slice, but again it is convenient and super fast.
