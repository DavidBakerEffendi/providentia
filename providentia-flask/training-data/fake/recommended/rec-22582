I almost hate to review this place so well because its small and if people find out...damn, I will have to waittttt! But I must..because its SO good. The best crepes I have ever had. They are very thin buckwheat crepes and the filling...ohhh man. The regular and dessert crepes are both amazing. Nutella and Banana! Very nice staff and cute place. Off the beaten path a bit but so worth walking or driving over. Parking is easy. They have an outside bar in front, if this damn humidity would ever stop, would be enjoyable. Only con is that it is Cash only...grrrrr. I love to use my debit card. It is however on the lesser expensive side.
