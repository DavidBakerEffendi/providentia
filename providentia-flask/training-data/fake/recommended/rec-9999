I could not get over how good the food was!  Three of us shared a whole chicken, brilliantly marinated and roasted, and served with a delightfully spicy salsa verde, Peruvian Fried Rice with everything--which meant it came with large chunks of both beef and chicken--and Mashed Potatoes filled with meat.  For dessert we opted for the Tres Leche cake.  Just a phenomenal lunch and the drinks were just as good. I can't believe I'd never been to a Pio Pio before but now I am not sure I want to eat anywhere else.
