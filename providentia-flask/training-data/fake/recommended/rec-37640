Ordered from here last night. They combined two shawarma orders into one tin and sent two measly pieces of pita. That plus 6 tiny balls of falafel came to $50 for delivery plus tip. Stay away. The restaurant may be different but delivery was a rip off and horrible. The food was cold, dull and pasty.
