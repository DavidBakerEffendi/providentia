I love this place.  The food is authentic. No sour cream and cheese tacos. They're "real" non-americanized tacos. my goal is to try every taco. The chicken is melt in your mouth good and seasoned perfectly. It's also larger than boston market sized rotisserie . The sides are also generous and delicious.  The staff is amazing, very friendly and answers any questions. The prices are resonable and well worth the food
