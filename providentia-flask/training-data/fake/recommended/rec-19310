One of the best brunch spots in Brooklyn! My friends were in town visiting for my birthday and wanted to take me to brunch. I told them we had to come to SoCo! We each got something different based on all my favorites. We tried each other's food and everyone was pleased. We also did the endless mimosas. The shrimp and grits is my favorite, the red velvet waffle w/ fried chicken is a close second! Good food. Good drink. My kind of Saturday afternoon!
