Alright well i was really excited that my neighborhood was getting a bbq place.  I've just come back from a few weeks in the south and ate at a few bbq joints recommended to me by some locals.  They truly know how to do it up right and it made me anticipate el camino real's opening that much more.  We don't have many (read: any) good q places in the city proper (sweet lucy's is good, but sometimes too far). First, the decor was interesting as everyone else has said on here, so really, no need to get further into that.  I ordered the brisket and the chopped pork with both the sweet and the spicy sauce.  I can handle the heat and that skill was definitely necessary as my fellow diners had some trouble keeping comfortable and soon abandoned the spicy.  Everyone, myself included, was a fan of the sweet.  Honestly, i'm throwing the love at both and will say request the duo as the wait staff seem willing to oblige.  The brisket was lovely, and the chopped pork was pretty good too, but i'm a harsh critic of pork so you may elevate the pork to "lovely" status as well.   Went back last night for a go at the bar.  2 flatscreens displaying the game accompanied by pitchers of dos equis amber/kenzinger as well as an order of the pig wings and fries.  When I placed that order I didn't realize what i was ordering....pigs don't have wings....so what was i eating?  Turns out, these are pork legs or ham shanks.  I was a little nervous, but they turned out to be great as well.  The meat almost fell off  and i was left with nothing on my plate but the bone.  Fries were great too.   finally, this place was hoppin' from 8-11 on a saturday night.  lotsa pretty girls and good music, mostly classic rock.  how can you beat that??
