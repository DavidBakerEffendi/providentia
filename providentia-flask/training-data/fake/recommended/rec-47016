I absolutely love this place.  This food is always great and consistent and the service is always really cheerful and great!   I love the gentle calm interior of the restaurant, it's separated into two dining areas which I had thought would feel a bit odd but it really works well for this place.   For starters we ordered the Crispy Calamari with Korean Chili Sauce and theHerb Goat Cheese Mousse, toast, pickled beets, and pickled red beet quail egg.  What i love most about this place is that the chef puts together incrediants that traditionally you would never think could possibly go well together and then she manages to make magic. And of course I couldn't pass up the Pork And Shiitake Dumplings which were perfect in every way.  They were crispy flaky skin with moist and flavorful pork inside!  Perfection. I then ordered a Roasted Amish Chicken with an apple and chestnut puree and Sautéed spinach, macerated cranberries, and a rosemary chicken juice and my husband ordered the Braised Short Rib with horseradish smashed new potatoes, button mushrooms, and turnips.   The dinner was absolutely perfection.   I generally never order chicken because I simply don't care for the taste of chicken however being here I knew that I could safely order a type of meat that I usually pass up just to see what they have done with it and it was absolutely delicious!  My husbands Short Ribs was so very tender and went perfectly with the sides of potatoes and turnips.   I have been to this establishment several times with my husband and it is hands down my favorite place to celebrate our milestones or simply have a good dinner.
