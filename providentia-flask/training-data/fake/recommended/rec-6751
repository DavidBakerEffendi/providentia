Classic lunch spot in Hillsborough. TK3 is hopin' come lunchtime. The food is incredible and very reasonably priced. My personal favorite is the #12 Pad Lard Nar. I would say that the menus is your standard array of Thai- including Pad Thai. For those with a hunger for the spicy, you can pick your degree of spiciness on the scale of 1 to 5 elephants- 5 being the HOTTEST!! With the overall lack of quality and well priced restaurants in Hillsborough, Thai Kitchen is a gem!
