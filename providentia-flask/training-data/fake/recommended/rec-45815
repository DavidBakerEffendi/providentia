Easy 5 stars. Took my dad here for a Sunday brunch. Made reservations around 2:00 and there was plenty of room. Got the seafood salad for an appetizer. Really fresh seafood and a nice citrus dressing. Then my dad and I shared 2 pastas. The plates were not too large but it was perfect for lunch. If I was going for dinner, I'd share another pasta dish or two. We got the garganelli and the tagliatelle. The pasta was delicious and the sauces were so flavorful. Also loved the atmosphere!
