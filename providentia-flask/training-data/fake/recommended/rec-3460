I found this place by accident when my boyfriend gave me the wrong address to where he was staying at. It was the best thing mistake that ever happened! I instantly fell for the exterior and the ambiance of this place! Place is popping even during a snowstorm ( I spend my birthday night here in early Jan). Althought it's not great for big groups, maybe you'll get lucky and sit by the window that could accomadate 5 (tiny) people. The bartenders are friendly and although it can get busy tries to accomodate. Food is freaking delicious! I don't even need to elaborate. Look at the pictures.
