I have not had one bad dish here. Not one. Three visits, tried nearly half of the menu (yes, we are greedy). Everything is so good. My favorites are the entrana tacu-tacu (the meat is seasoned inexplicably well) and the shrimp tamale (no words). Really, the only thing I would change is the sweet plantain because I like them a bit firmer. But the softer sweet plantain is common in South American dishes, so it's more a matter of preference. Definitely check this place out and be greedy! Try many dishes, you won't be disappointed.
