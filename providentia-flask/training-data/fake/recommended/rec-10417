I don't live anywhere near here, but I have eaten here quite a few times, often after attending arts events in the area. Last night's visit was a pleasure, as always. At 9 pm the place was packed and had a nice vibe, but fortunately it started to clear out and we were treated attentively and seated after a pretty short wait. (Once before we had been told honestly that it was a 45 minute wait, but they offered to call us when a table opened. Nice.)  The wines are always tasty choices, reasonably priced, as was the cheese and the tapenade that we ordered right away. I could not resist trying one of several new salads on the menu. It was both tasty and an extremely huge plate full of the very freshest baby carrots, blanched and chilled, and ricotta, with some yummy nuts. I probably should have added a pinch more salt, which they do put on the table in a tiny dish. It was really enough for four people, so my equally large plate of yummy gnocchi was unnecessary but delicious. I ate it all. My boyfriend ate things we had eaten before, notably the rigatoni which is out-of-the-park home-run delectable, always. They typically have things like trout, duck, and chicken entrees on the menu, too. I tend to like the pasta offerings, and usually one of them is vegetarian or near-vegetarian. We sat at a table near the kitchen, which meant a lot of traffic near our table but also prompt attention from the staff. I mentioned to our server that I was too stuffed for dessert, which seemed sad since it was my birthday. They then brought out a sweet, tiny helping of delicious chocolate pudding that the two of us a shared. A really fun and satisfying night.  Looking forward to my next visit.
