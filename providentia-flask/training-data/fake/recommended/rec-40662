Brunch -- delicious! The grits with shrimp, ham & egg was completely satiating in its warm, salty-rich delivery. My table sampled pickles (good -- a bit sweet), fries (decent), and doughnuts (must have been delish but I didn't sample them). Great americano, and huge bloody marys (pretty darn good). I will definitely return for another stellar brunch within this spacious venue. Lovely staff members! Also, my group ate early on a Sunday with a reservation, but the restaurant was not yet busy -- good timing. Brunch was a low $$$, and a great value.
