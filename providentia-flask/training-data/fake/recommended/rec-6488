I don't usually go out for Greek food very often but we stumbled upon this place and I am so happy we did!   The decor is beautiful with those terra cotta vases on the ceiling. The grilled octopus, pork shank and lamb chops were amazing!  So were all the other apps we shared, but I can't remember the names of most of those. I don't think you can  go wrong with much anythign on the menu though. The service was also great - Our party of 4 of didn't have reservations and the place was fairly packed, but the hostess was so--- accomodating.  She seated us within 5 minutes at the communal table and after the couple on the corner had left, the hostess came back and asked if we wanted to move so that the 4 of us could chat more easily. The crowd was diverse- super cute couple next to us and HOT Greek guy who gave us the best recommendations, Sandra Bernhardt on the opposite end of the communal table and a table of rabbis behind us. I don't get to see much of this in SF -  I'l definitely come back next time I'm in NY.
