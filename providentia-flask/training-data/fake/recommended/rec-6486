Excellent restaurant with Israeli/Mediterranean flavors. Possibly better than my favorite Taboon or Barbournia. No reservation and it was full when we got there at 6pm on a Saturday.  I don't think you could go wrong with any dishes.  It's a tiny place and it was extremely noisy thanks to a group of screaming women.
