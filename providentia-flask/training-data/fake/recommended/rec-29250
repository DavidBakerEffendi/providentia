Never had a cheesesteak melt in my mouth before. This is just unheard of, I barely had to chew. That can't be healthy... ahh well. My girlfriend called me up on her way back to DC from Jersey and asked where to get a good cheesesteak. My cousin had just mentioned this place so we decided to go here. It was 40mins out the way for her but she didn't mind after she took a bite. I have grown up on these things all my life and I can honestly say this is one of the best. Still gotta try Chubby's across the street, but this one might be hard to beat. This place would be 5 star if the space was larger and you could sit somewhere other than at the counter.
