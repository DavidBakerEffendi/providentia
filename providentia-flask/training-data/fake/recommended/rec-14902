This is one of if not my favorite bar in Old City. The beer selection is always good and constantly changing. The food is stellar, especially the Mac and Cheese. The place has an interesting mix of people. Every time Â I go there I see a mix of hipsters, hospitality people and business people. They also do an amazing brunch, every time I go it is packed.
