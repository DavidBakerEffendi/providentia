I seriously love this place. I went for brunch with my boyfriend Jay and my friend Jason. We had a BLAST. We went at a good time, too (right before it got crowded). I had a wrap and fries that were AMAZING. The fixed price menu is the BEST THING EVER! Very inexpensive for a lot of food AND DRINKS! Who knew?!?!?!? They also have a wonderful selection of Tea (I'm a HUGE tea drinker). The location is wonderful, as well! It's right off the Broadway stop off the NW in Astoria!
