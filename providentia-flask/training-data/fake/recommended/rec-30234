I love this place so so much. Had dinner here for the second time last night. The entrees are a healthy portion, drinks are strong, and the staff is attentive and doesn't give you pressure. Overall the feel is casual upscale..if that makes any sense. You be the judge, but make sure you make reservations ahead of time.
