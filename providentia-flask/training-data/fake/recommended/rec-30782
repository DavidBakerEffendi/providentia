It's not a sit in place... But if u want a banging corn beef or hot pastrami sandwich jump off the parkway at exit 144 and stop in to grab a bite! I hadn't been here since I was a little girl but decided to stop in! They have not lost their touch! I ordered a 1/2 corn beef & 1/2 pastrami on rye with Russian dressing. They pile the meat so high, you only need half the sandwich. They also give you two slices of a pickle. The Deli is combined with a liquor store so you can get dinner and a drink all in one spot. The people are pleasant and the price is more than fair... The decor is the only thing that leaves you wanting more... Don't expect anything fancy... It's a classic mom and pop!
