Had a great experience here last night!  I had to chime in since the mixed reviews on here had me hesitating- but now I'm convinced that The Pines is well worth the trek. We sat inside since the bar menu outside is limited to small plates; the garden is sweet and would make a great weekend afternoon drinking spot.  $3 Budweisers make that likely in my future. Our window table was slightly awkward but the decor is Brooklyn semi-fance and comfortable.  It wasn't too packed; it was nice to have a reservation and we were seated right away. Service was above and beyond.  When we waited a bit too long for our drinks, they were comped- and we never waited too long between courses.  Our lovely server was attentive & generous with her time, since the cryptic menu begs for explanation.  I went with her recommendations and was impressed with: the variety on the salumi plate, the decadence of the fois gras (could be a dessert), and the rich simplicity of my duck agnolatti.  All could have used a bit more of their amazing bread for dipping and spreading, but when we asked, we received- so plus points for less waste! The dessert menu was surprisingly slim, but when the savory menu is ever-changing, you can't be fooling around with your sweets every night.  Overall I was impressed with the ingredients, simplicity & share-ability.  I'd love to try the outside bar menu, and whatever they invent as the seasons change!         The somewhat high price point will keep this place reserved for special occasions- this is still next to Gowanus, after all.  That being said, I look forward to the next special occasion!
