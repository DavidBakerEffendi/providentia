My partner and I were driving through the Hartford area when we noticed an interesting plaza (okay, it was really the Whole Foods drawing us in) and were surprised to see a Noodles and Company. I haven't been to one since my Vegas vacation about four years ago and I had fond memories of the selection and food. We decided to stop in. I thought their selections were pretty good. Wide range of American noodle dishes, Italian pasta dishes and traditional Asian dishes. I stupidly went with the steak stroganoff instead of the pad Thai. My partner went with the Indonesian dish. He loved his. It was a bit too spicy for me though. I thought mind was bland and boring. The prices were fine so no complaints there. My partner got an interesting beer from a local brewery that he thought was fantastic. Table service was okay and the interior was pretty nice. I'd have to try a different noodle dish next time as I left hungry and my palette left bored.
