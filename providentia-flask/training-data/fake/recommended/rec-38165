Devon was a pleasure to have as a waiter. The andouille chicken gumbo was amazing. The fat boy is such a great platter to share we had pork chops and whitening and they were both so good. Okra amazing. Dirty rice so good too. We are definitely coming back. At ever the chef came out to greet us with a smile. It was a great experience.
