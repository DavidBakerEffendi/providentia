Wow, I can't say enough good things about this place. The food is exquisite. Think your usual Thai flavors x 2 plus other great and unique dishes and flavors. Service was incredibly fast (maybe even too fast, like they wanted us in and out?), appetizers out in 5 minutes and dinner maybe 10 minutes later. Waiter was very nice though. No reservations for small parties but we managed to get a table easily. Highly recommend!
