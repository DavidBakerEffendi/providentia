I am Indian so I know what authentic Indian food should taste like. You cannot go wrong with any of the choices here. Their naan is cooked to perfection. Chicken Tikka Masala has the right amount of spices. Fish Vindaloo is the freshest Indian fish I have ever tasted. Keep it up guys from management, cooks, to the servers. Everyone is doing a great job and hope many many years of the same kind of service, quality, prices and selections.
