There aren't many places you can get some good eats and then take a few steps over to the night club and shake you're groove thing.  I recommend the chicken sand which with a bucket of coronitas. Be warned though,  it gets pretty wild in the club.  I once saw a guy doing ribbon dancing in the middle of the floor!  RIBBON DANCING.  How'd he get past the bouncer with those!?!?
