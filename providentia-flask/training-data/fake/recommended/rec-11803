The moment you walk in you wouldnt even think that you are in willamsburg. The atmosphere is more french than anywhere I have been in Paris. Â We got there for dinner one early evening, before the crowd came, so we got all the attention of the server. Unpretentious service. And all his recommendations were spot on. Unforgettable. The Pissaladiere went so well with the house chardonnay I still think about it from time to time.
