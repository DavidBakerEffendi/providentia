This place is amazing. Somehow I never came here during the year I lived in University City, but now that Phil H. lives nearby Mood has become one of our favorite places and a standard weekend visit. Chaat is fast, flavorful and filling. And cheap. It's a great value and among the chaats I've tried, there isn't a bad one. I usually go for "spicy" and my boyfriend gets medium, but since chaat includes fruit and yogurt it's never overwhelmingly spicy. This is a UCity gem.
