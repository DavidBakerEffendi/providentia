Fare, you're making me sad.   We've been back two more times since our first experience only last month.  It is disturbing to see a different menu and menu format every time I come in.  Other than the inconsistency of seeing the same dishes described and listed in a different manner each time, the most upsetting change is the removal of the house wines.  The waitress said they were incorporated into the wine list, but they no longer offer the Cabernet Sauvignon and the cheapest glasses are now $6 instead of the $5.50 (There isn't a reasonably priced Cab on the list).  Gone are the bullet points on the menus, too, which I had appreciated in my last review.   The service was still good, the tables somewhat reasonably spaced, and the food is great.  I still think this place could benefit from dimming their overhead lights, but the ambiance isn't bad.   I can appreciate a constantly changing menu, but the dishes are still the same for the most part, just listed differently each and every time.  Among all the format changes, I've only seen one addition to the menu as far as vegetarian options go, but I have yet to try the new seitan dish.  The vegetarian onion soup is quite good although difficult to eat.  The same goes for the beet salad with goat ricotta, but I still love it.  I would not recommend ordering either of those dishes while on a date or at a dinner with clients. I still support their local, organic, & sustainable initiatives, and their food is still great, but Fare could benefit from some consistency.
