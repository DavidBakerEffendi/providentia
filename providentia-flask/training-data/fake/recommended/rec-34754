It's pricey and the plates are small...BUT.... If I'm rating the food, decor, and service...it's great. Three of my friends and I shared 3 meat entrees, 1 veggie entree, a bottle of red wine, and 3 different types of desserts..and it came out to be about $36 per person. Kibbeh Naya & Duck Shawarma meat entree were pretty yummy. The meat was tender. We had like 3 different waitresses who were making sure we were taken care of. When I was about to sit down, I saw that there was a specs of water on my seat (which could've been easy taken care of by wiping it with a napkin), but the hostess insisted on getting my " a fresh chair" rather than just trying to wipe it on the spot.
