My cousin and I came here the night before our ill-fated (but unexpectedly positively outcomed) half marathon.  Perhaps we can credit Continental for our moderate success?  Maybe the true plan for running distance is: 1) Not training (Ok, maybe run a bit - but never over 6 miles) 2) Splitting small plates: Sesame Spinach (good generic Asian flavor, I wouldn't count it towards my daily veggie requirement though); Shrimp sliders (on steamed buns - spicy mayo threw us off but who doesn't like fried shrimp and dough?); pork soft tacos (spicy and simple, our favorite) 2) Drinking $4 cocktails & trying new IPA's.  Hydration is key.   3) Not skipping dessert: We split a blondie sundae of sorts.  Reminded me that I used to bake them all the time and should look for a new, moist recipe to mimic these.  All they were missing were some dark chocolate chips/chunks.  Thankfully no walnuts. 4) Extremely reasonable prices. The bartender (Receipt name: Axel) was friendly and gave us honest recommendations.  He also suggested other places to go out and see in Philadelphia.   Even though this is kind of a chain, I think it's safe to say that I would return before another race!
