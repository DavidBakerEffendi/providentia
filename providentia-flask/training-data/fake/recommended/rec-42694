Best ramen I have had. Their pork buns are also amazing. In 5 days, we went back here twice since it was perfect for a cold NY day. Best ramen I've had! Their suggestions are always recommended and a good addition. Their classic is my favorite. We had the spicy one and also the bold one Both were so good. The lines can get very long so try to come at a time that's it's not the busiest. The quality of the broth is heartwarming. The eggs are cooks perfectly as well. The service was great! Great little restaurant. I'll never look at ramen the same.
