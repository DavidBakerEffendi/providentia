A great place to get your drink on! Great interesting beer selection (strong German beers) and size (no das boot but half liter or full liter about $7/$14). They served some traditional German food like pretzels and sausage. The atmosphere was well worth the trip. I came on a Saturday and the place rocking. People were dressed in German attire, including some patrons. There was German style dancing, live music, Jenga, and ping pong tables. People we so nice and it was a really good time. It was very loud but if you're out with a group looking to get drunk and have a good time, I definitely would recommend this place!
