My husband and I were traveling to NYC for pleasure, and I did plenty of research for excellent restaurants.  I jumped through all of the necessary hoops to get a restaurant at the Little Owl, and we were so excited about our  meal.  The neighborhood is positively gorgeous, and the street in particular was stunning.  Our food was fabulous.  The service was icy and rude.  My husband and I decided to get a little dressed up for our dinner and I believe the server thought less of us for it.  It was such a shame to have such terrible service, because the food was really excellent.
