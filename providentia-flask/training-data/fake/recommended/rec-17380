Hands down, my favorite pizza place EVER!!! I wait for nothing! but YES I will wait on the sidewalk in the freezing cold or heat of the summer for Grimaldi's and you'll more than likely have to wait again if you have to use the restroom, but it's not too bad and you'll be able to watch the staff prep the pizzas and pull them from the brick oven. The price is right and it's so delicious if you're going to wait for a table you might as well order one pizza there and put in an order to take one to go. Warm it up in the oven at home and it still tastes great. If you're shy or anti social this is not the place for you, because yes - you will be practically sitting in your neighbors lap. I love the pepperoni and sausage toppings. My favorite place on the east coast :) I miss the happy little feeling I get when I'm in line and they call a party of 2 and you get to skip over a few larger parties to head inside to your table ;) Grimaldi's = a must!
