Cuban Pete's is really cute.  They did a great job with the decor and that's why it has 2 stars.  After that it starts to go downhill.  The place is cramped; they practically have tables on top of one another.  The service is really slow, and they don't have a liquor license so you can't drink to pass the time or forget how long the waiter took.   I have been there about 5 times and always the appetizers are really good and the entrées are just not.  I don't know what it is with them, but their entrees are overly sweet.  I had the lechon and it tasted like they put sugar or real oranges in it.  Lechon is not supposed to be sweet.  They are supposed use sour oranges (a specific type of orange that is bitter).  It's too bad because it was cooked really well, but I couldn't get past how sweet it was.  It's not that I don't enjoy sweet entrées.  I like meats with fruits or glazes.  They are just taking entrees that are not supposed to be sweet and making them sweet.  They don't taste balanced, and it doesn't compliment the other seasonings.  On another occasion, I ordered fish that was done in a coconut mango sauce, and it was extremely sweet, but I didn't mind it as much, because as least the components went well together.  I wonder if they were catering to a more American palette.   Either way, most of the entrées just don't taste Cuban and yes I am Cuban.  They take Cuban dishes and really do their own thing with them.  I wouldn't mind if the change was inspired, but it's not.   Slow waiters, cramped tables, no liquor, mostly bad entrées, yet tasty appetizers and nice decor= 2 stars.  Take an extra 10 minute ride and hit a Cuban place in Hudson County like Las Palmas or Rumba Cubana for an authentic experience.
