Go for the truffle fries... Cool outdoor seating area.  I had a brunch here with a couple of friends about a month ago.  The wait time was borderline outrageous, but the food and service made up for it. I had the granola (homemade), the burger (with avocado and special sauce I think, it's been a while), truffle fries, and a peach mimosa.  Expect to spend a bit when you visit so if you're looking for cheap eats, this wouldn't be the place in particular.  The homemade granola was fresh and HUGE.  I couldn't finish it in one sitting.  Actually, everything  serve comes in large portions.  My friends had the oysters and truffle fries, and the "Big Breakkie".  I think that's one of the crowd favorites.  We enjoyed our meals and the waitstaff wasn't overbearing.  That can sometimes ruin the mood when you want to relax and enjoy brunch.  It's pretty small and I'm not married/sold to the idea of coming back; maybe if I'm in the area
