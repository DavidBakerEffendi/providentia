I love this food truck. It's in FiDi every Monday and I always order the Lemon Chicken over Basmati Rice ($6). It's a dollar more than the other guy 10 feet away, and doesn't come with water or a soda, but here are the perks: Bigger portion (I have 2 meals out of this) Caramelized Onions *NOT* Iceburg lettuce salad (mixed greens) Tasty cooked chickpeas My Monday staple if I'm not trapped by back-to-back meetings. Highly recommend this place, because it's not your typical chicken and rice (although I do miss the guys at 53rd and 6th Halal Cart for their heaping portions and tastiness).
