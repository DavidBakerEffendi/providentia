I came to Miriam with two girl friends for dinner on a Friday evening.  The best part of the meal was the great price - $9 for 4 items from the meze menu, which we all decided to take advantage of, and it was definitely enough to fill each of us up.  We all also ordered an appetizer of their special crab gazpacho which was my favorite food item from the whole meal.  Our large pitcher of sangria was refreshing and tasted great as well. The inside of Miriam is super cute and the service was friendly and prompt.  I was satisfied with each of my choices from the meze menu and the bread that was brought to the table was warm and delicious.  I had a very good experience at Miriam and will most likely be back in the near future.
