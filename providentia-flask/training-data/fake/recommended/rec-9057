AMAZING!!!!!  Everything was delish, and the atmosphere is warm, comfortable but also exciting.  I cannot wait to go back.  Some of my favorite dishes were the Crispy Calamari, Grilled Octopus, Bean Salad, Crispy Sweetbreads, Tomato, Scallion, Garlic, Olive, Lemon Yogurt, Kefi Mac & Cheese, Braised Lamb Shank, Orzo and the Grilled Branzino, Potato, Olive, Tomato.  I cannot wait to go back and try other dishes.
