My coworker has introduced me to this place and boy am I hooked! The sushi is super fresh ( been to quite a few of them) and take advantage of their check in deal and lunch special of two rolls, 1 salad and soup! You can't beat it! Lunch special is also valid in weekends! My coworker and I read the yelp reviews and decided to try the tuna dumplings which were AWESOME! Can't wait to go back, I am a new fan!
