I stopped in for takeout while staying at a nearby hotel. First off, their website is completely broken. I ended up going to menupages with led me to seemless, their online ordering provider. I got the dumplings and the green curry chicken with brown rice. Overall, it was very good but nothing extraordinary. Typical good Thai food you can find in any major city. The chicken was hard to find in my green curry, but the sauce was excellent. Â The dumplings seem scare on the meat as well. I know their prices are pretty low, but the lack of meat was annoying. Overall, good, but not great.
