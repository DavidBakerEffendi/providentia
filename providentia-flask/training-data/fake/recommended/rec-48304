Went tonight. We'd enjoyed the brunch and wanted a special dinner. I had high expectations but was quite disappointed. Â Not sure what fuss is about. Now I suspect I'll be an outlier amongst all the four and five star reviews, and I will grant you this was one meal (and a brunch) but it really did seem a bit "emperor's new clothes". On the plus side: Atmosphere very nice with fireplace and all. Quite romantic. On the minus: the food. First and foremost I'd told the waiter I didn't eat meat - only fish (they had a nice tasting menu waiter had recommended but he couldn't figure out a way to make it meatless). So I order the grouper with collards which contained (surprise!) meat, which I discovered after buying into them. Pretty bad mistake since I told him specifically I didn't eat meat. Ok, but that's a rare occasion, you say - and now you're writing a bad yelp review cause your experience was bad. Trust me, though, the food was simply mediocre. Scallops undercooked. Lobster app tasty but nothing special. Veal app (which my gf ate) bland. And after I got the grouper main back with meatless veggies and the now reheated fish -- the fish was bone dry and the veggies were oversalted to the point of being inedible. Even my gf who loves salt said it was way too much. The service was perfunctory. Never asked if all was ok. Not bad but not good. The chocolate soufflee dessert was a standard choice but well done. Nothing creative though. Wine was tasty. For the price ($100 with two glasses wine and tip) not a good meal. BRUNCH is another story. Food was good and well prepared. Service attentive. My omelette was cold (too long a wait in kitchen - we waited half hour for food) and they comped it. So I'd hoped to go often - I live nearby - but felt really let down. Maybe brunch I give it two stars for dinner - with the understanding that standards I'm holding it to are high, as are the prices), Plus one for ambience and brunch
