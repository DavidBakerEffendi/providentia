If your adventurous, care about the nutritious content of your food, and have some money to spend (not a cheap place), then I recommend coming here. I love their philosophy, and its consistent in their food, the architecture and atmosphere. Reading their website was entertaining in itself, but being there and seeing all these exotic options really intrigued me. Not to mention an exotic, philosophically strong menu attracts some interesting customers. My favorite item is the Raw Cocao Chocolate Bar with Fig, it works better than coffee. Definetly a place to stop by if your exploring NY
