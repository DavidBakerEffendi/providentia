I used to come here for the coffee, desserts and free Wi-Fi--all of which are solid offerings--but now I know the brunch is great. I will definitely be spending more weekend mornings in Manhattan. I had the salmon brunch special (don't remember the exact name), which was salmon and eggs over and english muffin. The special was more than filling and came with potatoes, OJ and a choice of coffee or cappuccino, all for $11. My friend had eggs with their fried dough, which was really good too. Wait time isn't long.
