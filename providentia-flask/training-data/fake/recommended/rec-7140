Chef White-- I am forever your fan. We came here for Brunch and although the restaurant was oddly empty and extremely quiet--I didnt mind because that meant a relaxed brunch for me and my company. I may try and see what the crowd is like here for dinner. We started with a selection of cured meats aka meat trifecta: the prosciutto, lardo, & salami. All were delicious and came with assorted toasted breads. We then moved on to our brunch plates, I got the Â cappelettti. Little heavenly pillows of perfectly al dente pasta filled with truffle ricotta and covered in butter. Oh yea, it was also topped with toasted pieces of prosciutto. The servings were on the small side, but I was a little distracted by how delicious it was. I can , and hope to one day, eat a BUCKETFULL of this. I heard on Mondays after 9PM pastas are $10 so I may come back and just try the other fresh made pastas. My company had a skirt steak and eggs. Perfectly seasoned and a great medium rare. Can't ever go wrong with this for brunch. We paired our meal with a carafe of peach bellinis. The carafe seemed tiny when it came out--but after all was said and done both of us were borderline buzzed/ drunk. There is a good amount of alcohol in there so don't you worry. TLDR; order the cured meats, pastas and come for a quiet boozy brunch. You won't regret it!
