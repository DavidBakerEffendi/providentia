This place is great.  I have been three times, and each time it's even better than before.  The brunch is amazing, and the dinner menu is also really delicious.  I really enjoyed the cheese plate, especially the fried brie and apple jelly.  From the brunch menu, the standouts are the monte cristo, the Captain Crunch french toast, and the potato galette.  The servers are very friendly, and the food comes quickly.  I recommend this restaurant for anybody.
