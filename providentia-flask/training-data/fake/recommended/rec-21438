I really like ramen a lot and just love noodles in general. So I definitely enjoy ramen places in the city. What I like about Terakawa Ramen is the location in Chinatown, decor and taste (in term of ramen). They're ramen is good, tasty and portion right. The decoration is very classy, clean and modern with an ancient feel. What I don't like though are the chairs, which provides no back support. Also there is no room to put your things. There is a coat hanging place but they're not responsible for lost, stolen or any damage so yea. The service is good, friendly and quick. I have to venture more on the food menu to able to review the rest of the food. So stay tune.
