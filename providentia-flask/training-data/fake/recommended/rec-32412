Chicken cutlet sandwich please! So delicious. When I ordered over the phone they told me what usually comes on it (sauce and cheese - I got mozzarella), which I appreciated since it was my first time. I asked for a few extra things to be added on (lettuce, tomato, and hot peppers) and they were very accommodating. You also get the option of having it cold or toasted in the oven. I got the "whole" sandwich, knowing that I needed something for lunch and for dinner. I was pre-warned by my co-worker that it was huge, but I didn't expect it to be so large! It was basically like having two sandwiches. A half of a "whole" was the size of a Subway sandwich, but obviously much more delicious. The hot peppers on it was great. My only complaint was that between the breading on the chicken and the bread, it was a little dry. There was no sauce on it like the person on the phone stated. It could have used mayo, hot sauce, oil and vinegar or something to help add some moisture. It was just under $16 for a "whole" chicken cutlet grinder, but it is totally worth it for the size and quality. The guys there were really nice too! May not be in the best area, but in the day time I felt perfectly safe. There is seating inside but I got take out. They take credit card, $5 minimum. Small parking lot available too.
