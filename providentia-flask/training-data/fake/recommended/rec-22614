I took my parents to the Lockyard for lunch. What a cozy space with delicious comfort food and great craft beer. The bartender was very nice and offered us some tasting cups of beers when we were having trouble deciding what to order. The music playing was a fun mix of 50's and 60's classics and the food was delish! Â Mom had the Johnny Cash hotdog, Dad the Brat and I had the bacon and cheese hot dog - and we shared the hot mess french fries. I look forward to trying the beer garden next time. Love this place!
