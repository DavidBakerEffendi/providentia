It was busy and for NYC the place is medium in size. For those not used to communal dining it was an experience especially when you factor in a buffet line. Food was ok and you pay for by per pound as they weigh it. Not sure we'd go back unless we needed to grab a quick bite and not sure as to what to eat so buffet selection would help.
