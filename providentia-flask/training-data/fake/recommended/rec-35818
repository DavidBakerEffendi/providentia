Lychee valentine is my favorite but matcha stripe chocolate is a good option too. I tried a savory crepe once and didn't like it but that's probably just my preference for sweet crepes. The store is really small (with just a few small benches) but the crepes are easily packaged for your convenience to eat on the go. Definitely recommend for a quick snack after shopping in soho!
