It's a bar. That serves burgers. Good burgers. Nothing fancy, just straight up burgers. There are only a few (tight) tables. Luckily, my party of 3 did not have a wait. The menu is on a board on the wall. I had the bistro burger-basically a bacon cheeseburger. It was very thick and juicy. I just wish the bun was a little more hearty but for the price, I can't complain. I also got an order of fries which were very similar to that of McDonalds. This is a good thing. Thin and crispy. Super cheap. $10 for a burger. I can't remember the last time I paid that little for a burger in NYC.
