I've been to Eagan's a bunch of times but only a hand full to eat. All those times the food was really good & I made sure to order the Maple Wings as they are super delicious..... Or at least they were until last night. Last night's Maple Wings were HOT (spicy) & so I thought they gave me the wrong thing. I asked the bartender who brought them to me if he accidentally gave me buffalo wings & he replied that they only have 1 type of wings. I had the other guests who were with me try the sauce & they agreed there was no sweet taste as usual but straight buffalo sauce. The plate was also filled with the red hot sauce the wings were covered in. To make sure I didn't get the wrong wings I asked 2 more employees who stared at me like I was crazy & replied the sauce was pre made with a tiny bite of buffalo & more maple. Eagan's, if you have a new cook - get him to learn the wing recipe! If I wanted buffalo wings - I would of went to the bar down the block. The drinks are good & they always have good music playing - once the wings return to normal, I'll up the stars :)
