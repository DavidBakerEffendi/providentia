I am a big fan of fries and this really is as good as it gets. The 30+ sauces are intimidating since it was our first time there but the staff were very friendly and gave us a variety of samples to try with some fries. Simply ask, and don't worry about holding the line up. Others are likely just as lost as you are. The fries were crispy, fluffy and done exceptionally well, best I've ever had. We tried the mango chutney, vietnamese pineapple, rosemary garlic mayo and the especial (free). Our favorite was the vietnamese pineapple but I have a feeling others will have different preferences. Be adventurous and go with your instincts. The regular is honestly more than enough for 2 @ $4.50. This will become a regular of mine.
