I will dub this "soup dumpling fiasco part 2": I ordered some soup dumplings to go from DSG when I was in town for a conference. I'm not from the area and not familiar. The lady on the phone asked me if I knew the address,  and I said yes,  thinking that was odd. As I walked the short trek from the hotel,  I see a sign for "Dim Sum Garden" so I walk in and say I have a carryout order,  only to realize after paying that there are TWO UNRELATED DIM SUM GARDENS in the same one block radius. To make a long story short,  I ended up with 2 boxes of soup dumplings. I wish the lady on the phone explained that there were two restaurants of the same name. This has clearly happened before,  since she even called me again to make sure I was coming. So,  the actual soup dumplings were good,   though more gingery than the ones from the other reastaurant,  and the meat was drier. The restaurant interior is nice and somewhat moderb looking. I would have liked to eat in for dim sum but just didn't have the time. The moral of this story is,  this restaurant is not to be confused with the one on 11th (?).
