MMM... this place is delicious and I highly recommend it for some good old, no nonsense food. It's tiny and cozy, but no frills here. Get a burger - it's so juicy and perfectly cooked. The fries are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. If you want something a little different, go for the spicy fries. If you're looking for a low key spot for a couple of friends or a simple date, this is the place.
