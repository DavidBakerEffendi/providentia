Great flavors. This is not authentic for authentic's sake, this is Mexican done up. Try it. Drinks need to be worked on though, I agree with the other reviewer on that one. The food is fantastic though. I you seek authentic Mexican in New Haven though, stay away and go to Grand Avenue in Fair Haven, the hotspot for Mexican now. Try either one of Tortilleria Michoacana (Grand Ave.), Taqueria Jalisciences (Grand Ave.), Guadalupe La Poblanita (parallel to Grand Ave. on Chapel Street and Blatchley Ave.). These neighborhood establishments reign supreme for me to get my "autentico" fix.
