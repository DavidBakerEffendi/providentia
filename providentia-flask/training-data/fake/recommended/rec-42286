Rabbit compote with poached eggs were amazing!!! Grits were not great and biscuit wasn't hot. Bloody Mary was pretty good. The bartender made a sour cherry side car that looked amazing bur being I was working on my second bloody Mary, I thought it wise to try it next visit ( and there shall be more visits and reviews). Go for the toast and home fries and you won't go wrong.
