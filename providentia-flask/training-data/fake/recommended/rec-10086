Hands down da' bomb!! I grew up with Peruvian cuisine as my stepfather lived there for years and my uncle is from there. We ate Peruvian or my mom cooked it frequently. When I met Eddie (COO of Pio Pio) through a mutual friend we talked about authentic spices and flavors. This was at the UWS location. Vibrant atmosphere, loud but not overwhelming music and AMAZING food. When we visited the 10th Ave location my jaw dropped. The downstairs reminds you of Buddhakan as it is sunken with ridiculously high ceilings and oozed sexy. The decor is top notch with murals of roadways that make you feel outdoors and panels of actual tree branches. I threw my husband a surprise bday dinner last week there with 8 other couples whom had never been and they were all and still are raving. I ordered family style and started with pisco sours for the table. Pisco is a Peruvian liquor the drink had the perfect balance with its foamy top. As starters we had ceviche mixto and the fried seafood platter. I don't do much fried food but it was light and tasty, the seafood was fresh. For main course we had lomo saltado & the Pio Combo. The beef in the lomo was tender and savory the potatoes soaked up the juices from the meat, peppers and onions. The chicken is what put them on the map and when you have it you'll know why. The flavor has to be injected into it because it flows throughout each morsel. I never eat the skin...unless its at pio Pio! All the sides were perfect accompaniments: plantains, tostones, black beans and rice. The service was superb our waitress had started that same week but worked out loud and boisterous table like a violin. I'm a true foodie and Pio Pio is one of my top 5 restaurants. I'll keep going back. ~Ivonne aka Epi-Curator
