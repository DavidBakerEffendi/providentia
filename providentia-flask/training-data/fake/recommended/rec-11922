One of the best sushi places around, hands down. And, luckily, it's located just a few feet away from our place here in Brooklyn Heights. So, what makes this place so great? Well, first off, the food is tasty! They offer both mainstream rolls (spicy tuna, Philadelphia, etc.) and speciality rolls... and also feature daily chef's specials, bento boxes, etc. etc. Some of my favorite rolls from the menu include the Monkey Roll (shrimp tempura w/ avocado and spicy sauce) and the Crazy Dragon Rol (spicy crabmeat w/ eel, tuna, & salmon). Also tasty at Iron Chef are the appetizers, soups, and salads. I recommend the Yaki Udon chicken noodle soup! Awesome!! As for atmosphere, it's great, too. The place is small and intimate and adorned w/ dark wood fixtures and aged brick... very classy and perfect for an intimate date for two or dinner out with a small group.
