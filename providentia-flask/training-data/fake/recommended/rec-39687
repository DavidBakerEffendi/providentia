I loved the food at El Cocotero. I've been coming here for years, I wish I could say I've tried a lot of different things on the menu but the truth is I'm loyal to the Patacones (the plantain cuban-like sandwiches) and the arepas.  The pork patacon (La Moronta) and the shredded beef patacon (El Pabellon) are simply yummy!!!!!  Favorite drinks here are the passion fruit juice and the tamarindo (although I have to admit the second is an acquired taste).
