I went to Ilili this past Sunday for brunch. Their prix-fixe menu was impressive and I was really happy with my order: Chakchouka Eggs in Cocotte: spicy tomato sauce, three poached eggs, hash brown dumplings, arugula salad, grilled beets with honey butter, fresh-squeezed OJ, and hot, fluffy pita bread. Bonus - check in on Four Square and the chef will send out a free drink (during lunch/dinner) or mini dessert (during brunch)!
