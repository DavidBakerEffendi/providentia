There was a line out the door for brunch yesterday. I found Buttermilk Channel by searching on Yelp yesterday morning and nearly turned around when I got there and saw the crowd on the sidewalk. My friend was a little annoyed that I had made him walk 20 minutes for brunch, though, and made me stay. Wow! The hostess (are we still calling them that? It sounds so un-PC) was really friendly and had us seated within 2 or 3 minutes when she had told us it would be 20. Very nice. I had the pecan pie french toast. Incredible. It was like cake, but for breakfast. The sauce was perfect, the coffee was good, the mimosa was about what you expect on a Sunday morning. The server was attentive but not overbearing. If I were a brunch person, this would be my go-to place. I'm not though, so it's on the short list of places I go when I get the urge every couple of months.
