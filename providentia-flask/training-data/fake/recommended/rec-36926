absolutely love this place. one of my favorite place in manhattan. the best mojito ever. especially in summer night, get a kiwi mojito at the bar. great ambiance, fabulous drinks. i tried salmon or something fish dish, it was above average, but i can't remember details. it was just good. if not drinking, i'd rather go for brunch during weekend. FANTASTIC french toast, yummy and hearty(?) bloody mary :-) grilled potato on side was great too. i've never made reservation to get a table here, but always able to get chairs at the bar. i don't mind eating at the bar here, because bartenders can make real good drinks and don't try to make annoying conversation. a little expensive, but worth it.
