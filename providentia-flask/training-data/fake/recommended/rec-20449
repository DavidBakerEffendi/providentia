I know we were late to the party on this one but Traif did not disappoint. One of the reviews I read said it was a life changing experience -- they were not kidding. We had the following: Mission Fig and butter lettuce salad with truffle vinaigrette; Scallops and creamed corn; Strawberry and cinnamon spareribs; Broccoli rabe, egg and toast and the short rib sliders. All I can say, and the hubby would agree -- Insane! We finished the meal with the bacon donuts and key lime pie. Unreal.
