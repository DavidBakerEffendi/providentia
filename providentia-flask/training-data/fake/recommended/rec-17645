Pete's is great. I have only eaten here once, but I found the food to be delicious, and the ambiance to be quite enjoyable. The decor is fantastic -- the outdoor patio is beautifully decorated, and indoors you feel like you're on vacation, rather than Bloomfield Ave. The location is prime. The food is very good, prices decent, table service was good, wait staff was friendly. I ordered fish - and they brought it whole, and I had to debone the whole thing before digging in. That kind of grossed me out, but I know that that's part of Cuban Pete's rustic vibe. Other than that, my friends' dishes were also good and our sides were good. The only reason I didn't give more stars is because I am just not into this kind of cuisine, but I still wanted to try it. This place came highly recommended to me, and I would recommend it to others looking for something new, exciting, and delicious!
