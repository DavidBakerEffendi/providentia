I come here at least once every 2 weeks with my boyfriend, and we both thoroughly enjoy this place.  We consider ourselves "sushi snobs" and we love the food here, so I'm confused by some of the bad reviews on this page.  I think it's normal to have the expectation for an all-you-can-eat sushi place that the food is poor quality, but it's really not at all!  The fish is always fresh, the other food items are tasty, the service is fast, and you can't beat BYO.  I'll say it again... I come here very often, and I'm never disappointed.  The best thing on the menu... the Godzilla Roll!!
