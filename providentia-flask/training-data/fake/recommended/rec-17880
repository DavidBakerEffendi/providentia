This little cafe is the epitome of what we need in NYC; good people, preparing excellent, high quality food, with local ingredients and not overcharging for it,like most shops in its class.   The pork sandwich with broccoli rabe, HOLY $&@!   This sandwich is by far the BEST pork sandwich in NYC, and possibly top 3 sandwiches of all time in New York.   This place is wonderful, even the rotisserie chicken is something special, to the egg sandwiches for breakfast.     Just lovely this place, they even have a quaint little backyard to hang out in.   If you're ever in Prospect Heights, make it a point to stop here and grab some food, even if you're not hungry, throw it in your fridge for later, you'll thank me.
