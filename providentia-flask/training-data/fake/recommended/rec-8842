I went here for a work dinner we hosted this past week.  We sat in a private section overlooking the restaurant.  The food was fantastic and service was great.  We had a party of 11 people.   The only complaint I had was that we were NEVER presented with the bill.  It was quite odd and left a bad taste in my mouth.   We then asked for the bill multiple times and it wasn't presented for a long period of time.  It made you think something shady was going on.  We were told it was closed out.  I never got to review and sign the check.  More importantly the gratuity was automatically 15% and I was unable to put extra gratuity on if I wanted to (I always leave at least 20%).  The bill was finally presented at the end of the night already closed out.  I've never had that experience before and I host work dinners quite often.  We had a minimum amount we had to meet for the dinner - so we didn't even have the option to order more to meet the minimum.  I was disappointed with this from a business perspective.  This was by no means a service/server issue.  Rather it's a management issue.   5 for food.  The lower rating is for the management issue.
