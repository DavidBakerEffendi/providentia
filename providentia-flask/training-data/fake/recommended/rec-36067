I tried this place a couple of times; once for dinner and once for breakfast.   For dinner, the waiter pretty much ignored the table and after 20 minutes, we left. For breakfast, the food was average at best and seriously overpriced given the quality.  Again, the waiter wasn't that great. The only redeeming quality about this place is the host and supporting staff. You can do far better in NYC for this amount of money.
