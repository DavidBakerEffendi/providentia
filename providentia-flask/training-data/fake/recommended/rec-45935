Choosing a proper spot to order a sushi lunch can be a challenge. I have noticed in a variety of places, for some reason, lunch rice is dry. I am not sure if it is prepared the night before, if it is the leftover from the previous dinner, or if it is made too early in the morning. Any which way, Sushiya has fallen victim to bad lunch quality. The lunch quality of their sushi rolls is low. I ordered take-out while in the store, so no significant amount of time had passed from the time it was rolled until the time I ate it. The rice was dry. The raw fish was dry and lacked flavor. I finished the rolls but not happily. Overall, I could compare it to grocery store sushi. If you have no other option, I suppose it is okay for one time. Otherwise, I would not recommend Sushiya -- shame, because the name is fun.
