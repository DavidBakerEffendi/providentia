My boyfriend wanted to come here because he heard good things about this place but I was not impressed at all. We ordered a pitcher of mojito and it tasted ok, it tasted like they put oj instead of lime juice an seltzer. We ordered the guacamole and homemade chips, the guacamole was good but tasted like it was store bought but the chips were good... homemade plaintain and batata chips. I ordered the arepa de pollo, which had chicken, caramelized onions and cheddar. It was kind of bland, maybe would've been better if the chicken and onions were cooked together. My boyfriend had the arepa with shredded beef, beans, cheese and sweet plaintains, when I took a bite all I could taste was salt. I was not impressed with the food or drinks and most likely will not be returning to this location.
