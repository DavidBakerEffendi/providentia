Very Fresh seafood, prepared simply with great ingredients. I've been there a few times, the vibe is casual, its BYOB and the staff doesnt blow me away with service. Its not a technically challenging menu but the simple preparations are executed flawlessly. The warm goat cheese salad really stands out. The Salmon, Swordfish and halibut are all excellent. The Yellowfin really stood out as the two sauces served with it were outstanding. Its not inexpensive. But the value is certainly there as its consistently a great experience.
