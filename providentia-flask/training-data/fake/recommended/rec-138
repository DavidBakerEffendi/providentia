Formosa is probably the best restaurant for Chinese food in the New Haven area. I have not tried the sushi yet but the Chinese food is authentic. With that said, this place uses quite a bit of msg and their prices are on the higher end. My most recent trip was for hot pot. Its $21 dollars per person (not all you can eat but a decent amount of food). The ingredients are fresher than hot pot at Great Wall in New Haven.
