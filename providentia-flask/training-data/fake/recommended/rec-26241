This review is for the burger only.. since I thought that was what the hype was Sure, burger is cheap and a great late night snack.. but I must say I was underwhelmed by it after reading so many good reviews on here. I think the way to go about eating this burger is to not have any expectations, then you might be blown away by the good deal you're getting on this pretty decent burger.. But then again, $8... I'd rather get myself shake shack (but of course they're not open as late)
