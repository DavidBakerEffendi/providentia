I only discovered this place recently and was pleasantly surprised. The food was good and portions are rather large. Â  Chicken tasted real (since we know how some Chinese places can be...) I've been looking for a good Chinese place around Morris county and haven't found one until now, hence, I give it all the stars until they prove otherwise... ha ha
