The food looked spectacular, but tasted about average. I think after reading the reviews, my expectations were pretty high. Everything about the experience was great, but again the food just "good". The service was great and attentive. The atmosphere is inviting, it is a small, cozy setting. My favorite part of the meal were the apps. The Artisan cheese platter was a nice assortment and quite flavorful. The special of the night was also very good, an oyster based chowder that we ordered to split, they brought it in two separate bowls for four of us to share. The rest of the food was "good", very edible, but nothing out of the ordinary. The onion soup and the steak with pur√©e potato, were exactly that, onion soup and steak with mashed potatoes. Overall... great experience + average food = no regrets trying once.
