After a pretty subpar experience at Nom Nom Ramen, I began to give up hope for a good ramen experience in the city. I also received a strongly-worded attack on my critique by the owner of Nom Nom, so I was even less inclined to return to what I thought was the only ramen place. Thank goodness for Terakawa. Really authentic flavors, and they really provide the variety that a Japanese ramen place should have (love that you can add ingredients, add extra ramen, select among different ramen types). I was surprised to see that most of the chefs behind the counter were Cantonese, but I feel like they work quite hard to make a good, authentic bowl of ramen. The Terakawa ramen is a solid tonkotsu ramen with a lot thrown in actually. The tonkotsu has rich flavor, and I'm really glad I had that during my first visit. The miso ramen was decent, but I really would have liked it to be a tad stronger. It tasted a little muddled. Very fair with pricing, and the gyoza/karaage were great in terms of portion + flavor.
