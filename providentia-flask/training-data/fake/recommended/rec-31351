There is nothing "wrong" with this restaurant. The service is good and the environment is nice. That being said, it is an Argentine-style restaurant that caters to American culinary tastes and is not a very authentic Argentine place. If you are looking for a classic empanada, asado, etc. experience, this is not the place. The empanadas were "light" on flavor and lacked the punch or filling needed to make them tasty. The matambrito has a different filler than the typical stuffed matambre in Argentina and is also served fully cooked and warm rather than cold. I did have a lomito sandwich which was probably a better value compared to the beef dishes. I would skip the empanadas as an appetizer entirely. If you are looking for "real" Argentine food at a similar price point, keep looking. If you are looking for a nice place to eat a sort-of American-style dinner with a not-very-authentic Argentine "twist," then go here.
