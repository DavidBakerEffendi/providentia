I will NEVER return to this place.  I just left there without finishing eating after witnessing a racist incident by one of the employees.  A guy behind the counter, who was perhaps in his 40s, was hassling a young Spanish boy (who was no older than maybe 12).  He was telling the kid how "this is the US. We speak English, and you need to learn English too."  The kid had done nothing wrong and was about to leave.  He asked the guy a question and was treated like dirt in return.  My girlfriend complained to the manager about it, who couldn't have cared less either.
