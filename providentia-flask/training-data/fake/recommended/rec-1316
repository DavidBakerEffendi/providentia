With the impressive display I was expecting an extremely delicious sandwich. Instead, I ended up calling the whole thing overrated. My sandwich was bland, and the service so-so. I heard that friends who went across the way to Pat's had a better experience, which is saying a lot since Geno's has the more attractive display. Hate to say I found much to be desire at this one. Oh well, hopefully better luck next time.
