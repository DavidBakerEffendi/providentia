I came here on a Saturday evening to meet up with some friends before heading out for a night of karaoke. I picked this place because it was easily accessible by everyone. I walked into the bar around 7, and saw a nice-sized crowd in there. There weren't any tables, and only one seat at the bar. I waited at the bar until a table opened up. The beer selection was fantastic. Wide variety, and I appreciated the server's prompt attention, and willingness to give samples and recommendations. The nachos were fantastic, and I left with a good buzz. I will definitely be back.
