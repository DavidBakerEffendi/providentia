Brunch was such a delight here on a sunny Saturday afternoon. Our early arrival before 12pm meant we had the bright, open space nearly to ourselves and the full attention of a sweet, if slightly spacy server. I had the coconut brioche French toast ($12), which came in a healthy serving of three slices and fruit. I'm usually a savory breakfast girl through and through, but today this sweet concoction was the perfect counterpart to a side of spicy merguez sausage. It was a healthy serving of four slices. My friend had the green eggs with quinoa hash, which was also quite tasty. Washed down with two coffees, this was my ideal Saturday brunch situation.
