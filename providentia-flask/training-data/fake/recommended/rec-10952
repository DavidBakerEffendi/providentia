I ate here last friday, and it was pretty disappointing. The atmosphere is cute enough, but if it's raining (which it was), there is a definite lack of table options. Waited about 45 minutes. Went to get a drink at the bar to wait, and when I went to pay for my cider she said the bar is cash only. Guess I won't be drinking during my wait. Server was lovely. The scallops were really delicious, and I hear the shrimp was good too. Crab legs were tasteless, which is so beyond unacceptable for a place called Brooklyn Crab. The fried clams were pretty taste free as well, and the fries were a travesty. The prices here are absolutely insane! $18 for a fried clam basket?  Not so much. $23 for 6 scallops.  Food came out at different times, which I hate and they forgot our fries. Anger feelings. Was looking forward to eating here, wouldn't go back.
