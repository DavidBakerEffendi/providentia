For the price, I was a little disappointed. I went with my Moroccan boyfriend hoping to get a similar taste to what we had eaten in other Moroccan restaurants (notable a great one in Philly). The food was good but sweet bread I specifically went for wasn't very sweet. Savory but not like fried dough full of chicken (which is what I wanted). He enjoyed and the atmosphere is lovely. Go in the summer, sit outside.
