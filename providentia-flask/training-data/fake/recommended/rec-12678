Been wanting to try this place for weeks now, but couldn't possibly justify the long waits described by the other reviewers here. I'm usually wary of popular American places due to many terrible experiences in the past, but this one beyond delivered when I finally got to try it yesterday. Walked into the restaurant around 3PM, two hours before the restaurant/bakery was supposed to close before dinner. Note that the kitchen closes at 4PM. My eating partner and I got seated right away and started with the lobster bisque. For $9, it couldn't possibly live up to the cheaper and tastier seafood bisque I've had in Pike Place Market of Seattle, but it was as decent as NYC food "that doesn't quite hit the excellent mark" goes. The creamy soup and the small chunks of very well-cooked lobster left me satisfied. Their coffee was also decent. Now on to the main items we ordered: Chocolate Chunk Pancakes and Brioche French Toast with Bananas and Roasted Pecans. Both were served with maple butter, and both were to die for. The only quirk we (and the next table of young Japanese tourists I happily recommended other NYC eats to) remarked upon was the largeness of the portions that are atypical of NYC. Took my leftover toast to go, that alone was enough for "brunch" today. If you really wanna try different things and you are eating with a group, have one person order any of the pancakes, share the pancakes, and then try the savory items. Their dishes are very well-prepared that I can about guarantee the menu items we didn't have room in our stomachs for are great too. Tip: They're cash-only but there are ATMs across the street.
