I've now had the chance to eat here a couple of times and have come to really enjoy the Farmhouse. The first time I went with my older brother and his wife and their two kids. The baby slept, but the toddler was feeling pretty nuts, and the staff totally fell in love with him. We went early so there was space around our table for him to colour, and they had a few toys for him to play with. They didn't have a specific kids menu, but were willing to do smaller portions of the burgers, mac and cheese, etc. Everything we ordered - the lamburger, pork-burger and my classic beef-burger were delicious. Portions aren't huge but are delicious. The fries are amaaaaaazing, especially with the aoli that comes in the condiment tray with their housemade ketchup, barbecue sauce and... something else. On my next visit I was able to taste one of my favorites, the meatloaf. It was hearty and delicious and elevated from a basic have at home. Â  Service is variable - the time with my nephew our waiter was hot and charming enough that I made it clear he was NOT. MY. SON. When I went recently with girlfriends our waitress wasn't so sweet, I tried asking for a beer recommendation and she just opened the book for me. All in all, one of my go-to spots here in Btown, but to earn a fifth star we need solid and consistent service, and maybe slightly larger portions/lower prices.
