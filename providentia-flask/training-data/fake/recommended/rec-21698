I have been to Palo Santo for dinner on a few occasions. The atmosphere is cozy, the food is amazing and the wine is wonderful. On my last visit, my party of eight had a reservation for 8 PM. We were seated late due to the party before us taking longer than expected to finish up. While we are all easy going and hadn't said a word, the staff took it upon themselves to bring us a round of champagne to enjoy while we waited and they apologized. This type of service is hard to come by these days but reflects the excellence at this establishment. Of course, the staff is attentive during the entire meal as well. The sangria is notable and the wines from Uruguay are unique and tasty. All around, wonderful.
