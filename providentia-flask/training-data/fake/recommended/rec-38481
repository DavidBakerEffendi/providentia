Busy, but worth it. Especially if you're young and energetic. Authentic Korean cuisine which will not disappoint you or your tastebuds. It's the little touches, like the cinnamon tea that the friendly waiter shared, which sealed the deal. You know what'd be fun? Take a bunch of friends over. Be adventurous, don't take BiBimBap. Everything else is sharing sized. It'll be exciting, I promise.
