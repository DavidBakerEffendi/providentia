I love this place.  I have been here many times and like to bring new people here for lunch.  The menu is varied and new items appear often.  What sets this breakfast and lunch place apart from others is the attention to detail. Dishes arrive exactly as promised.  In my opinion the food is quite better than traditional diner food.  Some reviewers have commented that the parking is all on the street, but there is actually a municipal parking deck behind the building (enter around the corner) and a walkway directly out to Park Ave.  Almost forgot to say:  ATTN: Vegans....You will be very happy!
