I guess I am going to have to echo the others that said this spot is a hidden gem. If you are looking for a crepe fix, look no more! To date these are the best crepes I have had on this side of the east river. The goat cheese, rosemary, fig, and date crepe is the champ. The salads are great too. To top it all off you get your coffee French press. Bravo mes amies! A bientot!
