Exposed brick, walls filled with energy and some fantastic food options, this bistro is making its mark on the the Ironbound section. Their menu offers about fifteen tapas and half as many "main plates". We enjoyed 6 tapas to share with four people and it was just the perfect amount. We tried the: pinchos de camerones (3 skewers of 2 fresh shrimp in a spicy spead - excellent) albondigas de pollo ( chicken meat balls in an almond garlic sauce - VERY good), Charcuteria Con Queso ( a variety of Spanish meats and cheese- I found this dish to be nothing special. The meats and cheeses were not complex at all and I feel you could recreate a way better charcuterie from items bought from a grocery store- SKIP IT.) Grilled Calamari - I love that not much is fried here and the calamari was very good! Def recommend Pulpo - Mmmm! They do it justice here. Portion isn't too big for the price but the dish is fantastic! Risotto- very tasty ! The more hearty part of our meal and very filling. Overall we really enjoyed the experience. I only gave 4 stars because I think the price point is off for the menu. Tapas are to be small shareable plates that shouldn't cost the price of an actual meal. Other than that this place is awesome - great cocktail list too. Wonder if they have a happy hour ?
