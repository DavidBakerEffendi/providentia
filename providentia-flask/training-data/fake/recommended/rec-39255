Fantastic service and really fun and tasty food. My parents came into town but accidentally took a detour and were 40 minutes late. I had a reservation and the hostesses were so sweet to save the table for us, kind of unheard of on a busy Friday around 630/7p. From the website I didn't know that it was tapas. Our server was wonderful and she recommended 6-8 plates for the three of us to share. We got 6 plus dessert, yum....And it was surprisingly filling! I would definitely go back.
