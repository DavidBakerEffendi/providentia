True story: As you can tell from the reviews, it's hands down a 5 star experience.  I won't take up any more space raving about the food.  Permit me to illustrate what a class-act the owners of Caesus and their other related establishments are.  My wife suffered a severe medical emergency while at the restaurant (unrelated to the food).  It disrupted their lunch hour and probably resulted in a couple of broken glasses & ?  I went back to restaurant a few hours later offering to pay for damage, they refused.  They asked for my name and address - I was thinking, in case our lawyers needed to write to each other.  About a week later, I received a personalized hand-written "get well card" from the manager and a gift certificate to come back when wife was better.  How many businesses do you know that do that these days?  Maybe I'll take my $$ lawyer there for lunch?  You've got to try their new Smoke Box BBQ in Hamden, CT.
