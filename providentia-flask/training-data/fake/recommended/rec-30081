Have had two great breakfast at this charming place. The pancakes were big and fluffy and the eggs over easy were just right. The coffee was not great but it was good. The toast were great, nice big pieces toasted on a grill. The service was prompt and courteous. Easiest access is to park on Brownell St if coming from downtown, on Whalley if coming toward downtown.
