A go-to spot.  Good for introducing people to the neighborhood.  Chill, relaxed environment good for brunch or dinner. Clean and healthy classic Mediterranean dishes with a healthy portion size. Also good mimosas, different flavors.  Coffee's pretty good, not overpowering. Downside is long wait for a table during weekend brunch hours.
