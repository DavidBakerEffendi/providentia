A group of my friends went there early to grab some drinks at the bar and play some outdoor games before dinner.  We were waiting on a couple of more people, but the host let us know they could seat us when most of the party was there. The atmosphere was fun and relaxing, the bartender Luke put us all in a great mood. But what started as a great night out on a weekday, took a turn for the worst.  It was a Monday night, so while there was a nice crowd, I would not say it was crowded.  The manager that night, VALERIE, decided not to seat 7 out of 8, despite being told otherwise just an hour before. We checked the floors, and there were several tables opened with no line.  Valerie was very dismissive and unconcerned with being accomodating.  For someone with such a high role in an establishment, it left a sour taste in our mouth.  Also, the host, Roger, who was friendly to start had suddenly become very condescending with her around.  The only thing that saved the night, was a great waiter named Conner.  The food was not memorable, but had it not been for the manager's attitude, this place would have probably gotten at least a 3 in rating.  It is fun, with a great view, plus there isn't many places for seafood in Brooklyn.  It's disappointing we had this experience...we've been there before with large groups, but won't be going again.
