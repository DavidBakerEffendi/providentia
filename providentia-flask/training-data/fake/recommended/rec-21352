We have been to this thai restaurant twice and loved it both times. The first time was for my son's birthday. The portions were all large and very tasty. I also thought it was very reasonably priced. The wait staff was very friendly. We loved the lemongrass tofu dish. The red curry was extremely spicy and I'm someone that likes spice! The pineapple rice was good, but probably could have been a bit more flavorful. The waitress surprised my son with a free dessert for his birthday which was so sweet! We took friends from out of town the second time. It was equally delicious. The lemongrass tofu was still our favorite, but we also really enjoyed the Bangkok tofu and the massaman curry. We asked for the drunken noodles to be less spicy and they ended up with not much flavor. Getting the spice level right is our only challenge here. The wait staff was again very nice. We will return and will try their food cart - now if only they could get a bigger parking lot!
