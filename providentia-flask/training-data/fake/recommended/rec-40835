Ambiance - 4 Stars: Pretty cool for a coffee shop, set up well. Lots of tables, and even some couches/chairs to sit in if you want to relax a bit more. Very cozy feel. Service - 2 Stars: Service is slow. Be prepared to wait around 15 minutes for your coffee. Food - 3 Stars: Their food is pretty decent. It's a coffee shop, but they have a fair selection of sandwiches and salads. Have tried a few things - and they're tasty. Portions are small, and prices are high. Coffee - 4 Stars: TONS of specialty drinks, lots of options to choose from. It'll take you 10 minutes to decide what you want to drink. All of the specialty drinks we've had are super delicious. Their regular coffee is pretty good too, but nothing to rave about. One thing to note, the owners and their kids hang around a lot - and they're a bit rude. They act like the "run the place" - oh wait, they do. But that doesn't mean they should let their kids run around and annoy the customers and wait staff. There was one point where we were in there and one of the owners son was pestering the ONLY waitress asking for "the password" to get by while she was carrying a tray. Seriously annoyed me. They'll sit and take up the entire lounge area with laptops/paperwork/toys. Either get an office, or do this at home. I really want to love this place, but I only like it due to the owners' attitudes and the slow service.
