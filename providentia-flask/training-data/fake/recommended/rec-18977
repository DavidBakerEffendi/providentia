Came here on December 26, 2012: Four stars for ambience and good chai!  A very charming place... If I ate something else other than oatmeal, then I could provide a more accurate measurement.  Had the oatmeal with fruit, and hot spiced chai latte.  The oatmeal was pretty standard.  It was probably close to 11am when we went, because I wanted some coffee and a little something, but not necessarily a full lunch.  We got to hang out for quite a while, chatting, getting toasty from the cool winter weather.  The servers were courteous and very accommodating.  A minor hiccup: they brought us the wrong order at first, but quickly ameliorated the confusion and delay.
