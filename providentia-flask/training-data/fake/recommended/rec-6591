I had never heard of Pylos before coming to this restaurant. I assumed it was just another neighborhood Greek place. I ended up being pleasantly surprised by the quality of the menu and food. I had the braised short ribs, which were flavorful and tender - one of the best braised short rib dishes I've had. The menu was moderately priced, and the service friendly. I'd definitely go back with a larger group to try more items on the menu.
