We stumbled upon Market Table after our original brunch plans were thwarted by large crowds and a lack of tables at our first destination. Overall, the experience was definitely well above average, though not perfect. Market Table was busy for a weekend mid-day, but not too noisy or overwhelming. The ambiance was quaint and rustic, but tables were fairly close together and caused some inconvenience when being seated with large jackets and bags (I guess that's NYC in the winter time, though). I went for the Poached Eggs (buttermilk biscuit, grilled ham, & hollandaise.... errr perhaps they should call it Eggs Benedict?). The dish was, by far, the best eggs Benedict I have had in NYC, or anywhere for that matter! The biscuit rivaled the buttermilk biscuits at Cookshop (though Cookshop still has a better biscuit), the ham was great, the eggs were perfectly done, and the hollandaise was delectable! It came with a side salad, which was also very good. However, I was craving some OJ with my brunch and when it arrived I was surprised to see that it was literally only about the size of a shot. I know it was probably fresh squeezed, but that was a let down. As for the service, our waitress was efficient but not intrusive and we definitely enjoyed our brunch!
