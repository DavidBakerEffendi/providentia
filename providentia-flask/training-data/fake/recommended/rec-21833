When was the last time they changed the menu?  (Redesigns and perpetual-restaurant-week inserts don't count.)  This place has been a part of my life for a long time, and it's still old reliable.  But it feels like the owners have lost interest.  Excellent (and I mean truly excellent) service will only get you so far. Also, I miss the late nights.  Blue Ribbon used to be an after-hours spot. Hope things pick up.
