We had our post-wedding celebration at Jadis (not typical reception, but a gathering of our friends). Edit (the manager) did an amazing job, and paid such close attention to detail! The wine selection was great, and food was appropriately paired. We had an amazing time, and the prices were so reasonable. Highly recommended.
