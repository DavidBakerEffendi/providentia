The food is pretty good (not amazing); I had the vegan scramble and I love that it has sweet potato instead of normal potato as it's much better for you! They use cheap bread. Coffee is average - the latte came in a cappuccino cup and was quite bitter. Best to get a juice with your food then get a coffee elsewhere in Bushwick.
