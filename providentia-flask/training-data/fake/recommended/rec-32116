Everyone else said it all, but just to reiterate... Small cafe that not many people frequent, but decent amount of seating for the size of the space. Workers/owners (I've only ever seen 3 guys there so I assume they co-own) always greet you and are sociable. Plenty of outlets and free wifi (ask for the password) make it a great place to do work. Personally always love the music as well. They also have a bathroom so if you want to avoid the Starbucks double whammy of waiting on lines to order & use the bathroom, go here. I always get the iced coffee (yes, they have coffee cubes and they're amazing), and the almond croissant is pretty good.
