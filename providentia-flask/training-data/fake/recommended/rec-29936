So Penelope is definitly one of the "hot spot" brunch places in NYC right now. I liked it, good food, nice atmosphere. I had the nutella french toast which was delicious and the sake bloody mary which was amazing. However you will wait about an hour miniumum. It is good to put your name in and then go off and explore the area. In addition, if you download the buzz table app you can get a free drink as well as know when your table is ready
