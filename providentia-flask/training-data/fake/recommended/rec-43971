Restaurant should be called "I can't believe it's not gluten" Stopped in there not knowing anything about it, I have one friend with a gluten allergy and she was beside herself happy about this place. The breadsticks DEAR LORD THE BREADSTICKS were amazing. Got a panini, the parm ham, mozz and arugula. Now, I know that kind of ham is salty but this was unbearably salty, even for me. I took a lot of the ham out of the sandwich. Other friends had the risottos, the shrimp asparagus and roasted red pepper one was amazing. All around good experience. Only drawback was the size of the place, it's really tiny and a party of 5 was pushing it.
