Lombardi's and The Grasshopper are the only two bars in the entire town of Cedar Grove. One is Italian and the other is Irish, a close-enough representation of the town's ethnic makeup. Lombardi's has tons of televisions to watch whatever game you want at any time, and the thin crust pizza is fantastic. Tons of sport memorabilia on the walls and the decor is very warm.. makes for a great ambiance. The service is great too. I'll be back there soon.
