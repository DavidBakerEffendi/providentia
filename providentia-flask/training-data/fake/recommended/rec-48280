I love this place.  It's my go-to place on Staten Island. Most "Italian" restaurants here serve variations on red sauce and melted mozzarella.  However, Pasticceria Bruno manages to offer a variety of interesting Italian dishes, with different price points.  Their brunch is amazing--a basket of warm, buttery pastries come to the table with a seasonal fruit plate.  Their pastries/cookies/breads are amazing and reasonably priced for the quality they offer.  They have the usual Southern Italian stuff, but also a goodly offering of French pastries too.  Try the Proscuitto bread and the chocolate/hazelnut cake. YUM. The service is attentive and professional.  I adore the Euro-waiter outfits they give their waitstaff to wear.  Very clean.   I can't understand the negative reveiws--I think they're simply one of the best places on SI.
