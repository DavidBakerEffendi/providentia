When looking at the menu, I saw on Monday and Tuesday the creeps are buy one get one at fifty percent off.  I thought wow good deal since they are ten a piece.  We'll he wrung me up at the total was twenty one and change.  I paid and then when it came out I asked about the special.  he said I had order a drink.  I'm like well why didn't you tell me?  And he had no answer.  Plus you can barely read the menu because of the color of the print and the small size.  Plus forget about finding the price on the menu, it's so small you need a magnifying glass.  I have to say the creeps were good but not for that price.  I think they need better lighting and bigger print on the price of the item.
