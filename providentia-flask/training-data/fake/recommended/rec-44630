Came here with my friend for brunch today!  I ordered the Turkish Eggs and Quinoa Hashbrown, and my friend had the two-eggs Fry-up.  The food we ordered was so yummy.  We were stuffed!   My only complaint is that the brunch menu is very limited.  But  overall I really like what we tried.  And I am definitely coming back to try their dinner!
