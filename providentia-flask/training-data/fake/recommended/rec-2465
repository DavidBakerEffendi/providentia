So after running the Philly Marathon, we decided what would be more fun than to go on a little cheese -steak expedition.  I hadn't been out' a cheese steakin' (didn't know that was a verb did you?) since my college frat boys days at Lehigh and all I really remember was drunkenly trying to get my order right at Pat's ('whiz-wit'); so we hopped in a cab right after we finished and headed over there first.  Prior to the race my gf flatly refused to eat anything with cheez whiz/onions (sp?) on it, but she was pretty giddy after finishing so I got to order whatever I wanted.  So their cheese steak is one of those relatively disgusting pleasures that are just damn good.  We were more or less happy as pigs in, well, cheez whiz and we were more or less covered with the unnatural goodness by the time we finished ours.  I know this place is touristy (appropriate given we were tourists though I guess), but the steak was great.  Now off to Geno's...
