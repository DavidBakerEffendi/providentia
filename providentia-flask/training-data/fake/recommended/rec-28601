A NYC MUST! This is as nostalgic as you can get for NY Pizza. The place is iconic located in Nolita. Pictures all over the walls, the symbolic red and white checked tablecloth. You just feel like you walked into a place rich in history. No frills, but authentic, delicious pizza. We didn't have to wait long on a Sunday evening for a table for 4. We split a tasty Caesar salad and got a large half margarita and half white. It was simply divine. No way could you get this in any other city. Crust amazing, sauce was perfect, cheese- omg the cheese! This is the pizza you dream about seriously. The best pizza I've had in NY. Better than Patsy's. Cash only! You haven't experienced NY Pizza unless you've dined at Lombardi's. Can't wait to return!
