If all meatballs could be this tasty... The pork meatballs with the spicy meat sauce was recommended and I feel that I need not try anything else, though I eventually will. Each bite is a flavor explosion of sure delight. I've had the mashed potatoes and the polenta buried underneath. I've never really liked polenta, but the combination together brought me to my senses. In fact, I think I may like their polenta by itself. I've been told there are crazy waits to be seated, but apparently I've been lucky. Every time I've been there, I've been seated right away. The first time I went, I ordered and my food came out in literally minutes.
