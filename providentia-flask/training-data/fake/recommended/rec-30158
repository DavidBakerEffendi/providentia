Really good Thai restaurant (it's all the standard thai food you would expect and the ingrediants are good quality) PLUS awesome decor - there's a random chandelier in the middle of the room! Came here after a show, so good idea if you're in the broadway area and forgot to make a post-dinner reservation. We had to wait, but it wasn't long and we were able to try an interesting lichee sangria at the bar. This was around 9pm on a Tuesday night and it was quite packed! Once we sat down, we ordered some usual thai cusine, but everything tasted great (my mock-duck green curry was perfect). I will definitely keep Room Service in mind for when I am in that area of town.
