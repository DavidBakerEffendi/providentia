Okay, so the manager contacts me today about my bitter review.  He apologizes and offers us seating for this evening if I want to give it a try.  I was surprised and flattered by this offer and decided I must go even though the Steelers are playing.  Battersby definitely made up for the debacle of last night.  The hostess and the manager were great and the food was amazing.  We ordered most of the food on the menu: Kale salad - excellent Corn chowder- excellent Roasted broccoli - excellent Pork tortellini - excellent Rigatoni - excellent Sweet breads - excellent Pork belly - excellent Scallops - excellent The chef also threw in some amazing potato purée with duck ragout and a spaetzel dish with bacon. The food is amazing. Battersby you redeemed yourself. Thanks for making the effort.
