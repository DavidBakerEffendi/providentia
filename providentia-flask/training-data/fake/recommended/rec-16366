9 years ago this place was a 10 out of 5 on the scale but it has dropped in quality. The fame got to the point where the quality of lamb and chicken is just plain poor. For those who are interested in calories its about 2400 in just one platter. They now have 3 other carts, one on the other side of 6th avenue, one down the block on 52nd, and one on 53rd and 7th. If you're in Manhattan you'll see the massive line across the Hilton Hotel for this place, for some reason people like that one even though the other carts are from the same company. Some advice, if you have a car, get onto LI and head to Hillside avenue and Homelawn avenue down the road from St. Johns or go to Jackson Heights. The rice, the chicken/meat are muchhh better and its the same price.
