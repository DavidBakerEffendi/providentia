After pilfering free food and booze at a yelp event I decided to check out Cavanaugh's as a paying customer. This is a super cool hangout in a fun area of town, and in my estimation,  free of  the douchey vibe found at most other trendy drinking establishments. I really like how each room has their own thing going on. My favorite is the main sports bar type area upstairs.  Besides the ample seating and big screen tvs, it also features my new favorite drink in town, the smoking bishop. It is basically a mulled sangria with strong cloves and cinnamon flavors.  Smoking bishop and the flyers game on the big screen is my new favorite way to spend my night in Philly.
