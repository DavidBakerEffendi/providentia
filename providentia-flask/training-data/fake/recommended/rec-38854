K-J-B is awesome! The staff are helpful and the food is out of sight! Obviously, the bagels are excellent. They even make pink ribbon bagels for breast cancer awareness, black and orange bagels for Halloween, and all kinds of other holiday themed bagels. Their other pastries are fantastic too. Frankly, there isn't anything I ever not enjoyed from this store. Great sandwiches and breakfast too.
