Awesome happy hour deal.. every night of the week! We went for a happy hour/pregame for a friend's birthday on a Saturday night and it was great. The space is pretty small so it was definitely crowded and cramped, but I guess you could've expected that on a Sat. during happy hour. We didn't try any of the food, so I can't speak for that but the drinks were good.
