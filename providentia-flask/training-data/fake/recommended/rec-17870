My first experience with Haitian food and I am sure I picked the right spot from the soup to salad to entree and dessert every bite was SUPER TASTY. I would recommend it and plan to go again. It is a smaller place with a date night kind of feel but don't let that throw you. Grab a bottle of whatever from next door and get your eat on. I enjoyed the Trini chicken with polenta and black beans and a seasonal cucumber cream soup. Freshly prepared, homemade tastes, white linen quality. I hear its get pretty crowded on weekend nights so if that's not your style stop in tues or weds or just be prepared for a more bustling place.
