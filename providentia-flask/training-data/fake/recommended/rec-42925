A friend recommended this "latin diner" type place to me, so what the hell, I tried it. I'm a fan, good food, nice service. It is technically "latin based food," but actually has a wide variety of menu options for those who are uneasy to try unfamiliar foods. I tried the steak over rice & beans with side of salad & a plantane, it was pretty good (although not the best steak I ever had, but I still recommend it). We also got the wings as appetizers; coated in chipolte & chocolate sauce. The flavor was slightly there, but honestly tasted more like buffalo & chipolte.. maybe a hint of chocolate? but I might have been imaging it... The table next to me got the mac & cheese with pork belly and chicharron, that looked amazing, I wish we had gotten it! I couldn't drink that night, so I'm bummed I didn't get any of their cocktails, but I think I'll be going back & try some more. That being said, I'll be going back for more yummy food!
