Disclaimer: went to a burger place, and didn't get a burger. The food I had was just ok, so for the price, not too impressed.   The oreo-kahlua milkshake sounded great, but was very lacking in the oreo department and was definitely not worth the price. Overall their drink menu seemed to have a good variety of beer and cocktails.   If you aren't into hard boiled egg, I wouldn't recommend the side caesar... the egg is on the side, but constitutes 50% of the salad. The chili fries were decent, but a small portion, and served in a sort of small gravy boat type thing that made them a little hard to eat. The mac n cheese was lacking a bit in flavor. The ritz topping, while a fine idea, did not seem like it had been baked on, so rather than forming a nice cheesy crust, it was just a crumby dusting reminiscent of the last bowl of cereal.  Add some cayenne pepper, throw it under the broiler before serving, and it could be great.   The staff was pleasant, and the owner/manager stopped by the table, was very nice, and gave us free samples.  Other people that I was with enjoyed their burgers, so if I go again, I guess I'll give their specialty a try.
