Due to a weak stomach, I was a bit apprehensive to try this restaurant. With that being said, I have to say that the food was delicious and I can't wait to go back! The waiters were nice and patient. They were willing to explain the menu and make amazing suggestion!!!  The decor was spacious and calming and provided a nice dinner ambiance.  If you're in Montclair, NJ please stop by this amazing location.
