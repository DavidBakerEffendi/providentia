The pork belly sandwich is perfectly balanced in flavor and texture; the richness and softness of the meat is offset by the brighter flavor of cilantro and crunchiness of the carrots. Â Some of the stools upstairs are ridiculously short and overall it's pretty cramped (like most NYC restaurants), so you might be better off just walking to nearby Union Square Park for seating if the weather is nice.
