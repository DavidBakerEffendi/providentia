I went to La Riviera for the first time for my birthday. We picked it mainly because of their gluten-free menu. And boy, am I glad I checked out this place. It was a small cozy restaurant in a most unlikely place, but what a find! This was the first Italian restaurant I've been to since my diagnosis. One of many things I miss is PASTA. Most gluten free pasta is just crap! They're awful. That is until I found La Riviera. The pasta they served was cooked perfect! Their gluten free menu consisted everything from apps to desserts, it wasn't just 1 or 2 dishes, there were choices!!! The wait staff was knowledgeable and so helpful. Service was great! They even sold various GF pastas which I'd like to check out. My husband and nephew had regular pasta dishes and they loved their dishes too. I'd definitely go back to try out other GF dishes. They even went out of their way to make a dish that wasn't on the GF menu. Good food, good wine, good service... Good find!
