Okay. I write this review with trepidation because although approximately 300 other people have written in about Vanessa's Dumpling House, I have always considered this place to be a hidden gem in the LES/Chinatown area. I come here for lunch about once a week, and I still cannot believe what a delicious meal you can get for under 5 dollars a person. I'm a big fan of the spicy/sour cucumber salad($2) and the chive and pork fried dumplings($1 for 4). As someone who heartily enjoys spicy food, I appreciate the gigantic bottles of siracha hot sauce on every table. Finding a seat here can be challenge at certain times of the day due to the limited table/counter space, but the majority of customers do take their food to go.
