Huge disappointment!  Interior was nice and clean, but that's about all I can say for this place. This place is obviously for people who do not eat Viet food often or care for authentic Viet food.  The bf and I shared an appetizer (beef stuffed grape leaves) and 2 entrees (lemon grass beef soup and pork claypot), however we both left hungry.  The soup was the smallest portion I've ever seen.  If there was an extra-small portion, I'd imagine it'd look like that.  A little further drive into chinatown we could have gotten the same food for tastier, bigger, cheaper and faster.   Needless to say, this place left a lot to be desired.
