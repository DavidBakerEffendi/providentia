Finally got in at Penelope. My friend and I both got sandwiches and they were very good, but not as good as the line outside the restaurant would have you believe. Food was decent, but I feel like they're more focused on their image than they are their meals. The service was a bit slow and it was FREEZING inside there. I left with numb toes. If you're in the mood for traditional American food in Murray Hill, this place is worth it - so long as you don't have to wait too long.
