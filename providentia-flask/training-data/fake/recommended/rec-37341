Wow, where to begin!? Starting from the first week Panino Rustico opened I've been coming here almost every Friday or Saturday. To start, the decor and mood to the place is what this neighborhood needed. Great for a quick lunch or even a classy dinner date and they deliver! The staff is nothing but fantastic. The ladies work and give full attention. You could tell the workers actually love their job which is great. The owner of the place (Louie) is a great guy, comes out and checks on every table and makes you feel right at home. Now, for the food... I have my second home in Italy which gave me a great understanding of Italian food, especially Panini's. With all honesty, this is the one and ONLY place that can be JUST AS AMAZING as the Panini's in Italy. Soups are great, salads are fresh..what more to ask for!? Their deserts are awesome, I recommend a Crepe with a nice Â Italian Espresso (great mix). Been living in the neighborhood for about 16 years and this is now, and always will be, my ALL TIME FAVORITE.
