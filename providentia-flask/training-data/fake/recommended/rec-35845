Love this place! Probably my favorite out of all the nearby Thai places I've tried. I find the pad thai to be a fairly reliable indicator of a Thai restaurants overall quality, and out of Luscious, Spice, and Up Thai, I find the pad thai here the best. Generally the dishes here are also higher in quality and less expensive than Luscious Thai, and less sweet and more garlicky than Spice Thai. This place serves quite a nice variety of lunch specials for really cheap and it lasts all the way until 4:00 PM, great if you're working long and erratic hours like me. The restaurant setting is quite nice, although inside is a little cramped and the number of tables is rather limited. Probably my biggest complaint with this place is that many of the lunch specials don't come with rice so you have to make your own or eat without it.
