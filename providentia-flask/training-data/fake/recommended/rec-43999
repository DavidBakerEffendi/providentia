So delicious! The glazed salmon with taro rice clay pot dish was my favorite--both the salmon and rice were perfectly cooked and seasoned. Decor inside is pretty, too: it's dimly lit but not overly so, and the tables are well-spaced apart. Tip: the restaurant is unmarked, so look for a green awning.
