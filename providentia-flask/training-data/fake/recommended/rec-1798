Where it feels like home. My friends and I decided to get some breakfast at Sabrina's after a week of checking out what Philly had to offer.  We were greeted with a smile when we walked in and were seated immediately. We all ordered a coffee, it was decent but nothin to rave about.  I ordered the Hueveos Rancheros. This was delicious!  Eggs on top of 2 crispy blue tortillas toped with a chorizo and bean mixed then finished off with sour cream and spicy guacamole. They also have some great breakfast potatoes on the side of that.  My lady ordered the stuffed French toast.  Although I'm not a savory not sweet breakfast person it was delicious. The decor was very homey from the mix match of coffee cups on the table to the wooden tables and chairs.  The service was also great. If your looking for a great start to your day come here.
