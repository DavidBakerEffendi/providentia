Great beer list, lovely ambience, and delicious food. The service was fantastic. I would recommend making a reservation on a Friday or Saturday night, as folks tend to stick around after they finish eating in the dining room. On weekdays the kitchen closes early, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth going, just don't expect a late meal. I've been for dinner and just drinks and enjoyed myself on both occasions.
