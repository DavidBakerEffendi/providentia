After three years in University City it's time to finally start writing reviews for all of my local haunts. Sava's opened after my freshman year at Drexel and it was definitely welcome.  They have the best grilled cheese among all of the Drexel area pizza places if anyone else has random cravings for grilled cheese at 1:00 a.m. like I do!   Another thing it's the best at is the interior--it's more restaurant and less college pizza joint.  They have a fully stocked bar (prices are what you'd expect at any other bar in the area).  They sell beer as well, not to mention outdoor seating.  The staff have always been friendly to me, and when I order take-out it's usually done pretty quickly.   Now to some of the reasons why I've taken off a star. Sit-down dining can be pretty slow.  Sometimes the waiters/waitresses can take a while to do things like get your check or refill your drink, but usually it's on the part of the kitchen and food can take a while.  I've seen them get an order wrong once or twice as well so make sure you check it over quickly.       They serve breakfast until 2 p.m. as well and I am a fan of their stromboli, pizza, pasta, and paninis.  I don't like their style of fries as much as other places in the area so I go somewhere else for those.  Prices are usual for the other restaurants in the area. I gave Sava's a four star rating for its location, consistency, and job in filling the need for a slightly nicer place to sit down and eat.
