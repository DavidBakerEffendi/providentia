Meh is right!  At least, as far as dining goes.  Whenever I see venison on the menu, I'm pretty much sold.  So, imagine my disappointment when my $22 plate comes out with 3 tiny pieces of venison.  If that wasn't enough, I ordered the meat "medium rare", and it came out "medium" and "well done" respectively - each piece was cooked differently, which was an unpleasant surprise. And, all of it was tough and chewy.  The crown on top of the plate were onion rings that tasted like they were a few days old... UGH. Besides my wasted meal, our waiter didn't bring my friend's drink over for 20 min., and didn't ask us how the food was after the fact.  It's probably better (for him) that he didn't.
