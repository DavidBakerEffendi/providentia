Food was tasty. But i won't return due to a rude staff, the one with shells in her hair that looks like the rapper Khia. I was there with a friend of mine who speaks English as a second language. She gave him an exasperated look and served the ppl behind us because she didn't want to wait on him. Nasty attitude and we won't return because of it. Shame too because the food is good and other experiences here were fine.
