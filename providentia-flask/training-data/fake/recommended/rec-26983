Truly incredible flavors at this restaurant. It's a tough place to get into but we were lucky to have good timing to get into the bar. On a Friday night around 6pm we got in just before the crowds and only waited a few minutes. The bar staff is top notch, service was excellent. We tried a variety of things and everything was either very good or superb. The dinner rolls were dressed with potent herbs and obviously freshly baked. We also ordered a special of rabbit sausage emulsified in pork fat (which was very good), appetizers/small plates of the mushroom toast (very fresh mushrooms and excellent flavors), entrees of the hangar steak and rabbit. Sides we got were the crushed potatoes and fried green tomatoes. Really might have been the best potato dish I've ever eaten. The herbs was just front and center and the nice sauce they serve it with was really phenomenal. I'm all about the flavor. Honestly its the hardest thing to find, even in high end restaurants. The two things I love the most about Hen of the Wood is that they don't chicken out on flavor and they embrace fresh ingredients. And you can really taste the freshness. The steak, for example, is one of the most flavorful I've had. And it was only $30. As opposed to typically paying $50 to $80 for a high quality steak and getting much less flavor. That was impressive to me. We also ordered a bottle of red wine which paired nicely with the whole experience. If you are in the Burlington, VT area and like food, try Hen of the Wood! If you are with someone who is not a foodie, order them the Hangar steak. It's safe for everyone. For the rest of us, I recommend trying whatever is on special and sampling the menu. You wont be disappointed.
