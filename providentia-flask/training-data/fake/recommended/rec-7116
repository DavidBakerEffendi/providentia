This is hands-down the best restaurant I've been to in Sunnyside. My friends and I checked it out for Sunnyside Restaurant week, which made it easy to try a number of dishes for a reasonable price. Salt & Fat has a casual, but chic interior , and our waitress was sweet, but efficient. Our meal began with a bag of (addictive) bacon fat cooked popcorn. Then came the appetizers: bahnmi buns and Korean BBQ wraps, both scrumptious. The buns had thick slabs of pork with a tangy mayo-based sauce, and the wraps blended the crunchy lettuce with the melt-in-your-mouth BBQ meat perfectly. As for the entrees, the rumors are true - that oxtail really does fall off the bone. My pork trotter was crispy and flavorful, and paired nicely with pickled greens and yet another mayo-based sauce. The meal closed on a simple note with the chef's dessert, a pear tart with granola and ice cream. The whole time, I was thinking how lucky Sunnyside is to have some great fine dining right in the neighborhood. Take your date, friends, family - do whatever you can to go!
