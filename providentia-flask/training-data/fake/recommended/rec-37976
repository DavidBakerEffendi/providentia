Haven't been here for a while but the family wanted beef and seafood so off we went.  Decor is unchanged (dark but cozy).  Service was good (as always).  The food, however, was a disappointment (and not as good as I remembered it). The "signature dish," Prime Rib was cooked to order (mine rare, my son's medium rare) but very tough and poorly marbled.  Definitely not USDA prime grade beef.  The crab chowder was pasty (way too much flower) and had little crab flavor (or crab, for that matter).  The lobster bisque was better but not my much. My wife's crab cakes were only so-so.  The mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus were very good.  The house Chianti was excellent for a house wine. Given that BS&SH is a bit pricey for a local restaurant, I was sorely disappointed and won't be back for a while.
