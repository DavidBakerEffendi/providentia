Blue is a success story ! If you get the chance to dine here, you will see true restaurant professionals practicing there craft every night. Julian the owner has hired top quality management & wait staff and has trained them to make your lunch or dinner a culinary experience. I couldn't wait to eat at Blue, I had been a customer of Julian's 2 other restaurants, Beso & Bayou and loved the flavorful dishes that they are famous for. Blue being on the water is going to be a summer destination ! The cocktails & wine selection is superb, treat yourself with friends to a great night out at Blue.
