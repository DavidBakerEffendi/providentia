Ugh, I noticed the reviews for Kobeyaki were a hit or miss, but decided to give them the benefit of the doubt anyway since they have such high ratings. I ordered the kobe beef bowl with brown rice and spicy tuna roll. Let me tell you, there is not a single time in my life that I have ordered a spicy tuna roll and not finished it. That is like a sin. But today, I could not bring myself to do it. I sinned. The roll, like other reviewers have said, had way too much rice on it. Way too much. And the spicy tuna was not fresh at all. You can tell sushi is not fresh when it tastes salty. The kobe beef itself was actually not bad, if you get any of it. The chipotle-sized bowl consists of mostly brown rice soaked in teriyaki sauce and tossed with some beef and veggies. After I consumed all my meat (which did not take long), all that rice was tossed. I've only tried these two dishes so I hate to judge a book by its cover, but so be it.
