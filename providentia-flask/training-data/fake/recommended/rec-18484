This review is purely on their dessert. Their sangria is tasty and sweet! But too much ice. Very very yummmmmy though! Key lime pie tasted meh, chocolate mousse cake is good! The cheesecake with ginger and lychee syrup is a little strange and you probably wouldn't like it if you don't like ginger flavored food. The ginger syrup is too overpowering. Desserts came around $6 per plate, not bad, but definitely wouldn't go back for their desserts again. Cute ambience though.
