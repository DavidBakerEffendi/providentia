Worst place ever!! Supper hard buns, 3 bland micro thin slices of "steak" save your $$$. The staff are like the "soup nazi" of cheese stakes. Let this be a lesson to me, and check the Yelp reviews. Others feel the same way I do. The building and sign is very cool, so our pictures did come out nice.
