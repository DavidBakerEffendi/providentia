Of course I had to track down the famous 53rd & 6th halal cart while I was in New York... Best street food I've had & definitely worth the wait & price.  There are halal carts all over the city, but their motto is true...the Halal Guys are different. When I got to their location, I was super confused because there was another halal cart on the other side of the street also using yellow bags.  My friend got chicken over rice there to compare.  The chicken tasted the same but the rice was different & you don't get pita bread. The lines were long-ish for both halal carts however - not too crazy though.  I probably waited 15-20 min, definitely doable. You can figure out which is the right cart by looking at the website linked on here - they changed their bags and T-shirts to say "the Halal Guys" but the slogan "We are different" is still there. I ordered half chicken, half gyros over rice with white & hot sauce. The hot sauce is pretty spicy, so I only recommend if you really like spicy food... Otherwise the food is plenty flavorful without it. I liked the chicken well enough, but next time I will probably get just gyros with white sauce. Overall, the food was cheap & delicious.  Within the category of street food, this halal cart is definitely my favorite.
