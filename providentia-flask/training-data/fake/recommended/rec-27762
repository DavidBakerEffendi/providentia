A friend highly recommended this restaurant.  My husband and I dine out regularly and we are both very good cooks as well, with that being said it probably makes us a bit more critical.  I have learned at this point in my life when I go out I deserve the best food the best service and nice ambiance.  Unfortunately Il Cafone offered none of these qualities.  The hostess appeared to be uncomfortable or unfamiliar with her role to begin with.  The restaurant is sorely dated and has ceilings that are dirty and old.  The wait staff is very friendly so I would say that is the high point.  The food was far less than mediocre.  We had a "sausage" appetizer and apparently it was "Spanish" sausage and not Italian.  We thought we were dining in an Italian restaurant.  My husband had grilled Tuna, it was overdone and the presentation was very displeasing.  I love tuna and would not even taste it.  I asked for a side of pasta al dente which you really shouldn't have to ask for but since I thought they may not serve it properly so I decided to ask.  Well the pasta came out as hard as it was in the box.  It was almost comical.  Oh well we were hoping to have another nice local Italian restaurant to add to the repertoire but Il Cafone won't be it!  I do not like to post bad reviews but I also do not like to feel like I was served less than an acceptable meal.
