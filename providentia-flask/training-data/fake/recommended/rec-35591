Mixed bag during our visit to Tinto.  10 of us went for dinner and we (not all of us at once) showed up early for a drink or two at the bar. Big disappointment.  Bar area poorly designed and can only handle 10-12 folks somewhat comfortably.  Wine was good, cocktails were flat out horrible!  Most of all, the bartenders were slow and not even slightly engaging. Should have started off the evening somewhere else. However, the dinner quickly made me forget the hour or so I wasted at the bar. All 10 of us got the deluxe chef tasting and wine pairings (yes, a small fortune was spent that night). Although an item or two may have been a bit over cooked, everything was outstanding!! Particularly liked the cheese tray, scallops, duck, baby artichokes, lamb, & sirloin steak.  The dessert tray provided was interesting as the items all had a smokey taste but I thought that it worked. All in all, I would definitely go back for dinner but start somewhere else for drinks beforehand.
