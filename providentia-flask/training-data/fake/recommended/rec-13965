I give this place 5 stars despite the fact that there is like one table there and there is always almost a long line. But they fries are awesome, the dipping sauces are tasty and unique. So if you love your fries, this is the best place to go. Its a bit pricey if you consider that you are just getting fries, but its worth it. And on the bright side, burp castle is around the corner and you can bring your fries there to have with some beer.
