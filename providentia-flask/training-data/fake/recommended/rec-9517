This place is such am amazing place to eat. From the outside, it doesn't look like anything special from the outside but when you get inside, the decor is really modern. The music was not overwhelming at all. The service was good although he did forget our drinks a couple of times. He gave excellent recommendations. We got the empanadas to start. They weren't anything spectacular but still very good.I got the Corvino a lo macho for the main course. Which was seafood dish with scallops, mussels, clams, fish, and a big prawn with spanish rice. It was literally the most amazing seafood dish that I had ever eaten in my LIFE. I have never ever fallen in love with a dish so much. The prices are a little high but I think it is totally worth every penny. I know that Peruvian food is famous for the chicken, although I haven't tried it, I will most definitely go back and try their chicken
