Walking in, I assumed the food would be sub-par as it gives off a "fast-food" ambiance. To my surprise, with everything being made-to-order, I bit into the best soft shell crab bun I've ever tasted. Every topping fit the sandwich like a perfect puzzle. I also got the chance to try the tempura sweet potato fries (recommend the wasabi mayo for dipping) and I was then in heaven! Great place for a quick lunch/dinner. Definitely paying a visit again soon!
