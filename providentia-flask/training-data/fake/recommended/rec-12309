Cafe Cluny is your typical West village cafe, with a kitchen and staff probably up to par for brunch, but nothing more challenging than that. I went there for dinner at the invitation of a friend who lives in NYC. The dinner menu was quite boring, nothing inventive and I would argue it's more modern American than close to the boundaries of French cuisine. Ordered the Steak Frites medium rare and a cocktail, which did the job but didn't blow me away. For a restaurant charging $120 for 2 mains and 2 drinks, you'd expect a *little* more fireworks. I also don't get how the servers expect you to hang your winter coat "anywhere around the room where there's a hook". Maybe it's a New York thing but I would've expected assistance for a place attempting to be chi chi.
