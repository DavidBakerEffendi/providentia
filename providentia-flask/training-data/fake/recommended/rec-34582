I took a star off only because their ridiculous wait times! Visited at 2pm and 9pm on a Friday and Saturday. Both times, over 25 minutes of wait time to get take out. Annoying! Everyone was complaining. Overheard a girl say that she'd been waiting so long, she would have taken anything they had given her, at that point. However, the food? The food is worth the wait! I tried the shrimp, chicken, chick pea and cheese roll. Everything is spicy. There's no mild or medium because the proteins or veggies are already marinated. Luckily, I love spicy food so this was mild for me. The shrimp roti was the best, by faaaar. There were quite a few shrimp there, definitely didn't skimp. I wish I had ordered more than one! Chana masala (chickpea) had the authentic flavour but needed just a bit more salt. The cheese roll was decent enough, Â definitely worth a try though. Chicken tikka roll (no egg) was second best! All rolls comes with coriander chutney inside which gives it the spiciness. Unless you want more heat, no need to buy extra chutney for $0.25. Downside: small portions so you do need 2 rolls to fill you up. Masala chai tea and mango lassi are decent. I see why people can eat this stuff every day. It's perfect on the go food. A lot of south Asian people can be seen ordering, so it must be good!
