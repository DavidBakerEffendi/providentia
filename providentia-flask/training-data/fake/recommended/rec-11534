came here solo a few weeks ago- actually my second time attempting to dine here.  the first time i was turned away by the hostess telling me the wait was really long and discouraging me from eating there (she DIDN'T say she WOULDN'T take my name, but she DIDN'T take my name so...)  anyway, i entirely expected to be turned away based on all the other reviews, but luckily there was a seat at the bar!  i think i went about 8:30 or so on a summer week night? i had a couple coney island drafts. and the reason i came.... to try the fettucini and clams which was really yummy.  i would say 4.5 stars, only because my personal preference is a more creamy/cheesey alfredo sauce.  at the end, i had the complimentary and delicious whiskey cake; and (i believe the owner) gave me a taste of a beer he felt went best with the cake.  overall great experience!  glad i finally got in to try it!
