Boubouki is the reason I signed up to Yelp. I discovered Boubouki two years ago as I was walking through Essex Market like every Saturday for my grocery shopping and literally fell in love with the chocolate cookies (before I fell in love with Nora). It became my comfort food. I used to send my boyfriend to buy me Boubouki's cookies and spinach pies whenever I was sick. Nora is a very admirable, young and strong woman, very inspiring and such a caring person. She always looks after her customers and I am grateful she opened her shop at Essex Market.Through these delicacies, she shares her Greek New York culinary traditions. I tried every single item she cooks freshly everyday and they are always consistent and delicious. One of my friends who lives in Atlanta never misses the opportunity to enjoy the pear cake made of olive oil. it is so full of flavor and fluffy. I remeber one day he sshowed up a little too late and the shop was unfortunately closed already. He was so disappointed that he tried to bake the same cake back home but never succeeded. All this say that Boubouki is definitely a must try, and trust me you will definitely go back.
