For all of us 20-somethings figuring out how to make our way in this cruel world, Tom's is a lifesaver.  We go every Saturday morning to drink coffee and eat cookies while waiting in line, to open the door and see the plastic flowers and carefully hung Christmas lights, to be greeted with a kiss and a handshake by Gus, the owner, to eat the kind of diner food that sticks with you all day, and to leave feeling a little less alone in the world.  I also appreciate that while my table may be full of hipsters, the restaurant attracts people from all walks of life who call Prospect Heights home, from police officers to retirees.  As we tell someone new every week as they look forlornly at the line out the door, "It's worth the wait!"
