Unobtrusive from the outside, inside the atmosphere is friendly.  While somewhat noisy, it was easy to carry on a conversation.  The host is welcoming and the stall are attentive and efficient.  The menu is  varied and far from orthodox. The food (bacon wrapped lamb chop, elk rib chop, cheese platter) were beautifully presented and delicious.  One of the best restaurants of this style I have been to.
