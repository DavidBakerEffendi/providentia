I don't get it. With a name like 'Vermont Pub & Brewery', you'd think they'd serve beer at the proper temperature. I mean, since they brew their own beer, they must know that a beer should not be served a shade above room temperature? While we didn't eat here, I won't go back in the future. Service: The waitress seemed rushed when we sat ourselves (no one was at the door greeting us). There was one beer menu for the four of us, and she came over within a few seconds asking what we wanted. Well, I don't know what I want, I literally just sat down and you have a bunch of beers so give me a minute? Then, the waitress was leaving from her shift and asked if we could pay the check so she could leave. Beer: The beer was single note. I'm not sure how it's award-winning. Very hoppy, all of them, with no range. The fact that they were served near room temperature probably didn't help matters much. I ordered a sampler and the waitress couldn't be bothered to tell me which was which. Instead, she threw a hand-written note down and said "I think these are in the same order, but I'm not sure". Atmosphere: Dirty & dark. Unwelcoming. You couldn't bribe me to go here and try the food, I'd be scared of getting sick
