Wow, what a great place! We came here last week after seeing the "Lend me a Tenor" show on Broadway. I've been wanting to checkout this place forever, but I finally made myself go here, and the experience was far from being disappointing. The Room Service is a nice and comfortable place. They have this huge chandelier in the middle of the restaurant cased in a glass box which I think is a nice decorative touch... They played a great lounge music in the background. They have a nice list of mimosas, and we ordered the Lychee mimosas which were super tasty. For appetizer we got the Chicken Satay with peanut sauce and the shrimp dumplings, and for main dish I got the Panang curry with shrimp and my date had the chicken Tai flat noodles. Everything we ordered was well prepared and delicious. Service was great too and we never felt pushed or rushed. This place has great cocktails at great prices. We left after finishing the dinner and six more cocktails and I could not believe the bill.... it would have been easily three times that for the quality and amount of food and drinks we got. I'll be coming here later this week with a group of friends, I want to try some of the other dishes on the menu. I would highly recommend this place if you are in the area.
