This is the second time I have gone to this brunch location. Although the first time was a good experience, with good service and good food, this second time ended very poorly. The food is great, but the service is terrible. And for me, that is critical to making a great establishment. We were a party of 2, and told we had to wait 60-75mins. We waited patiently, even though it took them over 90 minutes to seat us. We quickly ordered (because we were hungry and the menu is small), and ate our food. After we paid (which was quickly as well), we chatted for a few minutes while sipping our waters. In less than 5 minutes, the hostess came over and told us there was another party waiting, and we had to leave! Never in my life have I been told to leave a restaurant- not only was this embarrassing, but incredibly rude. It ruined our experience. Although the food is good, you can find just as good food at places like Corner Bakery and Fetch, while experiencing much better service.
