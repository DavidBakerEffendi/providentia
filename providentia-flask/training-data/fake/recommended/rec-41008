My first meal a Centanni was truly wonderful.  The blank ink pasta with calamari and spicy tomato sauce was perfect...and seemed to never end. The pasta was the perfect al dente and the sauce was garlicky and flavorful.  The squid was perfectly cooked.  My friend had the orecchiette with pistachio pesto, potatoes, and green beans. The pasta was perfectly cooked, the sauce was delightful and light, and everything was wonderful. Our cocktails were unique and refreshing.   The portions were a great bang for your buck. We both had plenty of leftovers for lunch (though I couldn't wait and ate mine shortly after getting home) and the price was more than reasonable considering the quality and quantity. Centanni gets an A++ for decor. Service was great. I was also really impressed with the number of tables they could comfortably fit so hopefully we can avoid two hour waits before they get really popular (which will surely happen soon). I only wish they took credit cards. I would order much more food and booze if they did. I cant wait to go back and try more items from the menu.
