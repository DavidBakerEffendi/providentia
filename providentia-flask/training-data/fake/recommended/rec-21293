I really just adore this place. Simple decor with an interesting menu. Not your run of the mill breakfast fare that is heavily Middle Eastern and Israeli influenced. Perfect place for brunch with a great location right in SoHo and not pretentious or touristy like Balthazar around the corner. Â  Food-wise... I've been a few times and highly recommend the Poached Eggs with Grilled Tomato & Haloumi Cheese, Green Shakshuka, Jacks Breakfast (if you're hungry), and the Rosewater Waffle is awesome even as a desert to share. You should also try the mint lemonade or Nana Tea (mint leaf tea).
