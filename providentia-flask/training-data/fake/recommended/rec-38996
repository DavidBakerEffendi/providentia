I've been dining here since sometime in the mid-80s, or so it seems that way... and have never been disappointed.  Similarly, I often rely upon them for delivery service for dinner... again, never a complaint.  Sure, one has favorite dishes, but roast chicken, hamburgers, Croque Monsieur. spaghetti with oil and garlic, etc., delicious bread, wonderfully elegant but simple service and decor, what's not to like.  Never a boring spot... and never a spot at which you'll feel pressure to pay and split.  Love it... love the friends I've made there and at Cafe Cluny.   R
