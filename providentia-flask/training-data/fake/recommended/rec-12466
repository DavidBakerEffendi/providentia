This deli has the most bang'n pho sandwich I ever had...extremely flavorful and just makes me crave for it again writing this review. I had the pho 1 and 2 before..can't go wrong with either one. If you re a beef type go 1 and if chicken go 2. Your expectations for it won't be disappointed. I even seen a drunk lady coming here late at night to grab a sandwich..even they know what's good..lol.
