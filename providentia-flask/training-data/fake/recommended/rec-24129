This place. THIS PLACE! Clean, quick, HUGE servings! The bar is a great place to eat or you can lounge for a table. The servers are great and real. We came from San Diego and overseas for a reunion and had planned to go to Ippoliti's but they were closed and right down the corner from here. SO GLAD we came inside! Gluten free options, vegan options, and MASSIVE menu with MASSIVE plates!! GO HERE!!!
