Great little Italian restaurant and wine bar found in Newington. We went on a Friday night and found the main dining area only had one table left near the entryway so we decided to take a seat in the lounge area. At the time they had a music duo playing a relaxing jazz set. We started off with a couple drinks, Riesling and cape codder, along with calamari. Both came quickly, especially considered how busy the place was. Then for our main dish we had the chicken parm and chicken marsala. Both of these were delicious as well and the portions were just the right size, with little to bring home. After our meal, the owner visited our table to ask about our meal. She seemed very considerate and made us feel welcome in her establishment. Overall a great meal and we will definitely be back, although next time we will probably take better advantage of their wine selection.
