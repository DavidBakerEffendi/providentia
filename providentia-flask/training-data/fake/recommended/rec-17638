Was less than impressed - more like distressed.  To be fair, the server we had was very friendly, and she was attentive and fast in getting our order and trying to get my kids crayons to keep them entertained.   That was the good; now the bad:  food; plenty of it, nice and hot, but nothing that popped out at me to say "wow! I know you probably know how to make a better chicken cutlet at home, but come out on a rainy night and pay for me instead because I am irresistibly delicious."  It wasn't all that especially not for the price we paid ($45.00 total for a burger, a panini, and a child's chicken finger platter, two sodas and 2 kid's chocolate milk. Finally, the ugly: the place itself!  Stained carpeting, broken Formica tops on the tables and counters, ripped seats, water stains on the ceiling.  Bathroom smelled to high heaven (and not in a good way).  A "family" restaurant, yet no crayons anywhere in sight to entertain two very small children (3 and 5).  I just expected more - sigh.  Anther disappointment in Jersey dining choices. Bottom line - wont be returning.  And cannot in god conscious recommend.  Sorry.  Just telling the truth.  I wanted to like it but I just couldn't.
