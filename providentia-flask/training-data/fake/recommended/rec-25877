Overall, Cafe Cluny is a solid brunch/dinner spot in the West Village that steers toward a mix of American/French fare. Recently, my friend and I took advantage of a killer prix-fix meal (3 courses for $30 - a steal in this money-suck of a city). She got a yummy beet salad, halibut, and chocolate torte. I opted for a green salad with vinaigrette, pasta with tomato sauce/peas/ricotta cheese, and topped it off with a delicious apple pie and vanilla ice cream. We both enjoyed our meal, and our waiter was very pleasant and efficient. However, the reasons I gave this place 3 vs. 4 stars were 1) it's really tiny and it can be a little claustrophobic at times and 2) the hostesses are a little snooty when it comes to walk-ins. I've dealt with this the last two times I have come to dinner, both of which were before 7pm and it wasn't even busy yet. They tell me, "Well, we're going to need your table in 1 hr and 45 minutes." I mean, I am sure I can finish my meal in almost two hours. I guess I would just prefer if they said, "Yes, we have a table for you" or "Sorry, we don't because of reservations". But don't make me feel bad because I don't have a reservation. Aside from that, it's a good place with solid, but not amazing food.
