We stumbled into this restaurant/pub cause we wanted a quick bite and some good beer. We weren't expecting the food to be so delicious! First off, they have a good selection of draft beer and from what my friends were saying .. All of the choices were pretty darn to choose. We started off with the spinch and artichoke dip with extra pita chips and the money is with them chips! So delicious and flavorful unlike the pita chips you're used to. I ordered the BYOB where you create your own burger with avocado, bacon, grilled mushrooms, goat cheese, chipotle mayo, etc. But you must try their chicken dish that comes with grilled green beans and mashed potatoes with pesto (?) to die for!!! When we were there the college football game was playing so it was pretty packed, but other then that the atmosphere was fun
