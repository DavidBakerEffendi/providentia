Our experience here was ridiculous, I don't know how the heck it still has high reviews. The food was sub-par and the house wine was unbearable. The house red was literally inedible. Also the service was atrocious, even though it was an early Sunday and it wasn't crowded. Please do your self a favor and go elsewhere.
