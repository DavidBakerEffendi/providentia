It's a burger place. It's fancy, a bit creative and with a fun menu. The place is clean and you sit comfortably (after the wait). So it really is a GREAT burger place. But burgers are eaten fast, they're convenient and filling and taste good, but they'll never really blow anybody's mind. If you're creative, know how to cook and know how to find a good meat provider, you really should blow my mind. By not selling burgers, and doing real cuisine. That makes me sad, but there's no other way to put it. It's just a burger place.
