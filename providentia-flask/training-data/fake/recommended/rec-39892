The broth was the best I've tasted from all the other ramen places in ny but my least favorite part of the meal were the noodles. Yeah, I guess they're freshly made and all, but they're thinner than what I prefer. I got the Akamaru ramen. In the midst of my meal, some guy with a garlic presser came around and asked if I wanted more fresh garlic pressed in the broth. Hells yeah, I said yes. My mouth was delightfully unkissable afterwards and I was one happy clam. My vegetarian friend got a salad and a tofu dish and they both tasted delicious and were elegantly presented. Too bad the portions are a bit small.
