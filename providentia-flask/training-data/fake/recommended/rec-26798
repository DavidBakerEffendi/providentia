Goats neck was good, the rice was very good.  The first few bites of goat were great, a rich smoky flavor.  This was probably the third time ever, that I had goat.  Everything was going pretty well until about 10 min after starting the meal.  The food left an unusual after taste.  Kind of gamey and something else, not sure.  Anyhow, it took away from the experience a little bit.  One great aspect was the food came out piping hot.  Love that.  The aromas were wonderful.  The waitstaff were nice, they worked hard.
