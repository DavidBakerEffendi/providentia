FINALLY! A really good restaurant. I'm so sick and tired of hitting up places that just fall flat. We had a seat at the bar Â b/c my bf knew the bartender. I had an amazing variation on one for my favorite drinks,the french 75. Their version is the Currant 75 which was a mixture of white currant,gin,sparkline wine...AWESOME. Later, I had a cocktail with rosemary bourbon which was also delish. We had a fennel, watermelon salad..totally refreshing. For the entree I had a braised pork w/polenta and swiss chard. My bf had a yummy veal dish. All the ingredients were super fresh. I love that the menu changes often. The highlight of the evening was definitely the jalapeno ice cream that came with the devil's food cake. I know it sounds gross but trust me, its friggin amazing. It tastes like regular ice cream at first then the heat creeps up on you and heats your throat. This place just has a solid combo of food and drinks and I'll be back often.
