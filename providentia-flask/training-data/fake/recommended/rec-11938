Though it is not the cheapest pizza in my area it is the one I always choose for take out. The ingredients are fresh and great quality and the crust is perfect.The plain with buffalo mozzarella is amazing, but my new favorite is the number 3 on the menu which includes cherry tomatoes and parm, it really adds extra flavor. I have tried a few of their non-pizza menu items too, and they do not disappoint either.
