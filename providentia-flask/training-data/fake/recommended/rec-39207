The food was really tasty. By BF got a pork cutlet with mushroom sauce on top, although it was fried, it was really good and not that greasy at all.  Just need to burn the calories later, haha. I also got the wurst, which is also tasty. There's no need to get a bun, because the wurst is good enough.  I got the curry one, the curry tastes like the mix between ketchup and mustard, but not too strong. I am definitely come back here again, though it is rare to see them at Clark Park.
