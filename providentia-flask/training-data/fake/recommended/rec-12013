Friends of ours took us here, highly recommending the soup dumplings.  I thought, oh yea - I know what dumplings are....yea right.  The Soup Dumplings here are absolutely fantastic, never had anything like that before.   First you wait, probably outside the door...give your number, and wait some more.  This place is PACKED, but DO NOT stray, it is completely worth the wait, I promise.  We finally got our table, sat family style with other folks.  There were 6 of us, and they fit us in quite nicely.  Everyone gets the same question, what kind of soup dumplings, crab or pork....not, "do you want soup dumplings", you're getting them.  And it's a good thing, they are awesome. I am so glad someone was with us to teach us how to eat these things.  First you put hot sauce in the corner of your plate, take the tongs and pull out a dumplings - place onto your rice spoon, bite a small hole in the top, set the spoon on your plate.  Spoon the hot sauce and the soy/ginger sauce into the hole you bit.  Lift the spoon and suck the soup, it is incredible!  Then bite into the dumpling and eat away.
