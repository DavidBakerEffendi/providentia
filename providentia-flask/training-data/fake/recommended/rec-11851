You know, I wasn't so impressed with the place. The sandwich was tasty (with carmelized onions, and the iced coffee was nice.. But their goods are seriously overpriced -- $3.50 for their cold-brew? I can get a New Orleans version for the same price. Also, selling Mast Brothers chocolate for $10.00 is robbery. Even in Williamsburg, they only sell them for 9 bucks (they are 7 dollars at the eponymous shop). Â I'd honestly prefer the place if it didn't seem so fussy -- is table service really necessary? Why not have a straight-up coffee bar, with a menu? It seems to have a bit of an identity crisis: are we a coffee bar, or a trendy comfort food joint which belongs in Park Slope?
