Very unexpected. Ended up here when the place we wanted to go to was closed. Very nice atmosphere. Great service. I had the strip loin - was cooked perfect but was a bit large (20 ozs). Had the garlic shrimp app (as per other yelp users) and it was wonderful. Very nice staff. Sangria was awesome. Was a good evening. Will go back.
