The Gander is a gem. The menu is inventive and food well prepared.  Wait staff is friendly, efficient and informative.  Snack menu Brisket Tots are delicious but my new favorite is the Shrimp Toast. Mains; Arctic Char is a definite winner. Duck Breast is worthwhile as well.  Beet Tortelli another new favorite from the Pasta selection. Can't wait to return to The Gander.
