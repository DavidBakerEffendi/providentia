being a HUGE fan of Chopped we decided to try this place out; it was OUTSTANDING!!  Fresh beyond belief, farm to table, all hand made, home made, reasonable prices, great atmosphere, from the lemonade to the peach dessert we were in love; we will be back, probably tomorrow.  After I let our server know I was a huge fan of the show, she sent Georgeann out to meet us.  She was so gracious and let me take a picture with her - absolutely made my day!!!  make this your next Philly stop!!!
