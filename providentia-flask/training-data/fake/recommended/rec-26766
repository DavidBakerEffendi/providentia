First, the good: the salad bar is great.  Everything except meat that you could possibly want to eat, ranging from salads to other vegetables to cheeses to breads.  All of it delicious.  No complaints about this whatsoever. For $50, though, you're going to expect more than salad, and this is where Fogo de Chao falls short.  I'm not going to cover the serving style at this place because the other reviewers here have done that for me, so let's just say it's essentially all you can eat portions of "16 types" of meat.  I put "16 types" in quotation marks because every cut from the same animal tastes the same.  Yeah, you can tell the difference between beef and chicken, but that's about it.  "Filet mignon" = "bottom round" = "top sirloin" - all greasy, all salty, and all indistinguishable.  I'd go as far as to call most of the meat slimy.  It's not bad if you're famished, but marginal utility goes down pretty quickly. I'm not gonna lie, I'm a skinny guy who doesn't have the biggest appetite.  But I couldn't possibly get my money's worth here.  If you're capable of eating a pound of steak without losing any of your hunger, then Fogo de Chao is the right place for you.  But if you're not, spend less on a good old fashioned buffet (New Delhi in University City comes to mind) or sacrifice a bit of quantity for quality and go to virtually any traditional steakhouse in the area. A footnote to the international travelers out there: there's a chain in the Johannesburg area called Rodizio that offers a similar experience (sans salad bar) for ~120ZAR, or about $15 depending on the exchange rate.  I've been to the one in Bedfordview a few times, and the meat is just as good (for better or worse) as at Fogo de Chao.
