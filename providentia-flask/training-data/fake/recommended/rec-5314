Salad and stir-fry joint that I've been to a number of times, all during the typical lunch time. That being said, let me start off with my perceived negatives: This place gets crowded pretty quickly at lunch time, and the line can appear pretty daunting when it stretches out the door. Additionally, the dishes with meat sometimes don't contain enough for my liking...but I must confess I enjoy a healthy helping of meat in my meals when I have them so I could be biased in that regard. Lastly, although the portions appear to be of good size, I sometimes leave here feeling as if I could eat more (which I'm sure I could), but it does at least get me to a comfortable level. However, all that aside, this place has some tasty food. It's healthy and locally grown/made so if you're heavily concerned about that you don't have to feel guilty eating it. They're also extremely vegan/vegetarian friendly. In fact I think I'd appreciate the place more if I was one of those. The lines also move faster than they appear from the outside, because they operate using self-order screens that you type your order into and a two-line serving system: 1 for salad orders and 1 for stir-fry orders. So it's usually not as bad as it seems depending on the day. Nothing to go too crazy about, but I like it every now and then when I want to change it up for lunch and feel healthy about it. I recommend the sesame garlic option or the sweet BBQ with pork. You can select from they're offered options or create your own, which is cool when you want to feel special and personalize.
