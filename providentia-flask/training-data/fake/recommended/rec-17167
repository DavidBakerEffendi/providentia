Been here a few times. They always have excellent service. Only thing that prevents this place from being a 5 in my opinion is that they don't take reservations, so you can wait hours on weekends just to get a dinner. I think they also do this for show, to show appeal to people walking and driving by. Besides that one caveat, this place has great cuban/ spanish food and flavor, which should really appeal to everyone if you give it a chance. Oh yeah, the atmosphere is incredible if you like Spanish/ Carribean inspired music. No regrets here. I will most definitely come back.
