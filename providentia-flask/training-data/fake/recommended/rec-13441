i saw harold at the crawfish boil! i'm such a fan! i had a birthday dinner here and overall the food was delicious! i'd like to point out that it was more on the salty side. i wish i could take home  a bag of  their spicy duck meatballs.  so good! i had the hanger steak and my friend ate the trio of wild boar.  if i had to pick between the two i would pick the wild boar b/c the hanger steak was extremely salty.   the atmosphere is cute and service was great.
