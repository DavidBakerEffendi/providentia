Breakfast the other day (a weekday morning, around 10:30). A babbling drunk was prowling the block as I got out of my car. Place is a bit tight and oldish. Sourpuss older lady behind the counter looks like she hasn't smiled since the Truman administration. Table I got was not clean, despite having been set with flatware and napkins. Got the 2 by 2 by 2 breakfast (2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 sausage). Eggs were decent. Sausage was a bit overdone, but otherwise fine. But the pancakes ... ugh! I read so many reviews here RAVING about the pancakes. Has something happened since these were written? These cakes were mushy and almost flavorless (save for an unpleasant lemony(!) aftertaste -- and I had NOT ordered the lemon-ricotta ones). Truly, I've had better pancakes at IHOP and Denny's. Maybe the great pancake cook has moved on? Or maybe s/he was just having a bad day?
