I've driven by this place a bunch of times in the last 20+ years....and now I'm mad at myself for not stopping in a LOT sooner! Very cute atmosphere, and the outdoor patio is great for summer dining! The service is excellent and friendly, and I was genuinely happily surprised by the taste, quality and presentation of the food! They've got a terrific, classic steakhouse menu - with some surprise anomalies, like fish tacos! I had the sole francaise, and it was really excellent. Bonus: portions are large! I give this place a solid 5 stars.
