We managed to get a reservation on Saturday of Memorial Day weekend and once again Blue Point Grill delivered a wonderful meal. The seafood paella was beautifully seasoned and adorned with mussels, shrimp and bits of sausage. We also shared a piece of wild caught Alaskan King Salmon which was cooked to perfection and accompanied by mashed sweet potatoes and yummy al dente asparagus. Blue Point is a wonderful dining establishment and you should go as soon as possible.
