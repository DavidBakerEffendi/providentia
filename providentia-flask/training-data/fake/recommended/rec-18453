This halal cart rocks. Some days they have the slacker crew there instead but if you catch em when they have the yellow shirts AND the shirts have the black circle logo with the 53rd and 6th Halal words, get on line, order the half lamb/half chicken combo rice platter, get sauce on the side insted and eat it up! The sauce is very spicy so don't overdo it :-)
