Talk about a bad time... The service was terrible. The waitress was on another planet. The bus boy didn't speak English but spoke to us a lot. The menu had hardly any options. Oddly enough there were many bread options. The decor was nice and the $12 mixed drinks were good but overall I had a less then stellar $50 meal.
