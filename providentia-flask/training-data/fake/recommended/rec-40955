This place sells wraps, paninis and smoothies. You really can't go wrong with anything you get there. The food and the smoothies are great. But, what is really great are the people who work there. They really do everything they can to make sure you are satisfied. I only went here twice. But, I could tell the manager has a real passion for serving healthy food. I think that's what makes this place so attractive. This is a must place to go! Â The only thing I could say is that even though the employees work hard, I think they could learn to work smarter. Overall.. great place!
