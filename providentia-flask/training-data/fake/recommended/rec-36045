I've only eaten here once, but it was absolutely delicious.  My wife and I shared a couple of appetizers, two entrees and a dessert.  They were all delicious and reasonably priced for New York.  The place is small and busy so you need to make reservations.   The menu selection is a bit limited and many of the items weren't things that I would normally order so that may be an issue for future visits, but given how much I liked what I ordered the first time I'd be willing to be daring and try some other items.
