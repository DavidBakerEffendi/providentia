We stopped here for dinner on the way back from a meeting in Hartford. Yelp lead me to this cute cozy corner restaurant. At first we weren't sure as the lure of the other fancy restaurants on the block was distracting, but we trusted the reviews we read... And weren't disappointed!! Empanadas were hands down the best I've ever had! Dining room is small, but staff was attentive and extremely knowledgable about the menu items and ingredients. Hector was great! Dinner was great! We asked for a piece of grilled chicken for my 2 year old as they don't have a kids menu... They were super accommodating and didn't even charge us for it cause "it was so little" ... Seriously nice people and great food!
