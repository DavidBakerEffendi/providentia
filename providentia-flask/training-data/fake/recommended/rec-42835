This is a very solid 4 star place- tasty, perfectly prepared burger with lightening fast service. Hand to god it took less than 10 minutes for them to bring our food out. My only complaint is with the bacon on the bistro burger, it wasn't anything special. I'd skip the bistro burger and just get a cheeseburger. Not as good as Shake Shack, but still damn tasty. Other than that, awesome little burger joint with lots of character at the right price.
