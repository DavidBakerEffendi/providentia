If you want to be pleasantly thrilled by an ever-changing, adventurous menu (that transforms on a daily basis) then you this is your new favorite restaurant. It is certainly my northeastern region favorite... even the finest Boston restaurants don't compare when it comes to pairing exotic ingredients for wonderfully prepared dishes. Â Your taste buds and other culinary-centric senses will never be bored here. The chefs at Misery Loves Co. love food and their passion shines with all their scrumptious, experimental, artfully crafted concoctions. Of course, if you don't feel adventurous enough to unexpectedly discover your new favorite recipe, there are always some superb traditional dishes to be ordered. CHEERS! I love this restaurant.
