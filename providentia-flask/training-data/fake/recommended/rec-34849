This is one of my favorite places to eat anywhere. A small classic "hole in the wall". I have been to other similar shops, but none come close other than their sister place in the village. I can't vouch as to whether this is authentic Indian food, but 75% of the customers appear to be of "native" descent. Don't expect atmosphere. There are only about 16-20 dirty seats in the whole place.  You wait in a long line to order at lunch time.  My strategy is to call the order in ahead of time and take it home. My favorite is the chicken roll. Warning, the food can be very spicy.
