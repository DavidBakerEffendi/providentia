I loved this place. This place was expensive but the three pillars were met: Food, Service and Environment The place was the a nice rustic dark candle lit environment. The service was great, it was effortless and proactive. My glass of water was never empty while I was there. We mentioned that indicated that we would share something and they took the initiative and split the portions into two plates or they cut our ice cream sandwhich in two. I've rarely had the wait staff be that proactive. The food was nice, fresh and the flavors were good. Had the Pan Fried Chicken, the Salad with Apple and Pears, the Brocolli side and the ice cream sanwhich. There's a few other dishes I forgot, but I would definitely come back for more. Looks like everyone else agrees.
