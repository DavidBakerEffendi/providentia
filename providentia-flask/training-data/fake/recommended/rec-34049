So I went here because my roommate said it was great and I was curious to see what the yelp hype was all about. I wasn't impressed. Not bad food but not great, and sadly a bit tacky. While the salmon and asparagus dish was pretty good, the fried hot pepper stuffed with cheese so was so, and the ice cream snickers bar was the same as one you can buy at a bodega only more expensive...what's original about that? It wasn't all bad though. The service was good and the atmosphere is cool. I dig the disco ball. But I don' think I'll be coming back again.
