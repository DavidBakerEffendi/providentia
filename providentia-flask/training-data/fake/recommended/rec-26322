This here, is my golden years. My 4 golden years of undergrad going to frat parties, frolicking off to Kat-man-du, pounding back 4 red bulls a night in a desperate attempt to stuff my small brain with as much information as I can before an exam, aaaaaand Mamma Flora's. Specifically her penne vodka pasta. YUM. If you want good ole quality home-cooked Italian food, come here.
