Being originally from Kolkata it was a delight to get a bite of these at NYC. We tried quite a few rolls and we felt the following about them: Shammi kabab roll - ok, the filling could have been better. Unda roll - good. Achari paneer roll - good Chana masala roll - good Aloo masala roll - good Although anything of this sort at NYC is a bliss, but I felt they could improve upon the flour crust of the rolls. Also we bought extra green chutney and it was very watery, it should have been much more consistent and tasteful. That said, I would like to mention that we traveled over the Independence Day weekend and the extra rush could have contributed to the quality. In all, nice place and does deserve at-least a try.
