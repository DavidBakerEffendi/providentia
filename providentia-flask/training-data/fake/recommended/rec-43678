Intended to go elsewhere but it was closed. I'm so glad it was. This place has incredibly fresh food, a charming and simple decor, Â and knowledgeable staff who are clearly passionate about food. Best duck hash I've ever had. The apple smoked bacon was top notch, grapefruit mimosas over the standard OJ version, Small plate of breads they bring automatically are incredible especially the carrot bread with the meiruange crust. You can't miss that and its made in house! I don't think you'll be dissatisfied with any choice. Pricing should be 3 stars, not 2 but still a great value for the quality.
