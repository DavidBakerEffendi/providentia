The BF brought me here for my birthday dinner. He's greek so he's really picky when it comes to food (especially greek food) lol. We got the spanakopita and greek salad for an ap, both were delicious. For our main dishes I picked the shrimp stuffed with crab meat and rice on the side. OMG it was delicious. He got the steak and he enjoyed it very much. Our waitress was excellent and the owners were very pleasant as well. Def worth the stop, and we will be back!!!
