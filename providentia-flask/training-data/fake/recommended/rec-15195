Came back here with a group of 6 so we got to try a bunch of different things. Everything was terrific, the Vodka pizza is a must order and deservedly so because it is that good. But the other food, like the Grandma's Braciole, Cavatelli with Sausage and Broccoli Rabe, and Chicken Parm are up there with other great Italian spots in the city so this isn't just a pizza spot. Great food and service, cool ambiance, and the very good pricing make this a perfect spot for a date or group dinner.
