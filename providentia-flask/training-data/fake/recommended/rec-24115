I'm a breakfast aficionado. And this place here? Perfect. I love eating here. The look first of all is simplistic and clean, pretty warm feeling too. I like my breakfast spots to smell of food, like permeating through the walls. This place has it. Shrimp & grits, bomb. Red velvet pancakes, bomb. Vegan scramble, bomb. Chicken & waffles, bomb. Every French toast, bomb bomb. Mm. Happy eating y'all
