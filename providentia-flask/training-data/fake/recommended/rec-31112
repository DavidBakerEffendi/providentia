Best Mac & Cheese ever! Finally got around to check out this place. I have heard so many good things and then when I head Guy from triple D checked it out earlier in the week, I knew I needed to hit the place up before it blew up... cause it will. Let me talk about this Mac & Cheese, it's like none other I've had before. It's macaroni in a cheese sauce, but then its topped with feta and cheddar crumbles and pickled onions, mmmmmmmmm. Go eat it now! We also got the wings and Oyster Po Boy. The wings had the most flavorful mild sauce I've ever had, but I prefer crispy wings. The Po Boy was good, but I would have liked more oysters on it. Great beer selection too! Service was spot on also. Check this place out before it airs on Triple D or you'll be waiting.
