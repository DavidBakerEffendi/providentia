Extremely DELICIOUS food and drinks, GREAT service, and lovely front-yard! Whatever I have ordered so far came out great. - Malawach w/ eggs (ordered 7-8 times) - Pancakes - French toast (my bf ordered 5-6 times) - Apple cider - most of the cocktails The food is prepared by an expert I believe!! The salad is so fresh, tomato sauce that comes with my omelette every time is like fresh-cut tomatoes. The cherry-berry jam was soo delicious. I went to this place at least 10 times and took different friends there. They all loved it! Anyways, the bottom line is if you haven't tried this place yet; GO and TRY ASAP, if you did, GO again and take more people there, they will be grateful to you!!!
