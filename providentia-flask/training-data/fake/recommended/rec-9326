I love the lamb over rice--perfect post-drinking food--but it's really annoying how stingy they are with giving you the white sauce to go now. I used to be able to take 5 of them in addition to them putting a ton on the food itself (yes, I use that much) but now they'll put nothing on and hassle you if you try to get more than 2 sauces. Geez, stop being so stingy about the best part!
