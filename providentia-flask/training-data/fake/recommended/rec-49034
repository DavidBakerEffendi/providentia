I've been coming here since this place opened a couple years back. Living in Montclair, there are several good pizza places to choose from but I always choose this place over those. The pizza here is always fresh and delicious. The variety also trumps any of that in the surrounding competition. The $5 lunch special is a steal and the staff and owner Josh are always on top of their game. If you're looking for a well decorated cozy fresh pizza spot then come here. I wish these guys the best of luck.
