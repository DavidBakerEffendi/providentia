I just had a Roasted Pork sandwich here with the Sharp Provolone and Sweet Peppers. Yes, it was good, but I think I could've probably done with the cheese and peppers, especially since it cost $1.25 for these 2 toppings. If you don't like sharp cheese, don't get the Sharp Provolone on your sandwich. The pork itself was alright--I didn't think that it was the best I've had. I suppose this place is borderline worth trying so only come here if you really want a pork sandwich that's highly rated in Philly. Otherwise, the Reading Terminal is just an awesome place to get some grub.
