Lovely! My best friend and I made a weekend of NY to visit Central Perk! We were staying in smelly ole china town and decided some sweet Italian was in order. Our server Freddy was attentive and gracious and we enjoyed a lovely bottle of Pinot with our amazing Pasta dishes. The place started hopping once the accordion player arrived. It felt like I was home in a Sunday afternoon with the family. Everyone was singing and cheering and I fell in love with NYC all over again. Italian people and culture is the best. thank you Benito One for making this weekend perfect. The lemon cello and cannoli was amazing. James, we love your family - Good wishes to you!
