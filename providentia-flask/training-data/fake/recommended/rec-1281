2 of my friends and I was in the mood for a byob brunch spot on sunday and found Miles Table. Its located in a really quiet section of south street. fews things about miles table. 1.you order first and they give you a number. 2. it is self seating 3. its BYOB!!! Their food is so simple its delicious. you get exactly what you order, without extra grease or surprises. 4 stars because even though its not a real "serving" restaurant... they do have food runners who bring your food and clean up after you. they never came back out to check on us.
