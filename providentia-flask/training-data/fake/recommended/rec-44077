I've been going to Rangoon since the mid '90s and it has never, ever disappointed!  It's one of my favorite restaurants of all-time, and I seriously worry about what I will do if the owners ever decide to retire! After what's probably a hundred visits by now, I've settled on my favorite dishes and I love that they never change the menu.  Why mess with perfection?  My favorite dishes are the thousand layer bread with vatana bean dip, summer chicken salad, chili monk fish, and kung pao chicken.  And farluda for dessert is a must!  I call it "a party in a glass." :) Rangoon also has a great story behind it of how it was founded by three women friends.  I think that core of friendship is reflected in the ambience, which is warm, inviting, and relaxed.  The decor is pretty but not trendy, which makes it a very comfortable place to just settle in and have a great meal, without worrying about dressing up or being seen.
