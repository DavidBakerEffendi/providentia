Not sure what people are raving about, this was one of the worst grilled cheeses I've ever had. Bread was overly grilled and unnecessarily oily - saturated. Cheese was not melty enough for long enough and didn't have good flavor. I'm pretty sure I didn't get them on an off-day because my eating partner loved her grilled cheese. I think they kind of sucked. Way, way better: Roxy's or Grilled Cheese Nation in Boston, or that food truck that has light green on it in New Haven (I've seen it parked near the courthouse).
