This is our go to place for a non greasy lunch or dinner. We love their gyros! I always get the roasted veggie gyro. It's the best! My boyfriend gets the chicken gyro with spicy mayo, another delicious option. We like to split either a side Greek salad or sweet potato fries. I'd estimate that we get delivery from here at least once a week. It's a fast casual type place and there isn't much seating inside. Everything is reasonably priced which is why we keep coming back. Highly recommend!
