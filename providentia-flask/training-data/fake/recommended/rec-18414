The kung fu xiao long bao is OUT OF THIS WORLD. Those soup dumplings are the  best I've ever had--the flavor is exquisite. I could have eaten the entire basket by myself. Food: 1. vegetarian dumpling - skip it, totally forgettable and you'll get much better           elsewhere 2. kung fu xiao long bao - best dang thing on this planet 3. dan dan noodles - so spicy it might blow your head off, but it's tasty! The food here is good enough to deserve 4 stars, but the service needs serious work. We needed to ask for every. single. dish. in order to receive it. In addition, the wind chill in this restaurant is ridiculous. Every time the door opened, the wind rushed in, so we had to keep our coats on the entire meal. The cold was unnecessarily exacerbated by the line that formed, as the door was often open for minutes at a time. The staff really should have taken more care to see that the door was closed in a timely manner out of consideration for their customers. Tip: sit at the back of the restaurant to avoid hypothermia UPDATE: The management has written to me and has installed a curtain to help with the chill. Additionally, they have also ordered a porch door to further address the cold.
