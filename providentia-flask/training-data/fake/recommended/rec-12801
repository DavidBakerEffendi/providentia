When I lie in bed and think of an awesome breakfast place...this place appears in my dreams. Perfect atmosphere for breakfast...crowded, a bit noisy, lots of conversations...I'm in love!  I mean really who wants to start the day off in a quiet, I can hear a pen drop, kinda atomosphere. I mean how boring! I ordered an eggs benedict...de-freaking-licious.  Came with some awesome home fries as well, fresh (and I mean FRESH) oj, and a small cappucino that was perfectly made.  Next time for sure, I want to try the pumpkin pancakes!   Who said, "Breakfast is the best meal of the day"?  Well that person was talking about this place my friend and surely deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.
