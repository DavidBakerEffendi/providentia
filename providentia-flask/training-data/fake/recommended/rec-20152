I too am a huge Beyonce fan & I must admit I learned of this restaurant because they frequent here. Well...I was thoroughly pleased. I came from NJ to celebrate my B'day and although the wait was 45 min the Hostess was so kind to get me in sooner; and not only that but since I told her I would wait outside in my car, she came out and personally got me and my family...who does that?!?! The food was amazing! I had the EGGS HUNTINGTON...Poached eggs, buttermilk biscuit with hollandaise. Since I told my waiter I didn't eat pork, he substituted the ham for spinach. To top it off...the Mimosa's were fantastic! I was even surprised with 2 complimentary Jelly Donut Balls with a candle...xoxo! I have found a little hidden treasure here & I will def be back!!!
