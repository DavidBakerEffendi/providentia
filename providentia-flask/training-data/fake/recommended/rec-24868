This place is AMAZING. The food, service, atmosphere, and decor is 5 stars worthy baby! We ordered the spring rolls and noodles. I remember my sister getting her noodles and after the first bite she says to me "I never want this bowl to end!" The food is delicious "my mouth is watering as we speak." There are a lot of great Thai places but of all the places that I've been to I found that Room Service does a great job to keep you interested but you don't feel like you're eating a bucket of oil. The ambiance is comfy couture and I can't wait to go back to try other dishes! * I just read my review to my sister and she goes "would you mind if we got delivery from room service"? I'll let you guys know how their delivery rates!
