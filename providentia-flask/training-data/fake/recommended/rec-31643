Tried Salute for the first time for a friends birthday a few weeks ago. The food was EXCELLENT! It was definitely an outstanding meal. Food and service were both 5 stars.. The 4 star review was due to a glitch that shows the wrong menu online. We went there with a whole different meal in our heads because we had googled the menu and it looked amazing! When were looking at the ACTUAL menu ( once we were seated in the restaurant) it was completely different. We asked the waitress and were told that was a glitch and that menu is for their sister restaurant Fin ( right down the block)
