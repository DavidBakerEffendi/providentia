Been here twice to watch the Olympics they had on projector, drink huge liters of beer and eat dinner. It wasn't busy at the times we were there so there were no problems with the wait. Ordered the bacon and mushroom spaetzle which I LOVE and I think it goes great with beer. The "Little Lamb" and Atlantic 'Lachs' (salmon) burgers were delicious as were the crispy fries with curry ketchup. On our next visit, we weren't happy with the "Kanzler" and the Classic burgers but the manager was nice enough to hear us out and refunded our check! The German potato salad was too vinegar-y and we did not finish it. Great place and atmosphere, though. They have ping pong tables so careful where you sit in case they hit the balls in your direction!
