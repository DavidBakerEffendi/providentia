Other than convenience of location, there's not much going for this place. Clearly their menu is way too large, as 90% of their items taste pretty terrible. I have no problem with cheap quality food other than paying too much for it. And if you don't have cash you might want to think twice, as their credit card machine breaks quite often. Poor customer service really deters me from ever returning as well. Personally I'd recommend eating something at Blue State next door or just walking up Whitney where you have Subway and Moe's, among many other choices.
