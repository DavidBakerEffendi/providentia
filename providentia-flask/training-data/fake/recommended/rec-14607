My Saturday late lunch. The food itself was so so like 3 star to me but the the owner was amazing. He gave me an extra soup and greeted me with a big genuine smile, not those fake standard please-tip-me from some restaurants nearby. I ordered pondicherry. I took it back to my apt. I thought about eating in the park but I figured it could be a little messy w all the dip and soup. I was proven right.
