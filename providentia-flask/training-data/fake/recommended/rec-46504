I came here with my boyfriend for his 30th birthday dinner and had an amazing time.  We had been following Chef Forgione on The Next Iron Chef, so was bowled over when he came out to personally wish my boyfriend a happy 30th. The staff were really friendly and encouraging towards all the menu choices that we made.  For appetizers, we ordered the chili lobster in a sriracha sauce with Texas toast and the crab cake special.  My boyfriend thought the crab cake was the best that he had ever had.  This was followed by Casco Bay cod (medley of seafood) and LI duck Elvis Presley for entrees, finishing with Lady Ashton's chocolate cake and pecan pie bread pudding for dessert. The food was amazingly good and included mini compliments from the chef, in the form of a spoonful of pumpkin soup, one potato chip with dip and a shot of green tea sorbet.  My boyfriend thought his duck was phenomenal, but I thought my Casco Bay seafood ensemble was a bit peculiar, consisting of one shrimp, a couple of scallops, clams, mussels and a piece of cod.  I would definitely come back again, but wouldn't order the Casco Bay cod in future. This is a great place for a romantic dinner, date or even to come with a group of friends.  Even the bar area looks like a fun place to have a couple of drinks.
