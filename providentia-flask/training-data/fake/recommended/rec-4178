I took our puppies and rode our bikes to Fare for Sunday Brunch! We were lucky enough to be able to get a great table outside, which provided a great place for people watch!   The eggs benedict with Nova Salmon was delicious! The portion was huge and the everything bagel was a nice twist to an old classic!  The salad that accompanied was simple and very flavorful!  My husband had the eggs any style with bacon and potatoes, everything was really fresh and tasty. The chipotle bloody mary was a great finishing touch to a great meal! We debated about sitting there all day until the dinner service, those avocado crab cakes were calling my name!! However, the real world kicked in and we had errands to run.  We will be splitting our brunches between here and Rembrandts!
