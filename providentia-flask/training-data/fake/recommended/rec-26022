This place is great for a number of reasons. The staff is always friendly. The food is good and reasonably priced. You can definitely find a healthy option. They deliver. And they're next to washington commons, a bar/beer garden that allows you to bring your own food! what more could you want? Shorter wait time? Option to pay with credit card? Yes. Looking forward to these in the future. They're still relatively new, so I'm hoping they'll get that sorted out. In the meantime, it's distinctive and very tasty. I like all the kimchi bowl options. (also, they're not joking about the chicken being really spicy!)
