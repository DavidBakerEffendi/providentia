I've been to Rye now three times. The most recent one was on my birthday. They had a lovely table set up. It was close to the end of brunch but our server was gracious and patient with us. Overall, the service was truly excellent. And I've worked as a server, so I know how taxing it can be, especially at the end of a shift. I was really impressed. Our food was spectacular. I had the Rye Benedict. Honestly, it's a very affordable place. Yay for Rye. Back soon!
