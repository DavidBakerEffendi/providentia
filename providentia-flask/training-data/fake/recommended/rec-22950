Love this place. If I had to convince someone to become vegan this is where I would take them. As everyone else has said the menu is extensive. The quinoa chili was a welcome addition for a cold day lunch. Dining area is low-key, but enjoyable and clean. Only complaint is the smoked tempeh is a bit heavy on the salt, but otherwise delicious!
