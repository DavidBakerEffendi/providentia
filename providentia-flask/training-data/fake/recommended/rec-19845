This place was great had the restaurant of the week menu where i got appetizer, entree and dessert plus a glass of wine for a great prize. The food ive never had anything like it else where which says a lot because I am dominican and grew up eat Latin American food but the food at this place even the sauces were delectable. The tilapia tacos are a must! Had the lechon which was good but the reason why im giving it a 4 not used to having just a plate of meat with no rice or veggies or anything else to go with it and then the flan delicious. The wait staff were super nice service was awesome even though the place was packed everyone was super attentive and made our time at the venue an enjoyable one. Will definitely return and recommend!
