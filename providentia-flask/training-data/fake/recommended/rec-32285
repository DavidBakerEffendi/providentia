Incredible burgers cooked precisely as ordered.  Great selection of options (sauces, toppings, meat-or-non-meat burgers), and very reasonably priced.  Good selections from start to finish from starters to desserts for carnivores and vegans alike (and everyone in between).   We all ordered sirloin beef burgers, and it was freshly made, cooked (mid-rare!) as ordered, and portioned with the perfect balance of lettuce and tomato.  Toppings were good (the cheddar was sharp, the bacon crisp), with one exception: the bleu cheese was not very flavorful, and (contrary to expectations) appeared to have been a slice of bleu cheese.  Odd, but perhaps it simply melted?  Either way, it was a strange thing to not be able to taste one of the strongest cheeses imaginable.  Everything else was great, however. Staff were polite, attentive, and more than happy to chide you (gently but appropriately) for ordering a burger well done.   The restaurant itself is quite small, but still unique and charming in its own way.  There's plenty of space - so you won't feel cramped. Sketch succeeds in that they serve damned good food at decent prices in an environment that is fun and welcoming.  More restaurants (another local burger joint that fancies itself a Pretty Young Thing comes to mind) should look to Sketch when they want to see how a business that wants customers to come back should be run. We will definitely be back.
