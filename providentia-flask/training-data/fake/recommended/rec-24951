Here's the breakdown for my 3-star review: 5 stars for the view and decor 4 stars for food (flavor, presentation, etc.) 2 stars for identity and menu overall i.e., I wouldn't call blue a true "fusion" style restaurant.  The menu is all over the place - Italian, Asian, Indian, Greek and American.  For example the Greek style chicken feta came with a side of plain old mashed potatoes. ???
