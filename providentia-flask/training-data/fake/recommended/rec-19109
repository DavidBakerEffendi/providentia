The pizza is made in a coal oven, which gives it a fantastic flavor, and the ingredients are high quality.  The pepperoni is fantastic and highly recommended. It is definitely a thin crust, and I recommend eating it with a fork and knife, or you'll end up with a mess.  The smell of pizza is pretty intoxicating, and it is everywhere, making the wait you are sure to have for a table almost unbearable.   If you get there before the dinner rush, it's a 5 star pizza experience.  The knowledge that you're going to have to wait, especially if you come in with a group, makes me subtract a star. Let's just say I get cranky if I'm hungry and made to wait.  It's not that the place is small, it's just super-busy.   If you're able to snag one of the few seats in their bar area, I might just bump them back up, but that's not a very likely possibility, unless (once again) you make it in before the dinner rush. Man, now I want Lombardi's for dinner...
