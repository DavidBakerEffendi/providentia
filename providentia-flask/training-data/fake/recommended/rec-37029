Wish I could give this zero stars! One of THEE worst places I have ever been to. 2 fights broke out and that's when we were still on line waiting to get in another fight broke out inside the place. My girlfriend and I where there to meet my brother and his girl so I felt obligated to at least show my face. Any other time I would've left on the spot. I like grown and sexy vibe mature places where people are the to have a civilized good time. This place is the TOTAL opposite super duper ridiculously overcrowded very small space bad music coming out of bad equipment.Bartenders serve you one drink if you order three bcuz they suck and they're trying to serve in some weird everyone gets one drink at a time style and the food is mediocre at best. I will NEVER EVER come anywhere near this place again in my life if you want loud bad music, bad service, crappie bar food, and wanna feel like a sardine in a can this is the place.
