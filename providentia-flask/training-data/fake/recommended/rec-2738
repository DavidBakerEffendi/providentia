My friends and I stopped in here for brunch after church today. We hadn't seen each other since before the holidays and wanted to meet somewhere quiet so we could catch up. The food at Cafe V is mediocre at best. I ordered the banana bread french toast and it had absolutely no flavor. Zero. Even the syrup had no flavor, it reminded me of wax. The eggs florentine my friend ordered looked tasty, but who knows ... Looks can be deceiving. She didn't make any comments about her food (good or bad) - so I assume it was just ok. I gave them 3 stars because my friends and I sat around in the shop for about 5 hours and weren't pestered to leave. We had a lot of catching up to do, the place was empty and they kept our water glasses full. Our server admitted that today was her first day ... one could easily tell that, but she was nice and sweet, so we cut her a break. Wouldn't go there to eat ever again. If you're in need of a quiet spot for chit-chatting, though ... this is the place!
