If you want to to be delight by many different plates but don't want to stuff yourself, then this an one excellent choice, especially going with a date.  It's atmosphere is casual but not trashy, trendy without going to the top yet classy enough to make you feel comfortable.  For the food, there's so many different choices and surprisingly, all of them are delicious.  However, mind you that certain dishes are pretty "micro-size" but then again, most come here to be delight without feeling the guilt of over-indulging.
