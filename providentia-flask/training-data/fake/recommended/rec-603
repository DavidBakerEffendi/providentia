Alta was recommended VERY highly and I've been wanting to go for years. I was SUPER underwhelmed pretty much sums up my experience here. We ordered a ton of food. Fried goat cheese(stone cold), shrimp (bland), octopus (cold and bland. would've been fine if they had thrown a little salt on it), bacon wrapped dates and olives(you can't screw that up-thank goodness- but they were cold),pork belly (the only thing that was warmer than room temp. Just ok. The kale and citrus salad that came with it was the best thing we had all night), Brussels sprouts (cold, burned beyond recognition, under seasoned and greasy), foie two ways (this was the dish I waited for all night...the salt that was missing from the rest of the dinner, showed up on this dish), mojito(worst mojito I've ever had in my life, and I've had too many than I should probably fess up to! There were 3 lime wedges that weren't squeezed at all. I did it myself. Mint wasn't muddled at all either.) I know they were busy, but the service was also lacking. My husband was never asked if he wanted a drink refill. Our meal came out in 4 phases and not once were our plates cleared...my husband had shrimp heads on his plate since the first round. You know it's a less than stellar experience when you're searching for another restaurant in the area, before you've paid for dinner, to make up for it.
