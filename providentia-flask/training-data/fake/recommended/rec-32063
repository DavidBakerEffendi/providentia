I am finishing my honeybar creation as I type this and holy moly was that good. I picked 3 fresh fruits, my choice of honey, granola, and added their homemade whipped cream which amounted to the best 5 dollars Ive ever spent. I custom created my whole order even down to my beverage from the touch screens they have set up. My complaint? The touch screen was incredibly frustrating. There was some lag or I'd have to press 2 or 3 times to get it to work. then, once I'd gone to the screen where you confirm your order, I wanted to change one small thing but it doesn't let you do that- I had to cancel and restart my whole order. When I first sat down to enjoy my food, an elderly woman walked in and looked like she needed some help. An employee came right over, walked her through her whole order on the screen, and even let her sit down and get her cash out and she ran back to the register and then brought her the change. So A+ for customer service! Weird selection of food... smoothies and juice and fruit which i get, and then stir fry? interesting mix, but yummy nonetheless. I will be back!
