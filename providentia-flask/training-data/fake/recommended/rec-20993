I strongly recommend this place for a drink, dinner, or both! Their wine list is impressive and food is amazing! I tried the risotto and the filet mignon, both are delicious, and for desert the Tatin tart and chocolate sausage are to die for! The atmosphere is very friendly and the service is great too. I will definitely go back!
