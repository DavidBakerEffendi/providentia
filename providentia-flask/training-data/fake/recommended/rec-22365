Ilili has quietly become my favorite NYC restaurant.   While I sort of detest the front door staff (from the calling to confirm the reservation thing -- I just made the reservation! I don't want you to call me so that I have to call you back! to the snippy guy at the front door "Um, your party isn't complete so when they're here let me know." Ugh. They seem too pretentious and unfriendly for what is an amazing, relaxed restaurant), everything else here is just perfect -- the upstairs space is my favorite because it's a bit more laid back, and a bit more quiet.   Still love the chicken taouk (absolutely perfect), the hummus served with the huge pita pooris (amazing, warm, soft delectable pita), still love the amazing candy bar dessert (heaven, heaven, heaven). These people have it!
