Beer is slightly less than mediocre, but it's not overly pricey. We ended up here a few times over the course of a weekend, and I'm not exactly sure why. We didn't even drink beer after the first night. Their snacks are decent & cheap & the perfect size. Cheese fries were very cheesey and the sweet potato fries were great in whatever dressing they serve. Jalepeno poppers taste like they came out of a bag though. They weren't even spicy. Beer-wise, I thought their smoked porter was the best. Pete thought it was the sour ale, which I found bland. Their IPA was super-flat. The pale ale was pretty mediocre. The forbidden fruit was not too sweet, so it was bearable. Their experimental citra hopped IPA was not hoppy at all... We had another beer or two, but they are escaping me right now. Guess that's how memorable they were. And finally, mixed drinks were weak. SIGH!!! I'd rather eat/drink elsewhere. I think I will next time. I'm pretty sure we just kept coming back because of the cheap snacks. I love me some snacks.
