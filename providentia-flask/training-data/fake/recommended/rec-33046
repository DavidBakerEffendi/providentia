This was my second time I got to drop in. The first was great, unfortunately todays experience was not the same. We got the chef tasting menu, the highlights where the chicken vindaloo and the desserts. The butter chicken, which was one of my favorites from my previous visit, was the worst this time around. The other courses were average at best. I expected more from a high quality restaurant like this one.
