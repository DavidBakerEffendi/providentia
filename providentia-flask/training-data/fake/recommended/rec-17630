I agree with the previous poster's statement that "I really want to love this place."  The decor is gorgeous, from the wood panelling on the bowed ceiling to the marble bar, it truly is an awesome looking place.  There is an excellent assortment of beers on tap, from Boddingtons to Hoegaarden, Blue Moon, Guiness of course, etc... Their home brewed beers are good as well.  The food is a little pricey for what you get.  You won't leave hungry, but you may not be completely satisfied.  The shepheard's pie was lackluster and the fish and chips was quite ordinary as well.  The bangers and mash, on the other hand, was quite good, and will probably have me coming back again.  Go for the decor and the beers.  Catch a game at the bar.  Go somewhere else for a serious dinner.   Free parking is in their lot in the rear.  There is also outside dining, but they weren't playing any music out there when we were there.
