Took the kids after a long day at Franklin Institute for an early dinner ...definitely a cool vibe spot.   The kids loved food presentation....hot  chocolate in a  heart shaped mug, using a paintbrush to coat French fries with ketchup and best of all  the  "chocolate needle" (served on a board  dusted with powdered sugar and gummy bears ).  Don't get downtown much but happy this was our restaurant selection.
