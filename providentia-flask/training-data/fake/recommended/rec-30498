went here for dinner last night-- shared the tuna tartare and brussels sprouts. both were so good-- the brussels were very crispy and delicious! also a pretty big portion. had the chicken salad for dinner-- it was a good size and also delicious. for desert you have to get the apple pie--- amazing! loved the atmosphere of this place. also loved that you could order wine by the carafe or big carafe. a great, easy, delicious place.
