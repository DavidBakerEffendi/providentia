Love this place. Am here at least one morning out of every weekend. Great service. Great food. Perfect coffee!  It's a pretty big place, and there's pretty much always a table when we go - which is generally before 9 on a weekend morning.  Plenty of parking too.  They roast their own coffee beans at an associated business, and the coffee is really, really good.  Definitely would recommend this Makris to anyone. Oh, and if you like Polish foods you'll find some really great lunch specials, too!
