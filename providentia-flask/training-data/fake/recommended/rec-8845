I am okay with this place. My fiance who grew up in Singapore attested to the authenticity of the food and no doubt it was a slice of home for her. However nothing we ordered really jumped at me. We got the roti, henan chicken, laksa... everything was A-OK at an OK price. For anyone who doesn't frequently eat oriental food I guess the food is kind of exotic. But otherwise I'd just wait to visit the real deal in Singapore or even HK :)
