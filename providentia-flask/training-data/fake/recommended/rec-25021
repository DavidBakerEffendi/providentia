I love how the Belgian Cafe is tucked into the neighborhood and a short walk from my place. The evening was perfect for sitting outside which is also reflected in the rating. It took the waitress a little longer than I'd like to make her introduction and take the drink and appetizer order. The bulk of the menu is their impressive beer selection but I was happily satisfied with the creative but short food menu. My boyfriend ordered the De Koninck, a Belgian amber, he enjoyed it and to my surprise since I don't usually go for ambers, I did too. It didn't have the bitter after taste I associate with many ambers and wasn't malty. For an appetizer we had the Spinach and Artichoke dip. Wish it would have been made with less mayo and more spinach but I loved that they kept the artichokes whole. They also accommodated our order with celery sticks along side the freshly fried pita bread. I was very grateful. Our main dishes came out moments after we finished off the appetizer. Perfect timing and unexpected to our delight. For our entrees, I had the Vegetable Zucchini Noodles - the noodles are very thinly sliced zucchini along with tomatoes, peas, onions, asparagus, and yellow squash. I loved the gluten free, vegan option! Â It was seasoned with parsley and lemon. However, I only felt like I had one good bite with lemon flavor and would have preferred more but the dish was still delicious! The bf had the pulled brisket sandwich with coleslaw on the side. He put the coleslaw on top of the sandwich and dug in. The brisket was very juicy and uniquely flavored although somewhat on the messy side, was completely worth it. The waitress could have done a bit better job checking in as my bf had to ask for water at the same time we put in our entree order and we ended up going inside to pay. I am looking forward to visiting Belgian Cafe again to try some of their salads and mussels! I know the beer selection would keep my bf satisfied for several visits.
