An interesting concept. I unfortunately didn't have time to really sample the food more than a burger. The wasabi mayo was actually pretty good, better than I thought. Though I'd like to see a wasabi mustard as well. Burger was nicely made, good quality, but a little small...maybe a 1/3 pound patty would work better. The portion of fries was huge. A little too big I think, by volume you get more fries than burger. I think a home made malt vinegar would go better with the fries. Or perhaps a salt and powdered wasabi sprinkle? I'd like to go back and try more from these guys next time I'm in New York.
