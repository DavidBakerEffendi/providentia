I first heard about about this spot from fellow yelper (and friend) Mandar M. Coppelia is a 24/7 Cuban restaurant/diner. That's pretty awesome in its own right. I've dined there on several occasions and it's definitely a solid late night/early morning spot. I'm a fan. I've always been pretty pleased with the service, and everything I've tried has ranged from decent to excellent. The menu is eclectic and the prices are great. Plus the ambiance is pretty cool too. As far as specific recommendations, there isn't much that has been especially memorable for me. If you're in the mood for breakfast, I can vouch for their french toast. Try some of their snack items, they are super cheap and yummy. I've always found their yucca fries to be pretty tasty too. My favorite item is probably their Torrejas de Oliva dessert, it's pretty amazing, though on my last visit it wasn't as orgasmic as usual. Still, if you have room for dessert, try it! I don't think I'd be inclined to visit during "normal" dining hours, but from 1-6 in the morning it's the place to be.
