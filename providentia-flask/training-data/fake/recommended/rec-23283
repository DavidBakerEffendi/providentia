Ok.  Never eaten in the restaurant, but have had their delivery several times both Chinese and Japanese.  It inexpensive, good quality, and taste great.  Delivery for a fairly large sushi order was an hour, but I know seems long but well worth it.  Highly recommend if you are at home sick and need food or just hungry for Asian fare.  This is a little South Philly treasure.
