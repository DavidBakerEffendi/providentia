Rex opened a week after I moved into the neighborhood and I couldn't have been happier when it did. My joy for it has only grown since and a drop-in visit several times a week before my day begins is now the norm. Rex makes excellent coffee, serves freshly baked scones, muffins, croissants & pound cakes and makes fresh sandwiches using primarily locally sourced ingredients. The team that works here is extremely friendly and customer-focused. They will know your name by your third visit! The cowboy cookie, the egg salad and brie & avocado sandwiches are great, as is the egg & cheese sandwich (served on weekends only). Rex is a small, neighborhood coffee shop that chooses to do a few things, but does them incredibly well and with impeccable care. Several reviewers have rated it poorly for not being everything to everyone, but I rate it highly for exactly the same reason.
