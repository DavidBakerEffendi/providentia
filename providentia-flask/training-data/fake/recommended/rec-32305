Absolutely the best burgers ever. We tried the Kobe burger with wasabi, the smashed onion burger and the truffle burger. The fries are amazing. Maybe the best we've ever eaten. The Macaroni and cheese is awesome. And the desserts . . . well you get the picture. The biggest problem was that we all ate too much.
