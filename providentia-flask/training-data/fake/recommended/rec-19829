This place was amazing. I wanted to try something new and was in the Carroll Gardens neighborhood, so I went to yelp for some suggestions, I'm so glad I did. There was about a 20 min wait, but we were able to have a drink at the bar, all the cocktails seemed really good. The staff all seemed friendly and accommodating. I ordered the raw oysters and it was accompanied by two interesting sauces, one was a made with grapefruit and the other seemed to be a tomato dish, both were spectacular. Â The main dishes: I hade the hake. And I'm so glad I did. I wanted a light dish, that was filling and this hit the spot. My partner had the steak special. It was a 16oz steak, but it was amazing! It had a kale encrusted topping and was made perfectly. I also had the strawberry tart as a desert and it was yummy. I can't wait to go back for the chicken & waffles, that looks amazing too.
