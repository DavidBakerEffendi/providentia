I love Han Dynasty, but this location is always packed! I would give it 5 stars if it was easier to get a reservation. The food is so good and spicy! I went with a large group (10+ people) and it was a good experience. My favorite dishes are the Dan Dan Noodle, Cumin Style Lamb, Home Style Tofu, and the String Beans w/ Minced Pork. I recommend the University City/West Philly location because it's bigger (easier to get a reservation or walk-in), but the food is good at both locations!
