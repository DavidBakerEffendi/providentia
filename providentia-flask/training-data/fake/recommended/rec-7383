5/2 8:49pm My husband and I had drinks and dinner. I got the fried oyster special and I got a nice sharp piece of shell in my crispy batter.  The manager, a heavy set white guy, asked how the oysters were and I thumbs downed as tried to get the shell out of my mouth.  I said they're delicious but they've got to be more careful.  Here's a shell.  I tapped it on the plate so he could hear it was a hard piece of shell.  He said, "If you find another I'll get you another plate."  So on my last oyster I find another shell piece.  He's there.  I pointed it out and said there it is.  And his response was to look at it and then give  the 1000 yard stare over left shoulder. They asked us if we wanted desert and since I didn't feel like carefully, trepidatiously chewing any more food that could break my teeth or choke me to death we declined. Honestly, it was the attitude of the manager that earned it the 1 star.   I hope the owner reads this.   This place is pretty pricey but I wouldn't mind if the food wasn't dangerous and management lazy about it. OH!  And when they handed us the check, they gave us a comment card.  It was a little late for that.  I was already mentally composing my Yelp review.
