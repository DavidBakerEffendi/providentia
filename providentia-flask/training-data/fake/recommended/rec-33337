I have traveled the world and eaten in some AMAZING restaurants, but no matter where I go, this place is and will ALWAYS be my FAVORITE restaurant. The food, the ambiance, music, and location are all PERFECTION. I consistently have dreams about the spiced olives and manchengo cheese because they are that good! The kale salad is divinity and the lentil salad with its crisp little falafels never ever disappoints. And if you do nothing else in life, eat the lamb kefedes - mind blowing! The servers are not that great, at least the one I had about a week ago, she was just an order taker and added nothing to the experience, but did not detract much either. I like that they use sustainable and organic products, even some of their wine is sustainably grown, which is a plus. The decor is beautiful in an eclectic, Mediterranean kind of way, so much so that there are bits and pieces that remind me of Greece, Turkey, Morocco and Egypt. Please check this place out and its in a nice part of Brooklyn, but still quiet enough where you can sit on the tables out front!
