An institution for reasonably priced meat burgers and beers" As you walk in, and if it's not the ridiculously overcrowded rush hours filled with wanna be hipsters and locals, you might think you stepped in some old timers bar posing as a burger joint.  Well, they do one thing right, they make a kick ass burger grilled in the old fashion stand up grills which they perfected in CT (New Haven the birthplace of burgers - go check it out yelp.com/biz/387QsrQ4Rfp…).  So the grease slides down, which is ingenious.  The wonder bread buns are perfect, and I would recommend the sloppy joe burger which is extra messy and extra good.  The beers come in these mico pints, but it goes well with what is being served.  Don't expect foie gras on top of your burger, this is like some burger joint from the country side , thrown into the city and priced reasonable which is very unlikely for the city.  It is what is is, one of the best burgers in Manhattan, period.  I just wish there wasn't so many posers trying to feel cool stepping into an hallowed establishment, complaining how dirty it is (go to TGIF please - leave us real connoisseur to our meat burgers and grime) that is really meant for the locals who are always parked at the bar, checking out the hot chicks coming in.  Hey, if I was 60 years old, and had a serious dependency on beer and burgers, I would camp out there and check out the hotties who come in too consume some meat, too.
