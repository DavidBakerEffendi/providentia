It's absolutely fantastic. I love French brasseries so obviously this was a love at first sight (and bite) for me. Casual yet chic atmosphere, delicious food and exceptional service. Salad Balthazar is hands down the best salad I've had in my life. I think it had truffle oil in the dressing. Whatever it was - it made it ridiculously good. I loved the steak tartar and lobster/truffle risotto was very good and big enough to share. Desserts are above and beyond. Pavlova with berries is to die for if you like meringue! I will definitely be back here. Can't wait to try other dishes!
