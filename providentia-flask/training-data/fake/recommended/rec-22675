fun story.. as a newby to the neighborhood, me and my other half were trying to find our neighborhood go-to bar. Bayridge has more than a few places to go, but the atmospheres in most of them are similar to a prison gym, or perhaps somewhere where people drink to relive PTSD. We actually popped in after leaving some douchey place down the street, seeing the glow of the sign down the street. This place is the fucking jam. The beer selection is AMAZING. The food is AMAZING. The staff- jess, louis, all of them... AMAZING. I will take a cab, in the fucking snow, past all the bars on 3rd ave, just to sit and have a beer. i bring my friends from the airport, my neighbor, my co-workers, EVERYONE who i know with a mouth to this place because this place is real life, and youre a ghost if you cant enjoy sweet potato tots and IPAs.
