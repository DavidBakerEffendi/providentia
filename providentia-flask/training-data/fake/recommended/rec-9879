A person's love for the city can be stretched to the point of escape without ever really leaving. Riverpark offers that opportunity. No need for Zipcar, Metro North, NJT or LIRR, just a subway, cab or stroll will get you to this out of Manhattan, top notch dining experience. You could miss the restaurant as you pass NYU medical center, with the only hint being a sign in front of the building. Pass through the lobby like a hyperloop to your ocean view. My initial thought was to sit on the patio, however, I found our window seat inside to be even nicer. Excellent wine selection, including by the glass. If unsure, order half a pour, Pinot noir was smooth and pure for sure. Cod was a nice entree thought I must say the chicken was more flavorful in a very tasty sauce. Service is very friendly/knowledgeable. Definitely check it out.
