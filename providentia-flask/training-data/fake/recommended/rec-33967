Loved Do or Dine. We went in with no expectations, just knew that the owner was a quirky guy who seemed to love food and aimed to transcend conventional thinking about food, which he/his restaurant does. Everything was delicious---the frog legs, the lamb breast and then we split the pork main dish---the only lowish point were the vending machine chicharrones in the pork dish----a better idea would be to get the bagged chicharrones from Mexican bodegas or from cuchifrito places that have the layers of pork skin and fat, but minor flaw. The star was definitely the Foie Grois doughnut---crispy on the outside, delicious mousse on the inside, incredible. And the vibe of the place---wonderfully unpretentious in spite of a culinary genius as the proprietor---we felt at home and the owner was kind enough to stop by and humor us---twice. Really nice guy. We will definitely be going back in spite of living way up in Upper Manhattan. Totally worth the trip.
