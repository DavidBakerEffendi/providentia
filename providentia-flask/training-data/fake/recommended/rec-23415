OMG the food was FANTASTIC,,, we got the pigtails, grits, crab cakes, and maple bread,,, just so damn great.  I was getting antsy because I waited for like 30 min for food,  They could of at least brought the bread out early.  but i was ALL worth the wait, This would have been an easy   5 star but the drink were kinda eghh, maybe it was what i ordered. (screwdriver, bloody mary, greyhound.)
