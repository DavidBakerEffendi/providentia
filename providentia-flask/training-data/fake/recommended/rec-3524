This is our favorite Brunch spot in the neighborhood. The staff is always extremely helpful and at tentative and the food never disappoints. Plus the prices are great. I highly recommend the Granola Crusted French toast. It's accompanied by these delicious saut√©ed peaches. The grits were also out of this world which is great because very few establishments know how to make a decent pot of grits. We try to go at least once a month as a treat to ourselves. I look forward to eventually trying their dinner.
