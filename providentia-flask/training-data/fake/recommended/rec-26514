Damn this place!  I so wanted to be able to criticize it.  There has to be something wrong, right?  I almost had them with a small issue with my wife's meal, but they swooped in and took care of it in a blink of the eye.  I would try to complain about the beer list, but that would just be silly.  Service?  Fast and friendly with just a dash of humor.  Attentive without being obsequious.  I've got it!  There are just too damned many good things on the menu.  It took me 15 minutes to make a decision. For shame!
