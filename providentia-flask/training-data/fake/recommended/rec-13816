it's more like 3.5 stars. cute little place, got there bright and early so there was no wait at all. tried: eggs benedict - ehh..i've had better.  I love eggs benedict and i always get it when i try new places.  should have stuck to their more famous dishes. southern breakfast - thought it was going to be a typical dish. boy was i wrong... fried green tomatoes in morning.... nice.  what's even better, sugar cured bacon!!! sugar + bacon = orgasmic in yo mouth!  i'm not really a bacon person, but yum it was freakin awesome.
