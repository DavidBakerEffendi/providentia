This is a Happy place! A little small but they are always friendly and accomodating. They have the basic Italian foods menu and the food is all good. Â The specialty slices they ave at lunch time are fantastic. My personal favorite is the Chicken Francaise, but I can tell you that the buffalo chicken, chicken parm and cheesesteak are all worth a try. Dine in or take out this is my favorite place because they are conistent.
