unfortunately i didnt eat enough to write a very comprehensive review, but what little i did experience of this restaurant was great.  my friend and i shared the fish tacos and some kind of spinach empanadas- both were very tasty.  the portions were pretty small- i realize theyre only appetizers but still!  but as the saying goes- quality over quantity...and these were definitely quality apps.  the real draw for me to this place tho is the cocktails.  i tried 3 different drinks- one was a pisco-something-or-other (i think it was called yerba mate); i tried my friends dark and stormy (delicious!) and some other kind of fruity drink.  i really wanted to try the desert rose which in theory sounded great, but im not a huge fan of gin so decided against it.  i would recommend going here on an empty stomach so you can sample a wide range of food and drink!
