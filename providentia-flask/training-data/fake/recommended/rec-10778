Romantic dinner with my hubby celebrating 14 years, let's start with the appetizer, there are several mouth watering appetizers but I have to stick with my all time favorite the arepas, they are crunchy with a bit of sweetness and topped with a homemade guac and white cheese, next time I think we need to order at least 2 of these appetizers instead of sharing, as an entree I had the surf and turf again and it was amazingly perfect!! The chef and whom ever prepared cooked the scallops perfectly seared on the outside and buttery on the inside, the mangu was good but the pork belly is my favorite in this dish, the dish does not need the salami.  The hubster had churasco and love that dish, only needs a couple more tostones and some garlic mojito on the side.   My ultimate favorite is the coconut mojito and the camelito drink, both drinks have a great amount of liquor, the coconut mojito taste like Puerto Rico in a cup, the camelito reminds me of berry bubilicious :). Our experience this time overall was great, I called ahead of time made a reservation with lance the manager and when we arrived we were seated in the outside patio and it was gorgeous.  I really look forward going back for brunch with the kiddies.
