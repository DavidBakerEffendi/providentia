I love Indian food and never had chaat before. It's like a street food dish with everything tossed in: crispy won-ton noodle things, radish, meats, tons of veggies, tons of different sauces. It attacks every taste bud. It was total comfort food, very reasonably priced and had a good portion size. The owner is SUPER nice. We told him it was our first time and he described all the ingredients and styles. Helped us choose our first chaats and spices. Also... the bottled water is free to everyone. And if we didn't like anything it was free on the house. I love his confidence and enthusiasm for his product. Food and service alone are worth checking this out. But I also loved the style of this cafe: I'm also a huge fan of places that do 1 or 2 things really well. Mood cafe only serves up Chaat dishes and lassi smoothies. But there's like 30 variations of each. I can't wait to go back and try something crazier in the chaat category.
