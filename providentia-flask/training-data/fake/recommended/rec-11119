Skip the corn bread!!!!!!!!!!!!!! As a southern girl, I cannot believe they actually sell corn bread like this. Â  Outside of the cornbread, I have only positive things to say about Beck's Cajun Cafe. The Etouffee is DELISH. Served with some rice, it totally hit the spot. We also tried the shrimp po boy which was pretty delicious as well. The po boy came with a nice spicy mayo type sauce that really pulled the entire po boy together. Definitely recommend folks to try this place, just skip the corn bread. Save your money and use it for some ice cream. :)
