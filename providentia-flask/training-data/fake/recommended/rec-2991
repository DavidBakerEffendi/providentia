If it is one place i miss it is def kelliann's bar. We used to live a few blocks from there and it was a great place to go have some drinks and take up the touch tunes. We used to shove $60 in it and play next haha. We will be sure to stop in and see all our fav bartenders soon. We will miss Pat and all the bartenders!
