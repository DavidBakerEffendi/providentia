heartttttttttssssssssssss tia pol is the SH*T! despite the long wait, the hostess was super gracious and agreed to take my cell number while we wandered around waiting for a table to be ready. When we came back, she remembered my name and told me a table was being cleared for us. Now on to the important stuff - food and drink. We ordered a pitcher of red sangria, which to our chagrin came in a rather TINY almost individually sized carafe. But DAMN did that thing last, and we can drink! I'm not sure if it was the ice melting or what, but it really packed a punch and we got 7 or 8 glasses out of it. Also, the waiter kept returning to repour it for us anytime we were almost empty. By far the best dish there is the squid in squid ink with rice. The scallops with chorizo in pureed melon are a close second. My boyfriend and I tried to recreate both dishes the following week, but after seeing how much scallops and squid ink cost (around $30 a jar! and they give you like HALF a jar in the dish) we realized we had really gotten a bargain at tia pol. They were also super generous with the bread so we sopped up ALL our deliciousssssss squid ink. Will definitely be going back there. Great deal for tapas and they excel at seafood. Although I didn't try them, their salads looked delish too!
