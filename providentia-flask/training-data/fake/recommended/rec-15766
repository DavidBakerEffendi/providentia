This is a typical Italian restaurant Little Italy. The place was absolutely packed but they were able to seat us for our 8 oclock reservation Â right away. The service was very helpful and attentive, especially because it was so busy. The food was pretty good, but not the best i've ever tasted. We loved it and will be back!
