The food was excellent but the location is in a "touristy" area, which is probably in their favor. I ordered the steak, that was amazing. It came with a generous sized caesar salad. My boyfriend ordered the pasta special that came with a side of fish (not a fan and can't seem to remember which) and vegetables. The caesar salad was like any other and vegetable side was offered with a nice variety and was perfectly cooked. There was a large wine selection,the bread was fresh, the staff was inviting, and the service was timely. Great prices for the over all experience.
