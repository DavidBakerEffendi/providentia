Going to go with 4.5 stars here!  Given that the health department made a surprise visit that night I no doubt believe that the place is as wonderful to eat at when the boyz in suits are back in their offices doing what they do best...but they are not about the food, too bad for them because Brooklyn Star is QUITE about the food!   I have to say in recent memory it was one of the best, most satisfying meals!  The dining room is decorated in a retro slash homey style with herbs in the windows and flowers all about.  Add that to the great staff and already the night was looking great! The cornbread is a good place to start...both on the menu and on this review....seems like a lot of places are bringin' it back and of a lot of the places I've experienced it (Red Rooster, Recette...) are not doing it so well...i'm from South Carolina and i've had a few pieces of corn bread... and Brooklyn Star's version is no BS...lol...its on the crumbly side with a nice corn flavor and heat heat heat.  Good job guys! As for the rest...we had the quail, chili and bone marrow.  The bird was excellently stuffed, a great size portion to share.  Cooked on the lovely side of medium and the accompaniment chorizo was purrfect.  The chili with tripe was equally good, maybe a stretch for some as trip has a texture not loved by all, but if you like tripe you'll LOVE the chili.  Finally the bone marrow...whats not to love...pure fat on bread...the life giver smeared on bread...if you dont love it you haven't lived. Great job guys...I'll be back for sure!
