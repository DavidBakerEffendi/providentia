Dropped by just before a line developed (at 2pm on a gorgeous Saturday).  Service was friendly and efficient.  If you are counting calories, then have someone else order for you because the calories appear on the menu and you would be horrified at the high numbers :-).  I ordered the original burger while hubby ordered the truffle burger (he was hungry so he ordered another burger, a special of the day called Korean BBQ short rib burger).  Four homemade condiments were offered - Unami ketchup, a spicy orange one, garlic aioli and a white one.   I liked the first 3.  For sides, we ordered sweet potato fries and thin fries.  We liked the classic and truffle burger.  The Korean short rib burger was interesting - an explosion of flavors with a kick.  Probably not order again if offered.  Will definitely go back to try other burgers.
