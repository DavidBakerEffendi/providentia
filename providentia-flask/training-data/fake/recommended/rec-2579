Everyone claims to have the best pizza in New York. This is true. And while I won't deny the likes of Grimaldi's and Lombardi's, not only is Roberta's incredible (Neapolitan) pizza cooked in a wood-fire oven (coal is unique but overrated in my book), but you don't have to wait in a HUGE line (Grimaldi's) surrounded by tourists (Lombardi's) or risk getting hit by a NYC taxi as you crowd onto the sidewalk (Lombardi's) but rather enjoy this: - Awesome German Beer Garden with steins (great deal btw, as you get the stein and all the craft German beer it can hold for a mere $15) should you have to wait, and long covered picnic tables at which to enjoy that beer. - ingredients grown on the roof and the back garden (spring, summer, fall) - a wood-fire oven outside that could work off the grid even if the big one hits (asteroid, Godzilla, earthquake, what-have-you) - ridiculous service - seats and tables galore for you and your friends - televisions (not in your face, but there to check how badly you are getting killed in fantasy football that Sunday) and did I mention the pizzas are ridiculous. maybe not to be ordered one for one, we have three gals and three guys and split 5 pizzas. in no particular order: Margherita, Beastmaster, BeeSting (aka the Kanye) and the Axl Rosenberg if you aren't afraid of garlic and/or your date eats it too.
