My birthday dinner at Marc Forgione was great!!  The restaurant was easy to find and we loved the rustic and romantic atmosphere. Service was also great, but it took longer than usual for our entrees to arrive. The bread and garlic butter to start was a nice touch as was the amuse-bouche.  I'm sure they serve something different every night, but ours was a chip and french-onion dip and then an apple and fennel purree.  Both were a good taste to begin our wonderful meal. We started with the barbecue oysters - AMAZING!  They were perfectly seasoned and the presentation was nice as well.  I would order these again for sure!! For entrees we had the pork tenderloin and the lamb chop.  The tenderloin was great and the potatoes and sauerkraut complimented it very well. I didn't care for the pig's ear schnitzel that was served as a side dish, however.  The lamb chops were fabulous!!  Cooked perfectly and very flavorful.  The black truffle mushrooms and sauce that came with the lamb chops made the dish even better.   Our waitress brought out a chocolate cake for my birthday, which was tastey, but not my favorite.  We weren't planning on dessert, but this was a nice touch.   I am a little embarrassed to admit it, but I asked if we could take a picture with the chef.  The waitress did not even hesitate, but took us right back to the kitchen where we got to meet the Iron Chef himself! What a great birthday night!!
