the crappiest thing about this place was sitting down, looking at the menu, and spending a good twenty minutes not being able to decide whether i wanted to order from the breakfast menu or the ethiopian menu. i eventually settled on some pancakes, which were really good, but i had total plate envy of my friend's vegetarian sampler. the staff is crazy nice, they play awesome ethiopian jazz on the stereo, and the coffee is super good and comes in properly large cups. yay for these guys.
