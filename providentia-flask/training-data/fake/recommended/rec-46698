We read some reviews and decided this was the place to grab a quick dinner on a lazy night. One said the General Tso's was particularly good and it is our favorite, so we were excited. When it got here, we were not impressed, though, especially for the price which we found to be at least $15 more than other places despite ordering the same thing we always do. The General Tso's was very dry and had barely any sauce on it at all which we were not happy with. Oh yeah, and they only gave one duck sauce packet. :/ The ordering itself though was pleasant and easy, we just wish the food was better!
