Is it worth the wait? Yes! Have I had better service at a Mc. D.s - sadly yes. Our waitress came by with a free dessert and promised to stop back by to take the order. We watched her checking her text messages around the corner for the next 15 minutes. When the host, an awesome guy with a great welcoming personality, stopped by with the check, we gave up on her. Outside of that, the food was excellent. We waited 30 minutes from past our reservation time to get seated, but the food more than made up for it. Plus, waiting is not the end of the world, it speaks to the authenticity and care they give their meals. It is a BYOB to boot so the bill was low given the quality of the food. The appetizers were delicious and I felt like my ravioli really loved me back! The mood in the cramped dining room was always festive and I cannot wait to get back. Just hope we can have a server who understands the importance of actually asking for my order.
