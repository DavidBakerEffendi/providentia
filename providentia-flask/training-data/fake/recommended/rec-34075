You'll feel like you're in the movie - Midnight in Paris. This is a lovely cute bistro in the middle of NYU/village madness. Went here for my birthday dinner recently with 3 other people, most of us are in the food/wine business. We started with their Kale Caesar salad - totally worked with the texture of the kale and had bit of anchovy which I love. We ordered mostly fish, all of it was super fresh and delicately flavored. I did not have their special burger, maybe next time!
