Beautiful shop. I could linger here for hours if I had the time. A variety of seating options to fit every mood. The coffee is excellent and HOT which is so important. The sandwiches and baked goods are wonderful. Love the bread selection. I would definitely take out of town guest to impress them. They would not be impressed with the ordering process, however. And on my first visit, I found it confusing exactly where to order. The queue moves very slowly. They need a better system. You have to wait in a long line behind people ordering food even if you want a simple cup of coffee or a refill. And whatever procedure the barrista Â is required to go through on the cash register seems to take a long time. Fix this and this place will be a coffee lover's heaven.
