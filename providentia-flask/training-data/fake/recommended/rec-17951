This place is amazing! I went here twice in one week because I had family and friends from out of town that wanted to check it out. The first time I went there was a line out the door but it moves quickly so do not let that be a deterrent. The second time my friend from the UK wanted to go and some guys outside munching away offered him a chip and he was sold so we all went in an ordered. My friend said "do they bathe these things in heroin?" LOL Folks this place is that good! Enjoy your artery clogging experience.
