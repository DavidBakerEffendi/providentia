I lived in New Haven for 6 months, and after finding this place, my friends either ate there or had take-out at least 2-3 times per week.  I never tried the hibachi, so this review is really for the sushi bar. They have a 50% off sushi menu, which makes ordering sushi everyday easy on the wallet!  The spicy tuna is wonderful, and the the peanut avocado roll was a surprisingly good combination which became a staple along with spicy tuna for take-out. The fish was typically fresh. A couple of times I got some not so fresh eel, so I stopped ordering that and I got to loving Kumo's.  As consistently good for the price as Kumo's was, it is one the New Haven places I find myself missing now that I am in Florida. If I ever make it back to New Haven, I will come here and go to  Sallys!
