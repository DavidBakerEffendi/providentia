Starr knows how to make good look restaurants. The food: Brunch is best here...getting it "family style" and sharing is helpful cuz a lot of the plates served are "fancy portioned" (small) i like the pancakes, lobster mac...and a bunch of other stuff I don't remember. The price is reasonable for the style of the place.... The style of the place is lovely. That's why I come, not because the food is awesome and super tasty..the food is pretty good, but it's the decor. I love the swingy chairs, all the stuff to look at when conversation gets boring, the bathrooms that are awkward, weird, creepy and unconventionally cool. This would be an awesome place to throw a party (or reception). So in summary: brunch + breakfast + swingy chairs + stuff to look at = very good. (The service is decent, and the wait usually is not that long...)
