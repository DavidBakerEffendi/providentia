yo! 4 dumplings for 1 dollar! 3 pan fried pork buns for ONE DOLLAR. unheard of. insane. you can walk out of there with a very generous lunch for $2-5. gotta love it. try the pork fried buns (sheng jian bao), get the scallion pancakes, and get a small wonton soup. you will be full in no time, for a mere $4. thank me later! take it to go obviously. eat it outside. feel like a true new yorker.
