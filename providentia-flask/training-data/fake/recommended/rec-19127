Great little pub. It's hidden, doesn't get too crowded, it's cozy and dark but not pitch black. Good music and friendly wait staff. This is, however, only based on my experiences on the weekdays. Not sure what the deal is on the weekends, but I love coming here on a Weds or Thurs evening. God, I sound like such a boozebag.
