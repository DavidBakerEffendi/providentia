If we had only had the square it would have been a 5 star rating. The soho square pizza we had last night was great, saucey and chewy flavorful crust. But a pizza place has to be at least partially judged on it regular slice, and that was just average or even below depending on your average. The cheese was a molten glop on top of a floppy mushy wet base. My husband who usually skips the crust (I do not approve) actually used it to scoop up some cheese and left the rest in a pile with the floppy under crust which had come loose and laid limply on the pile. I actually think that maybe they should only offer the Sicilian style pizza as some places in Italy seem to specialize in just one type and that seems to be working out for that country. There was also a picture of James Gandolfini at a pizza place that was clearly not Prince Street Pizza which was confusing, but probably has a good explanation. We will stop in again and get the SQUARE and review it by itself.
