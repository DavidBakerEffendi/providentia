Yum! I love a good burger and Umami Burger definitely satisfied my craving. This place has been on my list to go to for the longest time and I finally found the opportunity to come here. I ordered a medium rare Truffle Burger and it was cooked to perfection! The truffle cheese fondue sauce really made the burger. On the other hand, I wasn't crazy about their side dishes though. I'm a huge fan of sweet potato fries and truffle fries but these were not the best I had. Both were overcooked and overly crispy. Â However, they were unique in their own way. They sprinkled brown sugar all over the sweet potato fries and the truffle cheese fondue was again delicious on the thin fries. Oh, and they are very strict on substitutions on ingredients within the burger.
