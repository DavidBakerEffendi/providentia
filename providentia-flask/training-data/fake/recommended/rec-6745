I love DiNic's. I just love em. I took my one brother here months ago because he is a big Man v Food fan, he still talks up how good that sandwich is EVERYTIME i talk to him. The pork, broccoli rabbe, and aged provolone are a perfect combination. Everytime I go, it never disappoints. I keep half exepecting to get angry one day and feel ripped off- but it never happens. The products here are always good. One tourist sat next to me eating a DiNic's sandwich and proceeded to take it apart and re-arrange it. I wanted to yell at them, "Stop abusing that sandwich! There is not a thing wrong with that sandwich- there is something wrong with you!" I have tried this same sandwich (roast pork, broccoli rabbe, provolone) at John's Roast Pork, DiBruno Brother's, Shank's and Tony Luke's. I can say honestly after trying each place a few times DiNic's is always the best. One piece of advice, the hot peppers are pretty hot and they can overwhelm some of the other flavors in the sandwich.
