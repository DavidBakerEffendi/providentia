After trying four other pizza joints in search of the quintessential slice of NY pizza (L&B Spumoni Gardens in Brooklyn and three other places in Manhattan), I finally found what I was looking for at Grimaldi's. I live in Boston and came to NYC last weekend with my wife and two of our friends from Denver, CO.  We were all a little hesitant to try Grimaldi's given some of the negative reviews about it being a tourist trap.   After being underwhelmed by L&Bs earlier in the day, we all decided to venture out of our hotel one last time to try to find a good slice of pie.  We arrived at Grimaldi's at 11:30PM having called our take-out order in fifteen minutes earlier.  Although the place was packed when we arrived, there were no lines and we only had a short wait for our pizza.     Let me just say that this place is no tourist trap.  Without exception, Grimaldi's has the best pizza I've ever had!  My friends all felt the same way.  We had our large pepperoni pizza devoured before we got back to our hotel room which was only fifteen minutes away.  I will travel back to NYC from Boston for the sole purpose of indulging in Grimaldi's pizza again.
