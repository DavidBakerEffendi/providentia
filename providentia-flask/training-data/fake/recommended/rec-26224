Friends decided on this place as a quick bite before a movie. This place is pretty cramped/tight in space. The food is pretty good for the price. You also get a 15% off if you checked in for the first time on Yelp. I ordered the lamb and chicken combo platter. They gave a healthy portion (especially rice). I think the lamb was a bit dry and lacking in flavor for me. The bread that came with the combo platter is really good when it's warm. I think this is the same bread they use to make their gyro sandwiches. The only gripe I have with the restaurant is probably the spicy sauce. I had to drench/use excessive amount of "spicy" sauce. I was kind of expecting it to be spicy, but it wasn't. I really liked the minty yogurt-ish sauce. The food left my stomach feeling weird all night. It might've been my fault since it was rainy and I might've ate too fast cause of hunger (Sitting through a 3 hour movie afterwards did not help either). I think if you're short on time and need to grab a quick bite before attending some event near Time Square, you should check this place out.
