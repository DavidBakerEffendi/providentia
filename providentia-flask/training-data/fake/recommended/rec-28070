The hype is for real! I came here with a few friends on a Wednesday night immediately realizing that it's BYOB we sent someone from our group to go across the street to get some tall boys. We ordered the cap'n crunch chicken fingers, chicken empanadas, and disco tots. Cap'n crunch chicken fingers were excellent but the dip was amazing sweet and spicy.The sugar hill burger is hands down the best and most unique burger I ever had. It is sweet but not overpowering pecan bacon is awesome and the blue cheese adds a nice compliment to it. I could go on and on about this place but you really need to go try it for yourself.
