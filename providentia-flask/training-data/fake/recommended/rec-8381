The food is clearly made with a great deal of care and attention. Every time I order from them, they are sweet and friendly. I am so happy to support this lovely family business. The breads, particularly, are awesome. I have developed a serious poori addiction. And the chicken korma is the best I've ever had anywhere. It's surprising to find the best Indian food I've had in NYC in Flatbush, but there you have it.
