What a great restaurant! I must say that the peppers and onions are particularly terrific, as are the gnocchi. I was very happy with my eggplant parmesan. This is an old school Italian American restaurant which will contain all of the classic Italian American specialties. I would not call this authentic Italy-Italian, but if you want the great Italian-American food (much of it with the red sauce), this is the place to go to. I should add that the service too was terrific. This place is an institution in Philly, for a reason. When you go to this restaurant, you get to take part in history. I should say that the marinara is near transcendant. This is also a great place for a date and to take the family. However, I would not recommend that you take small children here.
