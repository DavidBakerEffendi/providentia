Perfect place for brunch after a morning ride Â on the river! The atmosphere and service are great. And the food was delicious. The whipped ricotta is a must; everyone in our party loved it. The salads were fresh and yummy. We had the burrata with kale and the potato caesar, both very good. The pizzas were also quite good. The breakfast pizza was a little too sweet for my taste. All around great experience though. I'll be back for a 5 star meal next time.
