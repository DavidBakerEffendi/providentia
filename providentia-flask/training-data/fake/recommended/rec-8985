Blue Ribbon fits everything that's great about NYC dining to me...hours: 4pm-4am 365 days a year...laid back ambiance with great food served at reasonable prices.. It's probably been a year since I ate here but have been 5+ times which is a ton for a restaurant that isn't in my neighborhood...still remember the first time I was there...BRB has had dishes on their menu for years before they became hip in NYC: bone marrow, fried chicken with syrup and sweetbreads among others..one thing that sticks out about this place is everytime they tell you the specials they tell the price too so there is nothing deceiving the customer (prices are more than reasonable in $18-25 range for mains). Good wine list for all price ranges...take rez for 5+ which is way to go if you have a group
