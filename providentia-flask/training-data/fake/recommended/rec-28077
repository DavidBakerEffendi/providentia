Meh. Came for a late lunch the other day with a friend. Because of the holiday, they were serving brunch all day. Started with a cappuccino, which was solid. Ordered the porchetta panino which was very underwhelming with small bits of pork, random globs of mustard, and forgettable caramelized onions. The side of arugula salad was atrocious--it tasted as if the entire salad was washed in a saline solution. Otherwise, the place has a nice ambiance and pleasant waitstaff. TL;DR - worth your time if you're just getting coffee; food is sub-par at best.
