3.5 stars. This is basically just expensive junk food. Kind of like doritos in steak form. It's good, I enjoyed it. But this isn't exactly a food destination in terms of quality or pricing. In my measure Geno's willingness to go the extra inch toward junky-ness put it a notch above Pat's, which was equally as junk-foody but with pretension to being better quality.
