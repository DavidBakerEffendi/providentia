This place has a little bit of everything.  I did a little research before a weekend in Philadelphia and decided on this place for its drink menu and small plate menu.  One thing, no reservations allowed and this place does fill up...fast. We went on a Friday night and when we got there around 7pm we had to wait for about 20 minutes, grabbed a drink at the bar (30 bucks for 3 cocktails!!).  The inside of this place is great.  A total retro throwback and the cocktails went right along with it. Once seated, the staff was very helpful and friendly.  They suggested we pick 4 or so plates for 3 people, they would figure out which should come first and bring another out when we were finished.  Our server definitely encouraged a slow relaxed meal. We started with the shoestring fries and cheese steak egg roll.  The fries were good came with a chinese style hot mustard.  The only thing I did not enjoy was how thin they were, kinda hard to eat and not make a mess.  The cheese steak egg roll was really good.  It is just as you would imagine it. It even came with a hot cherry pepper and siracha ketchup.  Our other two plates were also very good, an open faced shrimp quesadilla and thai chicken lettuce wraps (our server even asked if we wanted more lettuce).  Dessert is definitely not there strong suit.  We chose two ice creams, one caramel popcorn and I cant remember the other one.  The only thing I remembered is that I didn't taste caramel popcorn in the first one. Overall, the Continental is fun place to go.  The food is very good, I like the small plate style restaurant and service is also very good.  The drink menu goes on for ages, ranging from classic cocktails to new different ones.
