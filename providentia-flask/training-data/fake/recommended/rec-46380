Yummy! I'm in a bit of a feather and often find myself under the weather. Oh boy, I have been watching to much Downton Abbey. My wife just got me to go to lunch at this place and thank you god. I am going back. Had the lamb sliders and they were unbelievable. I can't wait to go back. We had to eat upstairs which was fine. To make it even better the service was attentive and gracious. Do Â treat yourself you will be returning.
