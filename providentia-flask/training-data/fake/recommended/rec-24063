Best Best Best Best drunk munchies everr :) I stayed across the street at the Sheraton, and it was so exciting to find out Chicken and Rice was only on the corner! We got it that night, and the morning after. Its delicious. and be sure to ask for extra crack sauce... well just extra white sauce. It makes me want to go back right now, we dont have anything this delish in philly. Chicken and lamb all the way :)
