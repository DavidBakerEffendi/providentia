Maybe it was the hype. Maybe it was the frustration of having to wait an hour for a burger. Maybe it was the 16 dollar price tag for a burger. Umami burger was nothing to write home about. Don't get me wrong. Taste-wise there was absolutely nothing wrong with the burger. FYI my friends and I shared the truffle burger and the duck burger with the truffle fries. The seasoning was well done to near perfection and the burger patty was cooked to medium rare as requested. What lacked was texture - the buns and the patties just sort of mash into a lump of Umami'ed out slush in your mouth that was obviously neither repugnant nor distasteful, but boring. Truffle fries were good. Ketchup is also Umami'ed out with mucho MSG. Next up: Umami beer?
