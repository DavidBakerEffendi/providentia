My personal favorite Philly cheesesteak joint. The beef they use really tastes like thinly sliced steak, and the sandwiches are juicy and flavorful which is far from the case in many other more famous steak joints in the city. The place itself is a dump but seems clean enough. The woman who took my orders was friendly and efficient. Highly recommended.
