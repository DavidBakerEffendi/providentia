I went here last night for dinner with a friend....I've heard of this place before and have always wanted to try it and happy I did.  The décor of the place was beautiful and felt very serene inside.  In the front of the restaurant, there is a huge "U" shape like sushi bar style seating which is where we should have sat but decided to go to the back for a more quiet atmosphere. When I looked at the menu, I didn't know what to expect but with the help of our waitress we took some of her recommendations along with what other reviewers had mentioned.  A must try at this place even though you may not like it is the grilled sea urchin - it was absolutely delicious!  I was never a big fan of sea urchin but this definitely made me sway the other way.  We also ordered another appetizer which was a potato taro wrapped in nori seaweed - it was ok.   For our main, my friend and I shared the croaker fish (all their fishes come from Japan) which came whole (head, bones and all....) that was grilled with a light coating of salt on the skin.  We both enjoyed it very much....the other dish we had was the Kamameshi which is what they are known for - it's a steamed rice dish with toppings of your choice.  We had one with mushrooms and another with oysters - it was presented in this very neat bowl with a wood topper.  As long as the top was closed, it kept the rice warm. Overall, it was a very nice experience and food was simple yet tasty.
