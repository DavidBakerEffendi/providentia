One would think with the crowd that Spice II has in their establishment that their food would be amazing. That's far from the truth. We placed our order for pick up 6:25. All we ordered was Pad Thai, dumplings, And Basil Thai Rice. Simple. They tell us that its going to be a 40 minute wait for it. Ummm ok? We had a few stops to make so we decided to do that first. We get to the restaurant, they tell us its another 20 minute wait! For Pad Thai and rice?!!! Seriously?? Ok. We wait and wait and finally get our food. The Pad Thai noodles were stuck together like they didn't stir them while they were cooking, the vegetables in the Rice were uncooked and chalky and the dumplings had a very awkward texture. The total cost of all this was $30. $30 for this horrid food? Never EVER again.
