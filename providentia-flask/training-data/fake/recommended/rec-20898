Formal and upscale dining experience with all of the luxuries that can be expected from that sort of establishment. The decor is a little too ostentatious, think 19th century France. The floor to ceiling shrine of red apples was my favorite element of decor. The staff are very knowledgeable and meals are impeccably executed. The noise level is very mild compared to the average thundering sound typical of popular restaurants. Each composition contained complimentary flavors and ingredients that sent reverberation through every taste bud. Bouley is perfect for a formal business gathering, anniversary, dinner with parents and a very romantic date leading into a proposal; or just an extraordinary gastronomic journey.
