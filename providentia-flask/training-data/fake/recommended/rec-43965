FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY! Probably the best BBQ I've EVER had ever. I got this BBQ basket thing came w 2 diff kinds of ribs both smoked to perfection fall off the bone delicious homemade BBQ sauce ahhhh amazing! Then the brisket again DELISH! Annnnd now the pulled pork! Just when u think it couldn't get any better! IT JUST DID! The ppl working were super sweet the atmosphere was casual and the food was spectacular! I'm kinda glad I don't live closer bc I'd be a big ol fat ass! My only negative comment is for the potato salad :/ very bland no flavor but everything else was so damn good I could have cared less! I WILL BE BACK AGAIN...and again...and again..and ok ok u get the picture! Oh oh almost forgot...peanut butter and jelly milkshake....nuff said!
