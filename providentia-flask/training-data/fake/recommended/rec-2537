It's a three star night from me to Uzu.  It was ok sushi.  yes, the fish and rice were fresh (the rolls were a bit small though) and the miso was standard.  it was more the service that dimmed out the celestials for me. though I'll keep looking for better sushi in town too. I'm not picky when it comes to service, have waited tables before and know it's a pain.  and I'll take into account that maybe a waitress was sick.  But if the main guy who looked like he owned the place always waits on tables....he should look into hiring a waiter. He was very hurried to get me done.  stood there while i decided, didn't bring water out even though he filled up other tables water and checked on them!?  I gave up trying to ask since he never made contact again and eventually just pulled out my bottle i tote everywhere (maybe he knew i was this smart) He cleared the plate quick and said ok check (statement not a question).  Which kind of sucked cause i was going to inquire about inari tofu skin for dessert.  oh well. only four tables so not overwhelming.  maybe he had to rush inside to answer the phone. eh, whatev. I'll give em another shot sometime in the future. but I'm  adhering to 3 stars like sticky rice on chopsticks for now.
