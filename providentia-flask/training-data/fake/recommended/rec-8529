Myself and two friends visited this restaurant to try something new. Unfortunately, the food was super bland and the staff was quite rude! One of my friends had never had Venezuelan food before, so he asked the waiter if we could have some chips or appetizer for the table- the waiter rudely told us "We don't have chips, we're further south than Mexico." Wow, there's a nice way to explain, and there's that way. Also, maybe he should have suggested an appetizer from their menu, instead, he lost the business and we didn't order anything. I ordered the Tofu Pepidia for a main dish and it was SO bland. I know what you're thinking - isn't tofu always bland? But it's far from the truth. If you season tofu with ANYTHING, it picks up the flavor really well. This dish was not seasoned at all - tasted like white bread. We ordered churros and coffee for dessert. I know this isn't a cafe, but the coffee tasted like it was from a diner, and the churros were nothing memorable. I won't be back.
