Fresh and nuanced Korean flavors done perfectly in a modern, beautiful, and extravagant style. The tasting menu was a fantastic presentation on flavors. The Royal Bim Bim Bap was truly luxurious with a pile of fresh summer truffle on top. Every dish was impeccably prepared. Service was very attentive and well paced.  Wine pairing was perfectly curated.  The highlight was a peppery Chateauneuf-du-pape paired with rare squab in a Korean pepper sauce.  Dessert was fun and flavorful. The meal finished with a garden topped stack of dishes filled with sweet treats. All in all a wonderful experience that left us all with a new appreciation for Korean cuisine. Well deserving of their second Michelin star.  Will return.
