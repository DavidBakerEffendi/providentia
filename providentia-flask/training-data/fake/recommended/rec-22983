Great sushi.  San Sai manages to get great tasting fresh fish.  Although the staff is friendly, they could be a little more educated on the menu items.  It's a place you should plan on spending a decent amount of time for at dinner.  It's not fast paced, and it's worth savoring it. Their rolls are tastefully constructed and their japanese curries are also wonderful (pretty large portions too for the curry).  They have some wonderful appetizers as well.  I usually order an appetizer or two, the Chirashi and a roll to go with it.  Pricy yes, but this is the finest japanese food around. They serve some saki's in a wooden box, traditional style, or in a heated clay pot. I believe they have a japanese beer on tap too. Good for lunch if you feel like splurging a bit.
