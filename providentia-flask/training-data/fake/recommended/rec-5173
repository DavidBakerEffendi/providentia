Ok, I'm all for rules but sometime s they just make no sense. I've had the mac an cheese to go and really liked it. This time I wanted to sit and eat. Well you can only get one kind of the many types of Mac if you want to eat at the restaurant and you can't get it to go and sit and order drinks or other food. They had Â only 3 or 4 of the 15 to 20 tables occupied and turned away customers who would spend additional money on drinks etc.. Sorry I just don't understand. Have you never seen one of the restaurant/bar rescue shows?
