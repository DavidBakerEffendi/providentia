Melograno is a nice BYOB tucked away near Fitler Square. They specialize in Tuscan cuisine and have a nice array or classic Italian options on their menu. The decor is nice and warm making you feel welcome inthe small space. Pasta is homemade and outstanding, they do a good job of cooking it to the right texture. In addition to the nice selection of pastas they have several salads to choose from and both fish and meat dishes. The seafood in particular was excellent, very fresh, and mixed with nice herbs and sauces. The waiter swore by the tiramisu but we went with the chocolate cake and apple tart which was really more like a cake. Both were good and capped off a very good dinner.
