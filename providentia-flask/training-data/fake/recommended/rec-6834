First of all, I have always seen this space as a missed opportunity, so I'm very excited that Prospect has settled in. We had a really wonderful time here last night.  I was surprised that we had no wait to get in at just before 9 on a Sunday in Fort Greene.  We got the only remaining table though, which is always a perfect moment. Our server was knowledgable and friendly and gorgeous.  He very patiently helped me find a great wine and chatted with us about oysters and planned the courses well. I got a nice Manazanique and my dining companion had an old-fashioned which he felt was superb.   We started with oysters.  They had 4 options: 2 West Coast and 2 East Coast.  The East Coasts were Wellfleets--standard but fresh, briny, and delicious.   We absolutely loved the snow crab "salad"--don't leave here without ordering it.  It is unique and I'm still thinking about it the next day. We also shared shisito peppers (love!) and the suckling pig, which was cooked to perfection.  The description of that dish on the menu had me a bit wary, but it was wonderful. It's a great restaurant and a wonderful alternative to Walter's, when that place is beyond packed.
