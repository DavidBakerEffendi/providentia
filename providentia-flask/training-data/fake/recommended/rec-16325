Came here for dinner with a group of 8. We were seated promptly and got plenty of time to look at the menu and order. All of us got pasta and salads to share. Complimentary bread and butter was a hit--we were all starving. The pizza bread is delicious! I ordered the montebianco salad and capellini di pomodoro with linguine pasta instead after hearing the great reviews.   Food took very long to come out. We were only one of 5 or 6 tables, and our food took over 45 minutes to be prepared. It was fine because the pasta was made to order and fresh. Portions are very generous and can be split between two which is what I wish I had done. I love Italian, and homemade pasta is very important to me. You've never had good Italian food if you've never had fresh carbs! The linguine was as amazing as I hoped for. You can taste the sauce and know it's homemade. I sampled the linguine rustica and fettuccine giovanni as well and they were both delicious. Though I'm pretty sure the fettuccine was the same as the linguine, they are the same size pasta! (Fettuccine is supposed to be a much broader cut.) Great service too. Our waiter was attentive and very helpful. Our water glasses were never empty. We asked to split two pastas between four people and he had them separated into different plates. We did not feel rushed at all after a big filling meal, even when the restaurant was getting busy and filling up for dinner. Prices are a tad on the higher side, but for Little Italy, this  is the most authentic Italian as you can get. Will definitely be back!
