Love this place!  The chef / owner Mike put together some genius seafood combinations that blew my friends and I away.  It is a bit small and there are no "non-seafood" choices, but it is called "Little Fish" so you should expect that going in.  The staff is awesome and really friendly.  My favorite seafood place in the city!
