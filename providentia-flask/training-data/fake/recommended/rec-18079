Diamond in the rough. That's all that can be said about this chaat-catering, strangely delicious, unbelievably friendly environment. For the sake of full disclosure, my taste buds were certainly adjusting to chaat as I was at Mood. It's a strange sensation: the mixing of the hot veggies and meat, the cold yogurt, the crispy wonton shells - all of it crunched up in a bowl. Hasan, the owner and one of the friendliest faces in all of Philadelphia, explained every step of how he prepares and serves the food. Then, for dessert, he prepared a carrot and cream cheese dish, with hot, stewed carrots (naturally sweet) and homemade cheese. It was somehow similar to a pumpkin or sweet potato pastry. Like other reviewers's experience, I too was blown away by both Hasan's kindness and his restaurant. He remembers faces well, and will prepare you a different kind of dish every time you visit. He promised a different, hot rice and beans dish next time I came. He also assured my girlfriend and I that we would not have to pay if we didn't like the food. However, we loved the chaat and the dessert, and were more than happy to pay every cent (though he didn't charge us for the dessert). Can't wait to go back!
