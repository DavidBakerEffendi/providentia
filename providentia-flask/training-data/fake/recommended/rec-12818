This was a definite experience.  The smokey smell of bacon greeted me upon arrival. Yum! I got there on a Friday and was told that the wait was 90 minutes, which was kind of expected.  Even the bar area was crowded.  Luckily the rest of my party had arrived in the next 10 minutes and the hostess was able to squeeze us in.  Lucky us. :)  Kudos to her as that is great customer service! For starters we got the bacon tasting and Brussels sprouts.  Honestly, the bacon tasting was just 'okay', but it was nice to try all of the different varieties of bacon.  For the price, I would have expected nice thick slabs of bacon, but these were thin like you would find at a common diner; there were 2 slices each of 4 varieties. The Brussels sprouts on the other hand.  WOW!  These fresh sprouts were mixed in some sort of light tasty yogurt sauce with cubed bacon.  This was definitely one of the highlights! For the entree, I got the bacon Reuben.  This was actually not a sandwich, but two halves of an open-faced sandwich.  Again, nothing really special about it, but it was tasty and filling. My friend got the Barbacon Banh Mi, which was quite tasty and very unique tasting.  Imagine a regular Vietnamese sandwich... on steroids. My wife got the Lobster Mac n' Cheese.  This was definitely something to write home about.  Even though they put the lobster meat on top, it was almost like the pasta was cooked in lobster water and absorbed the taste.  (This is a good thing). For dessert we all split a brownie and a bread pudding.  These were okay, but a nice touch for the end of the meal. The waitress Lindsey was a hoot!  Being very knowledgeable about all of the selections, giving us a laugh, and quick service, I had to give her a shout out!! Pros - Good service, bacon, more bacon Cons - Crowded, more for experience Suggestions - Despite the drink selection was great, they should have a choice of a smoky or bacon beer with the meals which would pair nicely.
