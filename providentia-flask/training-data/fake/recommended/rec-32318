Soooo good!  I am a huge fan of the brisket with roasted peppers and sharp provolone or the pulled pork with rabe and sharp provolone.  I know everyone raves about the roasted pork, but having tried both on multiple occasions, I still prefer the pulled pork...or the brisket as I mentioned, yummy yummy brisket!
