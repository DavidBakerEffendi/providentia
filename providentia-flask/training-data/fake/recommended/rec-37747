This was one of the best Mexican restaurants I have ever been to!!! All the food was amazing, the service was excellent, and the atmosphere was fantastic. The food was reasonably priced, the portions were good, and everything was fresh and delicious. The drinks were also very good and pretty authentic. Also the music was really good and the atmosphere was unique and chic. This is definitely a great place to go for dinner and/or drinks!
