I love joya and I still plan on going back but last time I went I when they were opening so it was pretty empty and the food was below their usual. I order the vegetable spring rolls which were great as always since hard to mess up. I divided to also get a large calamari for the table. The calamari at Joya is always tasty and never to salty. This time the calamari was soo chewy and hard like they were using stale oil. They took it back and gave us our entrees which was a little greasy and my rice was stale. I ordered the saut√©ed shrimp with the vegetable medley and the garlic sauce (for anyone who wanted to know). The waitress gave us their usually tasty mussels but when we had it, tasted like it needed to be washed. And it had the butt taste you get with dirty seafood. We left dissatisfied with the overall meal, but I always like the fact with all the problems the bill wasn't crazy.
