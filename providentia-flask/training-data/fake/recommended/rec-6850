This lovely restaurant is perfection. Had dinner here recently and was so satisfied. The space, food, service and even the bathroom are all top notch. Clean, pretty well lit and cozy. The food is super delicious. Get everything on the menu it's all amazing. The noodles, oysters, and tartar were my fave. They have a nice huge back area, really pretty it makes you want to stay forever. I highly highly recommend checking this place out, the waiters are really knowledgable and passionate about the food and wine there which I always appreciate because that's necessary so big cherry on top with that. Thanx Pines! Don't change a thing. I'll be back for sure, many times :)))
