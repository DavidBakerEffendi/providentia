It's such a sad sad sad thing, but Green Eggs has really gone downhill recently. On the weekends we usually order takeout, because we have a toddler and the wait just isn't reasonable for us. We usually do this at least every other weekend. The last three times the food has been just terrible. Lox in the bagel in lox platter was spoiled, which ruins the whole thing. Mac and cheese side tasted overwhelmingly of mold. The pork belly cuban sandwich had burned, overcooked pieces of pork belly and raw, extremely fatty pieces of what I assume was the cured ham, which made me feel sick for entire day after eating a few bites of it. Seriously disappointing, expensive, and a total hassle to return something from takeout. Used to love this place and recommend it to everyone, but some attention needs to be paid to the degrading quality of the food.
