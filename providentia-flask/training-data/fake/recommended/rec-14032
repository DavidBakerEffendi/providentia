I came for the blueberry pancakes with maple butter syrup and was pleasantly surprised that everything else was just as delicious.  The blueberry pancakes are very sweet, but if you think of them as a dessert, they are perfect.  Also super yummy was the cheese grits.  I am definitely going back. And oh, the wait isn't so bad if you have a friend get there on time, get a table and then you arrive 15 minutes late.  Thanks friend.
