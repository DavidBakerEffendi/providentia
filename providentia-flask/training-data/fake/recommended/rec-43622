My fav dish is prob the pork bun, tasty and just right amount of meat, sauce and the bun, perfect! but it's famous for the ramen, after trying the classic I just thought it's average, nothing really stands out and the flavor is forgettable, Santouka definitely have better broth and ramen if you are comparing these two.
