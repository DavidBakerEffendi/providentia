Holy mother of fucking god. This is my favorite Thai restaurant of all time. PLEASE NOTE: Whenever you order a dish, you have to tell the waitresses how mild/medium/hot you want it!!!! How are they supposed to read your minds and know what kind of spice level you enjoy?! My Indian boyfriend and I always get the drunken noodles. When ordering, I always make sure I say that I want it extremely spicy. Like "MY-BOYFRIEND-IS-BROWN-AND-CAN-HANDLE-REALLY-­SPICY-FOOD" spicy. As in "PLEASE-MAKE-IT-SO-SPICY-THAT-HE-DIES-FROM-HOW-­SPICY-IT-IS" spicy. This was the only time I saw my boyfriend cry.
