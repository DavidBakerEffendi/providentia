I've only gone here once for brunch, because there are very few places I'd wait that long for when I'm starving in the morning. But everything else about Penelope makes this the perfect place for a relaxed dinner: The cute, country/retro decor (I especially love the decoupage tables with the scary 1950s recipes), a delicious veggie burger, creative veggie burger salad when I'm looking for something healthy, and some of the best mac 'n' cheese in the city (has to be the fontina). The only drawback, besides the occasional crowds, is that the wine they serve is not my favorite, but I'm not really a French wine kind of person. Oh, and it's cash only.
