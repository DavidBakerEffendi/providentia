The Halal Guys is the best meal you can get in NYC for $6. The plates are huge, enough for two. They're super popular, but the wait isn't ever too long. I recommend you "mix" it up - both the lamb and chicken are amazing! The hot sauce goes great with the white sauce, but only a tiny touch of it is needed. I say pour a dime sized amount of hot sauce at the edge of your plate for the whole meal. Without any hot sauce, I find the dish to be a little heavy. If you take your plate to stay and eat on the ledges at the side, you can get unlimited sauce from their cart!!
