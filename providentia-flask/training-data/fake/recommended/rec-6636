This is truly a neighborhood gem. I'd been meaning to try it for a long time, and finally got my chance. The staff are friendly and make you feel so comfortable and welcome. Great service and great food are my kinda thing! I started with a glass of malbec, and ordered the barracuda, which is a seasonal dish. It was pan-seared and served over yuca, corn and palm nuts (which is where palm oil comes from), in a ginger-flavored broth, which added a level of brighness to the dish. I'd never tried palm nuts before - they are firm, with a texture similar to chestnuts, but the taste was unique, not as sweet as chestnuts, with a little something else I can't describe. The whole dish really worked well. I sat up at the counter, so I was able to watch the chefs at work. I can't wait to go back and try the other tasty dishes I saw coming out of the kitchen. And I will DEFINITELY be back!
