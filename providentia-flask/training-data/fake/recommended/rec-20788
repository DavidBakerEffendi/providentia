This place offers authentic Italian food for a great price. The owner/chef is super nice. My party went in on a Saturday around noon-ish. The menu did not offer an exorbitant amount of options, it was plenty for me. We were specially prepared a tomato, onion & basil salad. For my entrée, I had penne pasta with a light oil sauce and fresh mozzarella. The pasta was cooked just perfect, ''al dente.''  One person had a vegetable based soup and the other had another pasta dish. All were delicious and the bill came to about $50. All in all, I'm definitely going back again and again!
