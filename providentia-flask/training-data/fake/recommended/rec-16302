So when I went  there I noticed the "cash only" sign, I was quite disappointed but the servers informed me that they will have they're Computer system running within the next week, so I let it slide. I couldn't even tell the place just opened, their were so many people and the ambiance was very perfectly rustic and cozy. We had polenta with mushrooms and goganzola cheese, it was so amazing, then the pasta with lamb meat was so tender and the pasta seemed super fresh. The servers were very personable and welcoming,they spoke to us like we were friends from way back in italy!!! It wasnt until later we found out they were the owners running everything themselves.  The food was good,the owners were cool, I hated the cash only thing but Besides that I would definitely return with more friends!!!
