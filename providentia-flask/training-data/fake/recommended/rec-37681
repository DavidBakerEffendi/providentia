I've heard A LOT about this restaurant and expected a lot. Unfortunately it didn't live up to the expectation. I had the sunny side eggs, a very plain dish. I mean, it was fine, but nothing I couldn't make myself at home with very little effort. My friend's shakshuka was, well, embarrassing. one egg, in a very watery sauce. I expected much more from an *israeli* chef. yikes on top of that there was only one waiter on a pretty full house. not well planned. On the bright side -- the chef was SUPER nice and treated us with a free white chocolate Â mousse dessert . Also we did show up at 4pm so probably all of the mishap was due to the weird hour. I will definately come back and give them another shot.
