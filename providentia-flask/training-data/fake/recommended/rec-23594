I really wanted to like this place. After enjoying a great cup of coffee from their kiosk on Church Street, it seemed like a slam dunk. They had to really try to get a mediocre review, and they did. The servers utilize a team system but it seems they don't speak with each other. Whether it's assuming drinks ordered have been delivered, or that one ordering sparkling water means water glasses for all should no longer be refreshed, they consistently missed a beat. Of course, food is really the center of the review. I ordered fish which came with octopus which was inedible. Three large pieces, two warm and one ice cold, all shared the attribute of being inedible. A toughness which Smokin Joe Frazier would appreciate was consistent with all. When the server asked how the meal was, I shared that the fish was fine but the octopus was terrible. Her reply was that she appreciated the feedback, but could not share it with the chef as he was getting to the busy time of the evening. Imagine the culture of a restaurant where servers are 'afraid' to share feedback with the chef and allow really bad, premium priced food to be served? Or letting a customer leave with such a bad taste in his mouth? A lost opportunity for all.
