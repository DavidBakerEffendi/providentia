On my last visit to NY I made my friend drive me to Joe's Shanghai to try their soup dumplings.  I was not disappointed.  In my 3 day mini vacay, I ate @ Joe's twice! Their soup dumplings are DELICIOUS! I tried some of their other dishes but nothing stands out like those juicy, delicious dumplings.
