Lots of reviews for this place already so I will make mine short and to the point. There was a wait.  I ordered the penny egg sandwich, my friend got the french toast.  Penny egg sandwich was good but I was more impressed by the french toast.  The edges of the french toast were crispy and when you dipped it into the maple syrup, tasted divine.   I would come back.  Good, fast service too.
