nice atmosphere and easy to get a reservation. but they only accept cash and amex. so be prepared. We ordered fried goat cheese, hunger steak, grilled eggplant, mussels and paella. mussels are great. paella and hunger steak are ok. jp grilled eggplant is not a real Japanese style tho. Desserts are very yummy! both ice cream and panna cotta
