My wife and I checked out Bea before a show. Although we made reservations in advance, the hostess said she couldn't find them. After speaking to the manager, she sat us. The waitstaff was friendly and we ordered cocktails from the bar. My martini was average and my wife's cocktail was sub par. We ordered salads (pear and beet) and both were fantastic. Â I highly recommend both. My wife ordered sea bass which was excellent and I ordered the catch of the day. The waitress couldn't recall the name of the fish, but it was quite good as well. Overall, we both thought our meals were flavorful but the cocktails were disappointing. Our waitress was very nice but didn't really know the menu or bar selection. Overall, I would recommend Bea and will try it again.
