My wife and I had breakfast there this past Saturday and OMG this was Easily the ABSOLUTE WORST breakfast I have EVER had!  Almost scarred for life bad!  This place DOES NOT make fresh corned beef hash - that segment on Diner's Drive In's and Dives was for sure staged as I know corned beef out of a can and what they served was ABSOLUTELY of the canned variety.  The only places where you can be sure to have the real thing in New Jersey is The Mad Batter in Cape May or Colonial Diner in East Brunswick.  As for Hightstown Diner it was beyond disappointment we will NEVER go back there again.  This place is only for locals - if you have to go even 5 minutes out of your way NOT WORTH IT!  For anyone hoping for a great experience due to what they saw on Triple D I assure you that you will feel the same as I do.
