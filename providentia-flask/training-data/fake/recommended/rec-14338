I stopped here with my fiancée on our own custom designed food tour around lower Manhattan.  It took a little while for them to get the kitchen up and running early in their business day, but it was worth it.  If you are a noodle junkie like I am this is a one of the "mountain tops" to reach.  The only reason I am not going to give it 5 stars is that the sauce and vegetables/meats they include in the noodle are not mind blowing.   But the noodles themselves are the best I have ever hand.  I got pan-fried, hand pulled, noodles.  There is a chew and texture to them that I have never had before.  So satisfying and with a little bit of Chinese pepper sauce added to the noodles it was impossible to stop eating.  When we first got the plate we said "were not finishing these, we have other places we want to stop".  20 minutes later it was all over but the crying. Will definitely be going back to try the noodles in soup next time I am in New York.
