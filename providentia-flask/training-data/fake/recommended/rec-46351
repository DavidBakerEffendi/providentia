Very enjoyable. Comfortable atmosphere, clean straightforward food that let the ingredients shine. I had the calamari for an appetizer and it was flavorful and cooked perfectly in a dual preparation. For my entree I had the Halibut which was buttery smooth. In the end I had only two minor areas for improvement. 1) the wines by the glass options were somewhat limited though I enjoyed a beautiful 2010 Cellar Dosterras "vespers" Montsant which I thoroughly enjoyed, and 2) when I asked the server for guidance ("what is your favorite") on the entree's she recommended almost every single item which left me no better off ten had I not asked the question. I would definitely go back...except its NYC and there are a lot of good options out there but certainly would recommend to friends.
