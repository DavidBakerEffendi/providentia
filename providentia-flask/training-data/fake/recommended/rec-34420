Friday night a friend and i were having some drinks downtown and we decided to check it out. As we walked towards the entrance we stopped a couple to ask what they think. They laughed and said "They think we are in new york not Vermont.". We let it go and decided to check it out anyway. We walked up and when we entered we were told that they were full and was told to wait outside in 5 degree weather. I asked how long they felt the wait would be. "30 minutes" REALLY!!!! there was no one else waiting. I asked if we could wait in Ri Ras and i was told "You need to wait outside at the door to the whiskey bar, Ri Ras has a bar but it is separate." They need to hire Â "Door Men" not "bouncers"...Bouncers kick out drunks that are disorderly and rude Door Men have the ability to spot money and invite it in and when there is no room they manage the situation so that money comes back. Door Men are good for high end businesses bouncers are for clubs and dive bars..
