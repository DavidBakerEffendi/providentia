Phoenician Fries. Phoenician Fries. Phoenician Fries. Phoenician Fries. Phoenician Fries. Shoot, I was hoping they would appear if I said them over and over really fast, but it didn't work.  These fries (made with sumac, parsley & garlic whip) are phenomenal.  I think while we were here for happy hour (for a friends birthday) we ordered like 6 baskets.   After polishing off (+/-) 6 baskets of fries a gal needs a drink.  and the Poison Sumac Margarita was fantastic.   After sipping on a couple of those in the bar, we went on to explore the rest of the restaurant. The whole place is beautiful!  Specifically, and to some this may sound strange, the bathrooms.  Pocket doors open to individual bathroom, all  of which I believe have sinks inside.  The entire place, dining room, bar and bathroom, are all decorated with rich dark woods, luxurious fabrics and glass.  Whoever designed this place took a lot of time, and it shows in its modern eclectic vibe.
