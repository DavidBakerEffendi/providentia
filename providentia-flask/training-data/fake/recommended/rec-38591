I would come here again solely for the deep fried shrimp. Since they're tiny, I could probably eat an entire bucket of them. On the other hand, my Chicken Cheesesteak was pretty lacking in flavor which surprised me due to all the raving Yelp reviews. I felt kind of sick afterward and vowed not to eat fake meat again during my time out east. Womp womp.
