Tiny & rustic  - the previous review says people were "5 deep" at the bar - really hard to believe unless they were standing outside, the place just insn't that big - went for lunch but since they only have about 3 tables downstairs our party of 4 was banished upstairs.  Plus, the poor bartender had to tend bar (not a stool to be had) and handle all the tables, including food!  Incredible beer menu - decent food - avg. prices for Old City - overall, unless your a beer snob, nothing special.
