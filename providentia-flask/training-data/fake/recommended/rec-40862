Loved it. We went for drinks and dinner, then drinks and late night snack, then brunch. All 3 meals/snacks were very tasty. There service is wonderful (maybe they have gotten rid of the bad waiters). The price point is perfect for the portions and the taste. I'm excited to try the WIFI and sit with coffee and breakfast. But I do really love it. Hurray.
