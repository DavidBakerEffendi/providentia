I was so excited when I heard that The Wishing Well was opening. One, they're a block and half from where I live. Two, their menu looked awesome online. And three, the beer selection looked rad! When we got there, I was a bit confused. Was it a bar? A restaurant? An upscale restaurant? I had no clue. The prices reflected the service, but not the food or atmosphere. Not to say the food was bad, because it was pretty darn good. The dude and I ordered the cheese plate (it's the new thing that we like to order EVERYWHERE and compare) and that was pretty good. Actually it was a "cheese and charcuterie" plate...so meat for him, cheese for me. He got the SHAME burger, which I can't say anything about besides the fact that it looked pleasant (what? I don't know beef!). I got the catfish small plate (this had something to do with the unexpected prices). People looked at me like I was a weirdo, but it actually ended up being perfectly filling with the cheese as an entree, albeit absent of produce, kind of meal. Anyhoot.....catfish=awesome. My qualms with this place lie in the service vs. atmosphere. The server (whom was super awesome, I wish I remembered his name), was doing that whole 'showing me the bottle of wine letting me taste it then pouring it in front of me' thing that I am not used to. Maybe I don't get out enough. In the meantime, not 2 feet away from us were loads of people at the bar screaming at the TV. This threw me off a bit. The decor reminded me a bit of a sandwich shop/minimal Japanese restaurant. I don't even know what I'm saying....but it left a bit to be desired. The owner introduced himself to us, and was really rad....so we'll be back for sure. But only after we give it some time to figure out what it is.
