Great selection of food for vegetarians and meatlovers alike. The staff is very efficient when it comes to seating arrangements during their rush hours... and it gets packed during lunch rush. A few awesome menu items to try: -Their homemade veggie burger (sooooo good) packed with veggie goodness - Goat cheese and Avocado sandwich - Tuna melt (be hunger cause it's huge and cheesey) I definitely recommend giving this place a try even if it's busy you'd be surprised at how quick it can go.
