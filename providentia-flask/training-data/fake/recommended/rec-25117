Food:  It's good, It's cheap, and it's consistent.  The fries are a great addition to any meal.  Pulled pork pie is an awesome meal on a cold winter night. Beer:  It's good, it's cheap, and it's consistent.  $3.50 for a pint (tax incl.) is one of the best deals around town.  If you're looking for a $2 bud light or a glass of Magic Hat, look elsewhere.  The pub's beer is unique and they are always changing the lineup.  The Curacao Wit is by far one of their best (summer time only). The bar tenders are really nice and so is the wait staff.
