Pat's is the quintessential cheesesteak in Philadelphia. The line can wrap around the building at 2am on a 10 degree night but the wait never seems unbearable. The wiz wit' from Pat's is the standard by which all other cheesesteaks are judged. It is a must have at least once and would be my recommendation for anyone from out of town looking for their first cheesesteak.
