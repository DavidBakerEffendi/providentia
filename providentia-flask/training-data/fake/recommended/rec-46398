Quick tasty pizza slices near Times Square. I only had time for a quick bite before my show on one of my last trips to NY, so asked the folks at the ticket booth where to go, and they recommended this place. It was just a couple blocks off Times Square, quick, and very tasty pizza - crispy thin crust, tasty sauce, fresh toppings (I did the tomato, basil garlic one) - $4/slice. Definitely recommend.
