From start to finish, the food is excellent. We had the almond torte dessert which is good for 2 or 3 people. The Mango sorbet is also delicious and is a hefty serving. Make sure you have actual room for dessert. The owners and wait staff are attentive and excellent. This will be a regular spot for me and my wife. Probably not more than once a month as it can be pricey. Food is worth it though.
