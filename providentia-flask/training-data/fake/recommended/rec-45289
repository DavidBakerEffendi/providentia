Damn fine place. We shut this place down last night, lots of screaming and drinking, probably wasn't appreciated, but the staff is always great. The food is amazing, they have a very simple mainstays, which everyone of them are delicious. A bit pricey but it's Boerum Hill so can't really complain about that. Every time I'm over in the are I always make a visit.
