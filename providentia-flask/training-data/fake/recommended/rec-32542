I had the good fortune of having a friend recommend Hearth to me, and I'm glad she did. As a first course, the warm vegetable salad, had a superb combination of perfectly grilled vegetables with a hint of pickling that I really enjoyed, a great starter, that thankfully Marco, Chef/owner recommended. I then tried the rigatoni with lamb ragu, that the barmaid had recommended, she proudly said, "if you try anything, try that." Â I don't think I have ever had rosemary in pasta before, but, surprisingly, it worked well with the lamb ragu. I was two for two. For a main, the lamb tenderloin, cooked perfectly with caramelized root carrots, was a home run, and everything encompassed by top notch service, in elegant dining venue, that somehow, regardless of its appearance, was comfortably casual. A good trick, that few restaurants can pull off. My only regret was not trying the meatballs, they looked really good! Maybe next time.
