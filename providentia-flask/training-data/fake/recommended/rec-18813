Quite delightful, and open late. We shared the Balthazar salad, ceviche, and onion rings (which seem to be tempura battered, rather than breadcrumb) - everything was delicious. We ordered cocktails and and irish coffee - my friend declared it the best she's ever had. We finished with the chocolate pot du creme (so decadent, we left it unfinished), and coffee. The decor and ambience were lovely - spiced with holiday garland and lights.  The service was great, though I don't believe the story you told us about the playing cards stuck to the ceiling, mr. waiter. From reading the other reviews, it seems like this is a go-to for brunch - which I totally believe.  Maybe next time I'm in NY...
