This place is pretty pumping on a Friday night. Although the wait for a small table (4 pax) took a good hour, and the crowd in the front bar wouldn't let up, it was hard not to enjoy the venue. The food was tasty but not mind-blowing - but then again, neither was the price. A great start to the night, and I wholly recommend it.
