Went for brunch on a Sunday. The fried pork chop & cheddar waffles with maple syrup was amazing.  The 'chop was coated in a thick, crunchy buttermilk breading and the waffles had a hearty flavor greatly enhanced by the cheese.  I also had some plump little breakfast sausage patties w/ dried pear on the side.  Really looking forward to a dinnertime visit.  Beware the crowds though, brunch was an hour wait for a table and no reservations for parties under 5 (so we ate at the bar).  The place was packed to the gills at 1:00pm on Sunday. Super friendly and helpful staff. Two big thumbs up.
