I went here with 2 friends for dinner on Tuesday with the intention of going to the Gastronomia for a BYO meal, but we happily wound up at the resaturant instead because (a) we felt like liquor and they have a bar and (b) the owner's daughter, Maria, was behind the bar and we all fell in love with her immediately.  We wound up staying at the bar and splitting a good (but overcooked) stuffed artichoke (note: excellent filling and butter sauce!) , some hands-down-for-all-three-of-us most delicious fried zucchini and calamari we had either had and a solid order of eggplant rollatini (the ricotta was smooth and amazing).  Maria herself was our bartender and server, and she was a delight and perfectly on point.  She even poured us an on-the-house after dinner liquor (reminded me of a liquid cannoli - sweet Jesus!)  We can't wait to make a reason to go back as soon as possible - we all want to try more next time, I am confident we will be just as pleased.  I am hoping to change my review to 5 stars - which I don't just hand out to just any place...
