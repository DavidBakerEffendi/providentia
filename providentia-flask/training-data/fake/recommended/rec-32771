As far as I could tell, everything was good here (though that might have had something to do with the spot-on margarita I had to start off with). The tiny tacos - we had the chicken, the snapper, and the wild boar- and the sides for sharing were incredible - my table particularly loved the pork and beans and the grilled corn on the cob. The waitstaff was prompt and attentive - they have a great system going there, where tables who need something can just put a card with the Bartaco logo on it in a holder, alerting the waitstaff. Instead of coming around to tables systematically, servers only come when the table's card is up. Your group also orders for the table, instead of for each individual Â - and don't be surprised when you decide that two or three of the little tacos isn't enough for you. It's not uncommon to place two or three orders, and the review system above makes it quick and easy. The churros with chocolate sauce for dipping were a perfect end to the meal.
