I visited Izumi with 6 of my teenage friends. Although we're teenagers, we love food and are always respectful. We chose Izumi because we've been there before and it was a pleasurable experience.     This time, the experience was less than stellar. Our chef and waitress were very nice; however, our chef did not put on much of a show. I saw at other tables the chefs were much more involved, and I couldn't help but feel our chef could have been a little more into it. I mean, we're teenagers, you could amaze us with anything.     The food was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. The soup and salad were wonderful, the sushi fresh and tasty, and the main courses pleased everyone. No complaints about the food, it is consistently great.     Unfortunately, this quality does not make up for how expensive our lunch was. Everyone's bill came out to be around $30.00, which is ludicrous considering our somewhat dull chef. Although my main course was only $15.00, this restaurant nickel and dimes you for everything. Ice cream was extra, even though last time I came here it was not. It doesn't even say on the menu that fried rice is extra, and the waitress asks whether you want white or fried rice, failing to mention that it's an extra 3 dollars. These little charges really add up and outweigh the quality of the food.     Next time my friends and I wish to get some hibachi, we will definitely consider somewhere else.
