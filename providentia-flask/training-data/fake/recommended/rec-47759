This could have been an excellent burger place, but it just goes to show how important execution is! We arrived on a Saturday evening around 7:30pm, but the place was dead. I was shocked! My initial impression was that I really liked the decor of the restaurant, which was decorated with pop art prints. Anyway, I had the short rib sliders with a side of fries. They sliders were tiny (even for a slider), and I could not taste the kimchi because there were hardly any there! The fries tasted like they were under the heat lamp for awhile. I had some of my boyfriend's meatloaf burger, which was pretty good, though he asked for a medium and it was more medium-well. I will update my review once I go back and try some of the other more interesting options, such as the lobster sandwich or the wagyu with foie gras.
