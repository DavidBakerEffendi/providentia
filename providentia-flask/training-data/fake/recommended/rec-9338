I came here for my friend's birthday party and I didnt know the b-d girl would bring a big group. There were about 10-11 people and we took over 4 small tables. Luckily it wasnt too packed on that night. I honestly wouldnt recommend this place for big groups. But overall the food and drinks were good. My favorites are the spinach gnocchi and calamari. One thing I dont like is that they only accept cash. I was surprised when I saw that sign on their menu and luckily there was a bank of america not far from there.
