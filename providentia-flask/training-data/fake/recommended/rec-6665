First things first, and forgive me for sounding slightly pretentious, but with a word like "bistro" in the name, i naturally pictured something more along the lines of a cute cafe or at least something with the slightest touch of ambiance. I was way off. It's a good divey place to come grab a beer or a burger but it's pretty dank. Here is my assessment of the famed burger which I've been anticipating trying for a while due to overwhelmingly good reviews. Someone at work even told me as I was leaving that it's "the best burger in nyc." Juicy? check. Large? check. Flavorful? ... I have had some dry, small and sad looking burgers and while the texture and moisture of this burger is dead on, it completely lacks in flavor. Please put some onion or spice or something, anything in it. I also asked for it medium and it was very very red in the middle. The french fries also suffered from the dreaded blandness. If i wasn't sharing them, I'd have poured the whole bottle of salt on them. All in all, it was only $5.50 for the burger and it was decent, something i might eat again, but certainly not something I'd be raving to my friends about. I almost forgot about the service. Awful. Sorry, Corner Bistro, you lose the third star.
