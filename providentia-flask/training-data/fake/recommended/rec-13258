Snack is simple, but good - like its name! The service is always good and nice and friendly! I usually get the Chicken Souvlaki lunch sandwich, simple but good and hearty. The chunks of chicken are huge so the sandwich alone will fill you up. The special soup they make is good too - basically all of their sandwiches and salads are tasty with fresh ingredients. Can't go wrong!
