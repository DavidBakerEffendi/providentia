My friend and I had heard great things about Cuban Pete's and finally decided to check it out for ourselves. The atmosphere of this place is amazing! I felt like I was on vacation. The waiting area was extremely small and we actually ended up waiting on the stairs leading to another exit. It was annoying to to jostled around and constantly smushing against the wall to allow others to pass by, there was at least 10 groups waiting for tables! The hostess told us about 25 minutes but we only waited about 10, another couple got confused and cut in front of us when our name was called and took our table but the manager was wonderful and actually had the couple move! I felt bad but the manager insisted. The music was very loud but that didn't bother me at all but i know if i had gone with my family they would have been annoyed. I ordered the Cuban pulled pork and it was amazing!!! Big portions too. We also ordered a pitcher of mixed fruit punch which was equally amazing. I was completely satisfied with my meal and experience only down side was once we received our food our waiter forgot about us. He did have two very large tables, but after we sat plates untouched for 20 minutes you think he would have gotten the idea. I will absolutely return to Cuban Pete's but i don't recommend it if you're looking for a quiet calm restaurant.
