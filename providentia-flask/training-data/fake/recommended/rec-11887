Love the menu here but was disappointed that my tamarind tofu sauteed dish had cold broccoli in it! It was definitely not frozen, as the veggies were fresh, but they had clearly not been sauteed enough. In addition, you kind of feel pushed out. I know this spot is popular, but three different people shouldn't come over to take the bill within 5 minutes. A bit disappointed in this one after otherwise solid experiences.
