I have never been able to walk away from a dumpling or hand pulled noodle soup. Until now. As a super crazy fan of fresh pulled noodles- and tender, lovely dumplings- I was willing to forgo my usual Doyer Street haunt, Doyer's Vietnamese, and give this place a try. It was absolutely horrible. I've been enamored by hand pulled noodles ever since my first sip of broth at Lan Zhou Handmade Noodle yelp.com/biz/lan-zhou-ha… --- and floored once I tried Super Taste: yelp.com/biz_photos/bT4C… (yes, that's me!)   I am Prosperity Dumpling's greatest fan: yelp.com/biz/prosperity-… So there isn't actual, true service here- which is fine- so the single star is based on the food alone. I ordered a vegetable hand pulled noodle soup with dumplings. The soup arrived and I excitedly added a little of the fresh cilantro from the cups on the table. Upon first taste- the broth was metallic and EXTREMELY bland. I added some chili sauce. I ignored the broth's metallic taste at first thinking it might be my imagination, as I was starving.. but then I tried the noodles. They were beautifully thinner than Super Taste and Lan Zhou - but were actually under cooked and tough- and tasted very weird-- and I now believe the metallic taste came from something funky in the dough. I took a swig of tea- and continued on to the delicious "looking" dumplings. The dumpling skin was absolutely amazing- but inside you find this tough little nugget of pork meat, mixed with chunks of vegetables and undercooked onion. I took one bite- and then promptly asked for a check. PLEASE NOTE: I asked for vegetable soup with vegetable dumplings--- and I was given pork dumplings AND the broth was NOT vegetarian at all. It was certainly a meat broth. Yes, it was so bad that I returned to the monsoon weather outside, with only a few sips of soup and a 1/2 dumpling, hungry- and really surprised how bad this joint was.
