We came here a little while back and it was a great experience. The proprietor came out to our table and greeted us. He recommended the meal and the drinks that paired the meal. It was perfect overall and I look forward to coming back. It's tucked away beside the Barclays center. Tu Tu Bene... (Very very good)
