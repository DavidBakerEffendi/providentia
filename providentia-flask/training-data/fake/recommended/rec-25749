I am so sad to be writing this, because this used to be one of our favorite restaurants in the neighborhood. However, now it seems to have turned over to the children of the former owner and our last visit was an absolutely awful experience. I made a reservation for my husband's birthday via their on line system. I even received a text confirming the reservation shortly before we arrived. However once we came to the restaurant, we had to wait awkwardly by the door, with another group, hovering over tables. The restaurant workers studiously avoided looking at us, and after several minutes I took it upon myself to move towards the back of the restaurant to try to get some attention. There was one red-headed woman, who clearly seemed to be in charge. I finally got her to acknoweldge me and told her we had a reservation. She went to check, and said it would be a few minutes. After another 10 minutes or so, she seated the other group standing next to us, but didn't say anything or even look at us. (most hosts would say, "it'll be another few minutes", or "i'm sorry for the delay"), after being ignored for another 5 minutes, I had to go to the back of the restaurant, where she seemed to be not doing much other than avoiding me. Finally after asking one of the busboys to get her, I asked about our reservation, and she said - "oh your table is on dessert it should be soon." This is 20 minutes into our reservation! needless to say we left after that abominable treatment! I have rarely had such poor customer service at a restaurant in NYC. I am completely disgusted. We went next door to Bar Bolonat, where the food was impecable and the service lovely....
