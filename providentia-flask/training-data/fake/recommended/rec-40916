So psyched to have this place in the neighborhood. We ordered the Spiced salmon w/madras red chili and brown sugar...came with roasted brussels sprouts and chose the quinoa as the side. Also ordered the kale salad. All superb. Really like the menu, and they were super friendly. Actual chefs, caring about their food. Â Welcome to the neighborhood!
