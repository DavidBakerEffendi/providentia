I don't often write restaurant reviews, but my experience last night at Morgan's was so good that it motivated me to join Yelp to write this review We took my entire family here, all 17 of us, for dinner before the Nets game last night.  As a long-time BBQ enthusiast, I was skeptical that I'd find decent BBQ in Brooklyn, but the yelp reviews and the proximity to the Barclays Center convinced me to give it a try.   There is only one word for for the meal we had last night, and that is "spectacular".  The dry beef and pork ribs were out of this world, the chicken tender and juicy, and the Okra and corn-bread are amazing.  Oh, and the Mac and cheese (something like 6 different varieties) is without question the best Mac and cheese I've ever had. The deserts brought tears to my eyes. And to top it all off, the staff all have the most beautiful smiles, are friendly, attentive and fast. If you are a BBQ fan, anywhere in the US, you owe it to yourself to plan a visit to Brooklyn for some of the best BBQ you will find anywhere. If you are headed to the Barclays Center for a concert or a game, you're cheating yourself if you don't go to Morgan's for dinner first. I cannot wait to go back.
