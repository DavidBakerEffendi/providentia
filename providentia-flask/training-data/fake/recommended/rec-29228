There is nothing better. There is no cheesesteak that comes close. It would be impossible for me to count how many times I've had a cheesesteak here. They tend to dish out 9.3 - 10.0 every time. In all honesty and sincerity I've only ever had ONE that I wouldn't have personally rated a 9.0 or above, and it was like an 8.6. Which is still WAY better than Chubby's across the street, which is a 6 at BEST. WAY better than Pat's or Geno's. What a joke those two establishments are. WAY better than Jim's, who used to be my favorite, who now is about a 7/10.
