You probably need to be starving or stark drunk to enjoy this chicken/lamb over rice combo. Since I was neither when I tried it, I didn't quite care for it. The chicken was all dark meat (not a fan), the white sauce was okay, but the red sauce was totally wicked. Eat with caution, it's spicy as hell! The lamb over rice was better, but not enough to blow me away. All I can say is both were fresh and plentiful. Enough to feed a small army. And yes, the falafels were really delicious. Enough to make me stand in line for The Halal Guys? Only at 2 am when there are no other options.
