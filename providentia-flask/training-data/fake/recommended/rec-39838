My friend and I go here as often as we can as we live in the neighborhood. The Yuca fries are some of the best in the city - rarely too greasy... rarely - and the Cuban sandwich is heaven. The sidewalk seating rocks; being on the corner of Tompkins Square Park makes for some entertaining scenery. Had no idea about the half-off tapas. Even better! Brunch is a bit of a madhouse but if you get there late - like 2 - it's not hard to find a spot. Outside, even. Worth going.
