Sat at the bar and got a Bistro Burger. I couldn't find anything wrong with the service at all, they were nice enough and I don't need anyone to serve on me hand and foot. The burger itself was pretty good. The meat was actually cooked medium as opposed to so many other burger places who don't seem to grasp the concept. The fried bacons were delectable. The burger held together fine for me, but it could've been a little more seasoned. That's pretty much the only gripe I have about the burger. I skipped the fries so no comment on that. Definitely a solid burger and price is pretty reasonable, especially considering the quality and the neighborhood, but I prefer Shake Shack and even Five Guys, to be honest.
