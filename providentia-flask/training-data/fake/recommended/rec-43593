Came for brunch with my boyfriend and his family. The decor is adorable. Super hipster, but we're in Brooklyn, so what do you expect? My boyfriend had a cappuccino and his sister had a latte; they were both impressed with their drinks. The 5 of us spilt a handful of baked goods. The buckwheat baguette with house made butter, pretzel that was also served with the butter, chocolate and banana croissant, lemon poppyseed pound cake, and an apple turnover. All delicious, but the baguette was out of this world. Everyone ordered different things. We had the quiche of the day, yogurt with granola, cured fish of the day, eggs with sausage, and I ordered the eggs Benedict. Mine was pretty good. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the fishcake wrapped in pancetta was pretty cool. But, $16 for 2 poached eggs and a fishcake is unreasonable in my opinion. Food was good. Lots of baked goods. I'd come back again.
