I enjoy coming here once in a while. They have a wide range of food and everything is generally tasty. It gets really loud and almost obnoxious at night but I don't mind it that much. I would recommend the chips and salsa. There's two different sauces that come with them. And I'm not going to lie, the food overall is on the salty side so once I leave, all I want is water.
