It was such a sunny Friday last week, we decided to check this place out...we went in around 6pm, and it was not too crowded inside so we could actually pick our spot and we tried upstairs.  The staff was always very friendly and helpful, that has to be underlined.  Last but not least, the food was gorgeous, small portion tapas are just enough for dinner and the wine choice is awesome...yay! Am a fan!!
