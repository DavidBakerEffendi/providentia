The B'diner is the perfect example of a jersey diner done right. Friendly staff, good fresh hot food the way you like it. I love the chicken fajita wrap, I always ask for the outside toasted and that's what I get. Another favorite is the turkey dinner, it's fresh carved turkey made daily. When ever I'm sick I call in a large chicken soup it's better then my moms .... Shhhh don't tell her. And the salad bar favorites are the carrot hash with golden raisin, the macaroni salad and fresh French dressing. Ohhhh and a must try is their strawberry cheese cake Â that they also make fresh. It's the best I've had.
