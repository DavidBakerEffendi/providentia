I usually don't like pancakes, but I enjoyed the blueberry ones here. A friend suggested we check the place out and though I was hesitant I have to say I was satisfied. Not the sweetest pancakes in the world but if you're looking for something light and refreshing rather than a heavy, over sweetened syrup'd pancake then i'd suggest these. They serve the pancakes with this interesting sweet butter sauce. When we went it was in the middle of the week and there were no lines or crowds. Perhaps we lucked out since there seem to be some mixed reviews.
