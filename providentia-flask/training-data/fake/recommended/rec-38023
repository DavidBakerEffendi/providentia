Love it! There's so much sushi to chose from. Love the conveyor belt idea first place I been to like this. This place is awesome been here plenty of times and every single one was a good experience. I will definitely keep going back. The sushi is always made fresh and they also serve alcohol. Very good atmosphere. Not to expensive prices are not bad!
