Amazing restaurant.  I'll get the downside out of the way first... you're gonna wait for a table.  Probably an hour if my experience is any indication. But we'll start the upsides with this is a BYOB - and you can drink while you wait. Started my meal off with the Maine Lobster Bisque - which was nice and had a slight bit to it I loved.  Along with I shared a Lump Crab & Guacamole Martini with my girlfriend - which was great but didn't go with the soup at all... although it looked fabulous and was. On to dinner - this place has an amazing array of fresh fish.  I'm told they belong to the fish market next door - which might begin to explain how they can have such a variety.  There were 27 varieties on the mixed grill menu - prepared pretty much any way you want them. I skipped the mixed grill menu and went for the Hazelnut & Cherry Crusted Tilapia off the Fish House Classics Menu instead.  Amazingly prepared.  I expected the cherries as part of the crust because of the name of the dish, ut they were on the side which I ended up appreciating.  I had the sweet mashed - which were good but I wish I had gone with a baked potato to pair with the dish.  Either way - it was perfect and left me eating WAY too much. We did Creamed Spinach and Brussel Sprouts for our vegetables - which are served family size.  We should have only ordered one veritable because it went to waste - this place serves serious portions. I also got to try the Dayboat Maine Sea Scallops - which were perfectly cooked.  Actually, after tasting them I wish I had gone for the Skate Wing - I find most places that do one well do the other well also... and I havn't had a good skate wing in like two years. Overall - great service and atmosphere, cool band with the outdoor seating area, amazing food and great location if you're in Princeton for the day.  Highly recommend Blue Point Grill.
