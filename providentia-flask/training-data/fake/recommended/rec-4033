I find it utterly hilarious that my Johnny-come-lately hipster-yuppie transplant neighbors are giving this cookie-cutter gentrification watering hole five-star reviews based solely on the fact that "it's not Farrell's." As for the bar itself?  Well let's see... Pretentious name?  Check.  Vast selection of obscure microbrews that no one really cares about?  Check.  A feeling in the air like no one in here has worked a real job in their entire life?  Check.  The "Double Windsor" is about as original, interesting, and charming as your average suburban 7-11 parking lot--which, ironically, is where most of its two-dimensional patrons hung out before they blindly followed the Pied Piper here to Brooklyn to meet other yupsters identical to themselves.   The hipster-yuppies love to trumpet places like this as "diverse," and maybe it is--if you consider Amish Country to be "diverse."  If you are a frail white male who becomes visibly nervous around even a modicum of testosterone, then you and your Brooklyn Industries messenger bag will feel right at home over here at the "Dub-Win." On any given night of the week, when the weather is warm, you can hear the nasal, rehearsed, pretentious banter wafting out of the large open panel windows of this place ("Yahh, rilly-yyyy kewelll"), as the nuevo-Slope/Terrace leisure class gets acquainted with each other, late night on weekdays (work? what work?), whilst trying not to trip over each other's baby strollers. Needless to say, the good folks at the "Double Windsor" won't have to worry about us lowbrow Farrell's aficionados breaking the vibe up in the place with our brusque working class demeanor and lack of knowledge of obscure novelists.  We'll gladly stay across the street, drinking our world-renowned beer, patiently waiting for you to go just as pretentiously and flippantly as you wandered into our community.
