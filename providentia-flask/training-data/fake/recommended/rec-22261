First time for me dining here, have been to other Max restaurants and this one didn't disappoint. I loved the look inside of the old crazed subway tile in a black and white theme. Very antique looking but meticulously clean. We were greeted by very friendly staff. The place was bustling with lots of vibe. Nice looking lobster tank on the right near the check in desk. The clam chowder with bacon was excellent. I had the strip steak with roasted cauliflower and a potato and onion pave. Â The steak was cooked perfect, the potato and onion pave with bacon was addicting. The it staff was spot on and met our every need, very professional and very friendly. I had the pumpkin cheesecake for dessert and it was delicious. My partner had the pan roasted lobster and enjoyed it very much. I would definitely go back here.
