I'm Punjab and this place has my dil (heart) hehe :) Seriously - their food is crazy cheap, portions are huge and I can verify that the food is authentic with an A.  Rarely do I find good saag paneer like we make at home in this city. It might be more rustic and traditional than some of the restaurants on curry hill which cater more to the western palette - but it is 1) not oily 2) perfectly seasoned 3) healthy and vegetarian. They have some vegan options too.   This is essentially a "dhaba" style place, similar to a bodega deli - grab and go, or eat standing up. It caters heavily to South Asian taxi drivers, who are in a hurry but don't let that deter you from going - it is always crowded with a diverse mix of people. Cash only, last time I went.  The men behind the counters were jovial and smiling. Go here, you won't regret it.
