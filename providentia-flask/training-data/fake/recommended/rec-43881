I've been to Alice's Arbor many times in the last few years and I have always been a fan, but tonight I feel like the line from "chill" to "worst service ever" was crossed. I get that their vibe is laid back, but the service was just awful tonight. They tried to blame it on "we're really busy" but honestly, the place was not full, by any stretch. The waitress never, ever checked on us, we had to beg to be served, beg for refills on cocktails, beg to find out where our food was. When someone else had to take our order because the waitress just plum forgot about us, we got attitude, and when we asked where our food was for the 4th time, I'm pretty sure she may have spit in it (mind you we were all seated a good hour before our main courses finally showed up). I will say that the manager did the right thing and comped us a round of drinks for our troubles, but every step of the way we felt like shitty, complainy patrons which I am certainly not. I am going to have to think long and hard before I go back there, sadly, because I have always enjoyed it in the past.
