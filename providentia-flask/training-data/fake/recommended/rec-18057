Terrible service! I have been here 3-4 times since moving into this neighborhood, and my most recent visit was a huge waste of time... I ordered a rare steak and eggs, and after waiting an hour for this quick dish and seeing other diners being seated after me and receiving their food first, I canceled my order... I'm "in the industry" and understand that it's hard when the dining room gets slammed, but either hire people capable enough to handle brunch on a weekend, or don't seat the entire room. Even our drinks were late; I ordered an iced-Americano and my friend ordered a coffee. Twenty minutes later, we received one by asking a hostess who was refilling coffees and the other by reminding our server that we were still waiting for our drinks. When I said that we would be leaving, our server passed the blame onto the kitchen. Unprofessional! Support Greenline and anywhere else on Baltimore Ave. before giving money to this place (unless you're a Penn parent because THEN you'll receive wonderful service).
