Small tiny place. Had to wait a while to get seated. The menu is very simple which makes ordering quite easy.  All of us ordered the bistro burgers and fries.  The burger is BIG. They give you a LOT of meat and the bacon gives it some flavor. However, if you just eat the burger alone with no ketchup, it can be quite bland.
