This is the perfect place to bring a date on any night of the week. Salute has an upscale atmosphere with a highly affordable menu. The drinks are quite affordable, the menu is very full, the place is a bit crowded, but quiet enough that you can hear each other talk and the service was good. The other major plus is the fact that it is located right in the heart of downtown.
