Market Table is a very good neighborhood restaurant with quality food you would expect getting at a fine dining restaurant. All the food is prepared in a open kitchen atmosphere, small six seat bar, bistro style dining room. Service is professional with a friendly attitude. Nice wine list and great for a date, meeting of friends, casual evening out.
