after reading all the reviews listed for this place, and upon recommendation (rather force) from my roommate raving about how corner bistro has the best burgers in town, i had to check it out.   maybe i went into the whole idea of dining in the village and expecting it to be amazing.  i mean, who would wait 40 minutes to an hour in the freezing cold snowy day for a burger?  i did.  (but i suggest putting your name down and walking around the corner down bleecker to a international magazine stand and browsing).  there were plenty of pros and cons of the place, see below for the breakdown: Pros: 1.  wallet friendly (cheese burger-$6.00; fries-$2.50; diet coke-$2.00) 2.  nondescript location, very quaint and rustic..reminds me of a cross between an irish pub and dive diner 3.  easy menu.  they have a selection of like 5 things, and if you want something that didn't originate from a living breathing animal...you've got to go somewhere else, try that soy/vegan place down the street 4.  in the women's bathroom, there's graffiti tagged on small door below the sink that says in red letters "Door to Hell"...if they served burgers in hell..at least that's something to look forward to Cons: 1.  the burger in itself was ok...the meat was thick and juicy..which i should put in the pro section, but the tomato (single slice) and single leaf of lettuce looked like they both have been sitting in the fridge too long (i think i'm comparing the sides to the shake shack) 2.  cash only.... 3.  my diet coke was flat and tasted syrupy 4.  buns were the yellowy kind you pull out of a bag that one would normally get out of a grocery store but all 'n all, i would recommend this place for a quick and incredibly cheap late night haunt.  bring a sharpie...the tables in the back of the dining room have personal tagging from previous customers left behind...
