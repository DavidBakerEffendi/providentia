Despite recommendations from all these guide books and websites, this place is not worth it. Last time I was there, the noodle was barely cooked, the meat wasn't fully marinated. And their specialty dish, Deep Fried Soft Shell Crab, was just plainly bad and soggy (gross!). Maybe it was just a bad day, but I seriously would not go back unless there is absolutely no other choices. - Tiny place - Cheap price, just like most restaurants in China Town - Open til 4am. Apparently THE destination for nightlife partiers, and with all the alcohol in your body, you won't be that picky about food anyways
