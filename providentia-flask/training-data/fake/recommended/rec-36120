Let me start by saying that I didn't realize Public was a Michelin rated restaurant until after our experience; Totally unpretentious, and well executed dishes.  I will also state that my friend whom accompanied me was blown away by the food and drinks. I believe he said it was the best meal he'd ever eaten. He's right too -The food is phenomenal. When friends asked my favorite part of my New York trip, I paused and responded the KANGAROO at Public. True story.  We opted for a ton of different starters (all wonderful), but it was the grilled kangaroo that wowed me. The STEALTH MARGARITA is money.  Espolon blanco, St. Germain, cucumbers, cayenne salt, lime and a chili tincture. I literally just salivated thinking about it. I don't even like tequila -- but it was aaaaaaaaamazing.
