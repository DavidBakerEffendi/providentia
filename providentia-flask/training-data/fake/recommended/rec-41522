Very good restaurant. We got four different soup, ranging from simple beef to spicy shrimp.  We all liked our choices. The restaurant itself is simple but beautiful. My son was struggling with his chop sticks so the waitress wrapped a pair with an elastic band.  She seemed like a genuinely kind lady, not just a good waitress. We had a nice meal.
