Tina's is quickly becoming my go-to lunch place if I'm absolutely famished as their pernil with a heap of rice and their onion side never fails to hit the spot. Beans are available as well but I'm not a fan of beans so I just stick with the rice. You can also get plantains (ok), salad (yummy with the orange/oil dressing), and potato salad (pass) as sides. Other staples are the oxtail and pork chops. They have a bunch of other entrees that rotate throughout the week like goat stew, beef stew, and pork chops in red sauce. Front of the store is strictly cafeteria/to-go style as you line up, order, pay and go. They have a bunch of tables in the back for dining in but note that you don't bring your food in from the front. You order from the wait staff once you're seated. Overall a great and filling place to go if you need to gain weight for the winter but if you're on a diet, watch out.
