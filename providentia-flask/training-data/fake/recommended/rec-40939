Blah airport/Asian fast food. The teriyaki was somewhat greasy, and the kind of chicken meat they use is what an old friend of mine called "meow meow chicken"...i.e. kind of gristly and tough and not quite white or dark meat. But the lady at the register was nice and friendly - a good counter to the usual sullen attitude that's typical for peple working the registers at airport fast food places.
