Some of the best street meat that I have had in a long time. And for $5 a plate, how can you go wrong? I disagree with those who complain that the rice and chicken are both dry and bland. Perhaps these people went on an off day? The rice was nice and fluffed, yellow in color, with a bit of oil through it and a faint taste of cloves. Shockingly gourmet for a food truck. And the meat was surprisingly good. Chicken marinated in a tumeric based marinade, and cooked fresh right in front of you. Soft and juicy (almost too soft), with a nice mix of white meat and dark meat chunks. White sauce is seriously crack in liquid form. Don't even want to know the ratio of mayo to yogurt -- nor do I really care. Hot sauce is also good, although a bit too thick. As far as halal meat trucks in Manhattan go, this place is worth the hype. However, the carts in Jackson Heights, Queens, are way better. For street meat connoisseur , you're better off taking your business there.
