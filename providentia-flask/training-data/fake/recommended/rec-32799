Sorry y'all- i wanted to be in the 50% who had a good experience, but i'm finding myself with those who were disappointed... The place was deserted when i arrived to meet a girlfriend at 5:45 on a thursday.  We opted to sit at the bar, as it would have been too weird to sit in the dining room with just one other table of customers. Bartender was friendly enough, though she didn't seem familiar with the happy hour specials.  Happy hour deals would be excellent, but our food was not well executed, so it was just cheap bad food, with the exception of one dish: the popcorn chicken was excellent.  It was actually more meat than breading and, though we opted for the asian sauce, i'm sure the buffalo is good.  However- Duck fat fries were crisp, but not hot.  Fried pickles were soggy and generally inedible.  Fried bacon was not hot- why the heck not, i don't know, considering we were almost the only people there, but, oh well. After our lack luster meal and absent downtown atmosphere we headed to black eyed sally's where we proceeded to have an appropriately rockin' good time. I will not visit burger baby again.  Sorry guys, but- get it together.
