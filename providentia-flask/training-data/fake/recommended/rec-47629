Went here a few days ago for dinner with family who has been here before and knew what to order off the authentic menu. Absolutely delicious food, so full of flavor. The restaurant is not much to look at, like a typical Chinese restaurant, but the food really stands out. There is an "American" Chinese menu, and then there is the authentic menu - which is what all of our dishes were ordered off of. We had Szechuan chicken which was by far my favorite - spicy crispy chicken topped with red pepper and other good stuff. We also had water fish, cumin pork and the beef with two peppers. All very good. Especially great if you love spicy food. It was my girlfriends first time eating authentic Chinese, and she loved it. Will definitely return.
