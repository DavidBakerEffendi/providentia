All my friends love Vientiane but I just can't bring myself to like it very much. All the food I've had from here has been mediocre and the layout of the restaurant is a little weird so when you are stuck on the narrow side they sometimes forget about you and the service gets slowed down a lot. It is a BYO which is nice and my friends always like their dishes but I am just never overly impressed. I had the cornish hen this time and the meat was very dry and the vegetables weren't cooked much at all. The one detail I do like is that they put their rice in little baskets that make me happy to look at.
