a big letdown in my opinion.  sets itself up for success with a warm comforting ambiance and the nice interior design (wood paneling, brick) and a very cool bar drop.   beers are all very good but come on, 7 or 8 bucks for less than a pint?  i'm better off going to croxleys.  and don't get me started on growler prices...woooo. the waitstaff is running around waaaaay understaffed, or at least only one chick was workin tables that night.   menu variety leaves much to be desired; a previous reviewer brought that up and i totally agree, limited choices may be this places downfall.  the fried chicken was good but not incredible.  the grits may be some of the worst excuse for grits i've ever had.  cream of wheat does it five times better.  these were runny and completely tasteless.  maybe they were gerber grits.  the biscuits were good but a bit dry.   i wouldn't come back here unless i was assured (by anyone) that major changes were made.  too expensive for a forgetful night.
