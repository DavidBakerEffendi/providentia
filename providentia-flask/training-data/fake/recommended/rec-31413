My husband and I came here for lunch on a Saturday. We started out with the fried cheese appetizer and it was good, not greasy. We each had burritos and the portions were huge! I was unfortunately too full for dessert. The decor was really cute and the bathrooms were nice and clean. The service was ok, I think they were short Â staffed but she did the best she could. The parking lot is small and narrow. Will definitely visit again!
