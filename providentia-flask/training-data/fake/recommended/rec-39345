We were eager to try Istanbul after reading all the wonderful Yelp reviews. We  arrived and were very impressed by the beautiful decor of the cafe. We were seated in a wonderfully comfortable window seat table. First we ordered a shepherd' s salad for four. When it came we asked for some feta cheese and were told (in an unfriendly tone) "well you didn't say that!" The waiter then brought us a whole plate of feta and tomatoes and cucumbers. We hadn't ordered this appetizer, but didn't mind. The salad was just ok. Fresh and crisp but not flavorful. An order of hummus was very good and the Syrian bread was warm and delicious. One couple ordered the mixed grill and the other a plate of two kebabs - one chicken and one lamb. The chicken was tender and seasoned just right. The lamb was overcooked but tasty. The lamb chop advertised as included(on weekends)  in the mixed grill was missing. The gyro (usually one of my favorite dishes) was dried out and absolutely tasteless. We were not offered dessert or coffee and we left. We were disappointed and, sadly, will not return.
