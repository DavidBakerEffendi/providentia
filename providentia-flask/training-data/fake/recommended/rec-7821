on a sunday morning brunchtime, after a week's worth of grueling cardio workouts at the equinox in preparation for my jaunt to barcelona and ibiza, i felt my jeans getting a bit loose, and i figured i'd avoid having to purchase a whole new wardrobe for my slightly svelte-r self, and instead gorged on pastries at this little viennese gem inside the neue galerie museum. the apple tart was delish! as was the monstrosity of a hot chocolate and the breakfast basket of various breads and jams.  i left feeling stuffed into my newly slim fitting jeans.  loved the mozart playing in the background. classical music does wonders for a hangover! risk: emerge like an overstuffed strudel reward: better hangover cure than most uppers
