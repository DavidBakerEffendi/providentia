This is some of the best middle-eastern food I've had in NY, especially in this part of Brooklyn. The falafel is as good or better than Taim's, somehow - shame they don't offer it in more configurations than an appetizer. Some items are a bit pricey, so you have to order smart. Some dishes are more reasonably priced than others, like the shakshuka. The only misses so far: the "sometimes a cigar" spring rolls filled with cheese are really heavy, The best: crazy baba, shakshuka, fatush salad.
