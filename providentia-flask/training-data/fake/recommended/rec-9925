Queen: Magic Mirror, on the wall, who is the fairest one of all? Mirror: Over to 9th Ave and beyond Time Square, in a restaurant, dwells the best Pad Thai dish of them all! _______________________________ Lol...well not really, but when I first walked into this place, I couldn't help but to think of the Snow White fairly tale. This restaurant is literally covered with mirrors. But the best and I guess most bizarre of all, is their humongous encased chandelier, which I don't get, but whatever it's a conversation piece, I guess?? The food was good, nothing special and the service was very impressive. The waiters were always eager to pour water into my cup even when it's still full and the vibe of the restaurant was cheerful and vibrant. But the BEST PART of it all is the PRICE, especially when it's located near Time Square!!
