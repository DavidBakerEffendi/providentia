When we decided to go visit Philly on the Friday after Thanksgiving, we decided that we had to check the places recommended by Man v. Food. First stop: DiNic's at Reading Market. First of all, I was in awes when I saw how awesome Reading Market was. The baked goods, the fresh meats, the produces... I am still to find such a place in NY (haven't visited Essex market yet). And you can find any sort of food for lunch, from sushi to southern... To DiNic's... I had the roast beef sandwich with provolone and my partner in crime ordered the signature roast pork sandwich with provolone and greens. They were both served within minutes. My sandwich was great but could not compared to the succulence of the pork one. Flavors, juiciness, the combination of the greens and the meat and the cheese... It was like finding a long lost friend. The size was also perfect. A full sandwich left just enough space for our second stop: Franklin's Fountain.
