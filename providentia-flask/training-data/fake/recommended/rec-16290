Genuine Italian cuisine is prepared by the chef and he has yet to disappoint. The food reminds me if being in Italy. I have been twice and both times a left totally satisfied and the price is right. I've had the filet of sole which was perfectly seasoned and cooked. Also the mussels were so good we had to get more bread to finish the sauce. The tiramisu is perfection as well as any of the other desserts they offer. The place is a cozy gem in the middle of Astoria with all of the other imitation Italian restaurants in the neighborhood this should be your Italian go to without question.
