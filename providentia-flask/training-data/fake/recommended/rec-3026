One of the best meals I have had in New York and it was from a cart. This is truly a place for locals, the neighborhood is all but dead by the time these guys start cooking. Like most good eateries, this one has a loooong line. But it is totally worth the wait. The chicken is so good, nice and tender. And the sauces are to die for. It is very cheap as well and I always have some left for breakfast the next day.
