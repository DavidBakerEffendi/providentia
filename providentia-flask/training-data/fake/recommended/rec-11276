If you want expensive pizza ok quality go to Rustica.  If you want pizza and cheese steaks that leave you wanting more.  Then Trios is the place.  This neighborhood restaurant is fantastic.  The people are wonderful and welcoming to their customers.  Its like coming back to the old Northern Liberties when I was a kid.  Its a nice change to see....
