Cuban Pete's nice place gets crowded wait can be two hours if you get there past 7:00 pm on a Saturday sat outside with 15 people was kind of cramped out side area can be bigger or set tables up differently over all great hospitality good food sangria was good mojitos as well and the bill was very reasonable for having a party of 15 ate the skirt steak excellent goat cheese fritters and pernil with tostones excellent
