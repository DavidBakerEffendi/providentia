First time trying Ethiopian and I was pleasantly surprised with the service and the quality of the food. If it's your first time I recommend getting the "Meat Combination for 2" as it allows you to try 4 different meat entrees on a dish.  I got 3 Beef/Lamb options and 1 Poultry (chicken) option.  The beef and lamb was TO DIE FOR.   After tasting that, the chicken felt bland to me. Another important note, you actually eat with your hands which is pretty cool.  You don't actually grab the food with your bare hands, but they have a special bread that you rip off in pieces and use to grab the meat from the plate and eat.  It actually makes the eating experience a lot funner. Great place to bring a date and dig in or go with friends as its also BYOB. Next time you need a place to eat, why not go outside your comfort zone and try this place.  You won't be disappointed.
