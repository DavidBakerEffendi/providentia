Happy Chinese New Year!  And when on Chinese New Year in my house... we go to Chinatown and we check it out.  This year a group of us came to Nan Zhou Hand Drawn Noodle House for lunch... it was packed but we got a table right away. Service felt a bit rushed but nothing to influence my review (as like I said it's Chinese New Year and things were busy). I ordered Shaved Noodle stir fry and was very pleased with it.  It was definitely a filling meal for an extremely affordable price (don't remember off the top of my head). I'd love to go with a group and try a variety of items on the menu...
