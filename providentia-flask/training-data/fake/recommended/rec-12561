A more appropriate French phrase for this truck would be "Tres Bien" or "Super Choutte" or "Mon dieu! C'est delicieux!". Really, it's hard to exaggerate how damn good the food is. I don't know what magic goes on in that truck but I'm sure there's a dissertation to be written on the most economically effective utilization of cooking space using Comme Ci Comme Ca as a case study. The cous cous is phenomenal and every single meat is seasoned to perfection. The sauces are great too; the mint sauce especially elevates the selection from your standard street meat. I've been working downtown for the past three months and the thing I miss the most about midtown without a doubt lunch on Wednesdays when Comme Ci Comme Ca parks on 52nd. I may consider finding a new job just for the sake of that.
