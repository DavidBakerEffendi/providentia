Went for a family dinner here with our 2 and 5 year old for our anniversary.  The experience was amazing. Picked up wine a liquor store few stores down. (BYOB)  food was amazing!!!! Kids loved it also which is not easy to do.  Octopus appetizer was brilliant. My wife who is as picky as ca be when it come to seafood, loved the place. And the wait staff take the time explain the menu if needed, and are chef adjusts where possible to accommodate.  By my take one of the best seafood place I have been too, in Central NJ I wold rank on top of my list. A must go. Highly recommended.
