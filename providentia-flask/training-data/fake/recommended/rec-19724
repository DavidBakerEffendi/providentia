Oh my God, Umami. I heard about Umami Burger somewhere long ago and vowed that I would try it if I ever got to Los Angeles. Alas, I never did, but I heard news here and there that Umami was coming to New York, and I knew I'd run there ASAP to try it. Well, my friend and I zipped over to Umami Burger the first week it opened, only to be thwarted by a two hour wait, to which you know were like "Yeah the f--k right." So, away we went and returned about a month later where we were able to stop in on a Monday evening with no wait at all around 6:30pm (SCORE). The restaurant itself is a sprawling two-level space with two bars and a generally uncrowded atmosphere. The menu is adequate in explaining what to order and expect, though the wait staff were also generally attentive as well. I ordered The Original (umami burger) which was a thick, juicy beef patty topped with grilled tomato and a parmesan crisp. The burger was indeed flavorful, though sadly not the life-changing experienced I had hoped it would be. The sides on offer at Umami Burger are good, and I thought that the onion rings were worth a try. The price point here is about what you'd expect for a burger place in Greenwich Village, and everything (sides, etc.) is a la carte, so that adds up. The beer and wine list are interesting, and seem well paired for the food. So, Umami Burger comes to New York and mixes into the fray with the umpteen-hundred other burger places we have, and it competes quite well. Would I wait two hours to eat here? Never. Is it worth it otherwise? Absolutely.
