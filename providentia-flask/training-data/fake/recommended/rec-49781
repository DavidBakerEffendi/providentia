Fall is right around the corner which means hot pot season is approaching. It's time we put away the bbq grills and take out the 2 section pots and gas stoves that warm our bodies and our stomachs. Yes, summer is not over yet but my da bin lo craving has already arrived. Onwards to Mister Hotpot This might be one of the best hot pot places in New York in terms of quality and presentation. The meats and vegetables here are decorated with flowers and plated with unique looking bowls, dishes, and baskets. As each dishes came out, the presentation of the food never looked the same. And to add on to that, the meats and soup base tasted awesome. One extra thing worth mentioning is their sauces/condiments. They bring them to the table prior to the meal in a giant 6 sectioned circle plate to make your own sauce. This brought oooos and ahhhs from our group. The prices are a little on the expensive side and as you order, the bill builds up. Meats range from $5-6 while vegetables range from $3-4. But for high quality food, pleasant on the eye plating, and good service, its worth it.
