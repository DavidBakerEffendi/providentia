Was in NYC and ended up going here with my half Serbian friend, his friend and my date. The place is very small, quaint with a Belgrade feel to it. The service excellent. The menu was nice but a lot of my favorite Serb dishes that my friend's mother used to make me when I was in Europe were missing. It was extremely meat heavy but the excellent salad and bread somewhat balanced it off. The ingredients were very fresh and well prepared. The bill for three large guys and one slender girl was around $92, I didn't think that was bad at all. The staff is all off the boat and the place is very authentic. It was the perfect end to a perfect day in NYC. I'll be going back.
