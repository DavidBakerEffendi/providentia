My Cali Burger was delicious as was the Truffle Burger A had. We luckily came with another couple around 6:30PM on a Friday night so had no wait and also ordered almost all the sides - the truffle fries, sweet potato fries, cheesy tots, and onion rings. They were all good but my favorite side is definitely the truffle fries. I would skip the secret menu item of cheesy tots next time.
