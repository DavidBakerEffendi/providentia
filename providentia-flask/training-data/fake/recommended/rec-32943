I loved their old location... with the sangria table... oh the sangria table I miss thee! The new spot is a windowless space in a hotel. Food is still the same but the sangria table is gone! Which means your unlimited consumption is at the mercy of your waiter. Oh and the place is perpetually packed... you do the math! Things I love about the place: 1) The bread basket served once you sit down... Yummy, warm and diverse. The strawberry butter is awesome as well. I can probably have 3 baskets of this by myself. 2) Sangrias are strong and tasty... many unique flavors to choose from. However, now without the sangria table you should consider yourself lucky if you sangira comes with fruit. 3) Taco cart- a bit gimicky but hey they are tasty and curb your hunger as you wait for your food to arrive which could be a while. Things I could change: 1) Food is just ok... a bit bland... nothing to write home about. Having said that the protions are generous and hey eggs can only be so exciting right? 2) BRING BACK MY SANGRIA TABLE! (did I complain about this already)? 3) Reservations are hard to come by so plan accordingly. I have never gone without one so I cant speak of how long the wait is. One last thing, going to Calle Ocho after a night of drinking is never a good thing... do yourself a favor and just sleep it off :)
