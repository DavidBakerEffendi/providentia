Pompei is my favorite pizza in Bayonne.  I grew up on New York pizza and when I moved to New Jersey it failed to compare for the most part.  I will say that North Bergen has a few really good spots but Pompei brought me back to my youth and never fails to satisfy!  They have to be doing something right as they recently celebrated 50 years open.  That is something to brag about now days.  The crew behind the counter are awesome too.  When you are in Bayonne you have to check them out.
