This place was a second choice on a monday night a few months ago and it should have been first. The margarita frozen pitcher was great i should know i had almost a whole one to myself that night. ( mango strawberry) Â I also had two glasses of the red sangria and it was probably the best ive had, and i had many. The chips and dip were great the setting is awesome. We sat right by the open door and it was a great fall night warm yet with a breeze perfect. You can also sit outside which is what i did the second time around. Lovely place good place to hang out drink and talk with friends .. make new ones
