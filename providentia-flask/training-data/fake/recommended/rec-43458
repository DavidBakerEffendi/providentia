A landmark within a landmark, Princeton's own Hoagie Haven is just that... a haven of hoagie happiness, and a source of alliterations. The story goes that Hoagie Haven was repetitively failing the state health code inspection year after year, though with no known complaints from customers.  Finally, a few years ago, the state buckled down and forced them to clean up or close shop.  So they closed shop.  It was only a temporary closing for a month or two, though it seemed like an eternity.  In that time they cleaned house, and no doubt scraped off all of the carcinogenic additives that were stuck to the walls from the past years of cooking greasy burgers and cheese steaks. This is undoubtedly a mixed blessing.  While we all can dine there without worry of disease or cancer, I will openly admit that on a psychological level, the hoagies don't taste quiet as good.  Oh who am I kidding?! They are still awesome!! Note, though you can take this hoagies off to the Princeton battlefield, or back home for later consumption, the fluidity of some of the ingredients will prevent the bread from retaining the structure integrity to hold it's components adequately.  Hence my recommendation to consume the sandwich immediately. The location is ideal for pleasant walks in and around Princeton.  They carry a full selection of bottled soft drinks including a wide array of Arizona teas, Snapple beverages, and a fine root bear selection.  The menu is simple and direct with variations on all the major grease grill choices - burgers, dogs, hot and cold hoagies, fries, etc. A final note to newbies to the establishment.  The staff has a great deal of history with the establishment and are an integral part of the dining experience.  Though you aren't going to be ordering from the Hoagie Nazi, it is best that you are not debating your choices while they are trying to take your order, as the line will be long and they are ready to make your meal.  SO MOVE IT OR LOSE IT!
