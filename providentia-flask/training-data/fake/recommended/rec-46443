A cozy neighborhood spot.  Unpretentious rustic decor and warm service.  The food is sensational!!  Nevermind all the Food Network hype, come here because the food is fantastic, creative, and delicious.  I am always impressed.  Not to mention, great cocktail list too.  Imaginative and tasty without being overly complicated.
