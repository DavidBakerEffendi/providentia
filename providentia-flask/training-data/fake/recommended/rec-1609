Good German beer and liter glasses, check. Pretzels and brats, check. Outdoor seating with umbrellas and picnic tables, check. Real German beer garden experience. Umm, no. I feel like this place doesn't know what it wants to be yet. Ping pong, island music, disposable paper serving trays seem out of place and awkward. Look, I don't need a bunch of chicks in St. Paulie girl dirndls (although they'd probably sell more beers if they did) or an oom-pah band, but if Starr is going to go to all that effort, finish the job, man. That being said, the setting is very attractive and inviting. I think the food is similar to Brauhaus Schmidt's, but the neighborhood is iffier. Would have liked to see some stone-ground horseradish mustard. They offer a sweet stone-ground mustard and a horseradish-but-French's-texture mustard, neither one like the kind I ate in Germany. The kraut was cooked within an inch of its life and tasted canned. They have half a dozen wines and a few kinds of schnapps. Some herbal digestives would've been nice. Charging extra for rolls seems gimmicky. Staff was very nice, courteous. The two-window ordering system is a pain (although genius on the owner's part b/c now he only has to pay for half as many staff members). Food is a little pricey for what you get.
