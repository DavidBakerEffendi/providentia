I had a cobb salad here.  I was overwhelmed by all the options!  I really like how you can order from the touch screen so you can take your time.  It was very crowded when we went (during lunch hour, obviously) but it was delicious!  The salad was so fresh and just the right portion.  You get a lot of bang for your buck.  Definitely a great lunch spot.  I want to go back and try their stir fry!
