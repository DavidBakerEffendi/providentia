I LOVED this place. I went here for dinner and sat at the bar. The bartender was super attentive and talkative. The 4 of us ordered our dinner and it was out really fast. I ordered the meat loaf and it was amazing, I wanted seconds. I got the brownie ice cream sundae for dessert and it was huge. Prices were very good. I would go back there if I was in the area again.
