You come here for the rice plates, noodles, and BBQ meats. Place is reasonably clean, but service and accomodation is at a minimum, if any. You probably noticed many similar places in c-town, but I would say Big Wong is the best of the bunch given their consistency. This place looks the same as when I ate there 25 years ago. Some of the staff is the same too (with more grey hairs). All the dishes are good. I like congee with crullers, wonton soup, roast duck, roast chicken, roast pork, boiled chicken with ginger scallion sauce (this is the healthy option - order w/o skin), beef w chinese veggies over rice, seafood chow mein.....the list goes on. You can say the prices are still cheap but I am disappointed to see the prices creep up significantly over the years. I would give 5 stars if they stopped raising the prices at the speed of Starbucks price increases.
