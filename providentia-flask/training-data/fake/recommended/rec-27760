Glad to have a Thai takeout in town but could be better... I have ordered some super bland dishes here that shouldn't be... Chicken Pad Thai for example was flavorless, but the Drunken Noodle had some spice and saltiness. Â Seems pretty inauthentic as far as Thai goes but I will return because there is no other Thai alternative in town.
