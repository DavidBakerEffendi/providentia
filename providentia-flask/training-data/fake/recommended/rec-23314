A fair restaurant that provides quick, good service with Italian spirit. The veal was nicely sauced, but somewhat tough. The caprese salad (done in a special Caffe Linda way) was fair and is recommended. Wine list was average. Ambiance was neutral. Overall, an A-OK neighborhood style restaurant. Located close to many touristy hotels. All the best.
