Finally had dinner here last night using a Christmas-time giftcard.  We had the chicken-liver / foie gras mousse, the salumi board, roasted sardines, an octopus and calamari plate, and the asparago pizza.  All in all, pretty tasty stuff, but there were misses along the way... The mousse needed salt, but was beautifully smooth and rich.  The sardines were nothing special, and frankly,  I think $9 bucks for two wee fishies that require almost no prep from the cook is a bit much.  The octopus was salty as hell, but the squid was perfect.  The asparago pizza was pretty awesome, but I couldn't detect any sign of the truffles that were mentioned on the menu. It was a good dinner, but I don't get what all the fuss is about. Dmitri's was doing a better job of the same cuisine about 10 years ago, and I don't recall people calling them geniuses.  Probably wouldn't go back on my own dime, but had a pleasant meal.
