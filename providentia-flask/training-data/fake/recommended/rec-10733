Very disappointed with this place the fact that they weigh the meat should indicate something, my husband had the 1/2 pound pork belly which was more fat than meat and I had the 1/2 pound brisket, taste wise it was pretty good but the portions are to small for the price. The fact that you go to the counter and order your own food and they have paper plates and you seat yourself they could do a little better on the servings. In our opinion not worth it and won't be going back.
