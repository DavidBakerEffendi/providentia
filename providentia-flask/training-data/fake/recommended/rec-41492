Food and service here were outstanding. For appetizers we had the warm brie with pine nuts, honey, and some sort of toasted bread, which was delicious. I kinda wished it had some other element though like a fruit or prosciutto. Still wonderful. We also had the tuna ceviche which was probably the best ceviche I've ever eaten. Really fresh and just the right amount of heat. For entrees, my fiancee had the artichoke ravioli in the putanesca sauce which was really tasty. I had the scallops which came with cauliflower, brussel sprouts, and these 2 amazing sauces, one white, one green. Both were awesome, I think the green was some kind of poblano pepper salsa verde. Scallops were cooked just right, it was really great. Best part was dessert, we shared warm berry cobbler with vanilla gelato on top. Oh man it was reallllly good. I wish we got two. Everything was very reasonably priced too, our meals plus 2 iced teas came to like $65. Can't beat that. I dig the vibe of this place too, like American food with a Mexican undertone. Very cool. Hopefully be back soon!
