Always a good, experience.  A little busy and waiting, but I kind of like that.  They have very good soon tofu (soondubu), but like most places in K-Town, the seafood option is short on seafood and not of very high quality.  I usually opt for the vegetable version.  My friends always love the galbi short ribs.   The late night hours are great for a post-show meal.
