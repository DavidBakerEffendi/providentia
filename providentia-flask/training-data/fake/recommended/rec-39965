I love Belgian beers.  Therefore, I love Eulogy.   Visited Philly for the first time over Thanksgiving and was brought here by a local.  The beer list is extremely extensive.  I also got the mussels which were pretty good by my standards. Broth was perfect, not too salty.  The fries were also tasty and crunchy.  Perfect to offset the mussels/broth. Our bartender was an awesome guy who went to college in San Diego.  Forgot his name, but he had a red beanie on.  He was super chill, gave us solid beer recos based on our tastes, and gave us a few other spots to visit while in town.  We were the only people sitting at the bar upstairs, but tables behind us were filled.  It's a bit of a squeeze in that specific spot. We hit about 9 bars overall in Philly, and Eulogy was by far the best for beer quality/selection.  Would def go back.
