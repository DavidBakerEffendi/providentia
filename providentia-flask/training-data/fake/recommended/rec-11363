Another fabulous pick for a Fishtown Beer run. Frankford hall was very hospitable by welcoming us with great beer specials and complimentary Bavarian pretzels for the group. I absolutely love the feel and decor of this place. I'm a sucker for exposed brick and dark wood furniture. The outside garden was refreshing with plenty of seating and ping pong tables set up for fun. Plenty of bars to grab a drink- one inside and two outside. My only gripe with the place was that I didn't think the food was worth the hefty price- almost $12 for a small side of potato salad and sausage ( no bun, and a very very small side of saurkraut that came with it). It wasn't bad food, just not something I'd rush back for. I will rush back for the fun atmosphere and big mugs though.
