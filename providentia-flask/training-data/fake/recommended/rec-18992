What other sushi places puts avocado in your rolls without charging extra?!? This place! The lunch specials are pretty awesome due to the fact that you only pay $8-13 for a filling amount of food that comes with miso soup and salad. Its a small space but they make great use of it. And the ambience is great, very chill, it can also be a great spot for a date.
