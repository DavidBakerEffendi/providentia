went back for lunch again to try something different. I got the "WOOD OVEN ORGANIC CHICKEN" which is Shishito Peppers, keswick Creamery Tomme, Herb Aioli, & Beer Battered Onion Rings. This was an amazing sandwich and service was so quick since I just like to take a half hour for lunch. Â  This is now my new favorite sandwich :)
