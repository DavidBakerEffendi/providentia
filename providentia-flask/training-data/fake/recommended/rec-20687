Best late night meal!! I've been coming here ever since 2007. I always make it a point to bring all of my non-NY friends here. This may as well be the highlight of most people's night. Few tips: -WHITE SAUCE is the bomb. Just down your bowl with it. -Careful of the red sauce. Even if you like spicy stuff, this is REALLY spicy -There are two carts across the street from each other. They are the same -$6 combo (chicken & lamb) is the way to go
