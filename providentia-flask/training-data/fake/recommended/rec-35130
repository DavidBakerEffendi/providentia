Great brunch spot.  We had an excellent meal with great service.  I got the pancakes, eggs, salmon cakes and greek yogurt with bananas.  The pancakes were delicious and everything was properly cooked.  My girlfriend got the farmer's skillet which was a fluffy egg frittata with a good portion of turkey sausage and potatoes, red peppers and onions.  Very, very tasty.  Plus, they refilled my coffee as much as I wanted, which is a huge plus in my book.  All in all, will definitely be back.
