If you go here, order the fried chicken, and tell yourself that it's worth eighteen dollars, you are lying to yourself.  This place is thoroughly ordinary, packed to the rafters, and expensive.  No way does it live up to the hype.  Fried chicken is delicious.  Everyone knows that.  But it's the same fried chicken you'd get from Popeye's.  Sorry to burst all of your collective bubbles.  Burgers and pancakes also ordinary, as you might expect, since they are burgers and pancakes and pretty tough to mess up.
