I had lunch here when I was in town and decided to give it a try after all the positive reviews here on Yelp.  My expectations were surpassed once our food got to the table.  Though it is a relatively small menu I wasn't upset because every dish I saw coming out of the kitchen looked great and well thought through.  The only thing I would say however is that reservations are needed, even for lunch.  It was empty when I got in but within ten minutes the whole place was packed, I had no idea restaurants could fill up that quickly.
