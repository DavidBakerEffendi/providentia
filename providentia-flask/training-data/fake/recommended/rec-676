We went to this place for lunch and have been back several times.  The best is the pulled pork sandwich.  It is moist and the sauce is evenly distributed.    I've tried the french fries and the sweet potato fries and both were delicious.  The only dissapointment so far is the pulled chicken.  It was dry and not very flavorful.
