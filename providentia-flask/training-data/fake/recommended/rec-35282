5 stars for the broth. Awesome. Refined, homey and comforting all at once. 3 stars for the pork bun. It seems like everyone is making a version of this Taiwanese classic.  This does not stand out.  Tuna don was delicious as the sauce and tuna were both light and vibrant. The star dish of course was the ramen. I ordered the spicy but I did drink my friends plain broth and mine own before I mixed the what I am guessing is good old Chinese spicy sauce with a lot of pepper. The three slices of pork were wanting in tenderness and perhaps potion. The scallions with the ramen were refreshing. All I can say is next time I am getting the everything ramen with more meat.
