I love this place! I've gone there for dessert and wine on two different occasions. My friends and I got the Calimocho (sp?), Coke + Red Wine, which was fun and surprisingly tasty. The caramel there is apparently 'homemade' and it was stellar in a crepe with cream and ice cream. The place is so simple, and cute and I like that it's a little bit off the beaten path, so it's a nice refuge from the crowds. The waitstaff is cute, chic and nice as well.
