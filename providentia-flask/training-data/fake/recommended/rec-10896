Hearth has it all, if the portions were a bit larger and they hadn't nearly lost our coats, I'd probably have made this a 5-star, but... So, the atmosphere was perfect.  It's a bit dressy in a cool kind of way, the panels of felt on the wall, lighting and furniture just all went together.  Even the bathrooms fit the scene. There are two bars - one out front and one in the back, which gives you some options and it picked up and got pretty busy around 8-9pm (I went on a Thursday night). The service was comfortable casual and our servers were very personable.  The food was excellent, but I wouldn't come hungry. The food was very fresh and the menu was very original.  You're not going to have chicken parm here.  Our server mentioned that they source all of their food from local markets, including the Union Square farmers market.  So, it's a fresh and evolving mix. We were seated promptly (just beat the crowds) and we greeted with a large shot glass of turnip soup from the chef.  It was exceptional and immediately turned our attention to their soup menu. This is one of few places I would consider returning to - it was so comfortable and the food was so good.  I'd definitely recommend it to a friend.
