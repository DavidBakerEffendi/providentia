Not worth it whatsoever! The burger was bland and lacked consistency to hold it together. I was not impressed and assuming most of the people who went here lack a seasoned palette for good food. Jump on the bandwagon and eat in mediocrity if you would prefer. I'm assuming these reviews were given with beer mouth (the equivalent to beer goggles). This was by far worse than Shake Shack, hard to believe, but yes it was a waste of my money. The place smells dingy too like stale beer from the night before. Try Paul's or Hamburger Harry's.
