Lord of Spanish Tapas in NYC, how could I have forsaken you? I haven't been here in far too long.  In the meantime, I've tried many so-so places.  They may have filled my belly, but they did not feed my soul.  Or heart.  Or LUST. Came here on a Monday with two of my foodie favorites.  We put down our name, went on a walk along the Highline, came back, and were first in line.  Sitting here is very limited, and you'll be perched atop uncomfortable bar stools with smoke permeating your clothes and hair.  But the food is well worth it.  Everything is good, but my favorites are: the pan-fried chili peppers sprinkled with sea salt (daily special, I HOPE HOPE HOPE they have these again), chorizon con chocolate, and leche frita dessert. Service is always good, and they have a great Spanish wine menu!
