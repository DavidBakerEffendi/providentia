So according to a lot of reviews here they say that Geno's is a rude and can be a racist establishment. I didn't experience that . I went at about 9pm with my Indian pal and there was zero rudeness or racism toward my friends accent. So very pleasant experience.  Keep in mind that it was late and nearly empty so the level of stress wasn't displayed amongst the employees which can happen in fast paced hours. Anyhow, the Steak Sandwiches were OK. Not out of this world. Average. But I suppose my curiosity got the best of me. So if your in tourist mode and you just need to go. Fine.   But it's not the best. Sorry to disappoint. And neither is Pat's right across the street. Just helping you not waste time.
