The place located in Chinatown may not look attractive to tourists from facade window. But we still decided to try after searching the high-rated restaurant on Yelp. This proved to be a good decision. It's a shanghainess food restaurant with competitive price. We've tried the Â Crabmeat & Pork Soup Dim Sum Bun, very juicy but the meat can be more tender. If you very familiar with Shanghainess food, the speciality they have on the board is an extra menu for you. Yan Du Xian or fresh pork and salted pork with bamboo shoot soup is what we found. My friend from Shanghai says, Shanghai people usually eat this soup in Spring, when lots of fresh bamboo shoot come out in market. I guess there is still a difference between the bamboo shoots here and back in China, she is not satisfied with the soup. It's true that the material you use for cooking have significant impact to what you will get, the smell, the flavor, or even the color. Anyway, it's still a good dining experience.
