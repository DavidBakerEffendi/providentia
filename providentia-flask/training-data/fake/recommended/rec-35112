I checked out Home Sweet Harlem for Sunday brunch. I didn't have to wait at all to be seated. I sat at the bar and had a lovely conversation with the guy who took my order and fixed my drink. But the best part was yet to come. I ordered the shrimp and grits, which came with eggs, stewed tomatoes, a homemade flaky buscuit, tea, and a bellini. They were out of shrimp and were able to substitute with fish. The dish was prepared to perfection and every part of the dish was outrageously delicious! I met the owner who cooked my food and she was great too, just like her staff. This restaurant is the best kept secret in Harlem!
