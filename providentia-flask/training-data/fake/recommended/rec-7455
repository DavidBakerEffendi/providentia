Went on a Tuesday night for dinner around 8:45pm.  No wait for a party of 2, not very crowded (only two other tables of 8 people total).   Decor was futuristic and tunes were great (80s and 90s pop music) and not too loud.  Service was very attentive. Food (we ordered a bunch of small plates to share, so they all came at the same time): Sichuan Chicken Wings-- excellent flavor, didn't need the additional S&P that they offer on the side, topped with pickled jalapenos and cilantro.  Wings were small, but maybe that's what a non-GM chicken looks like. Charred Octopus-  Delicious.  Octopus is perfectly cooked, with the tiny charred bits on the tentacles that give it a woody crunchy texture.  Hearts of palm were crunchy and nicely complimented the citrus yogurt.   Patatas Bravas - Very standard dish, nothing to write home about.  I did dip the patatas into the uni emulsion (below), so that kicked it up a notch. Uni Pappardelle-- SO GOOD, but also very rich.  Would not have been able to have this dish by myself (luckily I shared) because of the intensity of the uni emulsion.  Couldn't taste much of the shiso, which may have cut into the richness.  Nonetheless, the squid ink pasta was excellent, and I would order again to share.  Definitely the highlight of the meal. Last but not least, they offered us a complimentary dessert of peanut butter panna cotta with a blueberry compote.  The compote overpowered the panna cotta, which had great texture and a mild (not overpowering) peanut butter flavor.   I was excited about the Uni Steak, which I saw on their menu online; however, it looks like it was a Summer menu and they hadn't updated it, but I was satisfied with the Uni Pappardelle.   Overall a great experience.  Would recommend but probably will not come back (let's be honest, there are too many restaurants to visit and only the cream of the crop get repeat visits).
