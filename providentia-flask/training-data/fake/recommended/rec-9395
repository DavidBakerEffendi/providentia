If you're looking for tapas with a Mediterranean flare in the lower east side, then you should consider checking out this little jewel.  Kudos to the folks who took the pictures of this restaurant.  It's a cozy setup with one small bar in the back.  Tables are lined up practically at the door so there's not much room to stand around and wait to be seated. If you're gonna go i would strongly recommend making a reservation and being on time for it.  On a packed night the food didn't take too long to come out, once your order was finally taken that is. The presentation was IMHO artistic and the taste was evenly matched.  The pricing for the type and portion size was justifiable.
