When a Brussels sprout side keeps you coming back, you know it's top notch. Always amazing service and knowledgeable staff. From the octopus to the papperdelle, tortellini, and suckling pig... this is one of my go to restaurants in the city. Just had the $45 local farm fresh tasting menu which I high recommend.
