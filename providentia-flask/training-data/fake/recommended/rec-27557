I'm really torn about this place. I was here last night and we ordered the guac & chips. That was very good and they were generous with the guac. Ordered the chicken de mole which was excellent. I love the mashed black beans on the side. It was a really nice surprise... and it comes with avocado too. Here's my beef: I had 4 margaritas, a beer and a shot and was hoping for a buzz. Got nothing. After dropping $140, my friend and I left and we were like "hmmm, why are we completely sober?" I love the food here, but I am a drinks kinda gal. I will probably not return as I refuse to pay $10 a drink for no booze. I watched the bartender making the drinks as we were paying the bill and I SWEAR, there is not even an ounce of alcohol in them. So, I will be fair and give Barrio 3 stars cuz I'm nice. Btw, we ended up going to another bar and drinking some real drinks. In fact, I think I am currently drunk typing this.
