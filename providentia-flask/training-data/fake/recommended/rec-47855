Duchess is an awesome fast food place... I love their chili dogs (get the bacon chips, its worth it), and they have veggie burgers and decent fries and onion rings, but this particular duchess doesn't have the most friendly wait staff, and today I went there and my chili dog had like... no chili on it... saaaaaaaaaaaaaad
