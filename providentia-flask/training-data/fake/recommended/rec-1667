Very, very close to being a 5-star review.  Rex REALLY impressed me when I went there a couple weeks back.  I wasn't sure what to expect going in, but the food, interior, everything was way above expectations. It's very welcoming, comfortable, quiet enough to talk in here even on a Friday night.  Obvious New Orleans feel.  Seemed like a cool crowd ranging from tattooed hipsters to button-down folks in their 50's.  Everyone seemed happy. My girlfriend and I wanted to try as many things as possible so skipped entrees, had the moules frites, chicory salad, mac and cheese, and crawfish pot pie.   The frites weren't anything spectacular (small, bit soggy) but the moules  portion of the dish, the bath in which they lay was freakin fantastic.  Big plump fellas swimming around in a pool of bacon-y pleasure.   Despite the heavy promotion on here the mac & cheese still exceeded expectations.  Crawfish and chicory were similarly way above average.  Had us talking after tasting each one of these how impressed we were at the whole experience.  Didn't leave a food baby in the stomach afterward, which is very important with rich foods like these. Service was OK.  Waited awhile to have anyone come up to us but certainly not to the level others have mentioned on here.  I definitely want to try this place again, maybe for brunch and you should too.
