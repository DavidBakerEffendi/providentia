Peaches Hothouse blows Pies-n-Thighs out of the water. I know Bed Stuy may be intimidating to the hipster droves of Williamsburg, but this place does Southern well, and moderately priced. I took my mother who loves Southern (and is usually skeptical about my restaurant recommendations) to Peaches, and she enjoyed her meal of spicy chicken, vegetarian collards (a welcome change from the hammock-addled mess that finds its way to family holiday meals), and Mac & cheese. Not being a poultry eater myself, I rather enjoyed my shrimp po boy, Mac & cheese, and a very STRONG bourbon cocktail. Also appreciate the drive towards supporting local and free range products--you don't get that at a lot of southern eateries. Seems Peaches is well supported by local Bed-Stuyers (fellow brown people), which was very reassuring as to its quality. Only quip was speed of service, but as their chalkboard said, good food isn't fast and fast food isn't good. Too true! Will definitely go back, order an appetizer to bide my time with, and try to save room for dessert!
