Boqueria is my go-to place for tapas. The food is marvelous (favorites are the cod, the peppers, and the lamb), the wine list is excellent, and the service is always attentive and friendly. Prices are quite reasonable, and the atmosphere is both stylish and comfortable. What more could anyone want?
