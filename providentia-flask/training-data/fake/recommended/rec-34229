Friendly staff and excellent food but be prepared to spend $100 easily for two people. I love tapas. I love being able to taste multiple items in one meal. Open door does not disappoint on taste. Their hanger steak and swordfish dishes were excellent! My only complaint on the food was the rice and beans tower with black rice. It was pretty dark in the restaurant but that rice certainly was not black. Unfortunately they lose a star on the prices. $12 for two bites of food is exorbitant. I loved the food and the experience was great, but I doubt I could afford to go back anytime soon.
