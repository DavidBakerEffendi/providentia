The first time I had heard of Umami Burger was when my friend sent me a link with "CA-chain-heads-to-NYC" in the URL.  Imagine my disappointment when i clicked on the link and it was some random place that was not named In-N-Out. I was so disappointed that I did not do the typical New Yorker and Alisa thing and wait in line when it opened.  In fact, it took me more than half a year to drag myself to this place and try it out.  And I'm so happy I waited since the place wasn't anything extraordinary and would not have merited even a 30 minute, let alone a 3 hour, wait. The burgers were good, not great.  My friend and I both ordered the truffle burger and truffle fries.  The meat was juicy and pretty loosely packed with a crispy and griddled exterior, which remind me of the Shake Shack burgers.  Once you bite in, the juices come out.  However, the patties were very small, especially for the size of the bun and the bun overwhelmed the beef, which should never happen in a burger.  The famous truffle oil was so light you could barely taste it. But at least the burger was better than the fries.  Too stringy to hold up to the truffle-oil-laced cheese, but too underfried to be the crispy skinny fries of either Steak n' Shake or Spotted Pig. Either ways, at this price point (about $16-18 for burger + fries), I'd rather go with multiple burgers at Shake Shack or Steak n' Shake, or just simply upgrade to a Spotted Pig/similar fancy-pants burger. Cali, you can take Umami Burger back, just please bring me a In-N-Out instead.
