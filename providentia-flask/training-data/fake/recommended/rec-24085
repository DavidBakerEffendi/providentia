My friends and I walked in for brunch here a couple of days ago and it was overall good. I didn't have too high of expectations for this place but I left satisfied. I saw from the other reviews that the most popular dish here is the creme brûlée French toast but I wasn't craving anything sweet that afternoon so I ended up getting the huevos rancheros, which wasn't all that great to be honest.  However, I did get to have a few bites of my friend's creme brûlée French toast and... it was amazing! I'm not from the area but when I am in Philly again, I would want to come back just for that French toast.
