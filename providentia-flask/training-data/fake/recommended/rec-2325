Somewhere within Reading Terminal Market, this sandwich shop has all that you need to try for some hearty, gut-busting, satisfying sandwiches.  The roast pork sandwich with sharp provolone and roasted spinach is the best you can probably get in town, and the roast beef sandwich is TO DIE FOR.  Perfectly cooked, seasoned, tender roast beef was rich and went well with some sharp prov and grilled peppers.  I drool when dreaming of that sandwich.  Will need to pick half of one up (because a whole one is ridiculously huge for little ol' me) the next time I'm in town and in the market.
