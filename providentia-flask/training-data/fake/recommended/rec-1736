The absolute best burger I have ever had. Friend and I tried both the Royale (beef burger with braised short rib, truffle aioli, and truffle cheese) and the Five Spice Duck (ground duck burger with peach apple chutney, chinese 5 spice, crispy duck skin, garlic aioli, and caramelized fennel). Both burgers were super juicy and grille to perfection, of course. The Royale was insanely juicy, the entire plate was covered in burger juice--so much truffle flavor... mmm.... The duck burger definitely felt asian, as there was chinese five spice and packed a bunch of flavor. I would recommend trying both for sure: the duck burger for novelty and the royale truffle burger for taste and texture. However the service here is negligent. They were really irritable, bussers stood around doing nothing while I obviously was trying to get their attention to pay, and no one smiled ever. Horrible service.
