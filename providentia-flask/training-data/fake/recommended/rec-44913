I have been to the old location a number of times, but this was my first visit to Bouley since it moved to Duane St.  It is exactly what you would expect, and I think the NY Times review of the new location was spot on, with the exception of the criticism of the people answering the phone, who were perfectly lovely every time I called. The decor is opulent and over the top, but you kind of expect that at Bouley, and they make it work (well, maybe not the giant faux impressionist paintings). The service/hospitality was impeccable! The food was wonderful, but didn't wow for the most part. The value was excellent!  We ordered 3 courses a la carte and still ended up with an 8-course dinner, with 2 amouse bouche, an additional free course sent out by the chef between appetizers and entrees, pre-dessert dessert, and post-dessert petit fours.  There was the famous bread cart.  And of course my husband got a complementary dessert for his birthday. Not sure what they serve for the $175 tasting menu (the old Bouley tasting was more in the neighborhood of $90), but personally don't think it's necessary or justifiable. The crowd is sophisticated and really fun to watch.  Of course, we had the rough luck of being seated next to the one table of real housewives of some outer borough celebrating some anniversary in all their drunken glory, but that's just how it goes sometimes.  The waitstaff miraculously managed to keep them contained for the most part, so even that didn't ruin our evening.
