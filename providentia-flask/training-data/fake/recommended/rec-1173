I hate to give into the rivalry, but I think Pat's is my favorite. Better meat, more meat, delicious all around. Wiz is hot and amazing. The whole experience was just cool. I'm sure it all just comes down to preference. I would have given this place 5 stars, if the staff wasn't so rude/pushy. I know they r just trying to move the line along, but damn! Give this place a shot!!!!!
