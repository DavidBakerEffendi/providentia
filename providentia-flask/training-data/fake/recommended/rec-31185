I was fortunate enough to try this fantastic restaurant on the first day of Summer with good company=)  Originally, I wanted to sit outside given the east river views and expected breeze, but there was none whatsoever on this blistering day! To start, I ordered my usual Grey Goose martini straight up with a twist; followed by a dozen east coast oysters. The oysters were fresh and delicious and much needed given such weathering conditions! For entrées we ordered the Branzino and Duck Breast.  I believe the Branzino was wood fired, given its smokey and crispy skin. It was delicately plated with sautéed artichokes, nicoise olives, white anchovies, onion and bronze fennel.  It was notably the best Branzino I have ever eaten, and I live in Astoria among all the Greek restaurants! The Duck Breast too was unbelievable.  It was cooked to perfection with morels, gingered peas, rhubarb and spaetzle. The sweetness from the rhubarb, accompanied with fungi(morels) and puréed peas, gave it a unique plethora of flavors.  For dessert, we ordered the peanut caramel chocolate tart.  I love chocolate ganache, but when paired with caramel corn and marshmallow, felt it  was a bit too lush for my liking-although some would disagree=) . The only con I had about Riverpark was the service.   The restaurant was not overly busy given the weather,  and 6:30 pm reservation.  I usually give everyone the benefit of the doubt, so maybe it had been this specific waitress or the fact that we were in the far corner by the window where it was difficult to be seen????? Regardless, I will still give Tom Colicchio a 5 start rating and would come numerous times again!
