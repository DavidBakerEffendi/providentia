Came here for the first time this past weekend. When I first looked at the menu, I thought I would be leaving feeling hungry. I was completely wrong! The food was great! I ordered a baja fish taco as well as a sesame ribeye taco...so good! I also ordered salsa verde & chips, a cheese quesadilla and sweet plantains. They add salt to their plantains. I've never had them with salt but it was good. The tacos were smaller than I expected. They are $2.50 per taco (some are $3.50). I was a little disappointed that they were $2.50 for these little tacos but it was more than worth it. They were delicious. The service was great and I will definitely be back soon!
