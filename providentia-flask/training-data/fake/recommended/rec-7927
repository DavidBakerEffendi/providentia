I went there with my roommate to have our long weekend lunch! Chattime is awesome because it has a full combination of western food and Asian food. We tried some sushi as appetizers, ordered teriyaki salmon, NY steaks for entrees, and tempura cheesecake with milk gelato for desserts. I really like them all:) all I wanna say is their quality of food and clean environment are beyond the price given. Service is good, and every dish not only tastes wonderful but also looks so good!! Good for a date or friends gathering!
