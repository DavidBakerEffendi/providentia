Ok so I just left this place a few hours ago. There was just one waiter that was working so I was a little annoyed by that. The place was nice and quiet. I ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was ok but it definitely was a knock off version of KFC original recipe. So that was why I am not happy. I could of just went to kfc for all that. And the mac and cheese was good, minus the bread crumbs. Did i mention my chicken was not hot and tasted like it was cooked earlier in the day? O but my half of waffle was good!
