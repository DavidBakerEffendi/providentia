After seeing many positive reviews about this restaurant, my bf and I were very excited to give it a shot. Unfortunately, neither the food or the drinks lived up to our expectations. We started with two cocktails off the menu, a tamarind drink and the old-fashioned. Both were pretty bad, to the point where i left 3/4 of my old-fashioned on the table. The ingredients used did not work well together and Im just not sure why they were chosen for these drinks. The food was, unfortunately, equally disappointing. The ceviche tasted like it had come out of a can and the salmon tarter had an overly sweet crust on top that did not pair well with the smokey chipotle-like sauce under the salmon. The lamb meatballs and polenta were the best dish that we had, but they were topped by a clump of bitter greens that we ended up just pushing to the side of the dish. I don't think I would go back based on the experience we had, but I am optimistic that some of the other dishes might be better.
