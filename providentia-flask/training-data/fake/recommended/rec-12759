We came 10 minutes before they opened for lunch & we were not the only ones waiting!   Small restaurant with a giant table and smaller two person tables along the wall. Seating at the bar as well.  Very cute place! I tried the naked Classic Beef Meatballs + Pesto sauce.  Yummy meatballs & the pesto sauce was very good but it was served cold. Mashed Potatoes as a side. I also got the ice cream sandwich too. Brownie cookie was good with espresso ice cream. Peanut butter cookie was good but hard to break with chocolate ice cream. I want to come back and try different combinations!!
