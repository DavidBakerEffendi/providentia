Worst experience for the 2nd time. So, we visited the place back in the summer for a friend of ours graduation at Saint Joseph, tried again a couple of months ago and our group of friends were like we are not coming back, even a couple of friends visiting from Maine gave a thump down for this place (not sure how it is in Maine). So, the first time we went was on a Sat night, but it was not busy at all which very unusual for a restaurant. We ordered some beef Pho and Chicken Pho, first thing we noticed was the food portion was quite smaller than other Viet restaurants we had tried like Pho 501 and Pho Boston just right down the street on New Britain Ave. Another thing was the soup was completely tasteless and they put a lot of fat soup on it. Maybe it was not a good day for the kitchen, so we decided to come back after awhile on a Sunday afternoon. We decided to try something new, ordered Pork chop rice, and Ban Beo which is supposed to be the Vite traditional famous rice cakes... totally overrated and it came out with 6 tiny cups of rice cakes and was $7, NOT worth your money for an order at all. Plus the Pork chop we ordered was overcooked. To sum up, after 2 visits of ours, we can tell that this is one is no competition to the other restaurants around. Save your money for else where folks.
