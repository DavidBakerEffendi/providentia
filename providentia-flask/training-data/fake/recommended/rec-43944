I went to Alice's Arbor for lunch on a Sunday and was extremely disappointed in both the food and the service. I ordered a BLT sandwich: it consisted of two small slices of thin bread, a few pieces of overcooked bacon, mealy tomatoes, yellow lettuce, and way too much mayo. My husband ordered a egg & cheese sandwich with bacon. It arrived on a hard untoasted roll without the cheese, so he sent it back. They tossed a tiny bit of shredded cheese in under the egg and brought it back. Neither sandwich was served with a side, nor were we offered any options. Both sandwiches cost $6, a fair price for dining out surely. However I would rather pay $10 for a delicious sandwich. We could have easily made better food at home. The restaurant was half empty, but because we had our baby in a stroller we were seated at barstools in the bar area rather than at a table in the dining area. Then a fellow came along and demanded we move our stroller from the area behind our seats to the walkway between the bar and the long table where we were seated. The reason, he said, was in case anyone else came in and wanted to sit directly behind us. Why anyone would want to sit behind a couple with a baby when just about every other table was available is completely beyond my comprehension. This neighborhood is greatly lacking in good restaurants, so our hopes were high that Alice's Arbor would be a start to filling the void. Our dream was quashed however with this sub-par experience. My advice to the owners if you read this review: 1. Implement some quality control on what comes out of your kitchen 2. Try catering to the clientele in this neighborhood. The people who would like to eat at your restaurant are young professionals, parents, or both who are used to dining at excellent restaurants all over brooklyn and manhattan. Step up your game or prepare to be out of business within the year.
