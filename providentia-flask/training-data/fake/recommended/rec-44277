I went on a Saturday for early lunch. Overall, I loved my meal. No exaggeration the Rick Reuben 50/50 is the best reuben sandwich thay I have ever had. It was slow when I was there so the manager was telling us about about the ingredients, which are all sourced locally including the meats, chips, sodas and breads. Also anything they can make in-house they do including confit and bacon. The sandwiches are expensive, but knowing the thought and care that goes into sourcing the ingredients and crafting the sandwiches, I think the prices are reasonable. The restaurant was empty while we were there but if it is crowded I think that it will take a very long time to get your food. Finally, the first two sandwiches that I tried to order were sold out so they have some issues with supply to watch out for. Overall, I loved my experience, I highly recommend Meat and Co. and I plan to be back soon.
