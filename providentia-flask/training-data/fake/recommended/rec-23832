Be sincere; be brief; be seated. December. Philadelphia. The breeze is a bitter wind. We better unwind. The windows at Fitler Dining Room were bedecked with dazzling lights and lined with homey, seasonal pine garland. Once within, my love and I were offered a seat at the bar. The kitchen was on full display, and we were both happy to be so close to the flames. A critic sat beside us, ordering almost everything. Enviously, I ordered only the Roasted Onion Soup, and the gnocchi as entree. The soup was a saline delight, leaving my lips slightly puckered. The gnocchi was a buttery, herbal sensation, but a decision made through the self-inflicted vices of frugality and a vegetarian diet. Welcome to the neighborhood, FDR!
