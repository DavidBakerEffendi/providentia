What a great little place for a casual dinner either before going out or to spend your night! When I walked in there was a birthday party going on, but the place is so big and airy that I barely noticed the revelry when I sat down.   Our waiter was super-friendly and attentive.   They have an entertaining-to-read menu and fare for every taste.   I had the steak salad - asked for the meat to be med. rare and it was!   The salad was delicious, the price was reasonable.   They have a great beer and cocktail list too.   Good place for date night (first, second, or more lol).
