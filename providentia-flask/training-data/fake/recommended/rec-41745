Really not pleased with Gueros tonight. Food took incredibly long to come, which is fine if the food comes out well. Things get busy, I respect that. I can wait. Instead, my food came out terrible and missing ingredients. Both of my tacos were missing ingredients that I ended up having to ask for. The waitress even questioned the fact that refries beans should've been on my roasted veggie taco despite it clearly saying they were included on the menu. My friends' orders were also equally as messed up. The guacamole was the worst guacamole I've ever had. Made with unripened avocados and was kinda brown. Half of my party had to wait so long for their food, they gave up and asked for a refund. Yet, the server (who seemed incredibly high) brought them their food anyway! She seemed pretty blazed and didn't seem to be paying attention to anything anyone told her. To top it off, right before we left a cockroach crawled up onto the bench we were sitting on! I don't know what happened to this place. I went before and it was great, but I'm never going back. Also, they kept bringing us the wrong tacos and instead of letting us keep them to compensate for their incompetence, they threw them away.
