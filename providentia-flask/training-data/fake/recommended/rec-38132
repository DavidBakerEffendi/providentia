Seven fast impressions: 1) Saw a local order straight from the cook and get her breakfast sandwich in about 3 minutes. She was rushing to get to work. 2) U-shaped counter. Old school. No table seating. 3) Yankees fans not only welcomed but encouraged. 4) Highly photo-worthy. Norman Rockwell could have painted it. 5) Decent eggs and sausage. Subpar homies. Superior corned-beef hash. 6) Parking is an adventure. For this trip, parked 3 blocks away in metered spot. 7) Go if you like the diner experience. The food will not let you down.
