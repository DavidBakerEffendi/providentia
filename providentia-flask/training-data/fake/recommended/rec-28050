Decent pub with food that ranks slightly above average. I think the fried pickles te a bit overrated though. Drink selection is pretty good with a few unusual options like cider around the holidays an pickle martinis. The place has been packed when I've gone, but that's only been weekends so far. It has this dimly lit coffee shop sort of vibe.
