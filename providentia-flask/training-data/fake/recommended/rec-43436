I randomly ran into this during my time at Princeton and sure enough I was hooked!  It definitely is a hole in the wall joint that sticks out like a soar thumb on Nassau Street but it's worth it!  I usually had the omelet hoagie for $3 but I also liked the BLTs and pepper steak options.  This place is ALWAYS opened for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and midnight snack.  The cashiers were also very friendly and welcoming to newcomers.  Two thumbs up for Hoagie Haven!
