Pork and chive over Pork and vegetable. But you have to get both to fully appreciate the superior flavor of the chive ones. Shrimp dumplings are a more unusual yet equally juicy/savory option. Though the dumplings at Vanessa's various locations are not quite as perfect in homey/fatty flavor as Prosperity's, Vanessa's isn't a filthy dump and has (albeit cramped) seating. Plus, there are bathrooms and an entertaining view of the dumpling cooking stations to view while you wait. P.S. Don't be a dick and have a member of your party save a table while you're still waiting in line to order. At least get your drinks in hand and food order placed first for crying out loud.
