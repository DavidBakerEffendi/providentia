I'm sorry, I don't know what some of you guys are talking about - this place is the shit.  Especially at 4am when you're swaying on line, waiting for this deliciousness to soak up all the alcohol you just consumed.  And yes, I've had it sober too, and it's just as good.  Granted it's very basic - just chicken, rice, lettuce, white sauce, and hot sauce.  There's something about it, I don't know what it is, it's just effin good. I admit, I sometimes wake up the next morning and ask myself why I inhaled a whole plate of halal at 4am, but it doesn't stop me from doing it again. And again. I'm salivating as I write this.
