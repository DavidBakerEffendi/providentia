Sooooooooooo good! Loved the menu selections, the diner feel along with flowers adorning the long windowsill, and the coffee served in metal cups. My husband had the tofu scramble with potatoes and biscuit (not your normal biscuit but this chunk of yummy homemade bread) with ginger lemonade. I had the challah french toast with raspberry cream cheese topped with fresh berries. I love french toast but wasn't sure about the cream cheese, let alone raspberry cream cheese. But it was beyond yumminess. And not the sugary fake kind but the stomach-filling, healthy and fresh tasting kind. The maple syrup was just perfect. They also have homemade ketchup which had me raising my eyebrows when they brought it to the table. It was runny but once I dipped my potatoes in it, I was sold. Only bad about this place is the long wait. We got there at 10 AM with pouring rain. I had this hypothesis that with the crazy rain there'd be no one there. I was very wrong. There were 5 parties ahead of us and little room to wait inside so we all had to stand outside under the leaky table umbrellas. But with good humor and faith you'll eventually be seated, it was doable. And it turns out, worth the wait. I also liked our waitress. She was nice and quick to serve. Would definitely go again if we're in the area. Hmmm maybe tomorrow before we head back home!
