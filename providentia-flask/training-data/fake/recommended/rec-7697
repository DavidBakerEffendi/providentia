We decided to check this place out with my dad because he wanted Italian but is allergic to dairy. Seeing that this place is noted for their sensitivity to food allergies, we decided to give it a try. I was impressed that the waitress asked us immediately if anyone at our table had food allergies. My dad told her he was allergic to dairy and she noted that she would make sure that his dish didn't have cheese. We ordered an appetizer of the calamari (which my dad ordered for the table) and I am pretty sure it had dairy in it. My dad didn't each much of it but he also didn't say anything to us or our server so I am not sure if he noticed or not... or if there even was cheese in it. I ordered the chicken, sundried tomato, and broccoli pasta dish. It was alright. I might get it again if we return. Our waitress seemed kid of aloof. We were seated outdoors and at one point I asked her where the restrooms were. Dead serious, she said "they're inside." I figured as much... "Where inside? Is it to the left? To the right? In the back?" "You'll see it" First off, it's in the back, behind an unmarked door (I had to ask another waitress when I went in just to make sure I didn't accidentally walk into someone's office or into the kitchen). Overall I was pretty underwhelmed with our experience there. I might try it again if I am out with friends or family who have allergies.
