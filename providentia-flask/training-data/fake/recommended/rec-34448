I stumbled across this place while attending Connecticon a few weeks ago.  I was starving and wandering near the Hilton; it's just a couple of blocks from there.  I wouldn't have gathered the food they had by the name, but I was pleasantly surprised.  They had breakfast sandwiches, some Korean food, and some Japanese dishes on their menu.  My boyfriend and I ordered the shrimp tempura udon and the regular udon respectively, and we both enjoyed it a lot.  There are large fridge units with bottled and canned drinks up front.   The girl at the cash register was friendly and genuine, though her parents (presumably the owners) didn't interact with us.  The restaurant was clean, but also a little empty.  There were only two other customers when we were there, and they were also convention attendees.  We left with a taro flavored boba (bubble tea), and the bubbles were perfect, not half-frozen like at some bakeries or restaurants. It was a joy to find this place in a nook in a quieter part of Hartford.  I'm not a fan of the city at all, but if you find yourself there, I would suggest Sunberry for simple and relatively inexpensive foreign cuisine.
