We went to In Riva for the first time not expecting much more than a pizza restaurant.  We were blown away and completely impressed.  Everything was amazing.  The food was so good that I didn't want to stop eating and now I can't wait to return.  We may even go back tomorrow!  They had a small but very good choice of specialty beers.  Nice outdoor patio with views of the Schuykill and plenty of shaded areas.  Lastly, the service was excellent and attentive.
