Holy crap. The most delicious food I've had in a really long time. I had the creme brulee french toast, which took me forever to decide I wanted because EVERYTHING sounded so delicious. I also had a side of the homestyle hash browns and the bacon. I did have to send the bacon back to be cooked a little longer, but that's just because I like my bacon crispy, but when it came back, it was delicious. Nice and thick, and the portions with everything were very generous. The staff is friendly and prompt, the music that was playing was a touch on the louder side, but it was good. I live three hours away, and I'd never leave town without visiting this place.
