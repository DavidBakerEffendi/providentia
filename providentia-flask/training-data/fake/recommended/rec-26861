We went there on a saturday night without a reservation.  Had to wait an hour and a half for a table, but deciding to wait was the best decision of the night.  The table all split the caprese salad, eggplant parm and the vodka pizza.  All three were amazingly good. The pizza was probably of of the best that I have ever head. I highly recommend trying this place out
