I was dead set on coming here to try out this place after reading the numerous reviews. I came yesterday maybe around 4pm and decided a late lunch would be good. The line wasn't bad at all and I managed to find seats even though I read it can get really crowded. So hurray for the perfect timing! I got the kimchi fried rice with egg, the wild rice and kimchi kimbap, the spicy tuna kimbap, a bag of octopus flavored chips and a bottle of moscato wine. The spicy tuna kimbap and kimchi fried rice was awesome. The chips weren't bad, typical Asian flavored chips and as for the wine I definitely cannot complain. 5 bucks for good wine?! A thumbs up in my book. The wild rice kimbap wasn't my fave though, that I wouldn't buy again. Everything else yes. They also have a big selection of drinks to choose from whether you want water or alcohol or something sweet it's all there. They also have hot food, perfect for that cold night and you need something cheap and warm to fill you up. Must come back another time.
