Delish!  Went with a friend who lived nearby and hadn't been since the smaller earlier version of Kefi.  Didn't disappoint. It was so good! Since we knew nothing about wine we went with the sommelier's recommendation which was above our normal price range but really good so we were really pleased.  My friend got the chopped greek salad which looked a little colorless and lifeless but was delicious. At first nobody wanted it but after tasting we were all attacking it.  My husband had the lamb and he wiped his plate clean and ravaged the leftover bones.  I had the pork medallions in a lemon caper sauce that was so, so good and so reasonably priced. I would go back in a second, if I didn't live in Los Angeles!
