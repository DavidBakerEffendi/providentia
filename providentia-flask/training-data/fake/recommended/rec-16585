It's a wine bar, but there is "no bar space" hmmm... I tried to make a reservation today, waited three hours for a return call. The hostess put me on hold for a good few minutes, then greatly discouraged me from coming in after 6pm or before 9pm. I asked if they took walk-ins & told her i worked in a restaurant and would not mind waiting at all. My girlfriend form out of town, whom I am meeting for dinner, could meet me at 7pm and I would be willing to come in at 6pm to wait it out. Nope, she is fully booked she says, and wouldn't suggest trying to walk-in. WOW! They really don't want me to come in....so you think if I went, they would tell me the wait for 2 was three hours? Funny thing is, I really don't want to go anymore. She sure left a bad taste in my mouth, and I honestly, I do her job. Way to sell the place. Sucks after wanting to try this place for 2 years and thinking tonight would be the night. Too many awesome restaurants in this city to bother with bad service. Why do I even attempt to leave Brooklyn anymore?!!
