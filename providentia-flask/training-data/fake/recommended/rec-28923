I don't see my original review posted on 8/22 here. I am reposting it. Don't understand why this place has 4/5 rating. Don't judge a book by its cover. This is yet another "Indian" restaurant where one common sauce fits all. Bland and boring food. My friend was unhappy with their service so she voiced her opinion. Result: When the food arrived they had mistakenly switched my friends order with mine. We switched it back. Food quality and Taste: Chicken tikka masala from the cart is better than the one served in Tashan. They might as well have mixed tomato ketchup and sugar to create the tikka masala sauce. The chicken pieces had NO SEASONING. They pretty much threw in boiled pieces of chicken with chewy ligaments on them. FREE After effect: Shortly after we left the restaurant my stomach spasmed at regular intervals. I now have a terrible stomach upset and I had tipped 25% before I left to be polite. FOLLOW UP: I called the restaurant manager "Brian" to put in my formal complaint. He was in no mood to listen. He argued with me and completely ignored my demand for a mere apology. The phone call was more about his expectations from me with no focus on the complaint and my ill health as a result of bad food served in this place. When I told him I would get in touch with "better business bureau", he replied "You are free to go to BBB" and he hung up. This shows the seriousness of the business they are in. This is not a complaint against just bad taste, inferior quality, lack of professionalism or food hygiene rather it is ALL THE ABOVE. Seems like the manager is there just to receive compliments and not complaints. He had great nerve and very bad attitude. Shame you Tashan chefs and management! I was compelled to write this review. Please do not go to this restaurant. DO NOT RECOMMEND!
