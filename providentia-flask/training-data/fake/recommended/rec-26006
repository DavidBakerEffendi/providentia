Excellent sushi at a great price. They have all the typical japanese appetizers you'd get at any sushi place, but all are well-executed and tasty. Their special rolls are delicious - the Monkey roll and 2011 roll are my favorite. I've had others but don't remember names (never had a bad roll here), but those 2 are a must! Staff is really sweet and friendly.
