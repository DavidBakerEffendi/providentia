My husband and I went there for early diner. The food and the atmosphere were good. Food was good but not extraordinary. They bring this bread, nice, warm and buttery with Mozzarella cheese inside of it. We were ordering: Calamari Fritti and salad (average), Veal Saltimbocca (good dish) and Scallop Salad (very good). The owner kept checking to make sure we were enjoying the food. The pizza maker keeps the kids busy. Â They also give you Italian bread on your way out. Will definitely go back...
