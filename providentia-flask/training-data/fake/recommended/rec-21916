I walked out of Park Tavern tonight after waiting over an hour for pizza I ordered that never came. Some friends and I regularly joke about how terrible the service is, but when I asked who I believe to be the owner/wife of the owner, and she looked at me dazed and said, "what do you want me to do," it was the final straw for me. In my opinion, the venue regularly offers some of the worst service I have experienced. It was so bad, it motivated me to put Yelp on my phone just so I could give it a bad review.
