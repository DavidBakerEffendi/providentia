Some of the best sandwiches I've ever had--the ingredients were unbelievable in terms of quality and freshness. Order any of the speciality sandwiches, and you're in for a treat. Or, go to the counter and ask for a suggestion on which cheeses and meats are fresh, and they'll put together a masterpiece for you on the fly. My co-workers and I used to eat here for lunch at least once per week. Note, there's no sitting here--it's for take away only.
