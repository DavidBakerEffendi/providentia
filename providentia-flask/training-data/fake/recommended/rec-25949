I'm not too familiar with street food.  To be honest, usually the smells emanating from halal carts don't appeal to me, but this place does it right. The food is full of flavor, it's fresh, and it's cheap.  You can't ask for much more from a food cart.  Although the chicken and rice platter is awesome (you get enough food for two with $6), nothing comes close to their falafels.  More nugget-shaped than an average falafel ball, with a surprising note of spice after every bite, they're easily the best falafels I've had in NYC.  To top it off the cooks are friendly and pleasant, and sometimes they'll even give you a falafel to munch on while you wait.
