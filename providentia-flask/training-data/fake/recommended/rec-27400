Also known as the Halal Guys why else because they are the best! Get the combination plate with lots of white sauce and some hot sauce. It's the best $7 you'll spend! They give you plenty of rice, lots of salad, pita bread and tons of meat. It's worth the wait, but they've strategically set up multiple carts. People say that there is only one cart that is theirs, but I don't really care if the others are posers because they've got the same quality the same idea and a lot less of a line. Who knows though it could be them since they have the yellow bags, the same brand and everything. I can't really tell the difference so I don't really care. But yes, generally around 53rd and 6th ave you can expect the same quality of halal because this is the competition.
