I think this will be my first 5 star review. Seriously that is how good this place is! Like for shizz guys the food is so good my mouth is salivating just thinking about it. The portions are HUMUNGO and the people are super nice. Oh and if you order an alcoholic beverage, be ready to be feeling pretty good cause they are huge as well. Worth every penny spent in my opinion. The staff is so nice too, if you're visiting, they are more than happy to tell you the spots to go or shows to see or even their life stories! I think anyone who is visiting New York must go, I cannot stress this enough it was just so yummy!
