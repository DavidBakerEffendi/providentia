I was looking for a place close to the Garden Inn in Tribeca and happened upon this little place. The vibe is a cool modern chic with a pleasant wait staff. The bread to start off the meal was really good. My sister ordered the margherita pizza, of which she's the queen of. I had a piece and it was really good.  I ordered the squid ink pasta with seafood.  The dish was delicious.  The sauce had almost a creaminess to it and the seafood was all fresh and well cooked.   I would highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for italian, they do it right.
