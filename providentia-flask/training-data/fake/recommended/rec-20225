Thai food has never been this good. The Beef Pad-see-u is the best dish! Â I like to mix it up with the Spicy Chicken or Pad Thai but I always end up coming back to the Beef Pad-see-u. Start off with the fried Calamari and perhaps a mango salad. The Riesling makes it all wash down real nice. The best part is the price...what price? A meal for 3 runs you about $20.00 (minus drinks). Where can you get great quality food that costs close to nothing? Oh right, Song!
