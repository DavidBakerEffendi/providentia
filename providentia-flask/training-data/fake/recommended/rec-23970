For delivery only When ordering the Ratchaburi Crab & Pork Dry Noodle on Seamless Web, get the noodle soup option. The broth comes separately so you can add just enough to loosen up the noodles if they're sticky. I've also now tried the following: Vegetable dumplings: They're not your typical Chinese/Japanese/Korean dumplings. They topped off the dumplings with crushed peanut which gave it a unique delicious taste. Pad See Ew: they use rice vermicelli noodles.. which wasn't expected but the flavors were all there. Pad Thai: delish, possibly better than Wondee.. not a fan of the dried shrimp though At lastly, if you ask for spicy.. watch out because my two Indian coworkers were in tears because it was so spicy.. which translates to death by spice for me.
