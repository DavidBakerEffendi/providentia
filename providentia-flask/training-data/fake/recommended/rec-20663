I LOVED this place. I felt like I was transported straight to Japan. The flavors and presentation were perfect. I got the Friday special - chirashi sushi donburi. So. Yummy. And for $8.75?? A steal!! I also got a mochi donut dipped in chocolate - after I gobbled it down I promptly bought another one. After eating my Japanese mother's cooking my whole life, I can safely say this is REAL Japanese food and I highly recommend. If I lived closer, my wallet would be in danger because I would go ALL the time.
