Of the two main cheesesteak place in Philly, this is the other one (and directly across the street from the other). Limited seating, service a bit nicer than across the street, but still a very average cheesesteak. Counter service. Like the other, it becomes a mob of tourists on weekends (especially during the summer months). Go if you want to say you have been there, but otherwise go elsewhere for a good cheesesteak.
