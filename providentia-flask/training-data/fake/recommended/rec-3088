Authentic Puerto Rican cuisine that's mouth watering! I went with my friend and we couldn't stop raving about how well seasoned the food was. Â I had chuletas frita with white rice and pink beans and my friend had 1/2 chicken with yellow rice and black beans. The prices are affordable and the service is great, I suggest you go without thinking twice!
