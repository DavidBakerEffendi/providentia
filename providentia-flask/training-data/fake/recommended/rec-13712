These sandwiches should come with a label warning... "May cause the ITIS after eating". The itis, however, didn't stop me from going twice this week. It's ridiculous how amazing these banh mi sandwiches are. I don't have banh mi often so I'm not an expert but I know good food, and the banh mi sammies are the BOMB. I highly recommend the 5 spice pork belly and the duroc pork. They're both tasty and a bit spicy. Deduct a star because they are a bit pricey and they're CASH ONLY.
