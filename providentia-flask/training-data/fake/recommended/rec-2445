"Mmmmmmm! This is a tasty burger!" - Jules Winfield, Pulp Fiction Walking down sixth, I smelled that beefy goodness from at least a block away. At that point, I knew this place was going to be special. I was expecting an hour wait, but I got my table within ten minutes, must be my lucky day. The burger was perfectly sized, big enough to justify its over $10 price but no so big that a food coma would occur soon after lunch. I had the Original, had to try what Uamami Burger was all about. And I can tell you that the burger was the perfect umami bomb.  Parmesan crisp was an inspired ingredient, it added a crunch to the texture of the burger like a fresh piece of lettuce or bacon would. The house made ketchup was closer to tomato paste than ketchup, bringing out the umami found in tomatoes. The beef patty was phenomenal as well. Even though this place opened in the last few months, the patty had a perfect sear and had so much flavor, it almost tasted like it was cooked on a flattop grill that had been in use for decades. In the end, the burger was an extreme concentration of umami, but no so much that it became too rich.  It was just  damn good burger. Wish their fries weren't tiny little shoestrings, a fatter fry could soak up more of their very good dipping sauces. Also wish their fried pickles were fried coins, not spears.  Still not deducting any stars from such an awesome burger.
