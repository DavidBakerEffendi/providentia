I loved this place from the moment I walked in. The decor is rich and colorful - it feels like you are walking into another country. There aren't too many restaurants that you can find both great food and a genuinely unique experience, but Marrakesh is one. As I came with a large group, we had our own room in the upstairs part of the restaurant. We were seated on pillows around a large table, and given towels for our laps. I thought this was pretty strange at first, but those towels sure came in handy as all of the food was served without silverware on shared plates! This was really fun and added to the authentic experience. They bring out course after course of food - way too much for anyone to realistically eat. Some of the courses I loved, some I only liked okay, but that is to be expected with any type of pre-fix menu. Even my least favorite course was still good, and its always fun to try something different! We also ordered a bit (okay.. a LOT) of the house wine, which wasn't anything special but was a perfectly sufficient red wine. Also, it was CHEAP. I think $12 a carafe? Since alcohol is usually SO overpriced at restaurants, it was very nice to be able to drink without breaking the bank. Between the rosewater handwashing ceremony, 7 courses of food and the visits from the belly dancer, we were there over 3 hours. it was a night out all by itself. The only negative that I can see is that three of the courses are meat/animal based (one with eggs, one chicken and one beef/lamb) so vegetarians/vegans probably want to avoid eating here.
