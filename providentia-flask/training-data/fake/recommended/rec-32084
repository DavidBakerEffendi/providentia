The staff makes no hesitation to recommend a dish for you that he thinks is better than the one you ordered. The dan-dan noodles comes out quick and is spicy and delicious! The dumplings in chili oil was the perfect appetizer. Hot sauce chicken comes out in a large filling portion and the double fried fish was crunchy and delicious with black bean flavor! Too much spice makes the next morning somewhat painful though so be warned!
