Pat's Pat's Pat's.....definitely much better than Geno's, which is across the street.  Pat's puts a generous glob of cheez whiz on TOP of the meat, as opposed to the microscopic layer of whiz on the bun at Geno's.  When the cheez is on top, it has a chance to sink through the rest of the meat on its way to the bread.  I could barely taste any cheez on Geno's.  I tried Pat's, Geno's, and Jim's and Pat's is definitely the best of the three.
