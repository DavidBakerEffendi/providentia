Hm, I think for what it is, I think it is more $$ than $. It's about 8 to 9 dollars for a wrap and about 4 or 5 dollars for fries. I got the carnivore delight wrap and it tasted like a hamburger. I also got the wolf attack which was tater tots with cheddar, chili and jalapeno on it which was pretty good for about $6. I noticed that every single person who entered was male. LOLS. Just a funny observation. They serve beer. So, I spent about $20 on a wrap, fries and a drink..$$ not $, Yelp.
