This is a north jersey landmark & one of the best known diners in the area . I came here for breakfast this morning.. The vegetable omelette & home fries were really good, & I enjoyed it. The service just seemed a little unfriendly.. But then again your talking about a place where the nephew of the previous owner set up a hit on his uncle in order to inherit the tick tock diner ... Maybe I'd be uptight too if I thought people were gonna get whacked on the job. The place is open 24 hours.. I'll be back!
