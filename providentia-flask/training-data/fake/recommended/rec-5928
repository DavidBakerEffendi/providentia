5 stars from my stomach, heart, mind, you name it. This restaurant made me love pappardelle and mushrooms, two things I didn't care for before coming here. Order the Pappardelle Tartufate and bring your own wine for an unforgettable evening. Actually, in my case, I drank a little too much wine last time I went which made things a little hazy - except I remember fighting with my best friend over who would finish the Pappardelle. He still owes me that dish next time I'm in Philly.
