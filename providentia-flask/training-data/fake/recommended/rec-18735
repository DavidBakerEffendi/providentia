If I could make this 3.5 stars I would. The food here is pretty good, I've been here now a few times and find my self habitually ordering the penny egg sandwich which is great. I find it though a little shocking though that there can be up to a 2 hour wait. When I went here yesterday I saw them turning people away because they had already reached the limit, I live however around the corner and we had a guest in town and it really is the only decent place like it for blocks so we endured the cold and enjoyed it. I would just like to warn people if you are looking to be moved and think that it will live up to the hype prepare to go in a little more level headed and you wont be TOO upset after standing in the cold for 2 hours.
