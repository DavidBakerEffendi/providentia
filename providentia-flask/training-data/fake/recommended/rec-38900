Burlington proved to be quite a foodie town, and it started here for us. My party of 7 was seated pretty quickly despite it being a busy night. Live music and great bar. The menu is a bit limiting. Not much in the area of appetizers and deserts, but the pizzas are gourmet. We bought 3 different pies along with a family size salad to share, and we ended up taking pizza home. Would definitely return.
