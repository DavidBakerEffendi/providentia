I've been going to the American Bistro for over 10 years. The food has remained consistently yummy and the staff is always pleasant. About 7 yrs ago, we moved about 40 mins away, yet continued to drive to the Bistro because there are no Italian restaurants in our area that could compete. We are happy to be moving back in the area and will be able to spend more time at the Bistro in the future.
