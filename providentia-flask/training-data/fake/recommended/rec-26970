This is a quirky little place tucked away in a basement near Citizen Cider & nearly hidden.  I had the Cuban sandwich, which was very good.  However, the wait was about 45+ minutes from arrival to sandwich touchdown around 1pm and it wasn't even that crowded!  The owner puts a lot of love into his sandwiches and it shows in the food.  Just don't come here in a rush or you will lose your cookies!  Cash only!
