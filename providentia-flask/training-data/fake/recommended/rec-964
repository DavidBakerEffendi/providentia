As a tourist who went to both Geno's and Pat's both, I feel the need to compared the two. Geno's has great bread, good meat, and straight kraft cheese wiz. Pat's had good bread and meat, but crafted the cheese wiz. While Pat's seemed more like a home style sandwhich, Geno's was more flavorful and I just loved the bread. So, I will have to vote for Geno's. Pat's had a lot more options and which would probably be preferable to someone staying in the area. As a side note, the lines were really long and I almost wanted to turn around, but they were surprisingly fast. The seating is cramped so take your sandwich to the bar across the street, it's looks like a car repair shop... 3 stars were given as I had to give the bonus star to Geno's.
