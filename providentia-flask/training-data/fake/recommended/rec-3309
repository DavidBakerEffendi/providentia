Oh wow, I don't know how I missed this place in all my prior Chinatown adventures...I heard some complaints about fatty broth; but I went with the roasted duck with the pulled noodles and man it was just perfect.  As happy as I am for Summer to come, I almost wish it were cooler so I would have more excuses to come in for a hot steamy bowl.   Next time I need to try the shaved noodles and some of the more interesting appetizers.
