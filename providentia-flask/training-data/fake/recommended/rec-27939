Cafecito is the real deal.  Food is made with pride and is always fresh.   I really like the steak, it is very flavorful.     The yellow beans and rice are always good as well!   Always an interesting crowd, tends to be young, but more mature then the throngs of NYU students around St Marks.   It can be a bit loud, but on the right night it can be a great date place.    On the weekends be prepared to have a drink or two at the bar to wait for a table.    The bar crowd is always lively and the owner Manny always works hard to keep it fun. I miss this place!
