Absolutely perfect.  This is the first tapas place that I have been to in the city that actually has a variaty of options for vegetarians (dont worry meat lovers, there is a ton for you too).  The staff is so personable, the tables are roomy and the ambiance is tasteful, homey and romantic. Please please please get the patatas bravas.  They are the most creamy, crispy and flavorful potatoes.  The fried chickpeas were pretty awesome too. I was expecting a falafel like dish, but instead we got chickpeas that were individually and slightly fried.  And finally you MUST get the leche frita for desert.  Just one of these tiny fried custard balls topped with drunken cherries will satisfy my sweet teeth for at least a week.
