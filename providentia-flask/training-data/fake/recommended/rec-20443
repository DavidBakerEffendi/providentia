We live in NY, the pizza mecca of the world. It's not fair to judge other pizzas on the same scale. On the Burlington scale, four stars. We sat outside with our pup, sampled as many half pints of local beer as we could and settled in to the mellowness. Speaking of mellow, if you're starved, hunker down. It may be a while.
