I passed this place on my way to Roasted Kitchen and decided to give it a try. DISH: Root Vegetable Mash (sweet potato, swish, carrot & parsnip); I topped it with roasted mushrooms, almonds and scallions. It was absolutely delicious. ATMOSPHERE: warm, dimly lit & casually abstract. OVERALL MENU: there's a huge selection of vegetarian/vegan dishes along with a juice bar. It was okay - being it was my first time but they're a bit on the pricy side. I purchased the mash bowl, an extra piece of bread and a small banana, almond smoothie. It costs $19! They're up there with Wholefoods. Unfortunately, this was expected in union square - for an establishment specializing in the Paleo diet w/no cane sugar, soy lecithin, refined sugar, gluten, emulsifiers and GMO.
