The mixed drinks are great, the food is always good and the patrons are a fun crowd.  The ONLY reason I cant give a full five stars is because I had a burger there once and, as good as it was, cannot compare to a local burger competitor down the street.  Sweet Afton is a wonderful addition to the Astoria nightlife.  The atmosphere is unlike any other bar in the neighborhood. Try the pickle back shots!!!
