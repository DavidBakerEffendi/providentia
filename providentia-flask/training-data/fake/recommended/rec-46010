I ordered half a chicken with rice and beans and a side of ribs(no rice or beans just the Â half ribs which is two pieces) It came out to eighteen dollars. I found that to be pricey but I was thinking maybe the food will make up for it. When my boyfriend went to eat the chicken it was all pink and some pieces had blood . We tried to find a piece that was decently cooked but we ended up throwing away all the chicken. The ribs? Even worse. They placed a regular sized rib on top of a rib that barely had any meat, just bones so that when I opened the box it looked like two regular pieces.i felt deceived and very upset. I work very hard for my money and I felt like I just threw away eighteen dollars. Don't go if you don't have to. Grill master is better and doesn't deceive. If anything they actually give you a good amount of food for what you pay.
