The other reviews really describe the food really well- among the most delicious and inexpensive noodle soup dishes around. To get a sense of how great this place really is- 1) this is the first place I go to after being away for a conference or a long trip (straight from the airport/ train station, even though my home is not along the way) 2) this is the first place I bring any friends/relatives when they come visit me in Philadelphia 3) whenever I/ my workmates want to celebrate something working out in lab, this is the joint we want to go to 4) probably 50% of my caloric intake has been from this place during weeks when I was in a comfort food mode 5) The noodles soups are the best!!!!
