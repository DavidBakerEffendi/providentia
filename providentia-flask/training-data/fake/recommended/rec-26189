Portions are huge, Â the price is low, and of course the taste is amazingg!!!! I got the a chicken pesto hot sandwich and man... I want more just thinking about it. I couldn't finish my order because it was so large. They also serve fries which are hot and crispy. Yum. Good place to hit when you want fast service or a cheap eat.
