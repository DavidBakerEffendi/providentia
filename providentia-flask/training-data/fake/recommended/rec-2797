It's a nice place to meet with friends for lunch, dinner or a late-night coffee & dessert.  Good food & service ~ large variety of typical diner food ~ a bit expensive, but you can sign up in their website under Promotions and they will e-mail you coupons! thegalaxydiner.com/promo… The decor is nice ~ looks like renovation was within the last 2 years. WARNING:  Parking lot exiting is very dangerous... don't make a left onto St. Georges Ave. (going south) ~ instead, turn right (towards Linden & Elizabeth) and go to a light to make a U-turn.
