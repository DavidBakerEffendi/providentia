Love love their white sangria and the seafood linguine beside the excellent calamaris! The price is very reasonable for the portion of food! The do special black ink linguine with the seafood (ultra yummy!). For dessert I love the NY cheesecake. Light but yet delicious! Reservation highly recommended!
