during my one week visit to PA, I ate at Mercato TWICE. consider that YUM STATUS (also David C.'s apt was just around the corner) THE cioppino.... oh how could I ever forget you. my gosh thats some YUM status. i mean the Pan Seared Diver Scallop, uhm, its just the typical scallop dish, so I guess you can skip that. Dont get me wrong, STILL tasty though! Antipasti was good also, but.. the best part of my dinner at Mercato was THE BITTERSWEET MOLTEN CHOCOLATE CAKE. FOODGASM (attaching picture!) -price came out to maybe +/-$100 for the two of us. -place was SMALL and ALWAYS CROWDED (I guess thats a good thing?) -BYOB ok Mercato, do you deliver to California? please say yes.
