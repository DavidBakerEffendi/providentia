I really liked the hand drawn noodles.  I tried the duck noodle soup and the beef brisket noodle soup and both used the same broth but both were delicious.  It doesn't taste like they use alot of MSG or grease.  I also tried the spicy pig ears for the first time and it was really good.  Good place for some healthy soup and pig ears.
