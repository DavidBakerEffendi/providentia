The main room, the staff, the sommelier, were all great. - the back room, not so much. We were in the front but our expectations were not met. There were 6 of us and other than the excellent "Ciareghi" (an in-house made type sausage) with sunny side up egg appetizer, the rest of our meals were "OK to Good". This is not what you expect in a place run by Marc Vetri. The "Lumaca" pizza (snails, spring onions, mozzarella), as well as another snail appetizer were nothing to write home about. The biggest disappointment was the Gnocchi - it not even being in the same class as his Spinach Gnocchi at his other location. Entrees including the rabbit, chicken and halibut were underwhelming. The lamb was good. With wine, tax & tip around $160 per couple. We'll return to one of his restaurants again - but not this one.
