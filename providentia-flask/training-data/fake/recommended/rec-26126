I took a few of my best friends and my boyfriend to Rye after having finished my screenplay I had been working on for 2 years. It was a very special occasion for me, and I couldn't have picked a more perfect place. I took them there as a 'thank you' for helping me and putting up with my lameness of never being able to go out, and by the end of the night they were thanking me like crazy.   We ate so much food: the short rib terrine appetizer was incredible, as was the artichoke stew (which is not really a stew at all but amazing nonetheless), the grilled quail, the grilled pork belly, the sardines, the chocolate cake, and the lemon cake. Although the chocolate cake was the ubiquitous molten chocolate cake, it was still out of this world; one of the best I've ever had. The least favorite dishes of the night were the wild striped bass, which my friend said was bland, and the crab croquette, which my other friend said was good, but not as great as the other food. That's a pretty good track record right there. The drinks were good too, but overall I liked the food better. This place is not cheap, especially when you are picking up the tab for a group of people (but that doesn't happen very often, at least not for me). And although they don't take credit cards, this place is sooo worth it.  Our waitress was so nice, and put up with us ordering at all different times. The whole staff was super attentive and made our night one to remember. Thank you Rye for such a good night.
