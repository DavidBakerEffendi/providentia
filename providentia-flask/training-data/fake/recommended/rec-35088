Came here with some friends for a happy hour after work. While they don't have a happy hour special, the food and drinks are relatively cheap so it's not an issue. I had a fish taco, guacamole and chips and a mango margarita. Â Total was about $20 so not bad at all. The fish taco was pretty good and the guacamole was ok. The margarita was tasty. It's It's a great place to hang out with friends because of the outdoor backyard type setup which I really like. This is a regular hang out spot and I'll be back!
