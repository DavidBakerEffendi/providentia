Everyone is going to hate me for this, but I'm sorry, I have to express my opinions about this place. I've been to the Fogo de Chao in Washington, DC a couple of times, LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT! I want to desperately say the same thing about this place, HOWEVER, I can't. I'm only giving them a two star rating because of the all-you-can-eat. The quality of the meats were amazing, if you were able to get any on your plate. So here's the break down: Service - We showed up as a party of six. Well dressed, with a reservation. We were seated, but it took the server forever to get us our drinks. We never got our plates, we had to get them ourselves, and if you wanted a certain cut of meats (even when your card was green) you had to chase them down. I felt like we were invisible that night. Aside from the different selection of meats, I LOVE the fried bananas and the mash that they serve, well those took FOREVER to come as well. The food was not disappointing by any means, however, the service was nothing close to acceptable for Fogo de Chao. Hopefully this was just an off day.
