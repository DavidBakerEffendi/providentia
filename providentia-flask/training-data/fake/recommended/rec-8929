I love brunch here. I came for blood pudding waffles and hash browns. It is so good, it makes me want to come for dinner to try what other good stuff they have. No reservations, fast seating, great service, strong and good coffee. Bloody mary's are strong and spicy. I also do like the location if that has anything to do with it. Not too many rubber neckers and its on a quiet corner. Cute balcony for 2 table seating for groups of 4 or more. The bathroom has complimentary individualised bars of branded soap. Its a nice touch.
