I have lived in the Art Museum area for years, and the one restaurant in the city that my wife and I will go to over and over again is Figs.  It has great atmosphere and great food.  All of our friends and family we have taken there have had nothing but praise for it, saying it's one of the best places they've eaten.   Figs is a Mediterranean BYO that has a bit of a Moroccan flair.  We have had a lot of the appetizers and entrees on the menu, but I'll just concentrate on a couple to whet your appetite.  The baked brie with honey is very delightful as an appetizer, as the last reviewer noted.  Also, the tuna sashimi (called my favorite appetizer) is very fresh and delicious.  And you couldn't go wrong with any of the choices for the tapas plate (hummus, baba ganoush, etc.)   For entrees, the shrimp with vanilla rice is absolutely fantastic - the grilled shrimp pair great with the sweet, but not overly sweet, rice.  The whole fish of the day is very enjoyable, grilled to tenderness with simply spiced roasted potatoes and asparagus, as to not compete with the delicious fish.  They have great filet and chicken dishes as well, and the crispy duck breast is a sweet change of pace.   Make sure you call ahead for a reservation, though...on Friday and Saturday nights, you may be waiting for awhile if you don't.  The dining room is a bit small, but bigger than other BYOs I've been to in the city.  Figs has some outside seating during the nicer days of the year as well, which is nice since it's in a quaint neighborhood.   Did I mention they have brunch too?  I haven't been, but my friends have and they say it is excellent with reasonable prices.   If you haven't been to Figs, you just don't know what you're missing.
