As a newbie driving past Montclair's restaurant row this place has always stood out. Their menu is, as advertised, Cuban food, but from the entrance, which is wood planks with coconuts on the ground, to the tables that look like outdoor patio furniture, to the wait staff dressed like Panama Jack (Cuban Jack?), it's a great experience. Family friendly, they have a brief kids menu -- and I hear the grilled cheese is really good. I would definitely bring friends, a bottle of wine and a taste for good Cuban food here without hesitation.
