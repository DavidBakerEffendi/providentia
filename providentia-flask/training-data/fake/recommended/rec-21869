We stopped here on a Monday evening when it was cool and pleasant outside.  The place was full and we had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. It wasn't that bad of a wait because there were a few free seats available at the bar -- although their beer selection was pretty poor. We ordered the Iskender Kebab, fried dough, and calamari.  The meal also came with bread. It was an adequate meal for two folks.  What was disappointing is how cool all of our food seemed immediately when we got it.  I realize it was a cool evening (probably about 65-70), but to have the food be that cool when it arrives is a little disheartening.  The food was good, but nothing spectacular. The issue regarding the food is that the menu is pretty limiting.  Maybe a dozen or so small portions and eight entrees -- many of which are pretty similar. What did work well was the location, outside dining, and excellent service. The service was really top notch. Overall we were pleased with our time at Beyoglu, but not so much that I think I'll add it to our regular list of restaurants.
