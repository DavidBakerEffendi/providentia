I found a new favorite! I came here with some friends after work and it was awesome!.  First of all the Kitchen is open until 2am which was unbelievable.  I had the Lobster roll and it was perfect.  It was packed with large pieces of claw meat and the bun was perfectly toasted and buttery.  one of my friends had the Lobster mac and cheese which also tasted great.  It could have been a little hotter but it justa made it easier to eat it.  I predict this will be one of my new hangouts.  The food is great, the staff were super friendly and helpful and the prices were right!
