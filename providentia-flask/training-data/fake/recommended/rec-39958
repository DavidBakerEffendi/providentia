the savin rock area is known for its great food and the roasting company is a great addition.their slow roasted meats are available in a dinner or on a sandwich these include pastrami,corned beef,roast beef ,ham and turkey.,theyre all delicious ive also had the ny strip dinner which i would highly reccomend.im not a big seafood fan myself but have heard rave reviews.to add all the meals and sandwiches are reasonably priced.
