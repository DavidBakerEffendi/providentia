It was my husband b-day and we made a reservation for more than 15 people with a week advance! By Â the time we were at the restaurant we waited more than 1.5 hour to sit and after a lot of stress and discussion with maitre and host they placed us in a table for 10 ...but we were in 15 ....it was my better-half b-day and I felt very bad about the situation
