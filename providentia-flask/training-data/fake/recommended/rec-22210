This was my second outing to Caseus.  The first was a dinner date, and I was left with such a great impression that when my friend told me she'd be driving in to New Haven, I jumped on the chance to suggest Caseus for lunch.  My companion chose the 1/2 and 1/2 cheese and meat board (delish!!  can never go wrong with this choice!), and I tried the sausage special served over stewed cabbage (which tasted much better than it sounds).  I forgot what was in the sausage, but it was so yummy and savory that it could've been mystery meat for all I cared (the waitress listed off a host of ingredients in the sausage special and all I could remember was truffles).  There were moments in the meal where we just sat making guttural noises. The only problem with this particular experience was that the service was uncharacteristically slow...  It took 45 minutes or so for our food to arrive after we had been seated.  I was expecting the waitress to at least come by and mention something about the wait, but it seemed like she was avoiding us.  All I could think was "Are they slaughtering my sausage back there?" or  "They're probably aging your cheese as we speak." After the waitress brought out our food, the owner came out and apologized for the wait, explaining that a large group had put their order in just before us...  so to make amends, he discounted our meals -- exactly what a good business owner should do.
