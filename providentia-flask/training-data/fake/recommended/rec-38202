We just love this restaurant. Last night we had an awesome meal with friends. The manager Rich deserves a huge thank you for making my husband and friends night by showing them (tequila collectors) his cellar and fine tequilas. They are opening up a place in Fairfield and I can tell you, we will be there the minute it opens . Great food, great manager and great tequila. Thanks Rich!!!
