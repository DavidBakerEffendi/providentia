Lombardi's will always be a New York favorite. I came here with a friend 2 years ago and it was EXCELLENT. This time I brought my wife because I felt the need to expose her to its excellence. It did not disappoint. This time we got the Margherita pizza with spinach & pancetta. It was a winner. We got a small (which has 6 slices) which is more than enough for 2 people to share. The table next to us had a large (8 slices) and they finished theirs. I couldn't see how they could do it cause those slices aren't small...but good job. I know this place can get packed but fortunately when we got there at 12:30 on Black Friday it wasn't too bad. We were seated right away. Service was excellent and pizza came out really quick. Those guys are on it! The only thing about this place though is that it is cash only and pizzas aren't particularly cheap. Make sure you bring at least $40 to cover cost of pizza & tip.
