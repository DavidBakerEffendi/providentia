BEST CHINESE FOOD IN THE AREA.  Hands down!  Not a fan of the sweet stuff like Sesame Chicken, but everything else is amazing!   Highly recommend ordering Kung Pao Chinese Style. It is just the chicken, sauce and peanuts, no peppers or other veggies to get in the way of the amazing flavor. I order mine not spicy which they are always happy to do.
