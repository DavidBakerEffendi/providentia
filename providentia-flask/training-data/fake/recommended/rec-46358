Tiny, itty-bitty little tapas bar with about 10 tables and 6 seats at the bar, but a local favorite in Chelsea. GREAT sangria, that just kept coming out of that seemingly little jug! The chorizo sausage was spicy and rich, but the best plate we had were the ham croquetas. No joke, we got a second order, even though we weren't exactly starving. Crisp on the outside, smooth and creamy on the inside. 150% better than the ones at another tapas favorite (Sala 19) in NY. My mouth is actually watering as I write. This one is a winner.
