Is the ~2 hour wait worth it to get the best ramen in NY that your taste buds will thank you for? That's for you to decide. Soft boiled egg is a must. Cash only, ramen is on the pricier side ($15-18), and the chicken foi gras was not worth it. Thank goodness they take same day reservations for future visits.
