Halcyon's specialty is fish and on that front, they do very well. But what they do even better is provide great service to their guests. When I made my reservation and specified that one of the people would be eating vegan, they provided a separate menu for her and she was very pleased. Our waitress was poised and had obviously (and eagerly) studied the menu because every single question that came her way was answered quickly and in thorough detail with a clear awareness of all things culinary. Beyond her skills as a waitress, she was just a really down to earth, friendly person who made everyone enjoy their meal a little more than they may have without her as our waitress. As for the prices, I think they're just a tiny bit too high, but I suppose NYC is any restaurant in Montclair's stiffest competition.
