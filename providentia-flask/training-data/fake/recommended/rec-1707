Kinda pretty, mega-yuppie setting on Washington Square but that's about all. Food's just okay.  Mostly upset because we were seated near the bathroom during a time when the restaurant wasn't really all that crowded.  I paid $70 for brunch but listened to the toilet flushing the entire time I was in the restaurant... Had the ricotta doughnuts to start - we got 4 of them for $10 and they were not big enough to really taste anything.  Had the pancakes as the main meal and they were pretty tasty but, again, not a lot for $16.  Friend had the duck and said it was good.  I'll admit that it looked good but I don't eat ducks. Salted chocolate caramel pudding was okay but nothing to write home about. Honestly, this place is nothing like some of the other Starr restaurants I've been to in terms of the food.  You are paying mostly for the setting here.
