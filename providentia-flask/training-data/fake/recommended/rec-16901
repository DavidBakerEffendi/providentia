Came here for my sister's birthday party. Party of ten. After waiting for over an hour and thirty minutes (no exaggeration here) we were finally let in.  Mind you we were wondering about the open two tables in our view for a long time not being used. We were seated at the back and after thirty minutes we were told by manager that we were going to have to "rush it" because apparently our table would have to be moved because the floor would be opened for customers (I guess to walk around and for the band to play) No consideration. No manners. And absolutely no help if you weren't of the Irish Anglo blood, for there were cultural superiority complex exercised by the staff Never again will we come here. Food is rated the same as glorified Applebee's but more on the oily side and oh yeah very petite size. Service is poor Bathroom dirty If there ever was a Sunday Bloody Sunday revolt this would be high on my list.  Save your money and go elsewhere for better food drinks and service For anyone to give this place three stars or more is simply under the influence of alcohol. It's just not possible other than the decor everything else is sub par expectations. Illusion of grandeur to say the least. A Versailles that serves Mc Donald's!
