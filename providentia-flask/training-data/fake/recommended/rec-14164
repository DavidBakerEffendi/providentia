i miss ny brunch so much.  who can resist pancakes, egg benedicts, granola, french toast, and the list can go on. went to this place after a long night so be cautious when reading... i feel like this place is just an unpretentious, comfortable, and simple brunch place.  the interior is ridiculously cute; this place could easily harbor an adorable family of 4, dog and all.   food is solid. 13 bucks for TWO drinks (one can be alcoholic as an fyi...) and an entree.  can't get more affordable than that! we had the homemade granola and salmon poached egg.  the salmon poached egg was quite enjoyable...although the portion size is not all that big.  the fish tasted fresh and it was seasoned well.  the granola, i felt, could have tasted better if the yogurt was a little colder.  they give u a lot of berries tho! none of that melon crap.
