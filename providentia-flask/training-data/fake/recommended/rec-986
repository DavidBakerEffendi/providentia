What a great, fun, and relaxing atmosphere of an eatery!! A great selection of draft beers and a fun german beer hall inspired menu.  Didn't eat much when I went but loved the little mustard bar for the soft pretzels.  Will definately be going back to try wurst of some kind and the german potato salad.  And maybe some ping pong too. Tip - If you're looking for a little price savings/ food deals try happy hour or PhillyNerdNite (once a month during the week)
