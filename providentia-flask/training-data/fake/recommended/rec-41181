The original location is so much better. I came in here after work by myself, ready to eat my ramen and leave. I ordered the Akamaru Modern, which is what I always eat at the EV location. The ramen at this location did NOT taste good. I am Japanese and grew up in Hawaii so I know what good ramen broth is supposed to taste like. The broth here tasted very un-clean and left a bad aftertaste in my mouth. I don't know how to describe it but to say that the flavor was wrong; there was almost a metallic taste and too much fat. Ramen is not a healthy food and it needs some fat in the broth to make it taste delicious, but I had to wipe my mouth with my napkin after every bite here. I almost wanted to send it back to the kitchen, but I was too hungry and didn't want to wait for a new bowl. :( Later that evening I got a terrible stomachache and felt nauseous, and I'm pretty sure it was the ramen because I hadn't eaten anything else that day (which is why I was so hungry). It could be that this location is still working out kinks, but I will NEVER come back here. Why? When I left, the two hostess girls in the front did not even acknowledge me or say thank you and goodbye. They both made eye contact with me and then looked away without a word. In a Japanese restaurant, even if the food is bad, the service is ALWAYS supposed to be excellent. I was extremely offended by the rudeness of the hostesses and will not come back here.
