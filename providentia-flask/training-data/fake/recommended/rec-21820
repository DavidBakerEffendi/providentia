My boyfriend and I returned here to celebrate the warm weather. We had been here 3 times before when it was still named "GetFresh" and remembered loving the quiet, cozy back patio. We had a wonderful experience. We got the family style dinner, even though the description of it was somewhat mysterious. The waitress did warn us that it was going to be a lot of food, but we were surprised by just how much food there was! I think we must have gone through the whole menu! They wrapped up the majority of the last two dinner courses for us, and we have fairly big appetites! Every bite was delicious, and the staff was extremely attentive. The ingredients of each dish were described with story like detail, and everything was very fresh. I really appreciate the respect they give to each ingredients, particularly the reverence and respect for the meats. After the family supper, we did order the chocolate mousse with elderflower and raspberries to share. Dessert is not part of the supper menu, nor was it part of the prix fix menu back in the days of Get Fresh. I always think this is a little surprising, but I like that they're not pushing the sugar on their patrons.
