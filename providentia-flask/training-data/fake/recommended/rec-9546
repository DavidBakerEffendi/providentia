Good food but terrible service, especially the host girls. I went the restaurant Â around 9pm without reservation, but I saw there were plenty empty tables. One of host girl told me it would be 45 mins wait, I was about to leave, but there were 2 other customers walked in n asked if there r table available , n she YES! ........many things happened after I heard that. Good food but I ll never go back.
