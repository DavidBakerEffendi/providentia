1st visit here--have been to the other Callandra restaurants.  It's in the Best Western Executive Inn adjacent to the parking lot for the Callandra's Bakery(so in case you miss it pull into that lot as they are connected) When you are approaching their entrance you'll notice a bunch of loafs of bread which are complimentary. There were several small parties going on but my opentable.com reservations were honored within 10 mins of the time(5:30 on a Sunday). They give the usual plain bread but as other reviewers have mentioned they give a 5 large slice of mozarella stuffed with a buttery oil sauce.  Very tasty---ate 2 slices w/o trying but it is very filling so had to hold back having a 3rd. We both got choc martinis--not very chocolaty, average sweetness but both very strong & at $11 each not stingy on the liquor quotient for the price. Appetizer was calamari--cooked properly but unseasoned tasteless breading--asked for mild & hot marinara--pretty good consistency but the hot wasn't very hot.   Entrees were Filetto di Maiale(pork tenderloin) & pollo milanese.  The pork was pretty good but a couple of end pieces were very crunchy almost to the point of being unchewable(word?), masked potatoes & asparagus standard, portabella good, glaze should instead be a sauce as this type of preparation needs extra "liquid".  Chicken was very moist, breading not greasy in the slightes & instead of the salad my friend asked for fetuccine alfredo.  As other reviewers have mentioned the pasta done perfectly, sauce very good reminded me of home made. Got the Italian potates as a side but like the calmari they are NOT seasoned as advertised to bland though made well. For dessert we shared the zepollis pretty good as they are freshly made & shook in a bag brought tableside. Our server Andrea was very good, no lapses & answered questions w/o hesitation. So for two drinks, 1 appy, 2 entrees, 1 side & 1 dessert with tax/tip was $130 which is a bit high. I prefer to give a detailed rating as opposed to just saying I liked it or I didn't. For me I rate a restaurant in 4 categories in order of importance: Food Service Value Décor/ambience/misc If you're wondering why this is the order for me I rather have great food & so-so service than the other way around.  You can always plan around a slower evening to make it just as enjoyable but not around mediocre food whether it's fast or slow paced. My 3rd item I call value instead of price because based on the taste & serving portion of the item compared to similar items at other restaurants tells me if it's a good value.  For instance the best steak I've ever had to date runs about $44 but besides being delicious(a way to tell is it stands on its own w/o adding any sauces) it is boneless & about 24oz so you get two good meals. Food(2.0), service(1.5), value(1.0) & décor/ambience/misc(0.5) I then take the # stars for each category & multiply by the # in parentheses then divide by 5 to get my final rating. If the final average is exactly 1/2 I'll round up or down depending on other reviews. So my calculations are as follows: FOOD                                     3.5 x 2 = 7 SERVICE                               4.5 x 1.5 = 6.75 VALUE                                   3 x 1 =   3 AMBIENCE/OTHER             3 x .5 = 1.5 Total pts 18.25 divided by 5 = 3.65 which rounds to 4
