I absolutely love this spot!  Me and my friends have been coming here for about 2 years now for fantastic and authentic Mexican food and top notch Margaritas.  The servers are very friendly and there is a fun vibe with live music on weekend nights and free shots of tequila sometimes given by the owner who comes around to each table.  You may have to wait a while on busy weekend nights since this place is so popular but it is well worth it!
