Overall, I had a good experience here. Being from New Orleans, I know my southern food well and have a harsh eye for any restaurant in the NE that claims southern heritage. I had the jambalaya as a starter. The rice was undercooked, the texture a bit too wet, but it was well seasoned. The cheese sticks were an extreme disappointment though. They were cold pastry bread sticks for $7, not worth it at all. However, the osso buco did make the experience much better. It was fall apart tender, well braised, and paired well with the sides. The fish and chips were the special that "day" I went. And turns out a few days later, it was still the special of the day. It was good though: tender fish, and well breaded. However, portions were entirely too small. Rex, this is supposed to be a southern meal, not a plate from Le Bec Fin. Additionally the desert options were also varied and hardy. Definitely southern styled deserts but with a new American twist.
