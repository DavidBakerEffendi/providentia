Ugh, this place serves terrible food. And at terrible prices. Granted, if you want greasy food, you'll find plenty of it here, but it's not even good greasy food. If I want to give myself a heart attack, I want to at least get some delicious, sinful, gluttonous food before digging my early grave. Unfortunately, the food here just isn't worth it, in terms of calories, fat content, or money. Redeeming qualities: history and location. Yorkside's been around for a while now, and lots of people have fond memories of it. It's also got a killer location, right in the middle of downtown New Haven and close to Toad's, an epicenter of debauchery. But the location is a double-edged sword. Drunk people abound late at night (as if you'd go to Yorkside at any other time of day), and you risk sitting in human feces every time you go. Seriously, youtube "yorkside poop", and you'll see what I'm talking about.
