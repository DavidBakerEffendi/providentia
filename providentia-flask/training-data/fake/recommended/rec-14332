Didn't take a pic because we inhaled the dumplings. If you happen to be in Chinatown and want a quick cheap meal .. I would recommend coming here! I went with my boyfriend and we ordered one order of fried pork and chive dumplings for $1 and an order of boiled pork dumplings for $2.75. They gave 4 fried pork dumplings and 8 boiled dumplings. That was plenty for us! Beware that it's a very small shop that is incredible hot inside. I'm guessing from all the boiling and frying that goes on in the back. If you're all about hygiene .. Or maybe claustrophobic ...You may want to wait outside while your friend orders. But it is Chinatown were talking about. The dirty hole in the wall look defines pretty much all of Chinatown.
