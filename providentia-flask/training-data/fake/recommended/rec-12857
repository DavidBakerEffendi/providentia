AMAZING!!! This is what pizza is supposed to taste like and a real reason to live in NY. We had a half classic half fresca, which is like a margherita. The flavors were clean and heavenly. They had good beer on tap and in bottles and the ambiance is nice - looks like a ny institution. Our only complaint is that they put us in the back room which smelled a little too much like the kitchen - and half the kitchen was actually in the room. We'll definitely be back to try more dishes.
