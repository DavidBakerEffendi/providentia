One of my favorite restaurants because they don't hold back on the flavor.  It's authentic laos food, not watered down dishes.  I love love love the papaya salad and order it with the crab sauce.  There are pieces of crab shell in the dish; that's the real deal.  My second favorite is the rice salad, perfect blend of sour and sweetness.  The laab is better when it's spicy.  You must order sticky rice to compliment these dishes and eat it with your hands. I noticed the restaurant expanded and the decor has been updated.  I was happy they didn't change the menu.  Keep it tasty.  Keep it real.
