Yeah, that burger is that good.  For ~6 bucks, the Bistro burger is delicious!  Cooked to order, the meat is juicy (unless you ask for well done, but who would) and with a couple of small strips of bacon and a slice of cheese, the burger is heavenly.  Yes, perhaps the burger is a bit small, but for a 6 dollar burger tasting this good, I'm not complaining.  The fries are nothing to write home about though they do they job accompanying the main course.  Post a night of drinking in the village, this is a destination not to be skipped.  Eat great, even late!
