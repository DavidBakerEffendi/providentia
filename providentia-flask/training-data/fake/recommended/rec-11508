The food we ordered was poorly executed. The pulled chicken sandwich I ordered had over cooked chicken that tasted old. The flavors did not work together at all. It was unpleasant to eat not only due to flavor but texture too. Of course I was told the wait would only be 20 minutes and ended up waiting an hour. The biscuits tasted pretty good; I'm sure they were amazing when they were fresh. For a place with such high turnover I'm surprised they're serving anything but fresh biscuits. The orange marmalade served with the biscuits was great though. I think if you know what to order Northern Spy can be at least good. But I felt the menu was unimaginative and the dish I had was kind of gross.
