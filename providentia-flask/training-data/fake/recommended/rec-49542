Arrived for brunch at 11 AM on a Sunday. Good thing too because if I was any later there would not have been seating. The waitstaff was kind and courteous, but the atmosphere was loud and it was hard to make conversation without having to repeat yourself a few times. The food was good, but a little overpriced; however, the 5$ side of fries was gigantic and very worth the price. Overall, the experience was generally positive. But I don't understand why the place is always so packed when there are places just like it or more affordable at every corner.
