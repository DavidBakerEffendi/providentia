This place is so awesome and cute. The waiter was extremely friendly. I had the honey oolong tea which was fabulous. However, I liked my boyfriends silver needle? Tea. The black sesame brûlée was mouth watering and their macaroons are top notch. 5 people 5 teas + sesame brûlée + 2 chef assortment comes out to about $100
