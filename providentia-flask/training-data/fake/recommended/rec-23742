We went there as a family last week and I was definitely impressed with the food and the atmosphere.  As has been stated by others, the bread and the dipping oil are delicious!  The pizza was very good, light and crispy crust with generous toppings.  What spoiled it for us was the waitress.  Her attitude wasn't very good from the beginning and it only got worse as time went on.  We will probably go back again, but if she is still working there I will request that we be seated in a different section.  The other waitstaff that I could see seemed much more attentive to their tables than our waitress was to ours.
