Came here on a whim after looking up Italian Restaurants in Little Italy. Read a couple of reviews and I thought I would give this place a try. The food here overall was pretty good. We ordered the following: Portabello Mushrooms: Topped with cheese, prosciutto and drizzled with balsamic vinegar- This was very good. Rigatoni Alla Vodka- I thought this was perfect because the sauce was not too creamy and the sausage was delicious with the rigatoni. Fettucine Giovanni fresh fettucine with asparagus, prosciutto and sweet peppers in a light romano cheese sauce- Again, it was good because the sauce was not heavy, just right. The service was super friendly and attentive, the head waiter would check in at what seemd the perfect times to see that our needs were attended to. Overall a satisfying meal.
