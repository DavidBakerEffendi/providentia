For those days you really just want an excellent burger, with flavors that you explode in your mouth, I always come to Umami burger. Their burgers are just so perfectly delicious. Tender, flavorful (especially their signature truffle burger and duck burger - the two I've tried), and the right amount of messiness required for a burger. Although I'm from California, I never got around to Umami on the west coast, so when they opened a location here - where I relocated to - I was pretty psyched. It took me a little while to get crosstown to this location, but I'm glad I made the trek. The Duck burger - my first burger here - was amazeballs. Tender, and packed with so much flavor. Unfortunately the five spice flavor kind of overpowered for me - and as that's such a usual flavor in my household, I was kind of disappointed. I knew that it was the primary flavor, but I had still hoped that I would be able to taste the complementary chutney, some sweetness to overpower the strong star anise flavor. The Truffle burger however was more my style. Basically this ridiculously oily and decadent burger, it's perfect for me when I'm in the mood for a burger. It's gooey, meaty, cheesy and truffle-y. All good things. As the burger drips over your hands, it feels like a diner-y experience, yet there's food explosions in your mouth. My only issue is that the prices are ridiculous for a burger. Although the location is cute, and the service is wonderful, I sometimes can't stand how much a single burger is here. $13-15 a pop is a little insane for me. And also, I don't find the sides that great. I got the cheesy tater tots as per yelp's reviews at the time, but the tater tots were too mushy and just tasted generic. For that much - I think it was 9/10 dollars, I expected something more. Now I come here mostly for the takeway and that suits me just fine. I get my burger and can eat it at the nearby parks/squares. My guilty pleasure/splurge burger and the beautiful outdoors? Perfection.
