Each visit I make to Manhattan is packed with awesome friends sharing perfect nights out. Dinner at Blue Ribbon Brasserie didn't disappoint! I was staying in SoHo and was happy to be able to walk to dinner. I met a friend at the bar for a drink while we waited for the rest of our party to show up. I have to say, the only reason why I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of all 5 is due to neither of our cocktails being well made. My dirty martini was cleaner than if I had ordered it with a twist and I was in desperate need of a 7 o'clock cocktail after such a terrible flight. The host/manager was charming and provided us with just the right balance of attention and space. He left us alone while we waited but seated us in a flash as the two girlfriends we were waiting for met us at the bar. He and our server visited often enough to keep our wine and water glasses full. The four of us started out with a dozen oysters and the vegetable basket. The table agreed, these were possibly the best oysters we have ever had. I ordered the Shrimp Provencal. The cheese ravioli was sinfully, melt in your mouth good and went surprisingly well with the bottle of malbec we shared. There were two steak orders and a duck entree and zero bites left by the time our plates were cleared. When our server asked if we'd like dessert I explained that I was only in town for a few nights and wanted to roam around SoHo for a drink at lounge and dessert elsewhere so we could hit three spots in a night. Instead of pushing the menu, he laughed and told us to have fun tonight. When we asked for his favorite places in walking distance, he sent us to a truly perfect choice two blocks away. Thank you! Since I always end up staying in SoHo, I will definitely revisit.
