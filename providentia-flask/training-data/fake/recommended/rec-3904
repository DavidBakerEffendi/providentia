My boyfriend and I looooove Toms. Their cranberry and sweet corn pancakes are great, the huevos rancheros are pretty rocking, even the chili omlet I had last week was great. The decor makes me feel like I'm at a yard sale, the service is excellent too. Any time we wait for our food more than 5 minutes the manager brings us something yummy to munch on, like cookies or cinnamonbutter toast. They Â also make home made butters that are so yummy, and their chipolte mayo is something my boyfriend craves. Even when there is a line, the staff bring around cookies and coffee. *note* we've found going on Sunday mornings is leas crowded than Saturdays. But always worth any wait.
