I've tried this place twice. Once for delivery (quesadilla and steak sandwich, both huge and pretty good) and the second time as eat in on a very chilly day. Delivery took a bit of time but I can deal with that. The food was very good so I let it slide since I wasn't dying of starvation or anything. When I ate at the restaurant they seemed very understaffed. There were a few parties at the tables and a few at the bar but the bartender seemed overwhelmed. One beer on tap and it took forever to get refills. Their mixed drinks were also teenytiny. Granted, the phone was ringing off the hook with what I can only assume were phone orders. Remember that I mentioned that it was a very cold night? Â Even sitting at the second to last table we had to keep our jackets on to keep even remotely warm when every someone came in or out. Do you remember those aforementioned phone orders? That meant that man was in and out a lot. Again the food took a while, but this time I was starving. The penne vodka with chicken was good and enough for two meals which was nice but I'm not sure I'm going to eat in there anytime soon.
