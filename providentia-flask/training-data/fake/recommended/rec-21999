Coming from the Bay Area in California I was skeptical about how Vermont would stand up to the sushi on the west coast.  My husband and I stopped here for lunch yesterday prior to it being officially open.  They seated us at 11:15am and we were the first in. The service was polite.  We did order our entire meal in one query, but was specific on the order it came in: apps first, soup, salad, sushi.  Unfortunately, despite my request the waiter brought it out of order which did annoy me.  I also had to wait a long time to get refills on my drink. The ginger salad dressing was the best I've ever had and the food was wonderful in presentation and taste.  I will definitely return!
