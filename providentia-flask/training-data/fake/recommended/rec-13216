This place is awesome! It's good sober, drunk, and a great meal after the gym. I noticed the time listed on yelp says it's open from 7PM onwards but I did notice this cart open during the lunch hours. I'm not sure if it's just imagination but the food from the carts do taste fresher and better at night judging from my experience ordering it for lunch every now and then. But you can't lose here, it's a cheap, fulfilling, and manly meal filled with hordes of meat and awesome sauce. PS: Don't go crazy on the hot sauce, I'm a guy that can handle my spice but my god their hot sauce is potent
