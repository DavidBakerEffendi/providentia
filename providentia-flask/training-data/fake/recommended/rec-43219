DO NOT GO HERE. Food was NOT good at all. The restaurant was very dirty - the tables, blinds, restrooms. Everything there just felt so dirty and to top it off the food was awful. Not even okay, but awful that I couldn't even finish eating my meal. I prefer to eat at a japanese restaurant where Japanese people are making the food - not CHINESE people.
