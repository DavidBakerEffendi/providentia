Their Pambazo Mexican Sandwich is the best sandwich I ever had!!!! Chorizo and chicken together is perfect! If you like spicy food I suggest add a bit tabasco to enhance the flavor. If you are looking for something light and healthy, please try their layered shrimp and avocado, it is filling and delicious! Definitely will come back for more next time!!!
