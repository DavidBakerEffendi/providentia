Delicious Thai food and chill atmosphere! I will come back! Peanut sauce was delicious with chunks of peanuts throughout. Although a tad too oily for my taste, I very much enjoyed it. (I got the @ramma , veggies with peanut sauce, I added steamed tofu) Bf got beef pad Thai which he liked a lot too. We started with the fried calamari, which was very crispy served with a sweet chili sauce. The sauce was the star, I will choose a more unique app next time, as many other things on the menu sounded amazing.
