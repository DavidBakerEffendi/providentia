I've dined at In Riva about a dozen times. EVERY time I enjoy myself from the ambiance (both indoor and outdoor in the warmer months!), consistently amazing food, and most recently, the service! Last night my friend and I arrived right at 6pm when happy hour was just ending. TJ S was our server and immediately tended to us, asking if we'd like to get our drink orders in to take advantage of happy hour before it ended. He noticed we were waiting for someone and asked us if we'd like to order our friend's drink as well for the discount. As he gave us drinks, he also gave us the complimentary roasted chickpeas (aka CRACK!) and I whispered to my friend how delicious they were. Throughout our meal and excellent service, TJ S quietly put a small to-go container of chickpeas on the table for me! (Note: He did it quietly probably hoping I wouldn't post it on the internet as I'm sure the servers aren't supposed to do this but I couldn't resist sharing how he went above and beyond!) In addition, one of my friend's asked if they had mojitos and he replied "not on our menu, but for you we do!" It really makes a difference when people work to make the experience as diners very personal. Overall, the entire staff of bartenders/ servers/ and bussers do a great job of quickly and efficiently getting the orders in and on the table in a graceful and quick manner. It might seem like I'm gushing about what is to be expected of people working in the this business, but it's not often you find a place with consistently impecable service--but In Riva is one of those few places! Thanks, TJ S for the experience!
