Why isn't there more about this little gem tucked deep in the folds of East Falls? Don't go there for ambiance - don't go for fine dining. BUT get your own little group together, pull some tables together, order some pitchers of good fresh cold beer, eat some excellent basic bar food (turkey club, chix fingers, cheese steaks, fries, burgers and...yes...tuna fish salad) and actually TALK to each other. People may give you odd looks if you sit with friends and text and obsesively and check your iphone, but it's a friendly crowd on the whole, friendly staff mostly, and a great hang out.
