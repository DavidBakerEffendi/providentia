Took my family here on Father's Day for lunch.  Thought it would be a long wait but nope... 10-15 wait.   Had tried the pizza before but had to buy it for take-out.  So finally we decided to sit in and enjoy the pizza at the restaurant. We ordered a pitcher of rootbeer and one large (thin crust) pizza with meatballs and sauteed spinach with garlic.  We loved the pizza.  It was delicious! Only thing is $3 per topping? ummm... yeah that can get costly.   And they only take cash!? ugh. You have to at least try this place once.
