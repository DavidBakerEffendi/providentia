A vietnamese restaurant trying to front being upscale...right. I ordered the com tam, and it was actually pretty good. However, the cost of it was appalling. It was almost double the price of what you would normally get at any pho shop that offered rice dishes. If it wasn't for the pricing this would be a 3 or 4 star place, however, considering the price, it's just not worth it to even try imo. The service was also bad. We were literally left alone to our tools and then when we finally wanted the check we had to call them over even though there wasn't very many people around in the first place.
