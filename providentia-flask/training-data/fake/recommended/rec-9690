The food was great. The experience was so bad, the food can't make up for it. Clearly out for every buck. The service was so fast and rude. The room is so crowded you can't walk between the tables. Starter and main arrived together before our drinks. Â It was only 5:30. I can't imagine what prime time would be like. There are too many restaurants in New York to ever see the inside of this place again.
