It's an institution and should be visited at least once if you enjoy burgers so you can have your own opinion. Mine is this: It's not a very good burger. They broil the burgers and each of the 3 times i have gone mine has been overcooked. I just think that at the end of the day they are churing out waaaay to many burgers in such a tiny kitchen to be able to cook everyone's burger to perfection.  And if my burger is not cooked to med-rare perfection it is a waste of my time.   The bun is an afterthought and so are the fries. It's really no where even near the top 10 burgers you can get in the city. At the same time, you almost just HAVE to go once. Be the judge yourself. As an aside it is a cool spot to chill for a cheap beer... and i do enjoy the surly oldschool vibe.
