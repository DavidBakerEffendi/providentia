Food was delicious. Service was something less to be desired. Our server "Jesse" was ultimately very rude at the end of our meal. She blatantly asked us to tip her for her supposed "bad service." Word to the wise -- don't ever say anything negative until we have our credit cards back to write off your livelihood!
