March 22, 2014    Told the taxi to stop and let us out because I saw this place.  The windows out front where open, people where out on the patio and the bar was open.  It was like New York meets Cozumel... with better people watching!  We struck up conversations with the locals and ended up going out with a group of them!  Get the drink with the sugar cane and chips salsa guac was excellent!
