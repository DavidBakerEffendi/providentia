After so many French bistros in Vegas, and then expecting something even greater from one in NYC, I've now realized that a French bistro is a French bistro. Unless there is some spectacular dish you MUST try, they're all the same. My bf and I spent more than a half hour in a  can to find this place. After being seated and being rushed to order as their breakfast would be ending at 11:30a, I felt a sudden déjà vu. Like Bouchon, the atmosphere was as old worldly as ever. With the hustle and bustle of other diners and the baristas rushing to serve plates. I ordered the scrambled eggs with mushrooms and asparagus on a puff pastry. Let me tell you...I thought it was delicious! The simple combination was truly mind boggling. Fluffy eggs with fresh wild mushrooms and crisp asparagus atop a bed of flaky buttery puff pastry...Mmm Mmm mmmm! I am giving Balthazar 4 stars due to the preparation of the dish. Service was ok, not the very best but certainly passable. For anyone who has not frequented French bistros, Balthazar I would highly recommend.
