Off the beaten path, but completely worth it! Totally camouflage from the outside. Never would have known about it had my real estate agent not pointed it out! Really charming inside, but more importantly, DELICIOUS. Great service from Italian hosts and servers (or people that are paid to do a great impression), and varied menu (not just pizza). We kept it simple though because we were a lot of people and wanted to share - ended up getting Â a plain margarita and the one with the anchovies, which I was nervous about, but was savory and delicious. We were lucky to sit in their beautiful garden. check it out while the weather is still good!
