I love love love kona grill! In the summer I love to meet friends after work for a quick bite and drink during happy hour that starts at 9pm, strictly at 9 though! Recommend their pomegranate Cosmo, yum! Love the suhi, the balsamic pizza, everything! The menu ranges from 3.25 to 6 bucks for happy hour...not bad especially if u split it with friends! Please note! Happy hour does not exist on Sundays, made that mistake once! Don't forget to grab some jelly beans in the dessert dish on the way out!
