The burgers here are not what they use to be. They taste frozen like any regular hamburger joint, and are not worth the ten dollar price tag anymore. Customer service is horrible as well. The cashier caught an attitude  when I asked her about replacing a burger I had ordered medium rare that arrived well done. Got the replacement burger which arrived again well done again. I guess the chef was teaching me a lesson for complaining about the first burger. Did not even dare to ask for another replacement.  They also dumped my fries from the first burger I turned in and refused to give me another set. Will not return here ever again. Shitty service and shitty burger for ten dollars, not my idea of money well spent.
