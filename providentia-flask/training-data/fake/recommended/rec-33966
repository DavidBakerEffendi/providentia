A couple of my favorite coworkers brought me here for Birthday Celebration #IDontRemember.  Once I saw "half dozen clams or oysters and a glass of wine for $8" I knew this would become a favorite. On a Friday evening, this place is packed.  The bar is in the front, opposite a few tables, so the space is pretty tight.  Fortunately, my friends got there early, so we sat at the bar and waited (about an hour) for our table to be ready.  I had to resist staring the guys down until they got up and left, because they were taking their sweet time, and they had already paid for their meals. The oysters and clams (I had two specials) were fresh, and the house wine was pretty good, as well.  For the cost of one inexpensive drink, you get a half-dozen oysters or clams, and a glass of white or red house wine, and the wine is pretty good.  For the entree, I ordered mussels with fries on the side - "Fries on the Side" is actually a menu section.  They were excellent.  Since they don't bring bread, unless you pay extra for it, I ended up taking a lot of broth home with me (heck, I already have bread), cause I wasn't letting that go to waste.  Coworkers had an oyster roll (really tasty) and a tuna sandwish (I didn't have any, but I heard it was great). I will definitely come here again and again, but I think I'll shoot for a Tuesday the next time.
