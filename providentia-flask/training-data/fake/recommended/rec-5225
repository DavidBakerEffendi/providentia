I live in Philly, and I drive the four hours every Monday night to pick up a couple of Pepe's Pies.  Okay, that's not true...but the thought has crossed my mind.  For my money, it's the perfect pizza.  Thin crust that is crispy AND chewy.  Phenomenal sauce, the right amount of toppings and cooked in an ancient brick oven.   Long lines....check.  Surly servers.....check.  Cramped quarters....check.   Better pizza than Sally's and Modern (on same street in NH's Italian district)....check.  And that's saying something since Frank Sinatra would tell his driver in NYC to go up to Sally's to get a couple of pies.  Even Frank knew....best pizza in NYC is two hours north.   My wife, who is a big-time foodie says it's the best pizza she's ever had, so I felt vindicated after the one hour wait.   If you're on your way through Connecticut, take a few hours out and enjoy.   The white clam pizza is unconscionably good.
