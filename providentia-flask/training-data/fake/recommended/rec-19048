This place has great decor and the food is solid for a thai place that has plenty of competition in the area. The vibe is slightly more upscale and decent spot for a low maintenance date. The service is good but can be a bit slow bc its gets so busy and the narrow layout hinders people moving around, but I will hit this place again on occasion.
