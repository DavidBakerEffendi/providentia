This place was awesome . . . when they first opened. I have gone back and eaten here maybe once every year and the food taste has just been going down more and more every year. Had some family friends from asia in town who love to eat. Theyve heard about this place all the way from SE asia. One time they werein australia and tried eating at the momofuku there, but they couldnt get in. Anyway, we arrived here the night before on a thursday. They stated it was going to be an hour and a half wait. We tried to wait as long as we could, but we couldnt wait forever so we ate elsewhere. The next night we came back and only had to wait a half hour for a table. The company that we were with just wanted to have the best of the best of what they were known for. It says to ask for availability on the menu, but everyone we asked said that we had to order it online ahead of time for their famous pork and the duck. So instead we pretty much ordered everything that was on the menu. I was excited for a few dishes, but was disappointed, especially in the Uni, scallops, singapore noodles, spicy pork and rice cake. The softshell crab was just okay. We also got the fish, it was huge and it was better than most of the other things we ordered, but still nothing special. The steam bun and BBQ bun were good, but compared to how the steam bun was back when they first opened . . . Â it doesnt even compare. Service was good, people were friendly, our last dish took forever to come out and it wasn't even worth the wait. We didnt finish a lot of the food so i took it home. Usually i like left overs and i destroy them. But these left overs barely got touched and i ended up just trashing them. Hope the food gets better. This place just seems trendy and popular and thats what keeps them busy. im suprised the food isnt as good as it use to be. I hope next time i try it, its better than this time.
