Joya is perfect if you're looking for tasty, cheap Thai food - and quick. I used to live down the street from Joya. I'd call them to place an order for my favorite tofu green curry. By the time I'd bundled up for the cold and walked to the restaurant, my order would be waiting for me. Even in warm weather when I didn't lose time to bundling up, I rarely have had to wait longer than about 5 minutes if I had called in the order and walked over straight away. The green curry is deliciously spicy and flavorful. I'm a bit of a spice wimp, so those of you who love love love spice may not find it spicy enough. The portion seems big as I have a hard time finishing the entire serving of green curry and rice in one meal. It even gets more deliciously spicy upon reheating! Joya seems like quite the scene on weekends. Every time I walk by during a weekend dinner, it's PACKED with people. Love the full bar, but wish they took credit cards. Full bar and cash only don't seem to work well together.
