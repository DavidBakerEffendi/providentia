Hidden next to a giant Asian supermarket, one would easily walk pass this place if they're not specifically looking for it.  And once you find it and make your way inside, don't expect anything much more extravagant than a few make shift tables occupied most likely by locals and regulars.  But if you're here for the ambiance then you're missing the point to this place. People come here for the food and luckily the place can back it up.  Most dishes are under $10 and they offer a variety for you meat eaters and veg heads alike.  Personally if you're ordering individual sized meals, you can't go wrong with choosing a rice dish.  I've had the beef rendang and it was good.  The flavored well with the sweetness but a touch more spice would have been welcome.  The beef was probably one of the softest I've had without it being cooked to death.  Make sure you opt for the chicken rice rather than the white.  And you'll also notice a random surprise vegetable on the side.  Once I got lettuce, another time I got slices of cucumber. While it isn't the best Malaysian food to be had, it is however one of the best values with some authenticity to it.  I wouldn't suggests eating in, as most orders are to go anyway, but definitely worth the trip if you're in the neighborhood and want something tasty.
