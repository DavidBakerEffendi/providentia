Overhyped restaurant with ridiculous waits. It was a 2 hour wait on a Saturday night for 4 people. I really can't believe I waited for noodle soup but it was for a friend's birthday. Vegetarians, beware: all their ramen soups are pork based, broth and all. Their vegetarian soup is $14 and not even worth the money. The only thing that looked good was my friend's pork buns. I echo Pokei's comment about their bathroom- it was disgusting and smelly. Will never go back.
