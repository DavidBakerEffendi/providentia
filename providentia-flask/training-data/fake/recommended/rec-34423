Worth the wait.  I can't wait to return.  Same atmosphere and similar menu to Roberta's.  Both of these places have hit on a formula that simply works.  The restaurant is full of reclaimed artifacts from around Brooklyn with the custom brick oven as a center piece.  The pizza has light airy crust full of bubbles and charred just the right amount.   Good beers on tap....what else can you ask for?  See you again soon Paulie Gee!
