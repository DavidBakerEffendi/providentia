Visited in October 2013, ordered the gnocchi and lobster spaghetti special, both which were delicious and expertly cooked. Â Prices were very reasonable considering the quality and quantity of the food. Love the decor, hip but cosy at the same time. Excellent service without being intrusive, especially from the attentive restaurant manager. Still having dreams about that lobster! Visited this on the recommendation of Yelp and was not disappointed.
