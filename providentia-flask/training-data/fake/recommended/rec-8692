Food is amazing, like everyone else ... lots of food for the $$$!! A whole pan (feeds 4) for $11.00!!! Rice, Fries and whole chicken ... $11.00???? CRAZY but CRAZY GOOD!!! Love the place but the bald headed guy, I think is the owner (at least he came across that way to me) needs to quiet down and STAY IN THE BACK OFFICE! My advice to him ... stay the hell out of the front and count your money, your employees "Make" your business blossom and they don't need your nose in their work. *Hint- Hint. Â  *** Good job by the employes up front ***
