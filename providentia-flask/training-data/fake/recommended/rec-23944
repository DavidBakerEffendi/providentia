Osteria isn't a Michelin 3-star restaurant.  It doesn't have haute cuisine or tip-top service.  And it's not even the best Italian restaurant in the city!  (Vetri, maybe?)  But at Osteria, they make homey and rustic Italian cuisine.  They do it almost perfectly, and for that reason, this restaurant gets 5 Yelp stars in my book because so many other Italian restaurants are doing the same thing but not this good. This night we had several winners, from their pizzas to a special item not on the menu, which featured polenta with cheese and a braised red cabbage on top.  Divine.
