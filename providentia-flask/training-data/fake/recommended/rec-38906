I struggled with the star rating.  I have always enjoyed the food a lot, but like most of the reviews note, the service is actually pretty bad.   Last time I went we ordered off the alternative Szechuan/Cantonese menu  - half a duck and Szechuan style Gung Pao chicken.  Both were very tasty.      Four star food, two star service.  I figured this one deserved the food star rating.
