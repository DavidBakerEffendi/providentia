Every time I think about all the times I have ate here, I instantly start salivating. No joke. Everything they serve here is downright delicious. You actually need to come here with a game plan on how to maximize your experience eating all this delicious food. You also need to come in stretchy pants. Trick is to pace yourself and not be too greedy in piling on every single thing the server brings by at once. All you end up with is a huge plate filled with tons of cold meat that you probably won't finish. My favorite is their filet mignon wrapped in bacon. So good! Their pork chops are yummy too. Yes it is pricey to eat here, but it's all worth it. If you're a wimpy eater, don't come here and waste your money. I also came here during Restaurant Week where there was a cheaper deal for dinner. The only negative thing I would have to say is the fact that you have to pay for your soda refills, which to me is kinda lame. But I forgive you Fogo. Just keep the bacon-wrapped filet mignon coming :)
