So nice I had to come twice! The food here is like no other. I had the Spanish scramble and my boyfriend had the eggs Benedict. Everything is cooked to perfection and the service is quick. The only bad part is that due to limited seating the wait could reach up to 2 hours. Oh and it is cash only!!!!
