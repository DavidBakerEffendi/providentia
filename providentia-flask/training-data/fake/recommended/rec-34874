Was headed to a Broadway show that night, maybe Spamalot, I don't really remember, while in town from California and traveling on a tight budget, so I turned to Yelp for dinner suggestions.  It's a winner!  Never had anything like this before.  I mean, I've had burritos, and I've had Indian wraps, but nothing like these little pockets of deliciousness.  I had two - aloo masala and chicken - and can't really recommend one over another.  Both had a wonderful cilantro/mint  burst of flavor (but if you're one of those crazies who don't like cilantro, just have them hold the chutney).  My taste buds were begging for more, and I might've been able to submit at the risk of sitting through a Broadway show in a food coma, but time didn't allow.  I have been craving them ever since.  Get 'em while you can!
