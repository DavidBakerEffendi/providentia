This little restaurant is a gem. The services is fast and attentive (even at 11 pm on a Sunday night!) we were seated outside in a cute little table with candles. My bf and I ordered the duck breast and truffle gnocchi. My mouth is watering just thinking about it (we were vacationing in NYC 2 weeks ago, my memory cells only apply to culinary expereinces). The duck breast is sizable serving, around 8 oz worth of quacking beauty. It was cooked perfectly with crispy skin. It was served on a bed of spinach, potatoes and some delicious sauce (prob duck fat and wine reduction). Worth every penny. The truffle gnocchi was also an experience. The little treasures melts in your mouth and you can see tiny pieces of black truffle. I kid you not. the gnocchi was served with Gorgonzola and in cream sauce. It was transcendent. Â  Located in the upper east side, the price tag was not too outrageous. The neighborhood is safe and the bread was warm and savory. I cannot wait to go back to NYC again and UVA will be my first stop.
