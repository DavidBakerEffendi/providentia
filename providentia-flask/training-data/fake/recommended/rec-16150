Whenever I am down visiting friends in the city and the topic of discussion turns to "where should we go next?", if no one can agree my recommendation is always Uva.  Easy to find on the upper east side the dimly lit wine bar almost always has a great buzz going.  The nicely decorated space is on the narrow side and can get crowded so if you want dinner call in advance and make a ressie. Usually I get there when the dinner crowd has tapered off into bar-hoppers so I have only ate here once.  Just on that sample I can tell you that the pasta is homemade and properly cooked, it was Lent so I got the penne with tomatoes and porcini mushrooms.  This is a dish that will always taste good if it is made with fresh, honest ingredients, it was, so its safe to assume the rest of the menu follows suit. The true flame of this place, which calls to my inner moth, is the Zardetto Prosecco which lists for around $22 a bottle.  This is a good price not only for the city but for anywhere, only about a 75% markup from retail, not bad at all! Prosecco is an Italian sparkling wine which is on the dry side, not to be confused with Spumanti which is sweet with a low alcohol content (and which has probably caused too high a proportion of hangovers based on that fact).   Zardetto happens to be my favorite brand of this fine Italian nector.  If this isn't for you then ask any one of the bartenders or staff for their recommendations, everyone here is very knowledgeable about wine and more than happy to help.  One bartender here even gave me a tip for getting people to try Zardettos who don't usually like dry sparkling wine, ask for a measure of Fragolli poured in your glass.   This sweet strawberry liquor which  contains mini berries is always a hit with the ladies and men too! I don't personally get it but I always order a shot when I am with a group to offer to those who do.   Just a little touch that I am thankful I learned and owe credit to the wonderful staff at Uva. Thank you.
