So my colleague an myself are wandering aimlessly through Philadelphia, hoping to find a suitable place for food. We're doing the familiar zig-zag pattern of predators seeking pray. This one's too fancy, this one's too asian, this one's too closed, and then we run into Race Street Cafe. Looks OK from the outside, the price is right, it's crowded, let's do this one. As we walk in we are greeted by lots of eyes saying "what are these out-of-towners doing here? This is our place!" Which means, yeah, this is a cool place where the locals hang out, not one of the touristy cheesesteak places on South St. There were interesting beers on tap. There were interesting dishes on the menu. There were friendly and happy waitresses. There was good food coming out of the kitchen. Yeah, I'd say it's an all-round good experience. Sometimes I just get lucky!
