Was recommended to me by a friend, so made a reservation. They called to confirm a day before by phone and by text. Â We arrived and the streets were empty on a Sunday at 10am but once we opened the door, the place was packed! It smelled delicious! We were seated immediately, which I was surprised because i didn't see any empty tables. It seemed like most were locals. I had the quiche which was amazing and my husband had the brioche French toast! We also shared the home made donut. Everything was served, fast, hot and pretty as a picture? Oh and I forgot to say, everything was so amazingly mouth watering that we could not decide which meal was better! Everything was perfect! I will definitely go back again and recommend HIGHLY!
