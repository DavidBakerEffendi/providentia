I was excited to come to this venue with my compare as a holiday work dinner: good reviews, fun appetizing stuff on the menu! However, it was by far the most disappointing experience I have ever had. The waitstaff was not attentive to our table of eight AT ALL, and was incredibly rude. Water was never refilled, even after asking three times. On top of that, the main entrees were delivered at all different times.  Usually that is not a big deal, but one dish did not come out until about 40 minutes after the first.  I understand mistakes, but that is unforgivable. So disappointing as I was excited to come back with my boyfriend for brunch. I will never return.
