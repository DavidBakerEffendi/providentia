Cute spot, good food, inexpensive prices! It's a small space, that at peak times always has a wait. So, I'd suggest going on the early side like we did (6pm on a Friday) or in a small group (which we also did - just 2 of us). We shared the caprese salad special which was great. Then my friend got a pasta dish, which was so fresh, and the parmesan cheese they grated on top made me want to try some - looked so good! Then I had the mackerel dish, which was also good. The breadcrumbs made it a little dry, but it was still good.
