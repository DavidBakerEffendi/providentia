This place is across the street from my office, and I feel blessed just for that, haha. I've been to the Dead Rabbit a number of times for lunch downstairs in the taproom as well as specialty period-specific cocktails up in the parlour. The taproom offers the most "authentic" old-time bar experience despite the place not having been open a full year yet, and doesn't strive to have the most taps or the most wild beers, but I think it DOES have the most Irish whiskey. I don't like calling their bartenders just "bartenders", because they have the knowledge, skill, and experience of an artist, raconteur, and professional all together - there is no term for them. I've never had the beer in bottles from them although I see in other reviews that it's limited, but really... who goes to a bar like this to drink Bud Lite? The food is delicious, although the portions are a bit small. Perfect for lunch, but not quite making it for dinner. The Irish coffee is not only the best I've ever had, but perhaps the tastiest cocktail of any sort I've had anywhere, ever. The parlour upstairs (which you'll need to put your name in for at the door, and wait for an opening) serves the most amazing cocktails, punches, etc. Be warned though, they pack a mean punch (no pun intended). My girlfriend can't get enough of them, once when we hadn't visited for a little while she told me she had a "craving for period authentic artisan cocktails"... What monster have I created! The only real downside to this place is due to its newly found fame, they've won awards for Best New Bar, Best Cocktail Menu, Best Bartender, and the list goes on. That leads to not only people catching the subway downtown to visit, but reaches as far as across the Atlantic Ocean! This adds up to one thing: an impossibly crowded taproom at prime time, and a huge wait for the parlour. Best to get in early!
