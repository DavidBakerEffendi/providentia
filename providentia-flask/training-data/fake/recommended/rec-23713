Checked it out in an early afternoon for a late lunch. The decor was very sparkling, especially with the huge chandelier in the middle of their room. It looked more like a night club than a Thai restaurant. I certainly enjoyed that aspect of experience. In terms of food, their Thai ice tea is very yummy. We got their lunch special (entry with appetizer or soup.) The spring rolls are really good and the seafood pad Thai I get was just average. The pork chop my bf got is kinda salty and dry. I am giving a 3 star solely based on the lunch special but I would be willing to try their full menu again and see if maybe we just chose the wrong food to eat this time...
