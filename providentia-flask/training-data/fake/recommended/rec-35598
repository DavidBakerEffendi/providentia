First time in Philly, I just feel like I made the wrong restaurant choice, I sat at the bar, the service was mediocre the food versus quality versus prize don't make sense, I lived in Spain for seven years and it has nothing to do with Spain's culinary quality, the place is nice and has Â potential but $28 for two very small and salty lamp chops does not cut it, my bill was $70 no tax included for 3 beers a lamb chop and bad appetizer/tapas with stale bread, (One Person).
