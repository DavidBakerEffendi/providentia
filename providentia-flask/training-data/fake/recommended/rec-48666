My wife is celiac/hashimoto sufferer, so our dining choices are more difficult, we are visiting from California and heard about this place, holy crap what a gold mine, luckily we came when there was a seat for the 3 of us, on a rainy Saturday afternoon. Bread sticks amazing, risotto, pizza, meatballs, cake, Arnold Palmer was all ridiculously good, staff was cool as shit, I'd eat here daily.
