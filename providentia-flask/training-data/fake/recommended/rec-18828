stuffed myself on: pork buns ... you just have to get their pork buns if you ever go to any of the Momofuku restaurants. roast duck over rice with side of chive pancake--chive pancake I could've done without (wasn't a fan), but the duck's flavor was just mmmm damn.... it had sausage spices so it reminded me of sausage, but it's DUCK! When I go back, I'd order extra lettuce instead of the chive pancake to make wraps with from the roast duck over rice dish.
