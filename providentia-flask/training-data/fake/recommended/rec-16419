After reading a few of the reviews here I decided to head out and try something new. And boy am I glad I did! Its a small place, but they serve up some great dishes. Everything is baseball themed (the sizes on the menu). Service is fast. I ordered some Katsu (breaded pork) Curry and it was delicious. Pork was nice and consistent (no weird globs or anything like typical fast food meat) the curry was thick and spicy. The rice was so-so, a little low on salt and just a bit on the mushy side. And there was also a little bit of raw cabbage on this side, which was fresh and crispy. All pretty good for what it cost (got a "Single" size for $7.50)
