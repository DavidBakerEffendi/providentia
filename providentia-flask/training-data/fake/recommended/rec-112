I recently was at Adriana's for a funeral reception.  All the food was ordered ahead of time by my cousin, and it was great, truly delicious.   The calamari had a nice, crispy coating but was very tender. The broccoli rabe with sausage was the best I've had, ever.  The three-lettuce salad was fresh with tasty dressing.  The penne (with vodka sauce) was cooked perfectly: classic al dente. Best of all, the chicken Marsala and the sea bass were so good that I wish I had more room left to eat. I will return soon as a paying customer, now knowing how good this place is.
