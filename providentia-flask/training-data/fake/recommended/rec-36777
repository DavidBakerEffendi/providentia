Table for 4. Reservations for 6pm. Tuesday night. Being a HUGE french bistro fan...(having dined at Le Express, Pigalle, Pastis, Payard, Rive Gauche, Brasserie, Cafe Centro, Jubilee, L'Ecole, Steak Frites, AOC, & Florent) ..it was definetedly time to try BALTHAZAR. And I was impressed. We were seated right away, at a nice comfy table. Waitress was really nice and informative. It was pretty packed for a tuesday night, so always get a reservation. Now on to the food... Four things you must try when you go are: 1) Onion Soup Gratinee  - it is really really good. The cheese is plentiful and really is  perfect with the soup. The more you eat it, the better it gets.  I know, $11 for soup is a bit nuts, but worth it. Share with a friend! 2)Chicken Liver & Foie Gras Mousse - So creamy and delicious, served room temp with a frisee salad and toasted country bread. Better then the cold Liver Mousse at Le Express, but comparable to Jubilee's. 3) Escargot - they are served in the shell (which now i understand why there were toothpicks on the table). I was not able to fish it out with my mini fork, but delicious and the parsley butter garlic sauce is comparable to Le Express. Soak your bread in it! 4)The Duck Confit! --the Duck Confit is served with a mushroom sauce and a Frisee salad. Perfect way to cut the grease of the duck. It was a nice big duck leg and roasted perfectly. Skin was crunchy, meat was tender. yumyum. We also ordered the Seafood Ceviche (which is cooked calamari, prawns, crab in a lemon vinagrette) served on nice big Radicchio leaf. And the Seared Halibut entree. Though not memorable dishes..they were both decent. I am definetedly a fan. This place doesnt deserve 5 stars, because they are a bit overpriced for the food. But overall, excellent well prepared food. Out of my list above, this one is in the top 5.
