I loooove the mahi mahi tacos here, they are lightly breaded and cripsy, last time the quac was not as good as the previous one I loved that had tuna tartare with goat cheese.  Also love the tuna tostadas.  The menu seems to change frequently which is frustrating for an out of towner that wants something that was so good they must have it again.  The photo booth is fun and the bathroom is cool, if not disorienting.  When it come to El Vez it is what it is, and for the most part its a fun and tasty experience.
