M&m froho sooooo good. Good spot to just chill. The desserts here are really good.  Had a couple items off the breakfast menu and they were really good as well. Prices are fair.  Haven't been there for special occasions such as open Mic but they seem to have a lot of different events at night.  They also sell the infamous stuffed cupcakes from Nutley however I don't find them to be as fresh.  Overall, as I said earlier a good place to chill or just catch up in convo with someone...
