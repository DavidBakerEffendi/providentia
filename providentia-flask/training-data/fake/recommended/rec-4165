I love meat and there's nothing more American that a thick and juicy hot dog. This place instantly became a guilty pleasure. During the cold winters months, when I would reminisce about summer and picnics I would come here to enjoy not one but two hot dogs. I was a fan and still a fan but during my last visit, I was underwhelmed. I'm not sure if it was the bitter cold, snow on the ground, stale fries, or dry hot dog. This never happened before, I didn't feel like complaining, the place was kind of dead and maybe the ingredients may have just been sitting out. I am still rating this place 4 stars because I am a fan. It may have just been a fluke that I didn't enjoy it on my last visit but I will definitely be coming back. Don't let this review stop you from going because this place is really amazing. I cannot rave enough about how good it is but at times it's good to be honest about a bad experience. Don't be like me, if your fries are stale then say something. It's not their fault that I didn't say anything that's why I still tell my friends and you all to come here because it truly is delicious!
