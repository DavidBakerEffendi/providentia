We have been to Station twice since moving into the area.  The atmosohere is a little unspectular, but don't let it fool you.  For the price you pay, the food here is wonderful.  The staff is very nice.  The owner was even kind enough to sit down and talk to us for 5 minutes when he found out that we just moved into the area.  They have specials almost every night and what seems like a great activity lineup at the bar(including scategories on Weds and karaoke on Thurs).:  We are hoping to make Station our go to hangout and would love to see you there!!
