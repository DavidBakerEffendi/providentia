Prices are high here. Expect to pay $30+ before tip. Ate here a few times and have tried the following: New England Clam Chowder - $7 - about 1 cup of soup. Creaminess was just right. Could have used more flavor though. They use bacon instead of salted pork. A dish I wouldn't order again, but wouldn't mind it if I had to. Steamed Mussels - Forgot price - You pick red, white, or mustard sauce. Forgot what the white sauce was, but I picked the red one which tastes similar to marinara. Can't remember details, but mussels were very nice. Would order again. Day Boat Maine Sea Scallops - $30 - 7 pieces in not too buttery sauce, a wedge of lemon, parsley, and this cinnamon butter spread. I didn't really understand the cinnamon spread with the scallops. The cinnamon overpowers the scallops' subtle flavor in my opinion. Scallops seared on one side only. A good dish. Would order again. Chilean Sea Bass - Mixed Grill Special ($32) - I got it from the mixed grill special, so I would assume the portion size was smaller than the regular one which is $40. The portion size was ~5-6oz. Forgot the details, but It was delicious. Would order again. Atlantic Salmon - Mixed Grill Special ($32) - A dish I wouldn't order again, even if I had to. It was just too mediocre for me, and the fish could have been cooked more rare. Whole Greek Bronzini - Forgot price - Definitely would not recommend this to anyone. Â It's the whole fish either pan-fried or deep-fried, couldn't tell. Problem was the flavor was almost nonexistent. Garlic Mashed Potatoes - side dish - nothing special, a solid choice for a side Baked Sweet Potato - side dish - again, it's just a baked sweet potato. Good choice as well. They start you off w/ 2 packs of oyster crackers and 3 or 4 slices of bread. You can ask for more bread free of charge.
