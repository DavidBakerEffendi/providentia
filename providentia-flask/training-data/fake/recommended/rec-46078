I came here expecting the best pizza ever because of the tv shows and what not. Um, it isn't that great. trust being a new yorker there's definitely way better pizza out there. I mean don't get me wrong its good, but its not over the top i want to eat everyday pizza. i might go there again to give it another try, but i might not as well. i mean go, try it yourself but don't say i didn't warn you.
