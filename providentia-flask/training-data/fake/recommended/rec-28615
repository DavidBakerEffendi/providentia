I was in NY for 3 days a few weeks ago for a work conference and I had been dying to try out Hu Kitchen ever since I heard about it a year ago.  My boyfriend and I have been paleo for about a year and a half now and it is usually so hard to eat out because of it.   The first night we were in in NY, I demanded we go to Hu Kitchen for dinner.  We had no idea what we were doing and along came Angel.  He was such a big help and so friendly. He made us feel right home and explained everything so well! We ended up coming back for dinner every night we were there and then for breakfast on our last day! Every meal we ate out, was at Hu Kitchen! The food was simply amazing! Now if only there was a Hu Kitchen in LA.  What can we do to do persuade you to open one here and bring Angel with you to open it?!
