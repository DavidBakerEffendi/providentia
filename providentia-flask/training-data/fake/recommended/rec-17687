Bijan's is a lovely, unassuming cocktail bar-cum-cafe in a pretty unassuming and unexpected part of Downtown Brooklyn. It was a birthday drinks and more stop for us after a group archery session at Hidden Gem a few blocks away. The place was funky and hip, but in that totally acceptable New Brooklyn way. There's art all around, exposed brick walls, and a fireplace to cap it all off. It was the weekend of the big snowstorm, which probably kept a lot of folks home, but that SUnday night was nice and mellow. Only a couple of other tables were occupied in the early evening, and a large table was already set up for us. Cocktails were spot on, and all flat priced at $10. I tried the Bijan's--vodka with pineapple, mint, elderflower, and cayenne, a delicious elixir full of nice contrasts. Alas, a cocktail is a short-lived beverage, so I switched to beer thereafter (there's a few nice ones to pick). The food was also way above average. We started with some very tasty dips (the place has Iranian roots, after all). Then I moved on to a lamb burger with sweet potato fries (good carbs and whatnot!), both delicious. Others seemed please with the regular burger and other treats. Everyone was thrilled with the place, and I have Yelp and a squadron of savvy Brooklyn Yelpers to thank for it. Hope to be back sometime, this place is really wonderful.
