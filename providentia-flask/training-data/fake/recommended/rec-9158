I absolutely did NOT have a pleasant experience at this location. It was about 10:15PM when we arrived and we were famished after Fashion's Night Out (due to starving myself all day to look decent). The hostess told us that they're closing soon. Okay, cool. So don't seat us? She assured us that it was fine and she seated us. The waiter rushed us to the point where it was uncomfortable and stressful. We ordered our appetizers and entrees together and when the appetizers came out (curry puffs which were actually quite good) he told us it was last call for food or drink and if we want anything else we had to order it right then. This was about 15 minutes after walking in the door. We would have liked another drink but we would feel weird having two alcoholic beverages each on the table at once. Our entrees arrived while we were still eating our appetizers and half the table's food was incorrect. The waiter reluctantly snatched the dish up and ran it into the kitchen to be corrected. Meanwhile, I glared at my very sad, pale looking pad thai. It tasted every bit as sad and pale as it looked. Perhaps the blandest thing I've ever eaten in my life, their version of pad thai ranked among the worst I've had. This includes pad thai from Chinese takeout joints. While we were eating our entrees, they shut the music off, turned the lights up, and began mopping! The smell of cleaning fluid is not what you want while you're eating. How could they even think that this is acceptable?! So anyway, if you want to get treated like shit definitely eat here. If you want bland food, this place rocks! If you want to enjoy your evening, AVOID.
