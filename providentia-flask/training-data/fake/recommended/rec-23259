This cozy little venue gives the feeling of good fortune (and it is) that you've managed to wrangle a table because the experience is awesome. Like many places in Philly, it is BYOB, which I liked, and which allows young exciting chefs to open such innovative eateries. We had to-die-for oysters, Cobia, octopus, Sole, and Hamachi dishes that were so delicious that the moaning was a bit embarrassing, given the proximity to your neighbors. I told the chef that I wanted to swim in the broth for my sole dish and drink my way out. There was nothing "little" about this fish...
