This place is awesome. I was here recently for an event, and finally had the chance to experience all the good things I had been hearing. It's set up like a Chipotle, where you work your way down the line. The food is served on trays, which is a fun presentation. I had the Mac attack ( I think, maybe the Bear attack...IDK) but whatever it was, it was a pile of Mac N Cheese, cornbread, burnt ends (their name for the delicious crispy outer layers of meat) and Spicy BBQ Sauce. Mash this up with a side of coleslaw and honey butter and I ask you....WHERE IS THE BAD? (The answer to that, by the way, is NO WHERE....THERE IS NO BAD!) On a serious note, Bear's offers a selection of American style comfort food you may not have time to wait for on a traditional lunch hour. The cafeteria style of service makes it an easy and fast choice. I highly recommend that you check them out!
