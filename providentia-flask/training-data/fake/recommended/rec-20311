I've never been to Ireland, but I fell in love with an Irish girl once. I like to think that makes qualified in all things Irish. Molly's is a 'real' Irish Pub. Meaning, absent: the shots, the jocks, the bouncers, the televisions on every wall and the electronic jukebox. If you visit on a rainy evening you will have to settle for a low-lit cabin, sawdust on the floor, dusty framed pictures, a fireplace, and a bar where people mull over perfectly poured Guinness and glasses of Bushmills. It gets busy on the weekends, but this is New York, so either expect it or don't come. Your waitress: the short Irish grandmother you've always wished you had. Try out your gab, or just be straight, she won't mind, she's been doing this for a long time. The burger is thick and juicy with good char. The bun leaves a little to be desired but they toast it. Anywhere who doesn't toast the bun doesn't know. Fresh tomato, always red, cheese melted (my goto is swiss), skip the bacon they overcook it. Fries are crispy and a thickish cut, always hot. The sour pickle is always crunchy. The Guinness is the best pour in NY. They let it settle, the right way, meaning you have to wait. It comes creamy and smooth. The perfect temperature. If you don't like waiting for good things, go away. If New York was still populated by people who wanted to live here and were willing to put up with anything to do so, you could imagine Dylan Thomas straddled up on one of the bar stools arguing about poems. Come on a Tuesday night while it is raining, slide into a booth, drink one too many whiskey's and argue, grinning, with a good literary foe. Who would you choose; Pound of Elliott?
