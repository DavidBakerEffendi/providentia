Balthazar was everything I hoped it would be. Seriously, I would've given them five stars but we had an 8pm reservation and it took a while (20 minutes?) to get seated. Honestly though on a busy Saturday, this place was a well-oiled machine. My partner and I had been looking forward to this meal for weeks as we live in Boston and don't get down to NYC nearly as frequently we'd like. First, our server was EXCELLENT. I wish we remembered her name. She was attentive, funny and super knowledgable about the wine list and menu. I like to ask for recommendations on food and wine and she hit the nail on the head with each recommendation. The other service was excellent as well, from the hostess to the maître'd to the bussers. Everyone was fantastic.   Second, the food was superb. We had the escargot, duck confit and two (!) desserts. Everything was lovely. I can't say enough about this place not was loud, lively, with great food and incredible service. We might have to make this a regular stop on NY trips from here on out.
