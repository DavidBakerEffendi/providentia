Been going here for about 3 yrs now - mostly lunch time.  Food is usually good.  Stick w/ specials.  As I usually eat @ bar, since B-tenders take care of me ;) I've met some good peeps here that I now consider friends. Go for fish specials, sangria (if U like that) stay away from surf & turf.  Meat quality could be better. But this is a Portuguese joint - get fish. Good espresso & desserts too
