I know there is a way to give another 1/2 star but can't figure out how.  B-day and had seen this cozy place.  Easy-going husband trooped along.  I promised if there was a wait we would go elsewhere.  Friday night 6 pm got the last table.   Ate: Broccoli soup - never again Beets with goat cheese - would go back just to eat this dish.AMAZING Fried artichokes - delish but my guy was maybe allergic to something in the Fantastic sauce they served Cod - edible but a poor choice/ waitress should have stopped us Broccoli rabe with butter beans - best beans ever, rabe was bitter but well favored/ not my favorite ever Asked and we could substitute things next time.  Will go again. Great wait staff.  Not too pricey.  Adorable girl bartender who came around and sat with old lady eating alone and chatted. Should get another 1/2 a star.  Bread was excellent but should be warm.
