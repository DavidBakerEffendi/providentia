I am so stupid and worthless. When I made my maiden voyage to Taqueria Diana tonight, there was what appeared to be a loose line extending from the register onto the sidewalk - a man and woman lingered near the menu and register and then two or three young women stood behind them. Earbuds plugged in and too socially maladroit to simply ask the young women in front of me if they were waiting in line as they appeared to be, I just kind of stood behind them and squinted at the menu from the middle of the sidewalk. Some 20-30 seconds later I heard a commotion to my right and the girls in front of my started lifting up their arms in anticipation of hugs from an approaching group of girls and I realized that they weren't in line at all but rather waiting for those friends to show up before proceeding toward the register to order. Seeing this, I looked in front of the girls before me and noticed that the man and woman who had been standing there earlier were now 15 feet away at the register ordering and that what had once looked like a line was now an empty space in front of those not-in-line girls waiting for their friends and I can tell you right now, in all honesty, I had never been more embarrassed in the entire day. It was far worse than when I'd asked my doctor how he was doing and he said "good, and yourself?" and I responded with "I'm good, you?" If I think about this any longer I might cry. The tacos (al pastor and asada with guac) seemed kind of smallish at first glance but they were jam-packed with meat and super flavorful. I can't wait to go back and try the burrito the end.
