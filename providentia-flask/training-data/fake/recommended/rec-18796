Reading some of the other reviews makes you realize how many fussbudgets there are in New York City. :) Â This is a great place to meet someone casually in a warm environment and where you can talk. Slighly dark ambiance makes it a good first date place, good wine selection, excellent "finger foods" and light pizza. It's not a premiere wine bar and it's not a restaurant but a great, casual place where the two meet and a very nice, clean interior which serves a great purpose.
