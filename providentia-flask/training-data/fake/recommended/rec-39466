I won't go into too much detail of the horrific time there but just imagine this scenario: the waitress begged for more tip, she even followed us outside to reprimand my friends and I for not leaving her the tip that she wanted AND after speaking with the manager of Yuca Bar he did nothing, allowing me to believe he condones this behavior! My Advise: go somewhere else, the food and drinks aren't that amazing anyway. meh
