Returned to Village Whiskey yesterday for my 2nd visit there. Still as delicious are I remembered it. Went with the Lobster Mac to start, then capped it off with the $26 Whiskey King burger topped with Foie Gras. MmMmmmmm. That with some Duck Fat Fries on the side is all you need. Be prepared to wait though, because this place is TINY. There were 3 of us and they sat us at essentially a table for 2. I recommend going at an off-peak hour so you can enjoy your burger in peace. Not a huge whiskey drinker, but from the selection I saw, I'm sure it would tickle any big whiskey drinker's fancy.
