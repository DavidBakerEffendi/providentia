I'm delighted to have a sushi restaurant so close to home. It seems I'm usually crossing a bridge or going on an interstate of some kind to get my sushi fix of late. This is a beautiful spot first of all. Very sleek and elegant, but small and not even a bit pretentious. I would easily roll up here in jeans and a coffee-stained t-shirt or a dress without anyone batting an eye. We started with a seaweed salad which was different than what I'm used to. They give you three different types of seaweed, none of which were the typical green spaghetti-shaped variety. They wouldn't get a second try from me but I'm glad they offered me something different. On to the main event. The sushi was extremely fresh and a good portion for the price. My only complaint was the sushi construction. Each piece immediately fell apart when I picked it up. Not a biggie, but not a mark of a top-notch, hallelujah kind of sushi experience either. I will be back to Izumi for sure. Can't wait for the summer when the front of the restaurant will be open to the breeze off Passyunk Square's fountain. But I don't think Izumi will scratch my top-5 list of sushi spots either.
