Good food at a great price.  Really, really tasty noodles that you can tell are freshly handmade.  I went with a group of 7 people and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food--the only thing was that they were SOOO painfully and excruciatingly SLOW!   We sat and waited for 45 minutes before the food came.  Honestly, we wanted to ditch the food and leave.  This is Chinatown--nothing should ever take that long.  You drop the noodles in pre-made barrels of soups!  We got antsy and *hangry* and needed to get back to work, but the noodles were perfectly chewy and the broth was simple but delicious.  I wouldn't recommend coming here if you are in a hurry...as they hand-make the noodles for each order.
