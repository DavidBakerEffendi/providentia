After I wrote a review saying that Bartaco was good for apps/drinks, not really a dinner place, one of the managers sent me a message asking to give them another chance and they would send me a gift card for dinner.  I appreciated the offer and agreed to give it another try.  I gave the manager my address, and he never sent the gift card....
