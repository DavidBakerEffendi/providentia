Siggy's better than good food:) Perfect for the mismatched eating companions. Me - vegetarian and he- eats anything that moves. Or used to move. Both left feeling full and satisfied. Good selection for both of us. Started with a green juice and a fruit juice. Â Berry one was yummy. Green one would have benefited from a few minutes in the fridge but were both a good value. Quinoa and spinach cakes were lovely with a nice cilantro kick. I will be coming back for sure.
