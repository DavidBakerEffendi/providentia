This has got to be one of the worst italian meals of my life and I was so excited to go here b/c people I talked to just raved about the place. Food was underseasoned and the sauce tasted like it was overcooked and got the burnt stuff from the bottom of the pot. Service was extremely inattentive to our table and we had quite the bill going on so it would have been a nice tip for the waiter..his loss I guess. This place only gets a 2 b/c the tiramisu was amazing and the decoration inside it pretty interesting as well. Don't think I'll be returning anytime soon.
