I grew up in Princeton, and this is the hoagie sandwich place all the locals and cool PU students go to. Great eatz. My middle sissy always went for the roast beef hoagie (full please). However, once I had it, I HAD to have it, their Philly Cheese steak (full hoagie, yes please.) During the day, the lines aren't so bad.   Late at night, it will take some time. As a PDS alumna, every reunion we attend, we both feature HH hoagies as snack food and need to drive by for a fix. Parking is impossible, but drop a buddy off while one of you orders for the crew. Years ago, if memory serves me, Princeton University honored the man who owns the place.  Might not have given him an honorary degree.  Then again, maybe they did.  Greek blue collar folks, he nearly wept over the honor. Whilst at PDS, a new faculty did the hoagie run while we were rehearsing for the Winter Musical.  We gave him our money and written orders.  He went somewhere else which went out of business, "Because the lines were shorter."   Of course they were. Locally owned, great hoagies. Idiots who give this place a neggie review just want attention. This is a hole in the wall venue.  Clean, but no sit down.  It is ALL to go.   Those sliced cold cuts were cut today, maybe the last few hours because they do a land office business.
