I'm sad to give Atticus such a low review. The food that I've managed to be able to eat there has been good, and I'd like to eat there again. The problem is the service.  I've travelled here for business, and I dine alone at the counter. It is really hard to get served there. The first time was good since I came in during an off hour in the afternoon. Second time, someone had to go "get" my server when she felt sorry for my sitting there so long, and then the waitress was surly the entire time. Third time, I sat there for ten minutes and waitstaff were paused right in front of me, looking through me. If someone had offered me water or said anything that indicated that I existed for them, I would have waited longer.  I walked out.  I don't feel welcome there, and the whole experience makes me feel terrible.
