I loved Cafe Steinhof, which is where I met some friends for lunch today. The server sat our party even though we were incomplete. I felt badly when still 35 minutes later our fourth person was not there, but she was very cool with it and understandably explained that there is now a wait for tables so we need to order or move to the bar. We placed our orders and apologized. I had the avocado and tomato sandwich. More like guacamole- I thought it was going to be sliced avocado, but still delicious. Side of potatoes was a yummy touch. Friends had french toast, delicious coffees, and a veggie omelette. Will definitely be back for dinner or drinks! I would love to try some of their brews. Also love the way it's decorated. Adorable paintings and antiques cover the walls.
