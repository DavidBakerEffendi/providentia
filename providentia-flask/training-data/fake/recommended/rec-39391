Well, this was a pleasant surprise! Had the Chicken Francaise Roll $6.50 (it was HUGE) OMG it was so good. Then I got lemon sauce on the  side, to dip in, that was so good too.  Highly recommend.  Came for lunch, it took a little while but it was perfectly made and very fresh!   Great place to people watch as well, if you sit by the window!!
