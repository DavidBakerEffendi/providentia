Awesome. Yes. Awesome. Everything is great- outstanding food, good beer selection, good whiskey choices, and service couldn't get any better. What a great place for Greek/Mediterranean food, perfect for groups or for a date. I've been here a few times, and I've brought friends and family- everyone loves the food, service and ambiance.
