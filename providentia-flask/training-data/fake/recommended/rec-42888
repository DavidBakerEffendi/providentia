I visited on a Sunday afternoon thinking there won't be much of a line since all the neighboring offices are closed that day. I was wrong. I still waited about 20 mins. There's always a line because it's the BEST halal cart in NYC. Avoid all the other impostors around the area and look for the real Halal guys (they even have their own bright yellow t-shirts AND a facebook page!) Your mouth will come into contact with the best Halal food ever: saffron-scented rice, juicy (albeit salty) chicken, awesome gyro, a handful of crisp lettuce and warm pita bread.   The guy threw in 2 tubs of yogurt white sauce and 2 little packets of red sauce.  I asked him, "how spicy is the red sauce?"  Gravely he said, "VERY spicy." Well, my Middle Eastern co-worker is always bullshitting me, so I didn't take Mr. Halal guy seriously. I pour the hot sauce all over my food and started eating. Minutes later, my tongue was numb, my nose was running and my mouth was on fire!!! I finished two bottles of ice cold water and it still took awhile for the burning sensation to clear up.   BEST $6 lesson I've learned on this trip.
