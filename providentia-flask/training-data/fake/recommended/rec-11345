Awesome. The staff was super friendly and very informative. They have a very extensive wine list. I had the lobster crepes, and they where awesome. i was told by the bartender that they take 18 min to cook, as it is very delicate. They also brought out a wonderful complementary selection of bread with olive oil that had whole green and black olives in it, as well as some brucetta. very good. If i am in the area and in the mood for Italian, i will def return.
