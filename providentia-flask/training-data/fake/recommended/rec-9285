Eat here if you want a well prepared bowl of noodles or a rice dish with high quality fish. The soba and udon broth here is very strong but not overbearing. I recommend the tuna in garlic sauce over rice. The tuna melts in your mouth, and it is served with a small bowl of broth with enoki mushrooms. During late fall or winter, fresh, delicious Kumamoto oysters are available as an appetizer. All of this fantastic Japanese food also comes with an extensive Sake menu that features charts that describe the dryness and sweetness of each bottle of Sake featured.
