We were fortunate to read about chef Michael White and Osteria Morini in the Delta Sky Magazine when coming to New York and decided to try it. We were not disappointed. The fresh pastas were the best I have ever eaten anywhere. The duck breast with cherry sauce was succulent and not tough and dry like in so many other places I have tried it.  The cheeses, breads, wine and desserts were all excellent.  Although, I hardly know NY restaurants, I have been to NY maybe a dozen times and this has been my best dining experience here with the possible exception of a french restaurant whose name I no longer remember.
