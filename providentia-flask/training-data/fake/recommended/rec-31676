My husband and I tried the all you can eat lunch buffet during the week for $8.99.  We were pleased with the variety of tasty foods offered such as paneer, tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala, dal, rice, vegetables, and raita.  They had everything from appetizers and salad to desserts like kheer and a mango pudding.  The bread was very tasty as well that they brought out to our table.  We will definitely be back to try more!
