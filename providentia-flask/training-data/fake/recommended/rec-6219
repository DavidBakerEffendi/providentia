Decided to dine at ilili because of it's appearance on Adam Platt's new list of the top 101 restaurants in the city and hey, it was participating in Restaurant Week.  Met old coworkers at the bar an hour before our reservation to take full advantage of their happy hour specials and hey, who wants to stay at work past 5:30 anyway?  ilili deserves 5 stars for their Cocktails right off the bat.  I started with the "Gin bi Khiar", then tried (half) of my boyfriend's "Fresh Meadow", then settled on my favorite "From Beirut with Passion." On to the meal.  SO MUCH FOOD FOR RW! Unfortunately they were out of the shrimp appetizer.  Our waitress was really helpful in the beginning explaining the dishes to us and making suggestions, but she was kind of MIA for most of the meal (maybe it was obvious we didn't need anymore cocktails?)  My main dish "Semolina Gnocchi" was very unique and tasty.  But overall we just weren't blown away by the food and came to a group consensus on the 3 star overall rating at the end of our meal.  I would still come back for happy hour and maybe eat in the swanky lounge area.
