Just went there for the first time for lunch and had a great experience.  The service was excellent, the sushi was sp fresh warm and well prepared, the green tea was free, and the price was right!  Great deal for lunch included soup salad and two sushi rolls, all for $9.00 and 15% off on top of that.  We look forward to going again soon!
