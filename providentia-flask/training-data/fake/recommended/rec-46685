Went here based on reviews from other yelp-ers.   Okay, I'm vegetarian so that limited my choices a bit but the pasta I got was floating in an oily tomato sauce (arribiata).  Not so good as I've had better. More importantly, the place was LOUD... for some reason, this place carries a lot of noise and it was really hard to hold a conversation. I would head down the street to Porcini's instead.
