I was in town for the week, staying with a friend in the West Village, and I was surprised how few restaurants in the area were open during the week for breakfast before 11am. Cafe Cluny was open at 8am, and that's why I chose it. It's in a beautiful little corner space with lots of natural light and quirky but classic decor. Unpretentious. At 8:30am we were one of two other tables, so we had a quiet breakfast watching people on their way to work. Lovely. The coffee at Cluny is some of the best in NY, in my opinion (they brew La Colombe). They were so kind to give me a to-go cup of it after breakfast each morning (I ate there three days in a row). I started breakfast with a bowl of fresh berries topped with a dollop of lightly sweetened whipped cream. Then came the perfectly-folded three-egg omelet with Gruy√®re and slivers of ham. Instead of the potatoes, I got a small side salad with red lettuce lightly tossed in a vinaigrette. It was such a perfect meal, I had it three days in a row, and each day, it was uniformly delicious. Service was friendly and attentive, even on our final visit on Saturday morning when the place was very busy with brunchers. Charming, charming, charming.
