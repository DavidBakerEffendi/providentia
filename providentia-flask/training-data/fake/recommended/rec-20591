I was first recommended to try the icecream at this place by a friend and when my boyfriend and I went I was surprised. It's a cute little old fashioned, i wouldn't say restaurant, but it is. They have on one side chocolates and the other a bar to eat and in the back a bunch of booths. It seems that every time we go here there are a lot of teens, I guess its a cool hang out, especially since the staff consists of teens as well. Although this place isn't really anything special it has a homey appeal and it is guaranteed that whatever you get will satisfy you. Not once when I have been there have I felt a reason to complain. Also they have dusty road sundaes which you really don't see often. Score! The only thing that was a little strange are all the stuffed animals on the walls. I don't understand why they're there I don't know if they are even for sale but the place is cute and it has late hours. So I usually go at night for a homemade meal when nothing else is open and I would rather stay away from the fast food. I still reallyyyy want to try their chocolates but I know from experience how expensive home made chocolate is. Â But either way I recommend this place, there's no way you could be disappointed.
