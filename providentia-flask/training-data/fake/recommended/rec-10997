Great place to see the statue of liberty and have a beer.  The raw bar was great.  Top level was a real treat.  Saw a rainbow after a brief shower...how great is that!!!!!  The only real problem I had was the price.  VERY EXPENSIVE SEAFOOD!!!!  $14 FOR A DOZEN OYSTERS.  I'll be back...just after they tweak the menu prices a little bit.
