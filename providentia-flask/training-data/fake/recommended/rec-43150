Came in,  sign says "seat yourself" so we did.  Server came over and took our order,  then the bartender came over and told us we needed to move because we were at a table for 6 or more and "the games are in,  we need this table for people watching those". Understandable,  we'll move even though the other girl said nothing to us and we'd already ordered.  Food comes.  My companion ordered a chicken cheese steak,  ended up with a steak cheese steak. Server never comes back, so he eats it.  People next to us spend 3 minutes trying to flag down their server to get a check,  she drops it then he spends another several minutes calling out to her trying to get her to pick it up.  In the mean time,  a party of 4, one being a small child,  sits at the table we were moved from. No one says anything.  Cool.   Food is ok,  service sucks.  Considering all the other places to choose from in this area,  it's not surprising they aren't busy. Step up your standards for service and maybe your sales will increase. I should also mention that they aren't busy.  At all. Aaaaand,  just got our check.  They charged me $1 for red wine vinegar.  Really?  That's a regular condiment,  like ketchup or mustard.  Fail.
