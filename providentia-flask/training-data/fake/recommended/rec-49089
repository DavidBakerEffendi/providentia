This is the first place I ate at in NYC- and don't regret it! It set up my whole day to success. The only reason it gets 4 stars is because it was an hour wait (place is tiny), but I guess I can't complain if it was that good! The staff was friendly, up beat and fun. The manager made sure to talk to us and make sure everything was good- I appreciated it! Now the food, my bf claimed to have had the best Benedict ( w salmon)- that's says a lot trust me! Cocktails was good but not mind blowing, they had two specialty, I only had the Magdalena. Lastly, shout out to the bartender for the free shot, a shot of rye was given to everyone near the bar and staff- pretty cool and fun!
