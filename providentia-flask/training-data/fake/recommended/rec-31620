Bruno's pizzeria, how I love thee.  I've been eating here for 20 years, and still go back here for solid italian food.  The pizza's pretty good, but their marinara's the stuff to really die for.  My personal favorite thing to cover in it is their tortellini, but any of the pasta's good.  I also recommend the antipasto.  Quite yummy. Aside from just the flavor, the portions are generous and the staff is always more than cordial.  Prices are more than fair.  Well worth your time and the trip.
