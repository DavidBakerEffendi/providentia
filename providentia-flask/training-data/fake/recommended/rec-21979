I love halal guys and have always had a positive experience but tonight they were extremely rude and stingy when I asked for one extra sauce when I bought two platters. The guy yelled at my friends saying "I already gave you sauce and if you put in extra from the bottles then give back the ones I gave you." Wow I won't go back to that particular corner cart. They were always so friendly and nice! What happened?!
