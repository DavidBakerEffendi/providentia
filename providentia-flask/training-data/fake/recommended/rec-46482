A bit of a dissapointment.  The appetizer (BLT ravioli) was really amazing.  Interesting flavors, cooked perfectly- it was a real treat.  But my entree was a dissapointment.  I got the scallops and not only did I get some sand, but one of my "potato" scallops was under done.  But actually, it was burnt on the bottom, so it looked like they just flipped it over to hide it.  So between that and the sandy scallop, I was not impressed.  I would have sent it back but the sandy scallop was the last thing I ate.  The service was good and the atmosphere was great, but I think the 2 cooking errors were a bit novice for a restaurant of this caliber.
