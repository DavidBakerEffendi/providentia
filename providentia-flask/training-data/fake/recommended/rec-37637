As pretty much everyone has said...really, really tasty fried chicken! It's a small restaurant, and there was a wait for 4 people even on a Wednesday night, but the atmosphere and service were both very pleasant. The chicken is awesome, though it's key to realize that the "Hot Chicken" isn't necessarily hot (it's a choice of Regular, Hot or Extra Hot), and that regardless you will get a giant bottle of delicious, vinegary hot sauce. The Hot/Extra Hot is basically just cayenne sprinkled on the already-fried chicken, so my personal recommendation is to get the Regular chicken and go wild with the hot sauce. Fried green tomatoes are awesome, and the mac & cheese and coleslaw are both really good sides. I thought the collard greens and fried grits were a bit bland, but everything else was awesome and I will definitely be back!
