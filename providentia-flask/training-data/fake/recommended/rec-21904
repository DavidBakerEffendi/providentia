awesome food.  the wait stinks if you go during a peak hour/night... especially on weekends, but if you are in the mood for sushi, it's really the best around!  i wish they would expand their restaurant or build another location!  they're always busy so why not open one on the other side of town or park ave, there's so many open spaces on park ave right, now!  please nizi :)
