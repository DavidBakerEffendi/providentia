Little Owl is like a hidden gem - it feels off the beaten path and the tiny, very cozy space makes you feel like you know something no one else does.  I love that feeling.   it certainly doesn't hurt that the food is excellent.  Interesting combinations without being annoyingly fused or schizophrenic.  Last night, I had the ricotta cavatelli and the halibut.  Both were amazing.   Everyone who works there has always been exceedingly friendly and makes you feel very much at home.  Whether you live in the neighborhood or are in town visiting, Little Owl is a must try.
