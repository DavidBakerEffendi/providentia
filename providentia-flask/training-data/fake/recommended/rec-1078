This is a trendy Mexican restaurant.  I'm originally from the West (where Mexican food is a staple), so I have mixed feelings about charging that much for classic Mexican dishes at a trendy place...  However, El Vez has a really great atmosphere, and the food is also delicious.  It's difficult to get really great Mexican food on the East Coast, and this place offers classic dishes with inspired twists to them.  I enjoyed the pork and fish tacos for my entree.  The guacamole and salsa appetizers were also delicious.  The Margaritas yummy.  The atmosphere was lively and fun, and the food was great.  In sum, El Vez is expensive for a traditional Mexican restaurant, but it doesn't fit that description.  This is "inspired" (New American) Mexican and Southwest food.  So, come here for fun experience!
