Took a ride from Monmouth county to give rats a try on a Thursday evening with a 5:30 reservation.  As we neared the area, it was clear that  sculptures were a big deal there.  They were everywhere! The restaurant itself was on a large piece of property that i would call a sculpture park.  Parking was limited and we had to park on the access road.  As soon as you walk up to the restaurant you feel like you're walking into another world.  The structure is unique as is the interior. Lots of wood and kind of dark inside.  They had very strange tableware.  When we sat down, I looked out the window and saw that there was outside seating.  If I knew about it, I would have reserved.  If you go and the weather is nice, I would recommend it.  What a cool view! Since it was a thursday night, there was a prix fixe menu priced at $39 pp.  the price actually included admission into the sculpture park, so let's call dinner $33 pp.  you had a choice of soup or salad for starters. You had a choice of short ribs, chicken, trout and mussels for an entree and your choice of three deserts.  I found the food to be fair. I had the short ribs, which although cooked correctly, lacked flavor. the portion was not very big either.  I thought it was strange that the ribs were served with French fries and ketchup.  I would have preferred rice, potatoes or pasta.  The service was truly outstanding.  The waitstaff was proficient and professional.  After dinner they gave us wristbands for the sculpture park.  Although it had gotten kind of dark, the walk around the grounds was great.  If you are a photographer, def bring your camera.  Lots of photo ops.  We stopped at a gazebo where they gave out free gelato.  Although I didn't find the food to be up to par, I have to say the overall experience made our visit worth it.
