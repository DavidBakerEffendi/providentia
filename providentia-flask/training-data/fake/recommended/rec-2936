We came here for lunch but we did not have enough time for the lunch deal so we ordered some soup and the steamed dumplings and spring rolls. The staff is friendly and the food was out pretty quickly but unfortunately it wasn't that good. Yeah there was a lot of garlic but the actual food fell short of my expectations. I am giving three stars because we did not try their entrees and who knows maybe they're amazing. If I were to base this strictly on the food I got today I would give two stars but it seems unjust to judge only by appetizers. Â This place is cash only.
