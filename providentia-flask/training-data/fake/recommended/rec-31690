I was attending a trade show just up the street on 10th Avenue and needed to find a place to take a colleague.  This turned out to be the perfect place.  A hidden GEM on 10th Avenue.  I made a reservation, which was a smart move since the place filled up shortly after we arrived at 8pm.  The space was charming, warm and cozy.  Not what you would expect for the area. I have to start by saying our server Natalia (who single handedly waited on the whole place) was the best!!  Without totally gushing about her, I will simply say that she was very engaging, and her enticing manner drew you in as she told you the specials, she made all good recommendations for food and wine and she was thoughtful enough to have our food split in advance since my friend and I were sharing.   Worth a mention is the cocktail list was quite interesting as well.  I had the Macenudo which was crisp, citrusy and tart.  Delish! Now to the food!  We had the burrata and octopus appetizers.  Both were absolutey delicious.  My friend and I also shared the whole fileted bronzini and also the rigatoni with chorizo.  Again, terrific dishes.  Perfectly executed.  Our other friend got the pasta with mushrooms and that looked great as well. We were too full for dessert so we opted for a sparkling dessert wine which the perfect ending to a delicious meal.  I would definitely go back here again.
