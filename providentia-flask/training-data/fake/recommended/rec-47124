Recently brunched at this popular, charming spot in South Philly near the Italian Market.  Traditional menu with light international accents, and an emphasis on fresh.  Enjoyed a tasty, shockingly massive egg white frittata, with turkey bacon, spinach, and provolone, accompanied by yummy, colorful sweet potato french fries (I recommend trying them with and without ketchup, and seeing what you prefer -- I couldn't make up my mind).  A "tolerant" BYOB policy had us enjoying self-made screwdrivers and later snatching an unfinished bottle of champagne (!!!) left at a neighboring table (tres gauche, I admit).  Sabrina's cafe is much like that homey brunch spot in, say, SF or Brooklyn that calls you back again and again, and sits at the top of your "must" list for out-of-town guests.  A treat.
