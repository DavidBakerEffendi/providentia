There must be some sort of ramen-crack in Ippudo's broth. It's addictive, just salty enough! I came here a lot for winter comfort food. All their broth is flavored with meat, so definitely not a place for vegetarian. Their ramen portions are generous, and you can order extra toppings or noodles. For lunch, they have huge sets. Like most Japanese restaurants, substitutes are not allowed. Their prices are a few bucks pricier than other surrounding ramen shops. But it is well worth it. The area is nice and spacious. However the bar in the front is very removed from the dining area and quite cluttered since that is also the waiting area. There are private dining tables, but also communal tables and bar seating.
