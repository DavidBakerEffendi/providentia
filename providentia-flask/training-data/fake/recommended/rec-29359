Now granted I've only had Geno's in Philly, and here on california i've had philly's best and a few others. I consider myself an amateur foodie. I know a good sandwich one I taste one. Dalessandro's Steaks blew me away, although I was iffy as I walked in and saw a big pile of meat on the grill, I let the sandwich do the talking. This place puts Geno's to shame, after eating here and at Geno's then here again, I felt like Geno's could be one of those frozen cheesesteaks found in the frozen aisle at your local grocery. So give it a chance! You'll be surprised!!
