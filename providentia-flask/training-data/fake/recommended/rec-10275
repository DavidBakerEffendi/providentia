Missing on the basics!   Dined during Ct Restaurant week  - their menu published on line promoted CT wines as part of this week long event  Unfortunately neither were actually available- rather some inexpensive generic Chilean cab/malbec blend was what was being offered - definite bait and switch   The chicken parm meatballs were just ok - nothing really special  In contrast the pumpkin / crab bisk was very good   Our waitress was absent during service - bread came 20 mins after the apps - and then rationed to 1 thin slice per person   The entrees- Fettucine Carbonara,Pork Osso Buco, and Steak Diane were also very good  - freshly graded parmesan cheese was not offered until several mins after being served   Expressos are served in a funky styled cup but lacked the traditional lemon rind   Parking can be challenging - you have Pratt street or a handful of spots on Main St - surprising Sorella does not offer valet parking   To sum up - food is good overall  - service needs work - promoted wines should be offered
