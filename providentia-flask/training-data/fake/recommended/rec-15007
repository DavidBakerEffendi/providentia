Wow, wow, wow. I have been thoroughly impressed by this place. I've never had this type of food, so I thought it would be fun to try something new. The wait was about half an hour but it was well worth it. I started out with Tako Wasa which is raw octopus marinated in wasabi sauce. It was delicious! The octopus was extremely fresh and complimented the spiciness. It was a very light but flavorful dish and a great way to start out the meal. Our waiter was really nice and I asked him to pick out a selection of skewers for me. I told him to surprise me and that I was fine with anything. I'm not exactly sure of what everything was that he brought me, but I'll try to list what I remember. Hatsu (heart)- Super tender and very tasty. Nankotsu Tsukune (meatball)- I could have eaten a couple more of these, it was so yummy! Kuruma Ebi (prawn)- Tasted like butter. Chicken Oyster-Really delicious. Harami (Skirt Steak)- I would definitely order this again because it was very flavorful and tender. Hokuhoku Garlic (grilled garlic)- The garlic was very sweet and good but I was afraid to get too close to people later in the evening. As far as drinks, they had a wide selection of sake. My dad let the waiter pick one for him and he thought it was really good (although I don't know how much of a sake expert he is). For dessert I had green tea ice cream, which was the perfect ending to the meal. Overall, I walked out feeling like I had gotten to taste a lot of different flavors, but I didn't feel overly full. It was just the right amount of food. I loved eating here because they had some unusual foods that you wouldn't normally find. It was a completely new experience for me and I hope I can come back again.
