If we could give O stars .. that would be our choice. This place is DISGUSTING! The men taking the orders were SO SO SO SO SOOOO rude! Know what you want before you go and order, as they rush you out of line. Cheesesteaks are about $10 each .. not worth it. My fiance's bread was soaked and the meat was so dry. When he went to pick up his cheesesteak, it all fell apart. When we sat down we had flies EVERYWHERE! It was so disgusting!!! They store the garbage in the back by the tables and the top of the walls are semi opened... flies were all over. NEVER EVER AGAIN! Next time we are in the area we are going to try Gino's which is across the street. Looks a lot cleaner and nicer.
