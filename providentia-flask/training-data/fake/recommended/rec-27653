deee-lish.  unique flavors and super good service by some fun young guys who looked like they were having as much fun at work as we were eating at momofuku ssam. since the speciality of the house is pork, my friend deb & i had to go whole hog on pork for this meal!  we started with the steamed buns (excellent) and also had the signature Momofuku Ssam.  Everything was full of flavor.   We also tried a sparkling shiraz which was fun and funky and really tasty.   definitely a fan.  will be back.
