One of my favorite date spots in all of New York, 'Next Door' (the basement dinner lounge space at La Lanterna) is warm, cozy, dark, and wonderful.  The pizzas are great, the desserts wonderful, the coffee done properly, and the service is consistently sufficient. In the wintertime it's awesome to go in late and drink coffee and wine and snuggle against the snowfall.  Everything about this place is comfy.
