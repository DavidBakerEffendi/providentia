I simply can't imagine a better value or more enjoyable dining experience in New York City.  The quality of the food is always amazing - I had the swordfish tonight, which I ordered because I never like swordfish, and it was freakin' amazing - meaty and delish and flaky and rich.  I tried the duck wings to start (unbelievable) and the carrot cake bread pudding to finish - autumnal and not too sweet or heavy.  And on top of that all, the service is unbelievable - we had late reservations tonight and were there 30 minutes after everyone else, and they didn't make us feel bad the way every other restaurant might.  Totally courteous, informed and chill.  Can't wait to come back.
