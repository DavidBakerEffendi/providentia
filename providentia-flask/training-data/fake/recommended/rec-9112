Because this place has been reviewed over 200 times, I'll keep it brief. DUCK CLUB! My favorite food item in the world. No joke. No exaggeration. I think if I had to eat one thing for every remaining meal of my life, this would be it. At first I thought it was the allure and the 3am seating, but no. NO WAY. I love this sandwich. I would make love to this sandwich if socially acceptable. Raisin bread, tons of sliced roasted duck seasoned with five spice I think, BACON. It's divine. And it makes me feel like a total snob when I order it for take out :) Cons: Pricey, crowded.
