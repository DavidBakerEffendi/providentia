Came here with a party of 6 on a Sunday morning for brunch. The waitress messed up 3 out of 6 dishes and the food was so-so. Â Didn't have a great experience and there are other great brunch spots in the EV that give you better quality food and service for the same $$. I would stick to this place for happy hour drinks and tapas.
