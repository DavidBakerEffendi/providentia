Had a very good meal once before  and went back this past weekend.  It was Dartmouth graduation and they were very busy but 40 minutes to get a bottle of wine  and over an hour for a very mediocre meal.  Very disappointing.  They were very, very  nice and seemed to be working hard but not much seemed to work.  I would give it another chance based on my first visit and hope it was just a very bad night.
