I absolutely love this place. It has definitely brought me back to life after an intense night of dancing, drinking or whatever. Cash only, buy has an ATM on site. There will be a line but it is worth it... Plus you get fed while waiting on line. I've had orange slices, French fries, whip cream covered strawberries even coffee at times! The place is a little on the smaller side but has a homey/cozy feel. Side note they move quickly so do not leave your leftovers by accident... by the time you leave the front door, remember and turn back to get it the table has been cleared and your leftovers have been thrown :(
