We went because of the great Yelp reviews, and I can't give it 1 start cause I didn't even stay to try the food.  Their menu has mexi-latin items that are supposed to included Guacamole, but the server said they don't have any. I did try the chips.  They were good.  The sauce was made partially out of ketchup, so it was so-so.  I left very confused.
