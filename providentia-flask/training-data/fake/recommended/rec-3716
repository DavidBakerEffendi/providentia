The appeal of this restaurant is equal parts old school and very satisfying meals. My friends and I went one morning with some brutal hangovers and the food there did just the trick. As people who love to share our meals, I tried three different dishes, all of which were very good. I had the corned beef hash with home fries. It was ginormous and corned beef hash was excellent. One friend got the crab cakes with an AMAZING hot sauce. If you order this dish, make sure you get that on the side! Another friend got the huevos rancheros, which were pretty standard. Of course, they were not as good as the ones I get on vacation in NM and AZ, but for east coast huevos, they cut the mustard. The service here is great! Very quick and not overly attendant. Water and coffee never went empty.
