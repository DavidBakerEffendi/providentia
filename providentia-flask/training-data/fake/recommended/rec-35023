This place is my absolute favorite Thai restaurant! Cute decor, ambiance is mellow, and the staff is amazing. They're attentive and very friendly. The owner, Mama greets everyone and makes sure you're enjoying your dine-in experience. I know Pad Thai is a standard dish at every Thai restaurant, but Topaz really does knock it out of the park. I try not to finish the pad thai whenever I order it but I can't help it; I devour the entire dish every time! I've also had their curries and other noodle dishes and they are pretty tasty as well. Consistently good experience every time I eat here or get takeout!
