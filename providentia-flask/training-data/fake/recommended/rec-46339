I'm not a good critic of restaurants, so I'll keep this brief.  We dined here for our 30th anniversary earlier this week.  The atmosphere was laid back yet sophisticated.  The service was attentive, yet not pestering, and the food was creative and tasty.  We both chose the tasting menu, and we were allowed a substitution, which is always nice. Bring your sense of humor (or maybe irony) because they throw in some simple items like potato chips, popcorn, and fried pork skins, but refer to them by names that make them sound like rare gourmet delicacies.  I don't think they're trying to fool anyone, because we all know popcorn when we see it.  I think it added a dash of whimsy to the meal, and those items were used very sparingly. We're not from New York, so there was a bit of sticker shock, but it was the only 30th anniversary we'll ever have, so the price was inconsequential compared to the value.
