After seeing a comedy show on broadway, we walked up here for a Gyro based on favorable Yelp recommendations. The Gyro sandwich was one of the best I have ever had. The meat was flavorful and juicy. The sauce was creamy and garlicy. The pita bread was warm and soft. My husband complained that there were Â no onions, but for me it was perfect.
