As if I couldn't love this restaurant even more... Public goes and wins me over with their fantastic brunch. The deal is great - $22 for any brunch item on the menu + cocktail + coffee or tea. I had the passionfruit orange mimosa... if it weren't noon on a Sunday, I could have proceeded to have 5 more glasses. The banana stuffed french toast I ordered was delicious. The toast was perfect - the edges were slightly crunchy, while the rest was chewy and NOT overly soggy. My friend's salmon eggs benedict was the best. I've NEVER been a fan of eggs benedict, but the hollandaise sauce here was surprisingly light, and the bread it was sitting on, once again, was the perfect texture. We also had the quinoa hash browns, which looked like dark mysterious square cakes of doom, but were very nicely seasoned and crunchy. Definitely a nice break from traditional hash browns. Would love to try the cassava chips next time!
