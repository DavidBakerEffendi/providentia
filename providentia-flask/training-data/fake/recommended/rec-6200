I don't live in Philadelphia and had never heard of Johnny Brenda's, but about 3 years ago an English band I really like was playing in their upstairs room and I drove down to Philly to see them.  I liked JB's so much I've been back a few times since then just to visit.  They always feature several rotating local and regional beers on draft (and hand pump too).  When I've been there the food has been excellent, and the upstairs music room is very tiny and intimate, a great place to see music.  Occasionally there's a theme, like the 'Saison Brunch': 10 different Saison beers on tap, French-inspired brunch specials and a DJ spinning French tunes.  A cool place.
