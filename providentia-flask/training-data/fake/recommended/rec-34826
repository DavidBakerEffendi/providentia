Today I was in the mood for some spicy comfort food to warm me up after standing for hours chilled to the bone behind my concierge desk. I told myself (this is a game I sometimes play with myself) that I could only spend the money I had made on tips today on lunch, so Kati Roll seemed like an excellent bet. I had two (yes I KNOW they are really fattening!). One was spiced mutton and the other a spicy potato/vegetable. Both were very savory, spicy and just hot enough to warm me for a precious few moments before I returned to my frozen perch...
