It must have been an off night. At least, that's what I've been telling myself for the past two weeks since my boyfriend and I had a fairly underwhelming meal at this place on Saturday 12/28/13. Where should I start? Well, for one thing, even though the restaurant wasn't crowded when we sat down, it took a very long time for our waitress to appear, and progressively longer intervals passed as we waited for drinks, appetizers, entrees, etc. I also noted that it seemed there were only about 3 servers working the tables. Couldn't find people willing to work over a holiday weekend, Wajima? Anyway, back to the food. I decided to order Â the crab with seaweed appetizer (can't recall the name of the dish), and when it came out (after roughly 20 tedious minutes), I was disappointed. Five little dollops of imitation crab meat over a bed of wilted seaweed. It's a good thing I was starving and had some wasabi to give them a hint of flavor. The sushi entree....hm. Not horrible, but definitely nothing special: three tiny rolls filled with spicy salmon, tuna, and yellowtail (at least I think that's what they were made of, they all tasted the same) and smeared with globs of spicy mayo. My boyfriend got the Shabu Shabu and wasn't thrilled with it, but it was good enough to prevent hunger pains. There were a few highlights interspersed throughout the meal: I enjoyed the sake, and their green tea was also good. I also thought the hostess was nice to offer us a space to place our heavy shopping bags so they wouldn't get in our way at the table. But overall, I felt deflated by the experience, especially after having read all the stellar reviews on Yelp. Would I come here again? Probably not, but I might change my mind over time.
