my bf and i walked in 15 minutes late for our reservation and we were still able to be seated at a very quaint and romantic table downstairs.  this place is secretly MASSIVE...i would receommend sitting downstairs for a cuter and quieter experience.  the food was very good--i enjoyed the swordfish while my bf downed his lamb burger! the only thing that was a little weird was the cocktail list...tried both the sangria and margarita and both were a litte werid...the sangria was very very sweet and the margarita tasted like iced tea...? not really sure what was going on there but other than that, we had a great meal with fast service and amazing prices! will def keep this place in mind when on the uws!
