So I decided to do something different than many of the other reviewers. I figured I would never get in for a breakfast/brunch without eating my arm off or that of a friend so I took my girlfriend for dinner on Saturday night to celebrate a special occasion. And trust me, waiting isnt only reserved for bfast and brunch. We walked right in but sat at our table for over 20 minutes before being served and once we did it took over 35 minutes for two dishes. I have read & heard many amazing things about CSBC and couldnt wait to try the many amazing concoctions of pancakes, fruits and syrups but as soon as I saw the menu i settled on my go to favorite southern meal, Shrimp and Grits. Being raised in the south, I consider myself sort of a connoisseur of shrimp and grits of any variety. Â Unfortunately, the grits left a lot to be desired. Also, for $18 the portion was smaller than that of a tasting menu at a tapas restaurant. For a side dish I ordered another one of my typical southern favorites, sweet potato fries. These were unlike any other sweet potato fries as they were like giant thick strips that were baked and sprinkled with sugar. They were very fresh and very well done. After waiting for a while for our check we decided to take a piece of the apple crumb pie home for dessert. Again, underwhelming. For being a bakery I was expecting something mind blowing. This was nothing better than a Marie Calendars apple crumb pie I can buy from the store. The apples werent fresh and the crust was dry. Over all, I enjoyed my experience but the food and atmosphere left a lot to be desired. I want to go back for a bfast/brunch service but dont know if I have the patience to wait.
