Great and surprisingly diverse menu for a Mexican restaurant, not just the regular burrito/taco/nacho fare.  The drinks are really good, but be warned, the Bloody Maria is super spicy (although it will cure your hangover).  If you like them on Facebook, they are always putting up deals and specials for lunch and happy hour.  Cool place, cool neighborhood, definitely worth checking out.
