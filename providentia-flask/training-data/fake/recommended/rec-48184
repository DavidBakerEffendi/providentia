Clearly the best. Philip's is the best steak in Philly. I'm a little hesitant about even writing this review as I don't want the secret of us who truly know the pure magic that is Philip's getting out. The best cheesesteak in the city, great fries, birch beer, fast service etc....THATS AVAILABLE 24 HOURS A DAY, 7 DAYS A WEEK. As a born and bred Philadelphian who moved out of state a couple years ago, it's my first stop on the way home from the airport. Can't wait til I'm back home for thanksgiving.
