With 4700 reviews, do I really need to review this place... The food- obviously delicious and perfect to end a night out in NYC. [Personally I'm a fan of the lamb+rice and the mixed (chicken/lamb)+rice.] I only wish they'd be nicer to customers..but I guess they're used to having to deal with an inebriated crowd. They're a little stingy in giving out the take-out containers of red/white sauce, but if you ask politely (bonus if you're sober), they usually say yes.
