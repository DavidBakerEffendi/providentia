great craft cocktails, beautiful space, but a little on the pricey side. had a few nibbles, mix of bar nuts wish they gave you more small portion but delicious, duck act apple salad was genius and deviled eggs. everything was executed perfectly just a little to small on portion of cocktails and food for the price they charge.
