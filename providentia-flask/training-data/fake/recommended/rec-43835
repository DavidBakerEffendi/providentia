Staff not excited to see you or serve you. Food is very below average, especially for price point and neighborhood. We had only been for brunch, which was fine and reasonably priced. A blackboard eats promo convinced us to try dinner. We wanted to like it. We really did. We live 4 blocks away and the decor is cozy and inviting. The food is amateur and very sub-par. First of all, appetizer of mussels took 35 minutes to make it to table. Mussels. And by the time they got there, they were hammered. Beyond overcooked. And totally gritty and uncleaned. Also - the mussels came with bread with what tasted like a store bought canned queso cheese spread on it. What?? Not to mention the whole point of bread with mussels is to have plain lovely bread to soak up the broth. Mixed pickles plate was pretty much inedible. Very overpowering vinegar. ( And I love vinegar). Nothing appealing or crunchy about it. Ribs came with black eyed peas salad which was largely tomatoes. In November. So - not good tomatoes. Chopped bits of pointless, out of season, flavorless tomatoes. It all tasted overwhelmingly again of vinegar. The baby back ribs described as "carolina style" were smothered in straight up mustard. The one place some vinegar would be appropriate, there was none. Also. At one point they pushed the empty 2 top table next to us right up against our table, which we didn't need. Then after turning away a 2 top who came in for a table, awkwardly pulled the table away from us in silence (realizing their mistake...I guess??) Oy. Sad to see staff that doesn't seem to care much about diner's experience. We'll stick with Emily, Marietta, Aita, Do or Dine, Locanda, and other neighborhood faves.
