Ordered from here recently. The food was almost cold when it arrived, but whatever, we have a microwave. Still, not a great start. I got the meatballs appetizer. They were sitting in a thick, velvety sauce. They were good, but not great. Almost too salty. I was really looking forward to the lamb burger...however, it was almost inedibly salty. The meat also didn't really seem like lamb. It seemed more like pork, oddly. But the orange, feta-y sauce that came on the side was surprisingly good. So was the side salad with feta and cherry tomatoes. Although when the best part of a dish is the side salad, that probably doesn't say anything very good about that restaurant. I tried a bite of the famous dumplings, too, and it was just meh. The taste of everything was just off somehow. Don't think we'll be getting from here again.
