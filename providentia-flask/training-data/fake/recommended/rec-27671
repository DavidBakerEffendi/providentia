This place was a major disappointment. 1. Ordered a chicken burrito, got beef. 2. Ordered single tacos, got charged for platter AND extra tacos. 3. Ordered a side of queso fresco, got shredded cheddar. 4. Meat was dry. Rice was bland. Tortillas were chewy and gross. Overpriced, subpar food with terrible service. Eating here was the first time since I moved to Montclair that I regretted leaving my block in Brooklyn, where there was a divine Mexican food truck a few blocks away.
