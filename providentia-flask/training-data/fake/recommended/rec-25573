I am a Boa Vista guy on Kearny ave. NO MORE THIS PLACE KICKED BOA VISTAS BUTT IN EVERY WAY. I GOT THE STANDARD CHICKEN AND RIBS (pork) COMBINATION JUST THE RICE AND THE FRIES ALONE WERE THREE TIMES BETTER THAN WHAT Boa Vista   AND Boa Vista  SERVES  GREAT FRENCH FRIES. The chicken was so juicy and it had more of a barbecue look and taste then the average Brazilian barbecue. Someone said the pork ribs were tough on a review. They were wrong because the ribs were unbelievable. Also if you like beans get their black beans because they are great. Great job seems like a wonderful location but other really good businesses have failed up there. They have another location in Hackensack according to their website. It's worth it to just stop in and check it out just like I get on my way home one night.
