I will admit that I am no oyster expert, but my oyster-eating friends and I always enjoy their buck-a-shuck Mondays. You simply can not beat that price, and they feature a wide selection. As far as the drink are concerned, I would recommend the Angry Shrimp to the brunch-goers and the blue berry crush to the happy hour crowd.
