My husband and I came here when we visited because I heard about the tater tots. So I had to get the tater heaven. It was pretty good, but I was jealous of my husbands BBQ hash. That was awesome. The bowls were super filling and the prices reasonable. I liked the atmosphere and the service was quite good.
