A party of 8 work colleagues needed some space to unwind and have a meal celebrating upcoming wedding.  LOVE this place.   Noisy, Latin vibe, great food, and you get to sport a Fedora! The sangria flows nicely, appetizers are substantial and the entrees are all reasonably priced ($13-$20) and staff is beautiful.  (I wanted to adopt the hostess she was so cute.)   Go hungry and byob-a good time was had by all.
