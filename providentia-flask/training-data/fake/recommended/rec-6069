Amazing. We had no plans but wanted appitizers. Saw this place and every five star review was correct. The taziki appitizers was the tastiest and there was a stuffed cold pepper that was colorful and delicious. The three cheese in a clay pot was very cheesy and tasted yummy with taziki sauce and pita. So stuffed after those three appitizers we had to take lemon potatoes to go. The atmosphere is so cute and great for a romantic dinner or for a girls dinner out.
