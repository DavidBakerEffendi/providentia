Just got back from this great place.  I went ahead and tried the haggis and tatties, ha!  YUM!  Total comfort food and it wasn't too too heavy... well maybe cause the portion size was just right.  Our waitress Kim, was awesome, she made us feel comfortable and welcomed.  I thought the owner, who was behind the bar would be more social, but maybe it was an off day.  He delivered us our food and didn't say a word.  Didn't talk when I was waiting for my b.f. in the restroom either... Oh well... My b.f. ordered the Scottish salmon sandwich and it was amazing!  It was smoked salmon people... never had that on a sandwich before but trust me, it was divine!  the group of Canadian women next to us raved on and on about the house made soups.  We will be back next time we are visiting VT.  And the prices were good to boot!
