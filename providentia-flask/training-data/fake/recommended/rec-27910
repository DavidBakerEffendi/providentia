This might seem like a novelty restaurant, but every component of the meal is so well balanced and perfected, it's easy to see why there always is and probably will always be a wait I went with a few friends and we had a pretty good cross section of the menu. I had the meatball smash with beef, tomato sauce and mozzarella and a chicken/parmesean slider. I'm glad I didn't get the hero because it was already a LOT of food. The mint ice cream is extremely minty (surprise) and the cookies are soft and delicious. Our waitress was very attentive and helpful with recommendations. For a place that seems to have non-stop business, this server made us feel like she was happy to have us there and was excited that it was our first time. Worth the wait and worth going back to.
