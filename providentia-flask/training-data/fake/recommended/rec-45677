Excellent sandwiches and nice people! My favorite is the garlic bread, eggplant, mozz, chicken, prosuito, and white wine sauce! Really don't have too say much more after seeing those ingredients :p and their zucchini fries are tasty too! Their weekend hours are really different from weekdays (they close early). I wish I liked more variety on their menu but what I've had from it had all been really good.
