All around great. I'm not a bourbon drinker but it turns out one of the owners is also a sommelier, so the wine list is terrific and the recommendations were spot on. Have already had a lunch and dinner there and have not been disappointed by anything. Can't get enough of the brussels sprout and pig ear appetizer ! Â Tried some oysters from the raw bar the other night and they were perfect. Did I mention the decor is spectacular ? Highly recommend this spot.
