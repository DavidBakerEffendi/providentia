Dont waste your hard earned money here. It's gonna cost you alot for some tots and a sandwich. Burger king has more flavor in their burgers here. This attempt of reinvented All-American food favorites is soo disappointing. I was excited to find this place.. the menu brings back childhood memories.. the decor is nice and modern.. i gave this place too many chances. It was down the street from the apt building. the food sucks. bottom line. Steven Starr does a slighty better job at his other restaurant in Olde City... that retro looking diner. go there if you want.. a little bit better... crap.
