The best Thai place in NYC. It's crowded for dinner, and pretty tiny but the sevice is great and you feel comfortable - hey you are in a city where space is expensive! We have been dining here since the beginning of our moving in NYC. Although most likely there is the line - but it is efficient - you can go arond and they call you when your place is ready. We coudn't renounce to this Thai after we had a baby, and kept going with the stroller. The baby loves the food too
