Extra points for getting seated promptly (came around 2pm on a Saturday and sat at the bar) so four stars, but now that I've tried it once I don't need to come again. Truffle fries: good, crispy, with truffle salt and truffle cheese. Overwhelming but not a bad thing I suppose since it's truffle flavored. Greenbird: Good, but not as tender as other turkey burgers I've had. Green goddess dressing, sprouts, and avocado made it very fresh-tasting. Original burger: Not mind blowing but these definitely taste a bit different- not salty per se but savory so I guess they did accomplish what they aim to do. I think the burger price could be better justified if they came with a side of pickles, some fries, salad etc.
