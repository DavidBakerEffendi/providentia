I've been meaning to write a second review for Bouley since they made my friend's birthday SO incredibly special and went above and beyond in every single way. The entire lunch was PACKED with surprises - after I simply asked them to just make it special by adding a candle in his dessert at the end of the meal. The service in Bouley is unbeatable. I am a foodie and ex-server/restaurant manager. Trust me, I know what is good service. BOULEY has the BEST service hands down from anywhere I've gone. They really go above and beyond to make your entire experience so memorable. They surprised us with so many little complimentary courses - I can't even begin to explain. All I can say is GO TO BOULEY! The $55 lunch special is the best deal you'll find for spectacular molecular gastronomy, and if you are eating dinner there, ask for their WHITE CHOCOLATE CLOUD :) I can't thank the team there enough for making my friend and all our experiences so special. I rave about this place more than any restaurant in NYC, and so do all my friends. P.S. This restaurant beat plenty of 3 michelin star restaurants I"ve dined at... so don't rely on those to determine which restaurants are "best"
