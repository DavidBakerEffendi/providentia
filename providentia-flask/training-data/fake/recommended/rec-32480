Coming to this restaurant is like visiting a party of friends. As I am very familiar with Bombay Olive, the staff immediately recognized me. The atmosphere was not bad for a Sunday brunch. To start we began with coconut shrimp and tangy wings. The food was served within a matter of minutes. The texture was perfect and flavors were exquisite. For our main entree, we ordered the all three meat kabobs. Sadly I was not impressed by the Beef, but both the Chicken and Lamb was wonderful. My overall rating of this restaurant is great. I highly recommend if you like Mediterranean food with a lite influence of Â Indian culinary art.
