We were taken here by out great Greek friends Leonitis and Pelagia.  I am no expert in Greek cusine, but this meal was hands down the best authentic Greek food I have ever had.  We tasted and tries everything!  We were drunk with olive oil :)  But the best was the Branzini.  I don't possess the literary vocab to tell you how good that fish was, but let me tell you this...  OPA & YASOU! PS: BYOB
