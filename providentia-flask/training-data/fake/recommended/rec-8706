My family and I have gone to Leondaro's II several times, and the fact that we keep going back should say something. Pros: --Endless bread basket filled with delicious bread means that I can fill up on that and take home my entree for leftovers. --The staff have always been incredibly friendly and helpful. --Most of the food we've had there has been delicious. (My favorite is the fried gnocchi. It's to die for!) Cons: --It's a small restaurant, so if they're busy it can sometimes get a bit loud and difficult to hear. --Some of the entrees that we've gotten have been just "eh" (notably, the lasagna and the "Da Vinci). These seem to the be the exception to the rule. Overall, it's a great place that we always enjoy.
