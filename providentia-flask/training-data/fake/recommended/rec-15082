I had been having a pretty bad day when I came here, but eating here definitely improved my mood. The place itself is cozy and pleasant. The food I got was very good (the vegan wrap) and the side of potatoes also had sweet potatoes in it! Yum! The young woman serving us was very sweet, I only wish that some of the sweets they had were vegan.
