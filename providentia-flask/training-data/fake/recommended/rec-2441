My BF and I had a layover in Philly 1/21/2009, so instead of sitting in the airport for 8 hours we decided to take a mini tour of the city.   We wanted an "authentic" Philly Cheese Steak and we were told by the people we talked to that Geno's was the place we need to go.  We went to Geno's where we got the sandwiches with whiz, onions and mushrooms.  They were ok, but not the best we've ever had.  The pictures of celebrities covering the walls was cool, but there is no where to sit, so be prepared to get them to go or eat outside.
