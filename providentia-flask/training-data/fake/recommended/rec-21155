Just like many people already mentioned before, the grilled octopus appetizer is very good! Smokey and grilled to perfection. The texture and amount of acid is just right. A very generous portion too. I would come back just to eat this dish! The Sheep's milk dumpling with sausage entr√©e was equally delicious. Smooth and creamy, very decadent. Lots of strong harmonious flavors. The grilled swordfish was very fresh, but was a little too acidic for my taste. You can really see and taste the homemade authenticity in every dish. I would've given a higher rating if only the service was better...
