My husband and I just moved down to the LES and Freeman's was at the top of our "to try" list for awhile. We had family in town so we made a reservation for Sunday brunch (7 people). Two people cancelled last minute so we only had a party of 5 when we arrived. They manager and host were very nice about it and seated us within 5 minutes. Upon being seated we ordered drinks, then shortly after ordered our food. We were having such a good time, enjoying each others company and chatting that when our server came over to apologize about the food being delayed we didn't even notice anything was wrong. We nodded and smiled and told him it was fine, no harm done. 5 minutes later he brought over complimentary artichoke dip and 5 minutes after that offered to buy us around of drinks. I was floored, never have we received such service in a New York restaurant. The dip was delicious to say the least, I was basically licking the dish. If they had brought out another we would have gladly devoured it. We received our food and immediately attacked. Everything was amazing! Clean plate club all around! After the table was cleared our server then came back to offer us dessert, ON THE HOUSE AGAIN. What?!? I'm sorry could you repeat that? Apps, drinks and dessert all on Freeman's just because there was a mix up in the kitchen. They went above and beyond and it was well received. Not only were my husband and I impressed, but his parents were thrilled as well. We will definitely be back to Freeman's again and not just because we got free food. We would gladly go again and pay full price based on this gesture.
