Crown is a wonderful place to take a girl you're trying to impress, a friend who wants an NYC feel, or a gent who likes a perfectly mixed cocktail.  I did not eat their food, so I can't comment on it however, I did notice their pricing to be on par with their drinks which would be high to say the least.  I wouldn't say that their drink prices are astronomical, because afterall, you're paying for the total package when you frequent Crown.  The ambience is bright and lively.  The furniture is modern and unique.  The service is superb and the drinks are professionally mixed.  I would go to Crown as a novel experience, say about once a month.  One thing that's great about Crown though is that even if you have the worst corner table in the place as I did the last time I went, the atmosphere and vibe of the place still pulls you in.  I definitely cannot say that about any other bars in New Haven.  I would say that this is far and away the best bar in New Haven.
