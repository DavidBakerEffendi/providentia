It was like a miracle when I realized that Vietnam Cafe, which is just a couple miles from our house, is affiliated with Vietnam downtown - my favorite restaurant in the city. I can't add much that others haven't already said, but try the beef with broken rice. It is also miraculous. Pork claypot and the corn pudding are two more favorites. Service is always friendly too, and SO fast.
