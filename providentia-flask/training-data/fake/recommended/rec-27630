it's not as good as it was about 15 years ago, but the char seew with rice is still one of my favorite comfort foods.  their duck is great and i honestly don't know why people go to congee village when the congee here is DELICIOUS--let me emphasize this point--if you hit up congee village for congee--stop (because you can make better congee yourself at home) the congee at Big Wong is first rate--get it here instead.  other staples that i don't leave the place without--beef chow fun, nguw cherng, the soup noodles are great.   don't come if you're expecting good service, if you're unfamiliar with chinese food, beware what you order (a la the pissed off guy who gave the place one star LOL--dude, get a clue).  it ain't clean, it ain't fancy, it's chinese fast food. and i've always been afraid to check out the bathrooms, but from what i hear they're pretty nasty.
