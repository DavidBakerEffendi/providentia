it's been way too long since i've gone to the reading terminal.  i certainly need to come here more often. i heard about tommy dinic's from the food network i think.  anyways, my family and i decided to come here for lunch one saturday.  after first the lines seemed really long but it moved really fast.  we got our foods in about 15 minutes.  regardless of the wait time, it was worth the wait.  on the menu, they offer  roast pork, roast beef, Italian sausage, scallopine (all $6.95). hand carved Italian pulled pork ($7.20). brisket of beef ($7.90).  the meats were really juicy and it definitely left a good impression.  if you still have room after stuffing yourself with the nicely portioned sandwich, go find some dessert at Flying Monkey Patisserie!
