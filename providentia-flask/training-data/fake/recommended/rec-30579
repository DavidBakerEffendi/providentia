Selected this spot for a pre-Broadway dinner and if I can say so myself, I did good! :) The service, like many have said, was quick and friendly! The establishment is pretty cute, black/white/grey color scheme with a few large chandeliers adorning the place and some awesome antique-like mirrors that line the ceiling in the middle of the restaurant. For drinks, my friend and I ordered the Lychee Sangria ($13 for a liter that pours 2 glasses) but I wish I would have tried the Sex In Bath Tub or Room Service which were their specialty cocktails! (Someone try them and let me know how they were!) The Sangria was good but nothing to get you too twisted. Â For an appetizer, ordered the Shrimp and Chicken Dumplings - um um good. 5 dumplings for like $5-seriously?!?! And then for dinner, I ordered the Thai Fried Rice with Chicken and my bud had the Pineapple Fried Rice with Chicken. The dishes were good and the best thing about them was the presentation - they served the rice in cones! (see pics!) Our bill was like $38 bucks which you can't beat for an appetizer, two drinks, and two entrees! I'd definitely visit this place again before / after a show because the food was fairly inexpensive and tasty and the service was quick. I'd probably go if I was looking for a place on 9th Avenue for after work drinks with 2 or 3 peeps.
