So I went there for the first time today, the place hasn't been there that log either.  So I tried it out with my friend. How long does it take to make 3 pork tacos?  15 minutes that is how long.  And I am not talking about complicated tacos here.  I purchased the Taco Americano ($7.95), 3 tacos with melted cheese and avocado.  I don't like avocado, so I asked for them without it.  So when I finally received them, they were wrong.  They put the avocado on.  I said they were wrong and they took them back and said they would make new ones.  All they did was take the avocado off.  Say I was allergic to avocados, that would not have been good. Soda - $1.89 for a soda, free refills.  But the cup is so small; you need to make 5 trips up there to stay hydrated.  If it takes 15 minutes for the taco, think about how much you will be drinking during that wait. My friend's order was messed up also.  He asked for pink beans and received black. The Pastor was not that bad, I will give them that. They have no website, I know they are new, but come on in this era of technology. I will take a lot for me to go back there.  A LOT!
