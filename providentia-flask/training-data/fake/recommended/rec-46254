Arrived 25 min early for our 8pm reservation on a Saturday night, waitstaff was friendly, quick, and very willing to help answer any questions. Drinks were on point, got the fried app and the short rib app, both delicious. Entrees were the steak, my mouth is watering just remembering the taste! Dessert was carrot cake, so fun and delightful! Definitely recommend this place! A bit loud but great experience
