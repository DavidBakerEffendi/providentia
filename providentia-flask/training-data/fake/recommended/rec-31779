This place is actually attached to the Home Depot,  It is everything a Philly Cheesesteak should be - It's my favorite, the preparation is correct the bread is great, Tony Lukes and Pat's & Geno's are over-rated tourist traps - if you want a really good steak come here!  The Sausages are also very good!
