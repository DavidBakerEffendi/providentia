It was our first time there with friends from abroad. We, all four, have dined all over the world and we think that it is a GREAT little restaurant, if food is the main reason to go to a restaurant, so don't expect a "grand" restaurant experience. The waiter was very helpful and the atmosphere very cosy, particularly with the chef preparing the food right there as if we were at a friend s kitchen I like the fact that they change menu frequently Although I am partial to few flavors blending  in a dish, I must admit that this time  I loved what I ate. Being BYOB is an extra attraction but I guess that raises the prices somewhat
