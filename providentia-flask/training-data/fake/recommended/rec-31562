This is a great family-run business. I order from Joey's almost every weekend. Â The rotisserie chicken is the best you can find anywhere, and all the sides are top notch, especially the sweet plantains and yucca. All the traditional Peruvian dishes are also very good. You can't beat this place for the quality you get for the price.
