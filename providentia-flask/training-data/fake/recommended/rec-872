I chose Geno's over Pat King's simply because I saw on their banner that they "Support the troops". Not sure how exactly they do that but it's the thought that counts I suppose. Â Anyways. I ordered a cheesesteak with whiz and it came up to 9.50. I got a Pepsi on the side for an additional 2 dollars. It's important to note that they only take cash. The sandwhich itself was good. I had not eaten all day and walked around 4 miles so maybe that played a role in my hunger but nonetheless it was good. The problems with the meal were the lack of table space for patrons, and the lack of a bathroom or wet naps for your hands. We all know Philly cheesesteaks are supposed to be greasy so it would be a nice idea to have a way to clean your hands after eating.
