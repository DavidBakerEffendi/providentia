Had to wait SO LONG for a table during Sunday brunch.  They really should start taking reservations to better serve the customers. Was it worth it?  So so.  My friend had the fried pork and cheese waffles, it was good, with the pork being juicy.  The syrup to the waffles was standard but there were no cheese evident in the waffles.   I had the eggs huntington, it was OK, not groundbreaking.   The service was OK, everyone seemed a bit rushed and I had to remind them to refill my water a few times and to bring ketchup. Overall a nice little restaurant if you can go on an off day - otherwise be prepared to wait a long time for food that doesn't warrant the time.
