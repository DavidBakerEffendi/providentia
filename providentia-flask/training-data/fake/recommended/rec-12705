One of the best under $15 breakfasts my husband and I have had!   We got there a few minutes before it opened on Saturday and there was already a long line..  Had to wait 20 minutes just to put our name in, but they told us 50-60 minutes, so we went and had a cappuccino at La Columbe on Layfayette. The blueberry pancakes were incredible served with the warm maple butter.   The country breakfast was also great -  amazing hash browns!     Will definitely go back when in NY again.
