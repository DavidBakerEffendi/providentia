Love this place! You wouldn't know it from the front but inside is so cozy and inviting. The pizza is super delicious. The staff is friendly and attentive. Only thing is I wish the seats were a bit more comfie. They are just wooden benches and no back. But the pitchers of beer I had defiantly Â helped!
