Listen to me: This place is Pho-king great. Ok, parking sucks here, but I'm not eating parking spots, so that's irrelevant. I go inside. There's a 10 minute wait because obviously all the Caucasian locals here in Hartford, Connecticut know this is amazing Pho. Now I know this secret, and so do you. If you're reading this you're probably from the area, so you probably already know this, so it's probably not a secret. Anyway... I sit down at a long fold-out table inside this approximately shoe-box sized restaurant, and don't know what to order. Interesting dialogue ensues between the underage server and me: Him: "What can I get for you, sir?" Me: "I have no idea, I'm just really hungry." Him: "Ok" Me: "No, seriously, just bring me whatever. And a water." He begins to walk away. Me: "Oh, and make sure it's large. The bowl I mean, not the water." Him: "Ok." He emerges with a combination of Pho I've probably had, but still enjoy. Eye of beef round? Check. Heavenly noodles? Check. Broth so salty I see the reflection of my reflection? Check. I eat this bowl pretty fast since it's so completely delicious. The four frat boys sharing the table with me look over in unison as I finish the last drop, with a look of wonderment in their eyes as they are caught in the endless loop of trying to get that one noodle into the spoon, but it keeps falling off. I give them a cool, confident look that says, "Yeah, I'm pretty good at eating Pho." If you go to Pho 501, be sure to try their Large Whatever. It's about $8.00 and realllly good. And get a water or two, since you'll need to stave off hypernatremia while you indulge in your Pho.
