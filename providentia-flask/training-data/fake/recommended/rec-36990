I've been to Perry Street twice so far and think it's great. Both times my wife and I got great service and were very happy with our meals. The appetizers, main dishes and desserts change a bit each time which makes Perry Street a restaurant you can go many times and not get tired of it. The only inconvenient thing about the restaurant is that finding a cab on the west side highway is difficult so you have to walk east one avenue to get a taxi.
