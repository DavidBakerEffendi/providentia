We were looking for good beer on a Friday night. After being told that the wait at Monk's was over an hour, we took a stroll, found Vintage, and were seated immediately. This place is known for it's wine, but the beer list is fan-tas-tic! Service is knowledgeable and friendly. Food is delicious and reasonably priced. Get the fries.
