Came here for dinner with the family on a Saturday night and was surprised at the Â many choices. Big menu, you'll find something here for everyone on your party. Huge selection of entrees, from Italian, American, Thai/Chinese and more. Had the vegetable dumplings and spring rolls with the peanut sauce as an appetizer and loved it. If you love seared Ahi Tuna Salad you cannot go wrong with this one, a little spicy, but loved that about it. One of the best Ahi Tuna Salads I had. The Blackened Chicken on the Pretzel roll was also very good, again on the spicy side, but was delicious. Will definitely come back here again. The only thing I didn't like is that they do not take reservations and they have a long waiting line. You can call ahead of time and find out how long will they take you in...I only waited about 15 minutes.
