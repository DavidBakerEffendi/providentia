I grew up on cosmi's deli. They have some great food. I enjoy their cheesesteaks and other sandwiches. My favorite is the grilled chicken caprise. I also love the names they have for all the sandwiches, how they name them after people in the neighborgood. The only drawback is the price. Ordering there can get really expensive so try not to max out on a weeks worth of cosmi's deli.
