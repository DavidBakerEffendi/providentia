Its a great Thai Restaurant. We were recommended by the local bookstore cashier. The wait was quite long but then again it was a saturday night. We sat by the bar and had a beer and once seated we ordered our food. Im not very familiar with the cuisine so the waiter recommended and I took it and it was delicious. As everything on th menu because my husband ordered almost everything haha. They're generous dishes so I couldn't finish mine,. Wes at towards the back and where you can see them preparing food which was cool and the view to the back yard. Its cozy place and low lighting.
