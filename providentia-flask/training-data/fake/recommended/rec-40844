This is the best sushi spot I've been to on the East Coast. I've been to several places in NJ and NYC and Nizi has them beat in terms of price, service and food. It isn't a place you would go for a late night date as it closes around 10-11pm and it is BYOB but as far as quality food and service this place can't be beat. I suggest the John's roll and House roll!
