My only complaint about señoritas is it isn't a little closer to my house! Friendly hosts when you enter. Servers that know the menu and how to treat their guests. Great food, salsa I would take home. We never know if we should just do apps( love the chicken nachos) or include entrees. My eyes are always bigger than my stomach. Excellent ribs , not something I would normally get at a Mexican restaurant but they do a great job with them there. I had a mango mojito that was ok but could have had a little more rum for my liking. They used to have a second location in Clark, there's a big empty Mexican restaurant in Livingston that could fit señoritas just fine!!
