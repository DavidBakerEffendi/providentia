Amazing space. Elegantly laid out, old world feel, great floors. The bar is one-of-a-kind and over 100 years old. Beer list is solid, both draught and bottled, as is the wine list. I am very impressed with the food, particularly the burger and oysters! I also tried the fried chicken entrée and dry aged NY strip special which were both excellent. The back room is well lit with a large skylight and comfortable banquet seating. The music was good, they have a great sound system, they also let people DJ occasionally.  The waitresses are attentive and friendly and the managers are cool guys. I live in the neighborhood and couldn't be happier with Bar Room, it definitely improves the hood.
