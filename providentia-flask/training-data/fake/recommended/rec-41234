Despite the fact that they don't take reservations, and that you will probably have to wait for a table at dinner, this place is the bomb dot com. The first time I came here I was surprised to find a simplified menu, but it's not what you think. Despite the amount of options, you'll be more than satisfied with what you order. Their Mazemen brothless ramen hits every flavor spot you would want it to. It's topped with cod roe, seaweed, scallions, bacon, yuzu, and sake butter. YUMMAH! I hope they keep it on the menu forever because I crave it all the time now. I like this place for their simple layout and chill atmosphere. Friendly staff as well!
