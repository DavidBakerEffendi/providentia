I had pretty high expectations for this place as I had heard good things, but I wound up being pretty dissappointed.   After waiting to be seated for a half an hour past my scheduled reservation time, we discovered that the restaurant was no longer participating in restaurant week despite the fact that restaurant week list stated that they were participating on Saturday.  This is not entirely their fault, the website was definitely misleading.   So we proceeded to order our food.  I decided to try the pressed Cubano waffle sandwich which was one of their specials.  I was a little hesistant about getting a sandwich served on a waffle but it seemed to be one of their signature items so I thought it would be a safe choice.  What I got was a lukewarm coldcut sandwhich served between to unevenly cooked and partially burnt eggo waffles. Just terrible. The fries were really good, but this 15$ sandwich was just a disgrace. I got the smores crepe for dessert which was good, but not necessarily a dessert you would expect from a high end chocolate specialty restaurant.  I think their whole wow factor is just cramming as much sugar and chocolate as they can into various applications and then overcharging for it, not really taking into consideration how different flavors might work together.  Glad I finally went and tried Max Brenner, but I will not be returning.
