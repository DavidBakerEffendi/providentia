So you like sushi? Then you need to try Masa 8. It's in a small shopping center, you'd miss it if you blink.  Seats around 20 to 30 max. What to get for lunch? The bento box.  It's $9.99 and you get a ample amount of food, by far the cheapest bento box around.  My fav is the shrimp tempora,  comes with soup, sushi, rice, salad, and something else I cant recall at the moment.  Delicious!   How about dinner? If you're in the mood to spend a little more, go straight to the "Special Rolls" section.  And order.....anything.  They are on average $12 per roll for a reason.  Must try the Volcano Roll and the ninja roll.   Volcano Rolls are torched with a butane lighter, tho they don't come "on fire" they are quite spicy and savory.  The ninja rolls are deep fried...need I say more? Everything is very fresh, I've made it a goal of mine to bring all of my friends to enjoy this place.  Not one unsatisfied customer. I can continually go there and get a quality meal. Waitresses are very nice and every time someone walks through the front door the sushi chefs are sure to yelp out in your honor. Never disappointed.
