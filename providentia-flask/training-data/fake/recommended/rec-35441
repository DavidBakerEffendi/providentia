As some of you know, potatoes fear me.  I cackle at the thought of them being mutilated through slicing, chopping, or grating.  I grin when I smell their little, starchy bodies browning, cooking, and sometimes being burned to a crisp.  Then, I devour them with delight.  I also like to humiliate them by smothering them in hot sauces, cheeses, and/or mayonnaises.  The torture of the potato never ends with me.  If they could, they would run away on their short, stubby legs at the sight of me, screaming all the way.  Lucky for me, they are born without any means of escape, making them all the more attractive as victims. Pommes frites has become one of my favored potato-torturing venues.  They know how momma likes her potatoes, and they give her what she wants.  According to Rachael W., the potatoes were better in the past.  I, unfortunately, did not experience that time, so I can only judge these potatoes now.  I love the paper cone they come in, the variety of dips you can choose, and the strength of flavor of those dips.  I have never finished my potatoes and thought, "Damn, there weren't enough fries" or "I wish I could have tasted the garlic in that mayo."  To the contrary, the potato sticks are plentiful and the condiments are divine.
