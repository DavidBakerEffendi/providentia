Pretty good... Almost comparable to Burger Joint. The difference between the Corner Bistro Burger is the extra side of bacon and cheese. The burger patty is huge. The recommended beer is Blue Moon. Menu is super-cheap, but they only accept cash, so be prepared (though there are ATM machines around). Funny that they serve the burger and fries on plastic party plates. This place is great if you want to watch football or sports. There is a line, but the server is forward about asking people to leave as soon as they've paid their bill.
