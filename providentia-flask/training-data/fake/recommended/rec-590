The soup dumplings are very good. Not exceptional, but probably the best in the city and definitely worth an order or two. The skins are reasonably thin, and they are large. Oddly, no ginger is served with them by default but they will bring it if you ask. Note that despite the name this is NOT really a dim sum place. The menu is mostly shanghainese, not cantonese. This is reinforced by the Mandarin (not Cantonese) speaking staff. The menu items include a few dim sum standbys (which are mostly mixed in quality; the steamed chive and pork dumplings were very good, but the shrimp dumplings were disappointing) but generally you get a shanghainese menu that prominently features XLB.
