My boyfriend had the empanadas special, but for something that was featured on TV, it was kind of meh. So why the four stars, you ask? I got the Big Boy Plate, which is your basic diner special where they put all the basics on one plate - pancakes, meat, 2 eggs, home fries, cornbread, etc. etc. Nothing really special, but I was craving the basics that day. I wasn't expecting much, to be honest, but holy shit. The pancakes. Let me explain. I NEVER order pancakes anywhere, unless they come with the meal, like they do with the Big Boy. Even then, I usually eat everything else first and push the pancakes to the side. My boyfriend then usually eats them. But when they came out today, I noticed immediately that they were different from your typical anemic diner pancakes. They were dark, not overly pale like pancakes sometimes are. They were extremely crispy. And they smelled like butter. I make pancakes at home a lot, and they're the only ones I eat, and here's why: I like my pancakes to be super crisp on the outside, and fluffy on the inside. They must be pan fried in a large amount of butter so that crisp exterior soaks up all that good buttery flavor, and that fat is extremely important for that crispy edge. I put some more butter on, poured on that real maple syrup, and dug in. And damn, was it good! The best pancakes I've ever had in a restaurant. I made everyone else at the table try them (my boyfriend and his two friends) and everyone else agreed that they were some damn good pancakes. Everything else on my plate was good to decent, but those pancakes really stole the show. And thus the four stars. I'll return, if only to order a stack of pancakes. Mmmmmm. P.S. We had to wait about 45 minutes to go, but I was planning on going to visit Badass Brooklyn Animal Rescue's adoption event that was going on a few blocks over, so I just went during the wait to check out all the lovely dogs. So I had no complaints about the wait!
