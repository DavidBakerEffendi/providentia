This is some of the city's best pizza! Really wonderful stuff! Kinda pricy but worth the cost. I had two slices of pepperoni as well as half of a regular slice. While my S.O. had a slice and a half of cheese. Pros +Great NYC pizza! +Actually its quite wonderful! +Generous toppings Cons -Space is kind of really small -Drinks are over priced
