This is my new favorite lunch spot. It's only one block from the Rutgers campus and the food is great. Once you decide between chicken and felafel there are so many different salad options to customize your dish. The obvious choice is the tabouli, which you can get spicy or regular. After that my go-to salads are the corn or chickpea and beet salads. If you're really hungry, I'd go with a laffa instead of a pita. The pita is nice and fluffy, but a bit small if you need to fill an empty stomach. The chicken shawarma sometimes comes out a bit too crispy, but the shish is delicious. And you can't go wrong with the falafel. My favorite for sure. The best part is now that they've been open for a while, I've started to notice that they're moving a bit faster. But even when they were slower it was worth the wait in line.
