I wasn't really thrilled with Kite & Key.  I came here for brunch.  It was a hot, muggy day in September and the ventilation was off (at least in the back of the restaurant) so not only was the air thick and hot but there were flies milling around our table.  I ordered the standard breakfast (bacon, eggs, potatoes.)  The potatoes were odd, they were maybe sort of like tater tots but with a strange after taste.  The bacon and eggs were ok, nothing special by any stretch of the imagination.  The wait was out of control.  Considering we ordered nothing more complicated than a burger, it should not have taken nearly as long as it did.  Of course the stifling heat didn't help.  Maybe our experience was an anomaly but I would probably not go back.  Two stars because our waitress was nice.
