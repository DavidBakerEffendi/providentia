I had the pleasure of dining here on a date a little over a week ago. Â My server told me to call her B (Bee) and she was quite lovely... sometimes a little too attentive (minus 1 star) but hey, I'd rather that than having to track down my server. The food ( SEAFOOD PAD PED - shrimp, mussels, calamari, bamboo shoots, thai basil, bell peppers, spiced curry, green peppercorns) was everything I needed it to be and the drink ( SIPPING EMOTIONS - Infused Vodka, Fresh Lemon Juice, Basil Leaves, Sugar) was amazing. I love B and I love OBAO! Coming again for sure.
