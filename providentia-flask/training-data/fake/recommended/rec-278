After reading so many reviews on how this is the best banh mi place in manhattan, I had to try. I had my favorite - the super cub classic. I have to say when i got the sandwich, i wasn't overly excited about the size, it didn't exactly look stuffed like the pictures, instead even a bit flat. However, it was AMAZINGG. Perfectly pickled veggies, though I would have liked them to put more. Everything in the sandwich was the same temperature and i didn't even think it mattered before but it apparently did and it was perfection! Their lunch special deal is sandwich + drink + snack for $8. Their iced lychee green tea is very refreshing. Snack was like a small bag of chips or something. Of course, I have to compare it to chinatown's banh mi saigon for $4.25, with a bigger portion. Xe may seemed a little overpriced to me, even with a drink. Though, it really did make me feel satisfied and wanting for more, I would go again for their other creative sandwiches.
