This place is really nice.  We waited about 1.5 hours to get seated since we didn't have reservations on a Saturday night, but they took our phone number so that we could get drinks elsewhere and come back when our table was ready.   The service was excellent and everyone was really friendly.  They know the menu well and make really good recommendations.   We had a group of 7, so we had a nice variety of food.  I got the mackerel dinner, and it was tasty.  The fish was cooked well but nothing to write home about.  I think the sides that came with the meal were better than the fish.  The egg custard is probably my favorite thing that they served there.  It was so silky! The oyakodon was really good too.  The chirashidon was a little disappointing because the rice wasn't well seasoned, but the fish itself was really fresh. I think I would go here again if I were in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't go out of my way to make a trip here.  Apparently, there's a new location in Times Square as well for you brave souls.
