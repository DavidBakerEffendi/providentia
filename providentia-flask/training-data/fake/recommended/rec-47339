I came here for a Sunday morning brunch, and I must say I was not impressed. I always get annoyed when wait staff feels as though you are just the last thing they want to have to deal with at the moment. I am an avid pancake person, due to my sweet tooth I always prefer chocolate chip pancakes. While I am a person of tradition, I find it customary for me to always order pancakes at every brunch. Therefore, I have a pretty solid grasp on what is quality and unfortunately is not. I got a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice that was pretty much half empty by the time it arrived due to the waitress not caring about it spilling all over the godforsaken place. Thanks. Because they didn't have chocolate chip pancakes, I ordered blueberry, which always have the potential to be great. Unfortunately here, there were not. They were that sad batter-y type, where at first you think they are light and fluffy, until you realize the truth...Pancakes are not that difficult to make, especially if it's something you do on a regular basis, so I just don't understand why it's so hard to have them cooked thoroughly... Not great ambiance, not great food. The juice was fresh...that was left in the glass.That's my review.
