Yummy yummy, lucky you to have stumbled on Izumi of Wayne NJ!!  This is my favorite hibachi joint and I have never been let down.  The noodles are top notch.  The flaming onion volcanos are always fun.  The station chefs are efficient and talented.  And the obligatory group birthday photo always dons my fridge for endless months!   Piece of advice - don't be a fool and wait for all your food to be cooked prior to the start of eating.  If you don't want to be beaten by the abundance of food at Izumi, eat each part of the meal as it gets cooked and added to your plate.  The filet mignon hibachi dinner with fried rice is always the way to go, and you are a rube if you think otherwise.  Don't bother saving the few bucks on a cheaper steak or chicken.
