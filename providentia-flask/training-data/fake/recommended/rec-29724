On a recent trip to NYC I had the pleasure of eating at Benito One.  I was in town w/ friends for CMJ and after a few shows and a few cocktails we decided food was in order - so, off to Little Italy we went. We peered into a few places and decided to give Benito's a shot.  The aroma of the food hit us as we walked inside & I smiled.  It wasn't very busy and we were sat, got bread and had drinks on the table promptly. There were many items on the menu that sounded delicious but I was in the mood for gnocchi.  They happily added pancetta to my dish and the end result was fantastic.  I sampled my friend's pescatore and thought that was excellent too.  The chicken dishes were flavorful but the chicken was a lil' dry.  Everything was nicely portioned & priced very reasonably. I really enjoyed Benito One.  It didn't seem trendy or overly fancy.  They just serve damn good food.
