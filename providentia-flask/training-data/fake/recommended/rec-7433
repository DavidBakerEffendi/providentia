We ordered delivery while staying nearby and the burger and the steak sammy were delicious! The gruyere cheese and arugula on the burger were a nice touch and the brioche bun delicious. We also ordered salads which were very fresh and had good dressings that did not taste like they came out of a store bought bottle. Memorable and worth a trip to the neighborhood!
