I'm a Prospect Heights native and a huge foodie with high expectations. I too was one that eagerly awaited Morimoto vet Jamison Blackenships creation and I have to tell everyone that it was worth the wait. Do try the fried oysters which are as succulent and tasty as the sauce. Also, the pork ramen in pork broth-is divine too fine a word? I'll just write delicious. Also, the pork gyoza were light yet full bodied in flavor, quite savory. Â My friend tried the chicken ramen dish with corn which I also tasted and you know what? I could feel the love that the chef put in to shaving the corn from the cob, it was sweet and crisp and just awesome. By the way, the decor is beautiful, its clean and refined and a compliment to the staff who may be many but are equally refined and friendly. Claire was especially outgoing and informative. Welcome to the neighborhood Chuko!
