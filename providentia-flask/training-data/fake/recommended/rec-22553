This place can be awesome! Their waitstaff is wonderful, their drinks are good, their location makes them top-dog, but their menu is awful! I don't know when it became acceptable to offer tasteless airplane food and serve it up with an explanation that the reason why this food should be coveted is because it was brought to this normal neighborhood on the back of a child who has row-boated from the Canary Islands and then artisinally prepared by their award winning refugee-chef who has used smoke signals to induce a warming effect over the Pacific Ocean which in turn allows the child labor-brought meat to slowly braise. Explanations are bullshit, your product should just be good. And also, stop changing your limited menu to cater to the faux-foodies of the neighborhood! You had simple stuff that was tasty...just leave it alone!
