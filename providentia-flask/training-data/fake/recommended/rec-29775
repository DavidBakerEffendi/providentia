I came here with a good friend when she visited for the weekend and we had a wonderful dinner.  There was a bit of a wait, but we shared a pitcher of sangria, which was quite delicious, and they were very nice about keeping the pitcher behind the bar for us since there was no place to sit until a table was ready for us.   We ordered the patatas bravas (obvi), fried fish, shrimp, and lamb skewers.  I love all things potatoes, and enjoyed the aioli on the patatas here.  The fried fish was good, nothing uniquely earthshattering, but the fish itself was quite tender and the fried, crunchy exterior was a nice balance.  The shrimp had a nice kick to it, and there were tons of shrimp, albeit they were smaller shrimp, but that just meant more bites.  Make sure to ask for bread to dip into all the extra garlic oil.  Finally the lamb was probably my favorite because it was so incredibly tender and the flavors were spot on.   We shared the fried custard for dessert, which was a nice and fun cap to the meal.  I was actually full after the amount we ordered, which was nice considering it's a tad on the pricy side.  The waitstaff was friendly, even though it was very crowded, even on a week night, the wine was flowing, and even though the place is small and dimly lit, I didn't find it hard to carry on a conversation amongst the mild din.   For a nice romantic tapas dinner, Tia Pol is a good bet.
