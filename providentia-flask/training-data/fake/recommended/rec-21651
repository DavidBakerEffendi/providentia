I just went here for about the 4th time.  Took Mom and my family for Mother's Day.  The place does need a makeover on the outside but inside is lovely.  There's a big bar when you walk in with main seating to your left and some smaller tables to your right.  It does tend to get noisy and could use some better lighting.  However, the food is the star here.  Almost everything I've had has been delicious, well prepared, beautifully served.  The wait staff is always cheerful and accomodating, eager to be of service which is unusual these days.  We had abundant appetizers, everything was large enough to share, even the salads.  They had a special of honey balsamic calamari which was out of this world.  I had a special steak for the day which was done just right, with tasty mashed taters.  The haricot vert needed another minute to be done to perfection as they were pretty raw tasting.  Also, just being nit picky - my steak was supposed to have melted smoked gouda cheese, which was not melted and the rind was left on which was unpleasant.  Everyone left some room to share a dessert or coffee. Cannoli's were delish, freshly filled with lots of chocolate chips on the ends but should have a note that there is anisette in the cream just in case someone has alcohol issues or doesn't like it which was the case with my sister in law.  I'd love to come for lunch and try a pizza next time.  It's a winner.
