This review is solely based on the Toasted Ricotta Gnocchi (It's the only thing I tasted). This is hands-down the very best gnocci I've ever had! The outside of the gnoccis are lightly pan fried or something, so there is a beautiful golden brown look to it and a slight crusty exterior. And then you bite through the perfect crust, to find a creamy, fluffy, perfectly doughy gnocci center. Â The rich truffle cream sauce poured over the top is sooooooo delicious. It has a well-balanced earthy truffle flavor that I simply cannot resist.. I will absolutely order this dish every single time I come back. Everyone that eats here should!
