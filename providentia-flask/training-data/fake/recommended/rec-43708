Came here for my friends birthday and had to be rolled out!!! We had the family style meal and it was AMAZING!! I was a hot mess eating the meatballs and sausage but I didn't care. Â  My favorites: -Their pizza is amazing here! The Vodka Sauce Pizza was my favorite -Pappardelle pasta with sausage -House salad (SO GOOD)
