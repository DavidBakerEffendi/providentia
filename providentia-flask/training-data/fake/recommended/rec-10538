Where's Darwin when you need him? The human race needs to evolve (yes I believe in evolution) to the point where we can dislocate our jaws like a snake so I can get the first bite of my burger without spraining my jaw. That's not a slam on these burgers which are juicy, thick and good. Grab a napkin, grab your burger open wide and... good luck. I'd say 'bistro' is a bit of a stretch for this beer and burger joint, but they do serve a tasty burger and fries at a good price. Wheelchair Access: YES, sort of. Strange, 3 votes say it is (now 4) and 7 say it isn't. It's certainly accessible getting in. The bathroom is not though - perhaps that's the reason for the 'no' votes. I guess if I went to drink beers the inaccessible bathroom would've been a problem.
