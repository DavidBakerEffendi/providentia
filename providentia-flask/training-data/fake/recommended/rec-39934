On your first trip here they will give you a samples of some of their meats. Delicious! Very friendly and food is excellent. The atmosphere is cramped and isn't much to look at. Could use a face lift and much larger patio (porch) or remove two tables from the porch. They will try to seat you on both sides of the porch that you will get to know the people next to you really quickly. But still very delicious with a huge menu and variety. The sandwiches are to huge to bite I used a fork. They mentioned they are getting new carpet tomorrow.
