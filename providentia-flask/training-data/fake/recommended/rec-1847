All you can eat pasta for $20-ish?! With appetizers? Yes please! The aioli was very good (fresh red bell pepper taste) Service was slow during our lunch though. During our visit they had butternut squash ravioli, tomato basil spaghetti and another ragu-ish looking pasta. Nothing amazing, but all were satisfying.
