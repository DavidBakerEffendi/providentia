Came here for brunch with friends at 10:30 on a Saturday. It wasn't super busy, but only 3 of the 7 of us had arrived on time. I assumed that they (like the rest of Manhattan) would make us wait until our whole party was arrived, but I was shocked when they sat us down anyway and welcomed us in. Then they served up the best hot toddy I've ever had in my life for the discounted price of $9! The food is awesome, the service is great, and the price is right. I highly recommend it. We left around noon and there was a solid crowd on the sidewalk waiting to get in, so come early.
