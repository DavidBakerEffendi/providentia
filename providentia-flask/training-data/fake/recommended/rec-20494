Solid pizza and excellent daily specials.  The specials change most days, so it's hard to know what's on the menu on any given day, but they are always good.  Had an eggplant, fresh mozzarella and roasted red pepper hero here that was one of best sandwiches I've ever had. Ingredients also seem to be very fresh.  Service is excellent.
