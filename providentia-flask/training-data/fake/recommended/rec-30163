Always a good standby for brunch, dinner, drinks, anytime really. Outdoor seating is limited but really casual and an overall chill spot. We went here to watch the World Cup and they were available seats which were hard to come by anywhere else in the East Village. Really unique but tasty food all day everyday. Definitely recommend it if you're not against a little food adventure.
