I get the Rachel (turkey reuben) when I go here.  It's always filling and delicious - one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.  The butchers are really nice and sometimes offer samples of meat and cheese if the lunch rush is slowing things down. Whenever I go here, I consider it a treat.  Unfortunately, this is not a good thing.  The sandwiches are pricey and the wait is excruciatingly long at times.  It sucks that I can only go here when I have some time to kill and have some money burning in my pocket.  Otherwise, I'd be here much more often.
