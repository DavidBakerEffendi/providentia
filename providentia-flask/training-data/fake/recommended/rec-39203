I have been to this diner probably a million times. Its one of the best diners i have eaten in. It is super clean and the servers are helpful. On the weekends, expect to wait at least 20-25 minutes to get a table. Its crowded even on week nights. The prices are great and portions as phenomenal. The shakes, burgers, Pasta are superb. Fresh dinner rolls. Their pancakes are very very famous. Salads are huge and almost everyone takes back leftovers home because they serve so much food. Cheesecakes and pie ala mode was delish!
