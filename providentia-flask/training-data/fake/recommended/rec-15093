Meh. We came here for dinner a few weeks ago around 7:30pm.   There was one large table of folks just leaving and two others just arrived.  Other than that we had the place to ourselves. We ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen and the Veggie Curry Ramen.  Unfortunately, neither were worth writing home about.  There was an absence of Miso in the Miso Ramen which was over-compensated with a overly-generous squirt of unabashedly spicy chili oil.  The Vegetable Curry Ramen didn't have any familiar curry spice flavor to it.  In fact, it brought me back to memories of my student life in the UK eating a Curry Flavored Pot Noodle for lunch - a similarly unsatisfying gastronomic experience. Overall, both dishes had the same generic, bland, overly salty underpinnings, each with some extras added to afford the different names on the menu. I'm hoping they had a bad night because I'd really like to try HJ House again and see them at their best.
