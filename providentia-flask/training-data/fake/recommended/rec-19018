My friend and I went to try this one day.  It was a spreading rumor about how good the burger is.  Unfortunately, it wasn't up to my expectations.... We ordered the Manly burger, the Original burger, and the Truffle fries to share.  Both burgers were made medium rare and this was my take on everything: Manly burger = Extremely salty. Although I like the execution method.  Instead of just slabs of bacon on the burger, the chef had minced up the bacon and spread it across the burger so that each bite contains bacon!   Original burger = I liked this one better than the Manly burger.  However, the meat they use is really fat and not best incorporated.  As I bite into the burger, oil drizzles down my arm.  In the end, even though I only ate half a burger, I felt extremely greasy inside. Truffle fries = nothing special about it.  The "Truffle" is really just a layer of truffled cheese on top.  Once the top layer of fries is done, you end up with just regular fries. Sauce on the side = I really like their Umami ketcup.  It's interesting but not so much that it would entice me to come back.
