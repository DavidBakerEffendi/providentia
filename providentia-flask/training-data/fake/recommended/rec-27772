After attempting to have dinner at no less than four other establishments in downtown Burlington last Saturday night, my sister and I gave up and walked into Lakeview House. This was the one restaurant in the entire area that didn't have a line out the door. It was the night before the Burlington Marathon and runners everywhere were carb loading, myself included. Walking in through the back entrance (the only entrance that makes sense through the parking lot) is a chore in foul weather. The rain pours down off the roof and drenches you as you walk in. If you're a nimble jumper, you will still get soaked. Inside, it's pleasant enough. The bar and tables are cozy and the staff are friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, there is nothing good to say about the food. If you're coming just to have a beer with friends, you'll be fine. Just don't order anything to eat because everything is bland and boring. Specifically the calamari is the worst I've ever had. Not only that but half the plate is actually just breaded garlic. I don't know about you but when I eat calamari, I don't like to be fooled into eating garlic. My main course, shrimp linguine, served its purpose. It filled me up with carbs for my big race the following morning. However, it had virtually no taste. Pepper helped a smidge, I suppose. But the dish was just incredibly disappointing. My sister's meal, a simple burger, was also tasteless. It was shocking that nothing we ate was good. The only saving grace here is that our waiter and other servers couldn't have been more friendly. They are the reason for the two stars. Sadly, their cheerful demeanors could do nothing to improve the food.
