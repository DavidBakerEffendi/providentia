Went here Sunday night to watch the Mavs Heat game and to get faded on my last night out in New York.  They got the projector screen for the big games and a couple TVs on the side showing other games.  Rectangular bar in the middle is pretty dope (but kinda wack for not having any Crown Royal in stock).  Didn't check out their food menu because we were already full. They play some good music here.  Heard an assortment of 80s and 90s hip hop, funk, pop, old school, R&B, and some other jams. Bartenders were pretty cool too, especially the female one with the cherry blossom tattoos on her forearm.  She gets an A in my cool book for being a San Francisco Giants fan.  Holler!  =) But pretty dope/chill lounge in the East Village if you're around this area.  I'm sure their food is good too. Seems like a dope date stop to get your date inebriated at.
