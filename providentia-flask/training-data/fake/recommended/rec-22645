Hipster Bar in Bay Ridge that is kid friendly? Awesome. I was a fan of the peach cider and the sweet potato fries were pretty good albeit a little salty. But I guess that just gets you drinking more. The staff was friendly and the list of beers was pretty good. The outside seating area? Amazing. They even have high chairs. All in all, I could see this becoming a regular place for us since it close by. The hot dogs though? I wasn't impressed. This is not a place where you come for food. Snacks and beers? Great. But I expected more from the hot dogs seeing as that's suppose to be part of the draw. I got the Johnny Cash hot dog and to me it seemed like it was canned chili and canned cheese. It wasn't bad but I just expected more, which I guess is my fault. If your vision of the perfect chili dog is a messy hot dog filled to the brim with homemade chili, shredded cheese, and diced onions, well you won't find that here. That being said all the other things that Lock Yard has going for it out weighs the lacking hot dogs.
