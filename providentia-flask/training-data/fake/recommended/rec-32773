This place is delicious. I live near Springfield and drive 35 minutes to this location PASSED other Indian restaurants just to go here. Reasonable pricing, but if it was more expensive I'd still happily pay. Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the fact it's always empty when I come to eat. However this would be a nice first date spot because it's quiet.
