Cuba is an adorable little place in my neighborhood, and the atmosphere inside the restaurant made me want to fly away to old Havana.  The Mr. and I came here this summer for a long overdue date night, and the ambiance was lovely with beautiful music flowing out of the restaurant's open windows.  Once inside, it was quite cramped, and we were stuck in the backroom with a rather large (and rowdy) party.  Other than that, dinner flowed nicely with interesting food and friendly service.  The Mr. loved the crab salad and I found the ceviche delightful.  While the food didn't blow me away, the highlight of our dining experience was certainly the energy and ambiance of the restaurant.  For that alone, we will be back.
