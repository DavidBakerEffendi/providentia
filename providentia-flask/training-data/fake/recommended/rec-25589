The service is spotty, the menu hasn't been updated since the Ford administration and the drinks could peel paint off of a '73 Gremlin, but I love it with all my heart. It's one of the last remnants of Trader Vic's-style tiki culture and the last such establishment in this area since the Jade Fountain mini-chain and Bloomfield's Pu Pu Inn closed. The backlit photos of Polynesian islands, the wilting bamboo huts, the carved tiki god tumblers, the blowfish lamps -- they're all continuations of a great theme. I'll give you that this place is old, but as Stevie Wonder says, never is it dirty. They keep the place in outstanding condition and keep the American Chinese fare better than the area's average. The crab rangoon and lo mein are excellent complements to an evening of karaoke and comaraderie. Some people appreciate what this place and its longevity, but some don't. I'm just glad to see that there's been more of the former than the latter in recent years.
