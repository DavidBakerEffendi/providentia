Johnny Brenda's is/was so far ahead of it's time... I can't think that far back. About 6 years ago, 2 friends of mine got bartending gigs here. At that time it was a small/medium sized room with a kitchen in the back. This was a number of years before the renovation of girard ave and 2nd street. The owners of this restaurant/bar/venue may be 2 of the most intelligent people in the biz. Slowly but surely they expanded the main room, added a "back" bar, a handicap bathroom...and as time progressed, a live music venue upstairs. I was lucky enough to land a job bartending here for a number of years and witnessed the day in/day out creation of the venue. It was remarkable to see the care and craftmanship that went into it's design, layout, and so on. I've been fortunate enough to perform on the stage and also throw some dj parties here. During my time as a bartender, I found the reviews of the various all draft selection of beers and food to always receive rave reviews from the customer base, and I back those reviews personally as well. Johnny Brenda's is becoming a landmark destination for, I believe, the city of Philadelphia, and possibly the entire country...very similar to what JC Dobbs was throughout the 80s and into the early 90s. This is an establishment that TRUELY was, and still is, groundbreaking.
