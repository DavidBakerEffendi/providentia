Carnitas taco (crispy): meat tender, juicy, and filled to the brim of the tortilla. Salsa on the other hand was lacking in flavor. Put some more onion and cilantro in there and we can start talking authenic. Making it "picante" wouldn't hurt either. Chicken Quesadilla: chicken are a bit over seasoned and the queso is not what I was expecting. I want "quesadilla," not a crispy tortilla with a slice of cheese. But if you just consider that as a wrap, then good job Dos Toros. Burritos: did not have, but saw someone else ordered it and it was packed like Burro. Looks good for the price. Take that Chipotle! Coming from San Diego, these tacos are wimpy satification. But since they boast "SF taqueria experience," then I guess it's a Nor-Cal sensation. I guess Nor-Cal people are more used to pricey imitation tacos than the rest of us in the Southland.
