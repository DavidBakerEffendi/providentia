Oh Giorgio, I think I love you! Okay maybe not you (he is a sweet guy!) but your menu. I was convinced that I would never be able to order pasta dishes at restaurants.. Not only could I but given a full array of gluten free options (peak at their menu online). GF bread, GF dessert.. I was in food heaven. The staff is super friendly and menu aware. Oh did I forget to mention, we made our "reservation" 2 hours prior to dining? Giorgio said "no problem friend." I'll most definitely be back and I recommend this place to everyone not just those who are gluten free!
