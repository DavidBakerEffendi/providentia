Outstanding and impeccable service at this secret jewel hidden in midtown.  I was smitten by the team of service professionals attending to my every desire and even providing a special perch for my purse. About every 2 minutes another morsel was dropped at our table. The evening passed in a whirlwind of excitement, pleasure and anticipation on what the chef would send next! Wine and cocktails equally up to snuff.  Hang on to your wallets!!
