I used a groupon here and it was a very good experience. The service was 5 stars. Our waitress was very nice and I liked that they wore gloves when handling the food. It was my boyfriends birthday and they offered cake which we ended up not taking but it was a nice gesture. The groupon was for an appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 drinks, however they did require a separate purchase, which could be anything I chose a slice of cake which was only 3 dollars so was still worth it. The place was small but very clean and well kept and the staff were all very nice and quick. The food was between 3.5-4 stars. I would definitely return here. They were playing slow reggae music which made the atmosphere even more friendly and relaxing.
