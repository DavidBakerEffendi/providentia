Sit at the bar & get $5 buck rolling rocks. Burgers were ok & they are on scoutmob so the reason we went. Service was fine but I didn't like the vibe, kinda of dinghy & dirty. Maybe just not for me but it is a local dive patroned by a lot of regulars it seems. It just isn't for me, I do not like sanitizing everything before I eat in a place.
