Having dined here several times in the past, my husband and I decided to have our rehearsal dinner at Spasso based on the service and food we have enjoyed previously. Fortunately, this time around was no different. With a large party of about 25 people, we were treated well, with our glasses consistently filled and the food turning out deliciously considering the amount of people in attendance. They were graciously accommodating and we'll gladly return again in the future!
