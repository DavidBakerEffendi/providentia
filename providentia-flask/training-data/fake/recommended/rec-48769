This is undoubtedly my favorite Thai restaurant. They have literally never done anything wrong. Staff is very friendly and patient. The decor is beautiful. Service is great, albeit slightly slow. My favorites here are the Pad Thai, the Red Curry with Chicken and the Salmon which is served in Green Curry. The curry dishes are served with jasmine rice. It's kind of expensive but so so worth the price!
