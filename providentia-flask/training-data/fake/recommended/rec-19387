Mood Cafe is still delicious, even two years later! My best friend and I went back yesterday to celebrate her birthday and, yet again, the owner asked if it was our first time and offered to make us lassis until we were satisfied. As always, the food was delicious and I only needed my lassi made once. I ordered the Queen lassi - yes, based on the name alone - and could not have asked for a more delicious drink.
