Yummy stuff, so happy for places that concentrate on quality ingredients and preparation.  Local, humanly killed protein is very important to me, and its nice to find a place where you can get that to-go.  Things are hit or miss though.  The prices are a pretty high as well.  The chicken, the kale chips, the bahn mi, the miso ginger salad, and the mac and cheese are excellent.  The corn muffins leave much to be desired.  Great to pop in for a picnic lunch.
