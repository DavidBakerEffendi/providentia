I was really not impressed with this place at all. I've heard a few people say it was great, but maybe that was a while ago. The atmosphere was pretty cool and the staff was very friendly and accommodating. Dim lighting, but I kind of like that. I started with the Tortilla Soup for an appetizer. So much salt in there, I thought I was drinking an actual tortilla. I finished with the flavorless Carnita Tacos. They came out kinda cold, meat was dry and flavorless, and I think they forgot the Orange Morita sauce on two of my three little tacos. I managed to sneak an Adobo Tuna Tostada from my friend, which was actually pretty tasty. I would recommend trying those. For a drink, the cinnamon infused "El Diablo" was pretty tasty. Thumbs up there. Overall: the small portions and lack of flavor make you regret the price you're paying.
