The secrecy and all the "effort" you have to go through to get a reservation pays off ones you get in. We were in New York last August and were lucky to get a table reservation, even with a short notice. I sent them an email for a request, where i also told a little bit of my self and why i wanted to dine at the Bohemian. As a big surprise, i got a very polite and friendly reply, including a phone number. The place was "hard" to find, due to the secret location behind a butcher. But after the hall way was found, there was just to ring the door bell to get in. The name Bohemian describes the style of the restaurant perfectly, it was very bohemian and i loved the style. The atmosphere of the restaurant is a perfect mix of trendy, cozy and hip and it is a perfect place to take some who you want to impress or have a romantic evening with. Everything is surprisingly inexpensive and for the first timers i definitely recommend the tasting menu and try the drinks, they are amazing! The quality, taste and freshness of the food is superb, nothing more to add! Most definitely the best dinner in the US we've ever had and this time we traveled around the country and even did some Michelin star restaurants, but nothing beats Bohemian with the over all experience. We are going to New York again in August (actually only 8 days left :)) and can't wait to have our second dinner at the Bohemian! They told us to make a table reservation a month ahead, so i stayed up late on July the 2nd (due to the time difference) and got us a reservation. Next day was a tired day at work, but what wouldn't you do to get a reservation to the Bohemian :). I hope this place stays as a hidden gem and keeps their mystery.
