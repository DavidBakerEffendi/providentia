Nice small cozy place. We didn't make reservation for this restaurant, and was seated within 5 mins for 3 ppl on a Saturday night @ around 9:30pm. The waiters were polite, and their services were great. It wasn't a drag trying to get eye contact with the waiters. They were cautious of their customers within their peripheral views. Appetizer: Duck Meat Balls & Scallops- Both very tasty. The texture of the meatballs were perfectly soft and moist. Scallops were fresh (raw). Entree: Duck- perfectly cooked med. No gamy taste. (winner of the three entrees) Redsnapper- nothing special. Pork Belly (normally not a fan)- it was tasty, and wasn't too fatty. Good choice if you're a pork belly fan. Dessert: Sundae & Pear plate - This was the spoiler of the night. Dessert sucked. The pear plate was tasteless. Sundae had a weird mixture of passion fruit seed (not sure exactly what). Tasted like chocolate with whip-cream, vanilla ice cream , and a tangy/bitter fruit or seed? Wasn't a good pairing.   Overall: I'd skip dessert and splurge more on the appetizer/entrees. Don't save ur  stomach ! City prices as normal, more to the med to high range with a whole course meal. I'd take off half a star for the dessert spoiler. Therefore 3.5 stars! How can you end a perfect meal without a perfect ending? :(
