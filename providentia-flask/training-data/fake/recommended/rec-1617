So I was pumped to go here after seeing this on the Food Network. The most impressive thing about this place is the hype. The sub was ok but it was pricey and small. The building was as impressive as the hype. It towers over Pat's Steaks which is why I went to Geno's on this trip. Next time I'll check out Pat's. 1 sub "wit" provolone was $8. Include 2 medium soda's and a fry and for a total of $16. Captain Harvey's here in Baltimore is WAAAAYYYYYYY better. Just saying!
