The food was fine. No complaints. Flatbread could have been hotter but whatever. The music though....holy shit...the music was atrocious. I know that seems like a weird complaint, but my fiancee and I went in at 11pm for a late dinner, we were kinda tired and just looking for a nice bite and a good glass of wine, and in spite of the room having a kind of cozy, rustic Italian, wine bar feel....it seemed someone has stolen a fourteen year-old girl's ipod and was letting it ride all through the late night service. Justin Bieber, Carly Rae Jepsen remixes...kinda like a Chelsea gay bar...no joke. I asked our server, who incidentally was lovely and knowledgeable, about the music and she said...."Yeah, it's my managers iPod, upbeat music kinda helps people stay later." So I get it. But couldn't it have been Motown, or Stones or anything else? It was bad and club-y and nauseating. If I had been the owner and walked in to a manger hijacking the ambiance of my upper west side Italian haunt I would have been irate.
