The ambience plus the service and good food, definitely something I'll be coming back to. There are tons of selections on their Crepe menu and I was impressed :) I ordered the Le Normande: chicken, mushroom, swiss, basil, amazing (oh wait, that's not an ingredient). The Brunch special seems great too so I'll definitely be back :)
