My friends have raved about Yakitori Boy so when I came home to Philly for the holidays I told them they had to take me there. We went to Yakitori Boy at 11:30pm on a Monday night and I was surprised the place was still open. Since my friends are repeat offenders, I told them go just order whatever they usually get and we'd all share. I can say that everything we order was yummy in my tummy! I definitely plan on going back to Yakitori Boy....I made that promise to my stomach. My favorites were: -Ika Yaki (Grilled whole squid. Topped with soy sake) -Beef Negimaki (Thin sliced beef rolled with scallion, bean sprout, broccoli, and carrot and marinated with teriyaki sauce) -J Roll
