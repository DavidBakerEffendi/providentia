It would not matter how good the food was. We just left Melograno. My head is splitting and my ears hurt. Making matters worse, we dined there with old friends and could not have a  conversation. For years Melograno has had complaints about the noise level in their restaurant. For years, they have ignored those complaints. The average age in the restaurant was 35.  Perhaps this is the generation that not only tolerates loud noise, but revels in it. Having dinner at Melograno was not that far  from attending a rock concert. We did not order dessert or coffee.  It was out of the question and we could not wait to bolt for the door. A restaurant owner who does not make any attempt to do ANYTHING about the madness is not worth having customers. But................having said that, if people keep coming, and keep allowing this kind of invasion on their ears, why would the owner have to make any changes. By patronizing this restaurant you are saying, "It's OK to damage my ears." It's OK for me to pay to be here when you do not care about the comfort of your customers. Better to have dinner in a bowling alley then at Melograno. What that says to us is, "I do not care about you. If you keep coming, I will keep disrespecting your comfort."  Same old, same old. We will never return.  And You.........boycott, until he turns down the volume and sound proofs this place.
