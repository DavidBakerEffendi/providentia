I know that this Blue Ribbon is a famous SOHO institution, but this was my first time being there. It's a bit small and there was a 45 minute wait, but we were able to grab bar seating right away, which was fine. While looking over the wine list we were asked by the bartender if we needed any help. We told him that we wanted a "reasonable" bottle of wine in the $30-$40 dollar range...he chuckled, and went on a weird rant about not being able to find that anymore. Luckily, the man who runs the raw bar station was WONDERFUL. He was extremely helpful and friendly, giving us pointers on how to eat the bone marrow and ox tail, which was delicious. He very much compensated for his awkward bartender colleague. All in all I more than likely won't be back. The food was good, but significantly over priced.
