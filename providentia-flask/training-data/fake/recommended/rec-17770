I live in nyc but was visiting a friend's family out in Jerz for the weekend. we went out to a few different restaurants and Caldwell's was by far the best quality in terms of food. I do not get out much for seafood in the city, so this was a great treat. service and ambiance was fine as well, but the food was the best part!
