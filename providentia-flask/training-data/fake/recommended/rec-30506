So weirdly, I think I was prepared not to love this place b/c I don't like the name -- but fortunately, I was ravenous enough by the time we sat down that I didn't really care, and was just thrilled for them to put food in front of me. Rolled in with a party of 10 at 8p on a Saturday night and the place was hopping -- you'll pretty much only be able to talk to those immediately around you, so choose your seat carefully. We ordered an obscene amount of food -- here goes my assessment: - Hommus w/ pinenuts: not terribly flavorful, the only thing I didn't love. - Baba G : smoky, luscious, creamy. - Fattoush salad (an be done GF, if you're curious): fresh, crisp...lettucey? - Moussaka: sweet, soft, yum. - Falafel: didn't eat, put supposed to be tender and yum. - Brussel sprouts: GET THESE. NOW. BUY OUT THE KITCHEN. Even if you don't like sprouts usually. Sweet, tender, amazing. - Arnabet Meeke (cauli): tasty. - Octopus: ORDER THIS. NOW. - Chicken livers/ Veal bacon "sliders"/duck schwarma: I don't eat this stuff, but apparently the veal bacon was stuff of legend, and the duck scwarma, while dry this time, has been amazing on previous visits. - "Candy Bar": chocolate + fig = godliness. Yummmmmm. Did not want to share. We had 3 bottles of a nice tempranillo that was abt $45/bottle -- and I think the total bill was $75ish each, incl tip. Our actual waitress was lovely, but the busboys all cleared plates too early. Yes, I do want to scrape each lick of that labneh from the plates. Oh, and the pita they serve w/ it is amazinnnnng.
