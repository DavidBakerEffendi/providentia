Boyfriend and I dined here on an UrbanDaddy deal- tapas, pizza, and cocktails. Absolutely loved the ambience, and saw many other dates taking place (as well as one or two with kids tagging along). Extremely attentive wait staff. The mushroom and artichoke pizza was delicious. Drinks weren't spectacular: watermelon martini was a bit too sweet and the olive cocktail was a little too olive-y, but I'd write home about the food for sure. I'd definitely come back for tapas any night of the week. It's upscale dining for a moderate pricetag-- such a rare combination!
