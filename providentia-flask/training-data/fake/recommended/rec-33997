4 star food, 1.5 star ambiance. Roberta's is the type of place I think some people think is "cool" and as a result some really obnoxious types flock here. Usually I don't really mind whatever scene hangs out at a certain place. But at Roberta's you must sit basically cheek to cheek to another party on a wobbly bench, so your fellow diners are unavoidable and you can't help but hear every word of their annoying conversation. Its "cute" looking and all and "kewl" cause its like this rustic cafeteria in what looks like a cement box, but I am usually too turned off by the ambiance and my surroundings to enjoy the decent food. I had a great pizza with honey and spicy sopresatta. It was very good! I also enjoyed my mint lemonade. Would have been one star if the food was shitty.
