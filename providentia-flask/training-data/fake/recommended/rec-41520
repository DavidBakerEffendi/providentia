Quissam our server was awesome! Expect a Young hip ambiance with relevant music playing in the bacKground. Drinks are a little weak go with the margarita. We had the crab with guacamole that was a perfect share. A little short on the crab but plentiful on chips and guacamole. The shrimp quesadilla is more like a small pizza but it's good. The sea bass tacos are bad real bad as in real good. They have a hint of coconut. The mahi mahi taco is the fried goodness equivalent of the sea bass. Get that too!
