Good breakfast place! Definitely recommend to make a reservation for brunch on the weekends. Had eggs florentine Benedict. Egg was excellent. Also ordered Vanilla bean French toast which was very tasty. However still mad the waitress forgetting to tell us the special of the day and we would have definitely ordered it if she had told us. Good but not sure if it's a place I would go back to when on NYC again.
