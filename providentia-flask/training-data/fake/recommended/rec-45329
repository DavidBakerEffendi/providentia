Came here upon word of mouth advice. Hot morning waiting out front for brunch and we notice a very oily sludge on the sidewalk right in font of the restaurant. Some of us waiting start talking about oily sidewalk and the smell emanating from the ground in the heat...it looks like they clean their kitchen mats every night here -  right in front of the restaurant? Disgusting. It stank so bad - I wonder if the neighbors complain about this - is there not a better place to wash kitchen mats? So we left, grossed out and still hungry...the other people we were talking to asked us where to go, we advised, they left too. Owners at Miriam you need to take better  care to the outside of your restaurant where we were all waiting patiently and left...please clean your sidewalk, it's disgusting.
