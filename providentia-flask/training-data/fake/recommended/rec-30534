#9 Went here for brunch and was good.  Def nice atmosphere and good choices.  Tried a number of the appetizers but really just remember the caramel brioche was good.   Went for the baked eggs in spicy sauce and again it didn't blow my mind.  It's eggs and wasn't as warm as I would have liked my dish to be.  But there was 8 of us so maybe it was hard to keep everything warm. The sausage and bacon were the stars on the menu and great sides to share. Overall a nice aexperience and would return with a group.  It does get busy and at times was hard to get any attention from any of the servers. 3 stars is all it's worth.
