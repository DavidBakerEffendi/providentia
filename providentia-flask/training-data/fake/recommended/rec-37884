I took my sister here on her bachelorette over the weekend and it was awful! The waitress was rude, by the time the last person in our 6 person party got her beer 2 of us were already finished ours, it took about 20 minutes to get 6 beers that we ordered at the same time. We were sat upstairs by a closet when there was plenty of seating downstairs, and two of the beers were warm and gross. When we asked for manager our waitress told us she is the manager and asked "is there a problem?' It was very unprofessional. We will not be back
