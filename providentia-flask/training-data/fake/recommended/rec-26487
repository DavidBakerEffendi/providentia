I was in the back room for a big dinner and it was uncomfortably hot. The decor, service and vibe was nice but I was not impressed with the food. It was not that the portions were small but all the dishes just looked bare. The arctic char I had was extremely salty and under cooked. Overall, not impressed. At this price point, I think you can easily find somewhere better in the area.
