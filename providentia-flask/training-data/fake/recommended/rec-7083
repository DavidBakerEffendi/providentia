Went in based on positive reviews. Wanted two bubbles teas and some dumplings. The cashier spilled the powder to make the tea on the restaurant floor, scooped it up, and proceeded to place it in our tea blend. We requested our money back and walked out. Absolutely disgusting. Will never go there again or recommend based on substandard cleanliness.
