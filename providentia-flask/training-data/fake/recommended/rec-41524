Everything was delicious (we had 7 dishes among the 3 of us). Food came extremely quickly Â (like 5 mins after we ordered!) and service was quite awesome. The garlic shrimp, lamb skewer and octopus salad were my favorites! Without wine, I think the bill was sub $100. Why not 5 stars? The place was a bit small and tables were small. I am also not a huge fan of high chairs when it comes to eating... Oh! And they don't have my favorite bacon wrapped dates... :(
