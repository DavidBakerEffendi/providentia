Had a nice experience here when I went for the first time a few weeks ago. We started off with the squid and chick pea ragu. I enjoyed the dish, but my date really hates olives and they were chopped up in the dish but not listed in the ingredients. For dinner, I had the grilled duck breast with brussel sprouts and blood orange, which was fantastic. I was worried about the portion when it first came out, but I was satisfied afterward. For dessert we split the flan and the polenta with gianduia mousse and candied hazelnuts. The flan is more like a chocolate lava cake, which the waiter informed us of before we ordered. It was good, but the polenta was a home run. Our waiter said it was his favorite and we were definitely glad we took his suggestion.
