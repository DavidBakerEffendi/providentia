Went early with a reservation @ 4pm on a saturday evening before going to see Once on Broadway. It was pretty empty. They sat  us upstairs. A little warm on a hot summer day up there. Wait staff was attentive and knowledgable, although a little slow on the water refills. Ok , about the food. Three apps, all very small portions. Mine, polentina with melted cheese and Speck prosciutto,  very good. Other app was a seasonal special,  rice ball with cheese and saffron,  very little saffron flavor. Last was mozzarella en carozza. Again small and quite bland. It was not your normal fried mozzarella ,but although it was different it wasn't better. Saving grace was the ceaser salad served table side. A little over dressed but tasty. Dinner was as under seasoned as the apps. I had the peperoni ripieni stuffed peppers , it had the beef, pork, veal meat combo, it was somewhat tasty yet once again, you guessed it, under seasoned. Not worth $22. They put salt and pepper on the table because you are going to need them. The wife had the short rib special, which looked great but again was lacking big flavor, the wine reduction sauce helped a little. Last main course was the Maiale Arista, the pulled pork, $28 for a tiny portion of the blandest pulled pork on the planet. We skipped dessert and headed over to Schmackery around the corner for some kick ass cookies. All in all a very disappointing meal from a restaurant owned by one of my cooking idols. I don't think Lydia would approve.
