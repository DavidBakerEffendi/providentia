Went with friends for lunch during Restaurant Week; wasn't overly impressed, considering all the hype. The service was good, though. I definitely felt cramped in there. We had wine at the bar while waiting to be seated, and I kept getting bumped by employees walking by. I was with five others, and we were pretty much sitting elbow to elbow at our table. The app was a plate of goat cheese and olive oil which was pretty good. However, the bread that came with it was stale and crusty. I got the Sunday ragu pasta entree, which said it had pork in it. There were MAYBE three little pieces! The dessert....that was most definitely the best part. WOW. Salted caramel budino!! Absolutely amazingly delicioso!!!
