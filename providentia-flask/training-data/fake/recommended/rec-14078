Did I really just pay $7 for a bottle of Brooklyn beer at MSB? Yes. Yes I did. And I'm ashamed. I'm ashamed I paid nearly $125 (including tax and tip) for our dinner for two for food that was good, not great, and but a single beer per person. Clearly value is not one of the MSB's strong points. The food is all well-prepared, but the experience falls short. Beer served in bottles? Napkins stacked high on the table with the chopsticks? Sure, in a dive it works, but in a restaurant where a $23 entree is on the low end, the charmlessness falls flat. Dont' get me wrong - we liked our food. The chawanmushi with snails was unexceptional, but at least the custard wasn't overcooked. The roasted mushroom salad was exceptionally tasty, and we both adored it and wished for seconds. The calamari salad was fun to eat and had an entertaining variety of onions, pickled. We enjoyed the crab claws but found them difficult to eat without shellfish forks. Our branzino was tasty, slightly overcooked, and the oil-based sauce was interesting but not exceptional. Perhaps we didn't enjoy it as much as carnivores because we avoided pork, offal, and other meats. But service is service, value is value, and the MSB just fell short on the latter.
