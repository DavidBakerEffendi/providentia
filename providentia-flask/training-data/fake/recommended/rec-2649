Is it just me or do others feel the same way in wanting a little more sauce and popping flavors to their stir fry? Definitely tastes healthy. Tastes good but I actually almost want to say it's like a tad under where you would want it. I'm sure you won't walk by the place without knowing it. You can smell the place just walking down the same block on it. Smells great, just wish it was soaked a little more in its sauces
