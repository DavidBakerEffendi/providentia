Had an art gallery to attend and decided to eat before hand. The place we tried was packed and the wait was forever. I quickly took out my phone to look places nearby on Yelp which accept credit and are well reviewed. My search leads me down the block to Rye, a debate begins on whether or not we should go in. Then we notice a sign saying, "$5 Dollar Old Fashioneds and $5 Dollar Cheeseburgers." Debate ends! The place seemed to cater to those who wanted a fine dinning experience as well as someone who was just looking to get a drink or two. We sat ourselves by the bar and ordered one of the best Old Fashioned's I've had in my life. The bar was beautiful and fully stocked. The bartender was super helpful and had all our questions answered. Awesome guy! They have a great $6 dollar shot and beer combo. Now most places that do this, will offer you a well shot (Jim Bean, if you're lucky or some other low shelf liquor) and cheap beer (PBR, High Life). I got a shot of Jameson and Hefenweizen, I don't think that can be beat. My friend settles on the cheeseburger while I decided to be adventurous. I've never seen duck confit with gnocchi before, so my selection was easy. Great combo of the two and ate every bite. They boil their gnocchi and then pan fry it slightly, giving it a slight crisp which was nice. I'm sold on this place. You will be too. I'm coming back for the meatloaf sandwich.
