We love Divina.  I love their homemade pastas and service is always great.  My husband loves their gnocchi.  Its not always easy to get a reservation, because it's not a huge dining room, however, that just means the food and service is immaculate and people are always returning guests.  Therefore, BOOK A RESERVATION.  Enjoy!!!
