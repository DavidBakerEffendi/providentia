Of course we'd heard about Grimaldi's forever; wanted to try it but never fancied waiting outside on a very long line.  Got the opportunity a few weeks ago by showing up on the early side on a weeknight, and so found a much shorter line than usual, so we were happy. Not so terribly happy when we got our pizza, though.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad - but hey, it was not great, certainly not the be-all and end-all of pizza as we had been expecting from all the hype. For me, great crust is the holy grail of pizza, and this was NOT great crust.  In fact, it was pretty bad - undercooked, flavorless, soggy and mushy; had to eat it with a knife and fork - unforgiveable.  Sauce and cheese were ok, nothing at all special.  Ordered ham on my pizza (I know, sounds weird, but I wasn't in the mood for the grease of sausage or pepperoni, and they didn't offer chicken).  I was expecting some nice slices of flavorful ham; what I got were a few teensy cubes of run-of-the-mill boiled ham sprinkled over the top.  That led me to believe Grimaldi's just doesn't care about their toppings. For my money and to my palate, this place is just coasting on their fame, offering a mediocre, ho-hum product that certainly does NOT live up to the hype and is DEFINITELY not worth waiting around on the sidewalk for hours.  Go somewhere else - venture deeper into Brooklyn to DiFara or L&B Spumoni Gardens if you want really excellent pizza.
