Lines, long lines, nothing but lines. Keep in mind this was a Sunday afternoon. Every place we tried to eat...there was a line. The worst part was that it appeared the eatery employees did not seem motivated, at all, to try to move the people. They moved at a snail's pace and the line just kep on growing. Maybe they thought it was cool to have a crowd in front of their establishment.
