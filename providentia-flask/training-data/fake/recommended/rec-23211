My husband booked this restaurant with high hopes, being that I love Greek food! We walked in and the decor was friendly and inviting, too bad the rest of the night didn't go as well... The four of us were placed in a table in the corner - we rejected that and then were shown downstairs (which smelled like an outhouse at a nasty summer camp or beach) to another table in the dark jungle - so we moved again. Once we settled in, the waiter came by and it was difficult to hear him from the get go. My husband ordered a white bean soap (soup) and it tasted like dishwater (and there were maybe four beans amid the cloudy water. The entrees were undercooked and tiny - more like appetizer portions than entrees. I ordered a chicken souvlaki, the chicken pieces were pink in the middle. When I made a mention of this to the waiter, he bit my head off. He was deeply offended that I was questioning the way the chicken was cooked. He said the chicken was steamed??? The chicken was supposed to be barbecued. Good thing the company was good or this dinner would have been a complete disaster! Stay away from this fake Greek place. I grew up going to awesome Greek Restaurants in Michigan's: 'Greek Town'. I was shocked to see that people were waiting to get into this restaurant...
