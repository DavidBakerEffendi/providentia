My food came late, and wrong. I ordered a turkey bacon sub, it came with no bacon. This was the first time I've ordered so I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, but looks like other yelpers had the same problems. Leaving off the bacon is a sin. My dumb plain turkey sandwich was ok. I originally gave this 2 stars, but the restaurant refunded me, which was nice. I think 3 stars is the max for a place that brings the wrong food late, though.
