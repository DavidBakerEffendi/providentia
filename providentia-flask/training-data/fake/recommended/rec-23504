You've got two basic options at Pommes Frites: french fries or poutine. Their poutine gravy doesn't bring back wonderful memories of Montreal for me, something just didn't taste the same...  but their french fries are amazing... fresh fried with a variety of sauces (war sauce and irish curry are probably my favorites, but I haven't tried every flavor). You get a lot of fries -- even if you're splitting an order with another person, a single order is probably enough.  If you're eating more than a single order yourself on a semi-regular basis then hopefully you've got the metabolism of a twitchy lab mouse because I don't even want to contemplate the caloric content involved. I've never experienced it myself, but allegedly Burp Castle (close by) has their fries at their happy hour, so if you like the fries and you like good beer, that is certainly worth looking into!
