SO DISAPPOINTED. The Fries were my highlight. The fries deserve 5 stars! I loved skinny crunchy fries. BUT i did not appreciate truffle oil ketchup or any of their sauces and sauce is one of the most important things. The burger was just greasy and lacked salt. The duck burger was just as greasy. I felt my arteries clogging as I took each bite. My hands were super oily from holding up the burger I had to wash it immediately. The oil seeps through my many many napkins. Yeap, I love oily food, but this experience was double the oil to me!
