Went here for my girlfriend's birthday party with her family the day before Valentine's day. Everyone had a different spice preference and level of adventure they wanted to experience, but it was great because the chef came out, answered all of our questions, and recommended some of his favorite dishes. We ordered multiple appetizers and an entree for everyone, but ate family style so everyone could enjoy a little bit of everything. Some of our favorites were the mutton sukka masala (first time eating goat for most of us), the lamb chops, and of course the chicken lolipops (a take on buffalo wings). Even though half of us had never tried Indian food before, there was not a dish that anyone disliked and the prices were very reasonable! My girlfriend and I will definitely be revisiting Arusuvai again in the near future! It's only been a week and we're already talking about returning for dinner one night this week!
