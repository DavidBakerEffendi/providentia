I heard only good things about this place, so I was excited to try what everyone was raving about. From the outside looking in, the restaurant looks fairly small and narrow, but there's a good amount of outdoor seating in the back. Despite it being mosquito season, my friends and I decided to be risqu√© and sit outdoors because of the breezy evening weather. Their menu is simple: appetizers, paninis, crostinis, and drinks. My friend got the arugula salad with beets and goat cheese. I'm not a fan of salads, but I did like the little goat cheese chunks. Now, I'm wary about ordering paninis because I always end up getting them served crunchy, crispy, and difficult to eat. But I must say, they were made perfectly here. I ordered the Italian meatloaf, and I loved the way everything came together: the onion jam, pesto, and spicy mayo made it unexpectedly sweet with a little spice. I wanted to try the ginger beer they had here, but it was pricier than I would've liked ($9). Service was attentive and they were patient with us, as we waited for one of our friends to arrive before ordering anything. If I do come back, I'd like to try their crostinis or their pupu platter (comes with your choice of 6 crostinis).
