This place is incredible. The backyard is so pleasant, quiet and romantic and is really perfect for a date night. The servers and hosts were so friendly and charming. I had the mussels as an appetizer and the chicken for dinner. The mussels were the best thing since sliced bread, I literally dipped all the things in the mussel sauce. The portion of the chicken was huge considering I had an appetizer too (oops) so I took it home! Just as tastey the next day. Highly recommend for a really sweet neighborhood gem.
