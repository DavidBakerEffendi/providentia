We order from here at least once a week. Sometimes it can get a little hectic but once you understand how it all works it isn't bad. If you're ordering takeout, line up to the right, along the counter, if you want to sit, go to the left and seat yourself. If you wait to be seated someone else will take your table. The service isn't some fancy restaurant, but it doesn't need to be. Their food and prices more than make up for it. If they took the time to sit and be friendly with everyone who walked in, no one would be fed. I usually get a whole chicken with just rice and extra sauce. Comes to 12$ and feeds my boyfriend and I for dinner and 2 days worth of lunch + some extra rice after that even. I'm obsessed with this sauce they give you. It's like vinegar, hot sauce and onions. I wish I knew the recipe so I could make it at home, but it's awesome on the rice! The fries are good when you dine-in but get soggy obviously when you order out so we stick with rice. Very flavorful meat! I'm not a huge fan of the ribs, I didn't find a lot of meat on them and just not my thing, but not bad. The line can sometimes be long and only once or twice did we have to wait for chicken to finish cooking, usually they are ready to go, but if you do have to wait for meat, don't be so upset, because it's even BETTER when its right off the grill. Meanwhile, just watch the guy spin the meat around and enjoy the smell. :) This place is not fancy and not concerned with looks. It's not neat but it isn't dirty! I've worked in restaurants and I can tell that this place keeps their ovens and stovetops clean. Overall, really delicious, A LOT of food, and very cheap! Enjoy!
