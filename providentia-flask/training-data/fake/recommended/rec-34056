I'll give Do or Dine an A for attitude. For some reason (or maybe reasonable reason) it's a restaurant mantra to not serve anything unless you're sure of it. When you go to Do or Dine, you may get something that works really well, sometimes not as well--but you'll end up with a new set of flavors, and you'll be better off for it. Sounds like an awesome place to work too. I had the foie gras donut and it "worked" in a new way--more than a lot of desserts, with the foie gras playing as a peanut butter to the grape jelly, which I'm assuming was concord. Also had the chicken & waffles, which was a little dense, but when you're stoned and order chicken & waffles, you're not expecting delicate, subtle hints of flavor (although the rosemary was a nice touch). Pork shumai was alright, probably won't stay on the menu for long.
