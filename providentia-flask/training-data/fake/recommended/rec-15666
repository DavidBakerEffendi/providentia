If your a gnocchi/truffle lover like me, come try this places ricotta gnocchi and truffled polenta! Â I literally stuff myself full everytime I come here, but it's well worth the calories. Obviously, their wine is perfect too. They even serve some of the red wines in a cool white old fashion cup. Will be back again soon!!!!
