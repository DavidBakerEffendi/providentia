Not sure if this was the location I went to but regardless, I LOVE IT! For the past like 2 years I've heard nothing but great things about this place but I have yet to try it only because every time I come to NYC, I never have time and have other restaurants as priorities :( ANYWAYS. This place is def one of my top favorites that I have recommended all my friends to try out whenever they're asking for a nice not too fancy dinner place. Their selection is amazing and not only that but their menu is so cute! A little marker and you get to check off what you wanted. I was kind of bummed the night I went I was not able to choose the special sauce because they were all out. I was so excited to try it but this will give me another reason to come back again but regardless, it was so good I will come back as much as possible! I ordered a slider with regular beef and tomato sauce which was yums and then the pesto chicken meatball smash because I think chicken and pesto is a match made in heaven for your taste buds. I have nothing bad to say AT ALL. Everyone needs to try this place out. I am so excited to go back in the near future and eat more. Service was spectacular as well!
