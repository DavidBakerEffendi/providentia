Amazing neighborhood restaurant.  Service was good with great wine recommendations.  Nice and calm, dark atmosphere with not a lot of noise.  Good wooden bar up front.  And best of all - good indie music which you would not expect from an upscale place like this.  Expensive but worth it.  Order the egg yolk Ravioli.
