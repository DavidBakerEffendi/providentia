After tasting the chicken sandwich last December I was completely enamored with the textures and taste of the chicken biscuit sandwich. To die for! In fact we tried to revisit several times not knowing that it was going through renovations. Finally when we dropped by recently- we noticed a change. Less batter, less crunch, a biscuit shell less crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, and a lighter tasting sauce. It is by no means a bad sandwich- it's solid-just a noticeable difference in quality. I still appreciate the cozy, down-to-earth, simplistic atmosphere in this little LES joint. There's also something great to be said about the welcoming staff. It did cross my mind that there may be a change in the chef or management or... the remote possibility that our palates have changed within the last year. Despite it all, I will be rolling in some time to taste test the chicken biscuit!
