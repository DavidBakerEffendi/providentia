Great restaurant.  Eaten here many times because of its proximity to my house.   The pizzas are stellar.  The varieties change every few months or so, but most are fantastic combinations of leafy greens and italian meats.  The crust is just right (hand tossed).  Pizza is a nice size (~12 inch).  My recommendations: Lombarda, Agnello, Lardo, and Parma.  All great, great pizzas. The pastas and entrees are delicious as well.  Chicken liver rigatoni--awesome.  The suckling pig--awesome.  Once had a special they had going of foie gras ravioli--double awesome.  Most of the entrees are smaller portion size than I would prefer. The wine selection is over my head, because I'm not a wino, but the cocktail selection is pretty solid.  The beer selection is average for a place like this.
