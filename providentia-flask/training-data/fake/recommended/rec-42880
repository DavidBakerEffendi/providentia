Wow! Yes I get the whole speakeasy, mixology, hip nondescript entrance, eclectic palm reader neon light, hipster handlebars, super nice waitress, outstanding bourbon drink with egg whites and love... But above all else the steak. Killer ribeye, cut, flavored, and cooked to perfection. On the side three mounds of sea salt, lemon, and jalape√±os. Throw those on a bite, and buckle in for a mouth orgasm. Top that off with a bite of the crispy Potatoes au gratin, Call it a night. Cheers!
