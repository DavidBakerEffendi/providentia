I loved this place. My partner and I had our first date here, and then our 6 month anniversary. It's super cute and scrumptious. And then I went in for lunch earlier today. When I asked the server how his day was going he scowled and said "terrible". It went down hill from there, and I walked out rather than try to enjoy myself under is hateful glare. I won't be returning.
