Festive atmosphere with salsa music to match the great taste of Cuban - Mexican fare. Portions are very good, but save room for the fried ice cream! The chimichanga is delicious... tried the chicken, next time though will try the beef. If you're looking for something out of the usual fare of a small town, you won't be disappointed! Â Our server Josh was great and offered insights that were very helpful. I'd give it 5 stars, but some of the food plated was not as warm as it should have been.
