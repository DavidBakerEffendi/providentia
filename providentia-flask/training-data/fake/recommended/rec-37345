I tried the gyro platter or gyro over rice yesterday after all the hoopla. The best parts are that the platter is only $6 in one of the priciest tourist places in NYC and the hot sauce is so good and spicy. It is really really hot like the reviews say. The bad parts are the white sauce is not tahini sauce! I can spot mayo easily and so when I tasted it, I knew it was mayo! It really had no spice or flavor in it aside from mayo. Â I doubt it even have yogurt mixed into it! Also, the yellow rice they use are kinda hard. Not soft and plumb like rice is supposed to be. Maybe their food use to be better before all the buzz?
