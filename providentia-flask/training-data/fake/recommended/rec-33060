Delicious. If you're new to Indian food, Cross Culture is a great place to sample; if you're already an Indian food fan, it will certainly satisfy you. For a beginner, I recommend chicken malai kabab (grilled garlic and ginger marinated white meat chicken) with kachumber and raita accompaniments (order these a la carte). Also recommended lentil daal makhani, any masala dish (very creamy) and aloo gobhi (cauliflower and potatoes). BYOB -- there's a liquor store in the shopping center if you forget to plan ahead. Sparkling wine (champagne or prosecco) or crisp beer work well with both spicy and creamy foods. Service is good. Very pleasant decor.
