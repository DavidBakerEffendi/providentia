If you are looking for middle of the road Mexican, this place is for you.  I do not mean it is bad, the food is prepared well.  It is just not special; the service is good but not great.  The notable exception is the tequila, they had plenty of varieties, and they mixed their margaritas well. So go, just do not expect exceptional.
