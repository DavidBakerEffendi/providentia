I've eaten at Balthazar many, many times.  It never disappoints.  I did see something that said this place is a favorite of vegetarians, and I don't see how that is possible.  If you are vegan or vegetarian, a French restaurant is no place for you.  Virtually everything has some type of meat base or dairy in it so definitely ask a lot of questions if you choose to venture in here (or any French place for that matter.) This is friendly French food done well.  You will have to bump shoulders with what seems like every European tourist in NYC, and the wait if you don't have a reservation can be long, but this place never disappoints.  You will spend a lot of money, but you will leave full and happy.
