This place could be great for some gringo tacos (fried chicken? fried avocado?!), but I can't get past the half-hour wait for three overpriced tacos. The tacos themselves are actually pretty good if you eat them there (they get too soggy if you try to take them home), but it's hard to get a seat in the super-cramped space. Once you do, you'll spend the whole time being watched by would-be sitters. Save yourself the time and go to Chavela's, which has better quality and faster service for about the same price.
