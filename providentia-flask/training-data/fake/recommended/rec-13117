Trusted my yelp app to find me a delicious noodle place in the area. It didn't lead me wrong. However, this place must also be on tripadvisor or some guide books because there was quite a lot of tourists eating here. It's kinda located at the edge of Chinatown on a small street (ie not Canal or even off canal). On my way there, I thought I was going the wrong direction at first. The place isn't too big either. Not great for big groups. I kinda sat a shared table, which was really a bunch of small tables pushed together. Ordered the house special noodle soup with hand pulled noodles. Food came out quickly. Though a bit oily, the bowl was brimming with soup, noodles and lots of veggies and meat. Noodles were great, cooked just right. And I was super stuffed at the end of the meal. I really wanted to order dumplings and other dishes but it would've been way too much. I think they speak Mandarin here but the English is passable. No Cantonese, I don't think. Paid at the counter and was out of there. A quick meal that hit the spot.
