Don't know how this place got 4.5 stars. We went with another family for lunch so there were 8 of us total. We ordered off the menu.... No special requests.  The appetizer came out after the entrees. The entrees were served in waves of 2. My kids got their tacos. After 3-4 minutes my wife's entree comes out. Then mine came out with the appetizer. The other family got their order all split up too. The father in the other family got his fajitas after everyone else was completely done eating. So the service was terrible. As for the food... Very, very bland.  No seasoning or kick at all. Everyone felt the same way. This is the first time Yelp has ever steered me this wrong. And it wasn't cheap. Lunch for 4 before tip was $52. That's a lunch combo platter, a burrito, 4 tacos, an order of nachos and 4 drinks. $13/person is way too much for the quality of this food, the service and the atmosphere.  I think this place must have friends making up reviews.  Don't waste your time.
