Came here for my sister's birthday last week and had a pretty good time.  First the good.  Service was great, decor is cute, food is decent.  The only thing is, for a place that specializes in fish, none of us were blown away by the fish at all. Started with two types of chowder, seafood and crab, and both were excellent.  Both were tasty enough that we were licking the last drops from the bowl.  We also started with the appetizer of the sauteed mushrooms (quite good), and the fried oysters (juicy, flavorful and delicious). Then our main entrees came out..the mustard crusted salmon, the cioppino, the cod, and then the special of the day, which I can't remember.  All the fish items were pretty mediocre..generally fresh I guess?  But rather bland and not in the good sort of, "this fish is so fresh that it doesn't need any accompaniment" lack of flavor.  Everything just was sort of eh.   Dessert was also a little mixed.  Both fruit tarts, a cherry and a mixed fruit, were pretty mediocre.  The flourless chocolate cake, in contrast to what another reviewer said, my whole family found to be really delicious.  It was rich, chocolately and dense, just the way I like my flourless chocolate cake to be.   So, generally alright food (though somewhat disappointing fish for a seafood restaurant), but ultimately, for a place that's so far away from any subway station, I'm not going to be rushing back here anytime.
