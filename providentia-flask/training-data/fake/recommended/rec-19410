A bit pricey to be a regular, but this place is great.  Currently, they have Furthermore's Fatty Boombalatty -- one of my favorites.  But for the rest of the year, there is a selection of bottled brews to satisfy any palate.  Been here for brunch, had to wait awhile but it was ok because we could still order drinks, and we were a large group.  Definitely not good for group brunch, I'd suggest McCrossen's if you're in a large group.   Food is consistently delicious and cooked to order.  Service is always friendly and prompt.  Atmosphere is casual and not too loud.
