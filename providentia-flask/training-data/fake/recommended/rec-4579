I've come to Soul de Cuba twice. Both times we were able to get sitted without a reservation, which was a plus. First time I wasn't impressed but thought it deserved another try. Second time didn't go much better. This time the food was better. My favorite was the tapas sampler. But service was so terrible it ruined everything. I noticed other reviewers had a similar experience. The waitress was in a terrible rush to get us out of there. While we were still enjoying our appetizer we were very directy asked to eat it or wrap it because the entrees were ready. This was followed by a container handed over to me to do the wrapping. After we finished eating and were still deep in conversation and finishing our glass of wine we were asked to wrap up so they could sit others. Problem was half the restaurant was empty! Why give such an unpleasant experience to your customers when there aren't others waiting? Just bizarre.
