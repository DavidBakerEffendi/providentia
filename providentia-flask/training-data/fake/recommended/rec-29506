Fantastic, identifiable flavors, and the cooks pay attention when you ask for spicy or mild. Well cooked seafood, fresh vegetables, chewy noodles. The fried ice cream had a lovely crust and perfectly un/melted. Very attentive service. I recommend going for the lunch menu with its average prices of about $10 per entree, unless you really want duck or lamb.
