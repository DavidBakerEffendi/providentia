Went to Wedge & Fig for a quick bite with my mom one Sunday afternoon a couple weeks ago. Had one of the three cheese slates (had the Humboldt Fog, Beemster, and a cheese I forget the name of, cuz I had to order it as a second option as they had ran out of my first. With a delicious fig cake and membrillo.) also had a delicious cappuccino. Â the place is cozy and adorable, makes me feel like Im in Paris or something. Only thing I can complain about is that the service was a bit condescending and snooty for my taste. I like a place to make me feel welcome and comfortable, but they kind of made me feel stupid and like they were annoyed with me. Overall, a great place and I'll be back to try more cheeses and the sandwiches!
