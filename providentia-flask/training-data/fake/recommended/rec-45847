Was here for some beers before a dinner at another restaurant.  We got here at just the right time on a Saturday night, around 5:30-6ish, because the bar was empty. There were some real great beers on tap.  And the prices couldn't be beat.  We sampled four beers, my girlfriend enjoying a fruity beer.  Then we each ordered half a pint.  It was great to have the option to order a sample, half pint, or full pint. By the time we left at 7, the place was packed.
