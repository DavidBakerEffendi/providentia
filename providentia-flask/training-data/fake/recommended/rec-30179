Came here with a party of 6. We arrived a little early and it was great to spend the extra time looking through the super fancy glass store and going downstairs and watching the men work on the glass. They seated us in their covered patio area. It was a beautiful view but many of us sat directly in the sun and it was uncomfortable for a bit. Appetizers are small but extremely delicious. Everyone in our group loved their entrees. I had a delicious crispy duck that I couldn't stop eating. I shared an amazingly delicious walnut meringue dessert as well. The only issue I had with the place was service was pretty slow even though it seemed that there was plenty of help and the place wasn't packed. Will love to go back next time in in VT and would highly recommend it to others as well.
