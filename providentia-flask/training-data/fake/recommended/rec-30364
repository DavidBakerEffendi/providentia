Going to Bouley for the prix fix lunch with a group of 6 was the cherry on the sundae that was my birthday weekend of surprises.  My beau brought me as the final step to my bday celebration and it was a truly luxurious experience. The dining room was rather hushed and so our typically boisterous group did take a second to adapt to the new environs.  Once we were in our comfy high backed chairs and they brought out some scrumptious gazpacho, we all settled into the experience.  The food was great, and the pace of the meal was perfect.  A highly civilized time was had by all. Also, the foyer was an apple room. A room litterally lined with real apples on every bit of wall space.  It smelled amazing and got us all feeling the specialness that was to come. I would definitely recommend for anyone looking to impress their g/f or b/f on a special occasion.
