Millet pancakes (gluten-free!) as a special on the weekend are worth the queue that oft forms out front! The espresso coffee is spot on, they have soy (yay!) and all the egg breakfast options on the menu are great. It is light on the grease and big on the flavor. Great for a lazy weekend brunch! Note: Order a side of the homemade chicken and pistachio sausage...mmm or the potato cakes! (or both if you are a greedy bunny like me)
