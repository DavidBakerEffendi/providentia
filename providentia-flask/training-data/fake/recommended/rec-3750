A lovely bar with friendly (yes, friendly! in Williamsburg!) bartenders who take real pride in their work. I got into an extended conversation with a bartender over the kind of mold he used for the giant ice cube in my old-fashioned. He said, "I want to upgrade to some high-pressure molds, because the ice cubes'd be much clearer." He then looked sadly at my somewhat-cloudly giant ice cube. I hadn't even thought about the clarity of my ice cube. Now, I hear Rye also serves the best meatloaf sandwich in town, and I've got to come back for that. My sneaking suspicion is that M. Wells has Rye beat in that category, but I'm willing to be proven wrong.
