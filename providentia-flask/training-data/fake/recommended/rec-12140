I've been back here a few times, including for brunch, and this has turned into one of my favorite spots in the city. The menu has changed and is still a little limited and eclectic, I think if they added some popular choices to the menu (no Calamari for a seafood place? How about a Caesar salad with my steak?) I think this would be one of the premier spots in town. But everything on the menu is amazing, our servers had given some great recommendations for items we wouldn't normally order that turned out really well, specifically the Pork Collar. I rarely (never?) order Pork, but this is fantastic, tender enough to split with a fork you wouldn't think it's pork and served with cheddar grits As a closed minded Northerner, "grits" is also not something that would traditionally "ring my bell" but they're excellent. The atmosphere and the drinks are a big part of why we keep coming back. On the weekends the place is extremely vibrant and always fun, it's a bit quieter during the week and for brunch. Maybe a notch down from the insanity at El Vez. It's a good place to grab food on a weekend before heading out. The drinks are very good if only a little bit pricey - lots of unique choices with fresh ingredients and unique combinations. Certainly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal and a good time.
