If you are looking for your own "Winchester" pub, look no further.  There is an extensive beer selection that changes by the week, and each month a different micro brew is featured on draft.   The food is just OK, I actually have gotten food poisoning from eating here (avoid the crab cakes) and I still come back, if that doesn't say something about how great this place is I don't know what will.
