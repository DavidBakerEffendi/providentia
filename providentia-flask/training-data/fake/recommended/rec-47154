Great place for a Times Square restaurant! Typically, you get the tourists and chain restaurants, but this little spot was great. Restaurant was busy, but service was superb. As soon as we sat we were greeted with warm yummy bread and cold water. Our drink orders came shortly after. This isn't your mom and pop Italian place, but for the price and location it can't be beat. We ordered the caprese app, primevera pasta, bolognese pasta, and spaghetti. For desert we got the berries and it was so fresh with cappuccinos.
