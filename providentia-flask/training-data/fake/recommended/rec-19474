It's a traditional NY style pizza joint, nothing fancy, but their ingredients are top notch and the kitchen knows what it's doing. Margarita and Caprese pizza (as well as the plain cheese) are really really good. We just lunched at Mark Vetri's Osteria and had a very nice time, but Luigi's pizza is better at a fraction of the price. Finally -- best chicken parm sandwich ever. Chicken is hot, crispy and juicy inside, Â good cheese, good marinara, nice chewy Italian roll properly toasted. Everything we've had at Luigi's is good, but the chicken parm is really special.
