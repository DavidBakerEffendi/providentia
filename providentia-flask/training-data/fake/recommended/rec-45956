I ate here alone last night, and sometimes as a lone diner you can feel forgotten at a sit-down restaurant.  This was not the case at Junior's.  My server was quite attentive and very friendly. I ordered the pasta carbonara, and was given a GIGANTIC serving - I literally have enough leftovers for two more meals.  The meal came with a little tossed salad, which was good with nice lettuce, onions, tomatoes, cukes, and DELICIOUS homemade blue cheese dressing - very creamy!! I enjoyed the foccacia bread that came with the meal, but I'm not sure what the little bread-fingers were - they almost seemed stale. Pros:  Good service, large portions, homemade blue cheese dressing, yummy foccacia bread Cons:  Weird bread-finger thingies with the foccacia that seemed stale
