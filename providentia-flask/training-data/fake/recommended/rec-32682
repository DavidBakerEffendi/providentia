I love this place. It's so adorable and the food is delicious. A perfect date spot too. I'm not a big coffee drinker, but I always get a coffee with my Saint Michel sandwich. It comes with a small basic green romaine salad, but the sweet dressing on it is so good. My boyfriend usually the quiche of the day (usually ham and swiss or spinach and goat cheese). I've sneaked a bit of the spinach and goat cheese one and was amazed how good it was. That says a lot because I'm not a big quiche fan The only issue I have with this place is that seating can fill up pretty quickly if you come during the weekend.
