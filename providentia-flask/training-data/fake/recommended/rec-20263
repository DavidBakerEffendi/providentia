Battersby is pretty much perfect. I want to eat literally everything on the menu. And, happily, the menu changes, so there will theoretically always be something new to try. The first time I visited, it was a little busy, but we managed to snag spots at the bar and our server showered us with free starters, so it was hard to complain about the wait. (Plus, you can see the team in the kitchen working feverishly away, which also makes it difficult to fault anyone.) The bread and whipped ricotta takes a standard restaurant freebie and elevates it to this amazing place where you could easily ruin your appetite. But don't! Because there's so much more good stuff to follow. The scallops are the stuff of dreams. They were cooked beautifully and came in a wonderful broth and I probably could have eaten two or three portions. I don't usually order chicken at restaurants because it seems boring and like something I could make at home, but the chicken here is incredibly rich and..."divine" seems a little over the top, but it's the only word that comes to mind that comes close to what I mean. My dining companion, a lamb aficionado, ordered the lamb on our second visit and was very happy with it. I'm not usually a big lamb person, but I tried it and there was enough action on the plate to make it a compelling dish for me, too. In short: Highly recommend!
