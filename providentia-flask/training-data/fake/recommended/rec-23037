I would give it a 5 star but my standards are very high, but I have to say it is one of the best when you combine the atmosphere and the food.  Other than the prices are a bit high, and the wait being a bit long, the food was outstanding and we didn't have enough room left to even try the deserts.  A must if you are in the area.  Expect to pay about $20 to $30 for entrees plus additional for apetizers, salads, drinks, etc.
