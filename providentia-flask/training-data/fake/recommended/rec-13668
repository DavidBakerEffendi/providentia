When you need cheap, late night eats, this popular street cart is the way to go. After stepping off the plane following a long cross country flight, my lady and I needed food. And fast. My friend suggested the Halal Cart on 53rd and 6th. It was relatively close by and considering it was almost midnight, there weren't many other choices out there besides pizza. A quick subway ride and some power walking later, we found the cart with a line of 6 ppl waiting for the same good eats. We were warned by my friend beforehand to order only one since there was a lot of food. Chicken over rice it was. Minus $6 later, my lady and I were chowing down the contents of the aluminum container. And boy did they give us a lot of food to chow down. The chicken was hot and tender, the lettuce was fresh and crisp, and the rice was firm and flavorful. Flatbread was a bit dry but that's just nitpicking. For the price, it definitely filled us up. I even ordered a lamb over rice to eat later on. Beware the hot sauce has a powerful kick. Like a mule kick to your oral cavity. The white sauce helps mellow that down though. So it recap, it's cheap, plentiful, filling, and oh-so-good. Make sure to get it. Your stomach will thank you.
