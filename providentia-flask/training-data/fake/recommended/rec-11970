I wish I'd been able to do a taste test comparing the $16 and $26 burgers.  I tried the latter and it was really delicious.  But the salad I had before - beets with walnuts, endive, and chevre - was way better composed and way more special. I wished I'd gotten two salads actually - as the brussel sprouts special with a poached egg on top sounded a-ma-zing.  Next time. I sat at the bar which was packed and loud but not obnoxious.  The bartenders were entertaining and the cocktail I had (a Blood and Sand) was very tasty. I will say, though, that both my salad and my burger/fries were undersalted.
