Great addition to the neighborhood.  Food is top notch, as is the service.  The backyard area is fantastic, although I wish it got some more natural light, and they could really use speakers back there to liven up the atmosphere a bit.  My biggest, and perhaps only complaint, is that the menu is fairly limited and doesn't change all that often.  There are some stellar knockout dishes such as the Breakfast Gnocchi, Pa pa pa peas salad, and the lamb burger, that should never be taken off the menu, but other items could get swapped out every now and then.  Also, one or two more heavier meal choices would help round out their dinner options.
