This was my first Korean restaurant.  Food was okay, $13 got me a little bowl of soup and when I asked for extra kimchi I was charged $2 for three small pieces (waitress was nice enough to beg the owner to even let me have that!) Honestly, after going to this place I decided that Korean food is not my thing (even though I love all other asian food!).  Thank goodness, my bf convinced me to try BCD Tofu House while visiting OC.  That place was so much better! botom line, since there is no other options in new haven if you are desperately craving Korean food you can check out Seoul but I am not going there again.
