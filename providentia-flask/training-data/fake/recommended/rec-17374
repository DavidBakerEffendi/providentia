It's kind of hard to screw up hibachi.  Throw some chicken, rice, noodles, and vegetables on the grill with some corny jokes, along with a volcano onion - who wouldn't have a good time?  This place is solid...nothing wrong with it.  We're always completely stuff'd, and buzzed off their cheap wine.  There's nothing extra special about this place, and you'll most likely leave satisfied with your meal.
