Not having ordered from the rest of the menu, here's what the bo ssam was like: -Pork behind with raw oyster, rice, lettuce, and 4 diff kinds of sauces to choose from.  I had a hard time "swallowing" the pork butt idea but finally conceded that it was very tasty.  I normally detest oyster, especially raw, but adding the oyster to the "wrap mixture" def added another level of flavors. -Attentative & friendly staff, especially enjoyed having the open kitchen to see them preparing all the food -The bo ssam is for 8+ people (reservations required), although we had 8 (well, 4 girls really only count as 2 people) and we only finished half the meat. -Drinks are somewhat overpriced but a very decent selection.  I did Not enjoy the ssamgria I ordered, probably because curry in any kind of alcoholic drink is puke-worthy, sorry. Overall - Def worth checking out.  Plan ahead though...at 5pm on a Saturday evening, there was a line to get into the place.
