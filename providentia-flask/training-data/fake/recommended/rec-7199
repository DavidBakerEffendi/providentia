Lunch in the front room here is one of the best values in New York. Almost every entree is around $20 and you know it will be spectacular. They have a daily soup/sandwich special that has yet to disappoint---every time the flavors just come together perfectly. Honestly, have never had anything there that was not perfectly executed. Service is beyond reproach. Even when they are slammed and making you wait a few minutes for a table, you get the feeling it's because they legitimately can't seat you, not because they are being pretentious. Beer list is expensive but at least they give you some really out-there bottles for $10-12. Better than $8 Bud Lights at other places in the hood.
