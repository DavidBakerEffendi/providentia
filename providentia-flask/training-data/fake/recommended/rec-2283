Hot Diggity, the interjection, is so applicable in so many ways. They've got 10 awesome creations displayed proudly on their full-time menu. (The beautiful illustrations come by way of Hawk Krall, local illustrator and contributor to Serious Eats.) They've been done a special hot dog as well. I had the delightful chance to try their Philly Surf & Turf on my last visit. It's a Levi's Hot Dogs-inspired Philadelphia classic. Beef hot dog wrapped in fishcake, topped with pepper hash (PA Dutch cousin of coleslaw or so I'm told). I'm really hoping it makes it onto the fulltime menu. On my first visit, I had the Cincinnati, topped with chili, cheese, scallion sand onions. It was amazing. All in all, the service has been absolutely great. The hot dogs have been rejoiced by hot dog lovers and non-lovers alike. They've got fries with 12 different dipping sauces and there's even vegetarian options of most hot dogs on the menu. The dogs are filling and delicious. So much that although I'd love to indulge in fries, I don't think it's the smartest move as I can only hold so much. There's some debate on the authenticity of the regional hot dogs. I really don't care. The two that I've had are great and I'm sure the rest are too. The Sabrett's all-beef hot dog on the (special order?) Liscio's mini roll + their toppings is amazing. I know what you're thinking. An Italian roll for a hot dog? Trust me. It works beautifully. It's a little bit big but it's necessary to hold the overflowing toppings on their gourmet dogs. (There's standard ol' hot dogs available too.) Right now, my main objective is to not get too fat on these things. That's really it. It's dangerously close to where I live. With all the vacant store fronts, South Street needs this so bad right now.
