We went to a see Grimace play on Saturday night at Johnny Brenda's and were beyond thrilled with the experience. This is a great place to grab a beer and see a show. We watched from the top floor, peering down on the band, who put on quite the show.  The drummer is beyond awesome. But back to Johnny  Brenda's, it's a dive bar where you can get cheap beer. The bathroom was clean though the place was packed.  You can take cute pictures in a photo booth in the back. I would definitely go back.
