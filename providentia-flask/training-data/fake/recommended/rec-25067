This is my SPOT!  They have the best cheese fries, best chicken cheesesteaks(real chicken breast chunks, my cousin gets hers with broccoli), best steaks, sweet potato fries, good hoagies, great turkey burgers, did I leave anything off? I bring my friends here who aren't from Philly, and they lose it, cause they can order with all the fixings they like and not just all the classic Philly fixings!  You can walk up and order, or sit down inside, but based on the 5 person seating inside, its best to order your food and keep walking down South Street and to Penn's landing.  The one Chef has been there for at least 15 years, so I think that's another thing that makes the food here so exceptional!  And while you're here, please get a Gremlin: grape juice and lemonade!  it's a ishkabibble's original, and it just helps the grease of the cheese fries slide down smooth!   Tip: when ordering a chicken cheesesteak get it with the following: provolone cheese, mushrooms, fried onions, pickles, salt, pepper, ketchup and mayo...trust me, the provolone cheese brings out the mushrooms and the flavors!
