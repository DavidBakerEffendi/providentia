Ended up at Bubby's at 2:30AM on Saturday for a late night snack/brunch. The place is open 24 hours every day except for Monday, when they close at 10. Despite the fact that it was freezing cold outside and it was late, we received prompt and friendly attention and lightning fast service. The cola soda pop def. hit the spot - as did the burger. The buttermilk pancakes with chocolate were also amazing. I'd give them 5 stars had the pork sausage been better (plasticky skin, odd texture, poor flavor) and the fries tastier. However, it's a place that you should try, no matter whether you live in the area or you're just passing thru. It's cozy, comfy and the staff makes you feel at home in no time.
