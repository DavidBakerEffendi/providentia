I've been here a few times and absolutely love it.  While I believe you can get sushi here, I would advise against it.  Focus on all the delightful izakaya style dishes instead.  Yakitori of all sorts (get the grilled chicken skin if they have it, roasted clams, you name it.  It's pretty tasty. While there are always people waiting to get in it's really not necessary.  Put your name and phone number on the list and head to one of several nearby bars for a pint.  They will call you when your table is ready.
