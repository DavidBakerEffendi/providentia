Man, what a loss! This place once sold some of the best vegetarian food in the neighborhood. The hongos taco was a neighborhood staple among myself and friends. After moving locations, service and quality has begun to decline. I no longer eat at Chavellas. The cuisine is sub-par and the best vegetarian menu items have been discontinued. Crown Heights has better Mexican fare. This place is NOT worth the wait.
