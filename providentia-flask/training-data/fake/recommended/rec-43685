VERY LONG LINES = long WAIT Time!!! but actually it went by quickly...it was about 30 mins waiting during the summer time. The pizza lives up to expectations. SOOOO darn good. No other is comparable. The pizza pie was actually pretty cheap, around $12-15, i was expecting to pay more since its a tourist trap. It serves about 8 people (8 large slices), the only con I have is the oven is right by the tables, so it was very hot inside and the smoke and smell of the oven was over powering. They def. need to open the windows or vents. Otherwise, this is a must try for everyone!!
