First time ever eating here and I was blown away. Excellent pizzas made to order and pasta created fresh everyday. The pizza here is definitely comparable to what you can find at Pepe's or any New Haven pizzeria. The toppings are all so fresh and delicious. They make thin crust pizzas with a perfect crunch factor. Chicken ravioli is the best ive ever had. Perfect portions and correctly made. Service was wonderful and the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable. For a moment you feel as though you aren't in downtown Hartford, but somewhere like Manhattan or downtown Chicago. Excellent work Sorella!
