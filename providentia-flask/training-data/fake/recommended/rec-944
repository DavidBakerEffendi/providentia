The Brussels sprout and mozzarella app was just amazing. Probably the best app I ever had!!! The pizza was weird / different.  I had the sausage and fennel one with white sauce.  It was amazing. I will be back. *NEW 8/8 - I was back last night and it was still pretty great.  My first server that sat us was rude (black guy - we almost left - he basically told me to shut-up when i asked about an app I had previously - he said something like if I let him talk I'll find out, he then continued to read specials for 5 minutes but did NOT address my original question) but then luckily a really cool guy stepped in and was excellent - white dude in 20s with short hair.  He was a pro and saved the whole experience.  Food was excellent.
