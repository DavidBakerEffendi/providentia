The food at Penelope's is completely mediocre, and the coffee will have you falling asleep or dragging yourself to the nearest Starbucks afterwards.  Service is usually ok, but the various hostesses are always snooty.   I got a chicken club sandwich that tasted like cafeteria food.  The bread was stale and the mesclun greens wilted (some pieces had even gone bad and stunk!)  The chicken didn't look grilled, baked or seared.  It was completely bland, rubbery and I swear, MICROWAVE-COOKED!   It was completely overdressed in some sort of cloyingly-sweet mustard sauce.   Anyways, I'm loathe to throw out food, so I brought home most of the sandwich.  Imagine my surprise when I later took a big bite only to hit something hard and sharp!   I had bitten into a toothpick (I think?)  or just a piece of wood, stuck into the chicken breast itself, making two pieces look like a thicker, larger piece.  It was completely weird.  My tongue was bleeding, but I didn't feel like going back to complain as I'm sure they would have just said, "it's an accident."   I'm happy to say I chew my food before swallowing, otherwise, my last visit to Penelope's could have landed me in the emergency room with a punctured esophagus or something.
