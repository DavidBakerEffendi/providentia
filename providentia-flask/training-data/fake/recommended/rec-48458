Very delicious! Had the beet wedges,never tasted anything like it. Bread was warm and crusty on outside . Had risotto pollo,very tasteful. Prime rib sandwich very good and sizable. I highly recommend trying this place. Sara was our waitress very attentive and personable young woman.nice Decore.Overall very good experience
