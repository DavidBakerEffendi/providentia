We came in for brunch on Sunday at around 11:30 am.  There were very few people at the restaurant and the atmosphere felt very nice.  We were seated upstairs where there are white and blue decorations that remind of beautiful pictures of Santorini. (Check out the website to see what the restaurant looks like). We ordered the sheep's milk dumplings, which was quite a treat.  It arrived and I immediately noticed that it wasn't very big.  However, it was packed with flavor, so eat slowly and savor all the flavors: the tomato, feta cheese, spinach, herbs, spicy sausage, pine nuts (yum!), sheep's milk dumplings (which, FYI, aren't filled with anything!  If you've had Chinese-style dumplings, you will understand my initial confusion).  Fantastic to clean off everything with the delicious complimentary bread they serve.  My husband ordered the Sausage and Egg Skillet, which was recommended by the server.  Unfortunately, though it was a pretty big portion, it wasn't exactly anything special.  It came with Greek salad and some pita bread.  The Greek salad was pretty good. Total bill, before tip, came out to be approximately $28.   Our server was extremely perceptive.  He kept coming back to refill our bread and water.  The last time, we asked one of the other waiters if we could have extra bread and he never came back.  Some of the waiters looked a little confused ie: we asked someone to if we could pack the rest of our dinner to go, and he came back a lot later because he couldn't find something.  But, that was just a small thing.  Will probably be back to try other dishes!
