There was a while there where I was eating Dos Toros every day for lunch. Absolutely the best of the "fast food"-style taco options you'll find. The carnitas are to die for, but everything I've tried there has been delicious. It tastes like real food, where I find places like Chipotle attempting only to masquerade as food. The staff is also really top-notch. They smile, they're friendly, they'll even have a short chat with you if it's not too busy. Rare find these days. They've increased their prices a bit over the last two years or so, and now everything is a tad on the expensive side. But if you've got the dough, I give this place my highest recommendation. I'm leaving New York next month and this will literally be on the places I miss most.
