The actual sandwich wasn't even that great and it's still a highlight of my trip to Philly. Pat's is the original and now I can say I've done it, I've been to Cheesesteak Mecca! I got my cheesesteak "wit" and there were plenty of peppers and onions to go along with the thinly cut steak and cheese wiz. The soft bun was nice and it's a good size hoagie. All in all, the steak itself was a little lacking and I couldn't help but think, I don't so much like cheese wiz. It's my own fault, I wanted it authentic... I think I'm the opposite of my Yelp friend Liz T. on this one though. I think it was well worth the cab fare to check this off my culinary bucket list. I've been to the original Ben & Jerry's in Burlington, where you can get 'seconds' for a buck - the pints they ruined with too much chocolate or something; Pepe's Pizza in New Haven, AKA Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana, the best pizza on earth; and the original Starbucks in Seattle, which I'll put on the b-list for quality, but it is legendary and the only Starbucks with any originality in terms of decor. Pat's King of Steaks is worthy of being on the list. Now...where do I go next?
