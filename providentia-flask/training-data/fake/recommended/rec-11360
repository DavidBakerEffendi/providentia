My god Paesano's is like a party in my mouth and the entire mafia was invited. They delivered me a DIAVLO Sandwich and POTATO ARROSTO. I swear I had to close my eyes it was so good. I have no photos to show, it didn't stand a chance of making that long after I took my first bite. I kind of want them to cater my wedding.... is this possible?
