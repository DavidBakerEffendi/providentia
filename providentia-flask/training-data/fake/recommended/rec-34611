I have to say, the food was great, but not mind-blowing. It's definitely got a homey, or homemade, kind of feel to it, though. I just thought the flavors were more bland than I'm used to, at least when compared to most Southeast Asian cuisine, but...that could just be my ignorant ass not knowing what "authentic Cambodian" food is even when it's staring me in the face. If I could give half stars I would definitely be putting 3 and a half. I definitely will give the place another try if I see the truck around again, and will up my review then if I have an incredible experience. While I desperately WANT to help Jerry out, because his really is a terrible story, I also want to be fair. Until next time, then!
