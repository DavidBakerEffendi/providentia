Tried Umi on a Friday afternoon, after the lunch rush.  The place was very clean and organized, guess we gave them plenty of time to recover (a new sushi place in Blue Back? I'm sure it was packed at lunch). Since we were one out of only three parties, the waitress service was slower than usual-but hey the food was running by right in front of us continually, so that was not a big deal.  The chefs in the middle of the conveyor belt never stopped making new rolls the whole time I was there, they kept loading them on. They were marked for freshness too, which was cool. There were plenty of different options and thanks to the continual work of the chefs-there were always plenty available. The concept is very convenient, I can tell this is going to be a popular place.
