Jason and I both had the giant breakfast burrito. OK let's face it, breakfast burritos might be one of my favorite things on earth but this one was really up there in terms of best burritos I've ever had. Did I mention it was giant? And an excellent ratio of eggs/cheese/potatoes/vegan sausage. I would love to come back and try another of their dishes if I were ever in the area again.
