How would you like to dine at a club? What this place is is waitresses dressed in clubbing attire, house music blasting in the back ground and lighting so dim you can't  see your menu or your date.  This is one of those over the top places that you would expect to see on an episode of Sex and the City complete with it's own chandelier in a glass case right in the middle of the restaurant. But guess what? Room Service has reasonable prices! It's very comparable to any of the Thai places in Hell's kitchen. I ordered the spicy squid ink spaghetti. It was tasty enough although couldn't really taste the squid ink. The chili and basil over powered the subtle flavor.  I would come back and order drinks. Looks like an electric Asian fusion drink menu.
