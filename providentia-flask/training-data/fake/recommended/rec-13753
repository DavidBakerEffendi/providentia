This may be one of the fewest restaurants that I was genuinely surprised by. From the outside, it doesn't look much, especially situated in the Flatiron district. It's like a secret little gem! When you walk in, the entrance is very narrow, greeted by a server, inside the decor is very modern "NY" feel, the lights, atmosphere, and people are very respectful and not to be loud. Service is very attentive, asked about food, water..etc I haven't had much experience with Middle Eastern - Lebanese food, so take this review as a grain of salt. I went in for the Lunch Pre-fix Menu, which is $20 for 2 choices. My choice was the Calamari salad and the Garlic String beans. I have to say, the Garlic String beans were very savory, but extremely over salted. It was well infused with the garlic flavor, but without a pair of bread or rice, it is way too salty to eat. The calamari salad was interesting.. Instead of the usual crispy Calamari rings, this was strips of calamari with dusts of seasoning, over a bed of regular lettus, and oversized pieces of green bell pepper. (Not a fan of bell peppers).. again, maybe my choices were wrong, but both seemed to be extremely salty. Wish I had a side of rice or something to wash it down. The portions were relatively small for a $20 dollar meal, but the atmosphere and non-rushed service makes it very pleasant. It's a great place for a business meeting, as everyone's a superb respectful crowd. Not easy to find in NY. Decor is great, service is great. I'd def visit again to check out the other dishes on the menu
