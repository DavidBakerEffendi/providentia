Had a pretty good time at Peaches last night.  Now mind you I arrived around 8:30 - 9:00 PM on a Sunday night, and there was a pretty nice (and mature) crowd.  Ambiance was relaxing.  The sound system needs a little work (muffled). Sat at the bar, and had a great bartender that was laid back, but attentive.  I had the Brooklyn Punch...a definite winner.  The drink did not have a strong alcohol taste, but somehow it still "creeped" up on you. Will definitely get another one. Had their "Brooklyn Wings", now that was a miss.  They had a smokey flavor with a hint of spice, but the wings were not fresh ( were a little on the dry side ). Meaning that they were probably part of a old batch of wings that were re-cooked. All in all I will definitely try Peaches out again.   I want to try out their brunch.
