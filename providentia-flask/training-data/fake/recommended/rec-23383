Whenever I'm near Chinatown in need of a quick snack, this is my destination.  You wouldn't guess from looking at the exterior...or from a quick glance around the 'dining area' - devoid of decor save a flat screen tv in the corner set to some asian tv network, that this place has really excellent noodles! I've been here many times, but unfortunately since I don't eat meat, the only vegetarian dish on the menu I can order is the sesame noodles (all the soups are made using beef stock). However,  the noodles are fresh and delicious, topped with scallions and a light peanut sauce.  very cheap also!
