Atmosphere is fun and seated quickly on a Saturday night. - grilled octopus salad : liked the style of the salad. flavors were balanced just wish the octopus was cut thinner, the large chunks of meat did not get marinated throroughly - Sheep's milk ravioli was amazingly flavored and the sauce was delicious, serving size was not enough to be considered an entree more of a small plate
