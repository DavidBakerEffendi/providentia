This place has it all!  How can they packed so much awesomeness in such a tiny place like this?  My boss suggested I go check out this restaurant while I was out there in NY with my friends.  I'm so thankful he steered me in the right direction. We started off with a cheese fondue served with apples, cubed bread, and bread-sticks.  It was my first time seeing fondue on a menu so I wanted to try it out, unfortunately I didn't think anything of it.  I love cheese but this wasn't for me. Then out came the beef marrow & oxtail marmalade and  foie gras terrine.  Both served with this light butter toast and I think sea salt with the marrow and oxtail.  Can you say "food p0rn"?!? Freakin' amazing!!   About being polite and reserved and save the last piece/bite for your friends? Screw all that.. I claimed it and yes, I'm a monster. Entree came out, I had the rack of lamb even though my boss highly recommend their fried chicken.  Something about fried chick didn't sound too fulfilling esp at a place like this.  I wanted to make my visit count and couldn't be happier with my lambs :D Friends had the hanger steak and the other 2 had the soft shell crab which was the special of the night.   For dessert we shared the chocolate bruno, a flour-less chocolate cake, that failed to deliver.  It was too thick for me and the puny ice cream scoop didn't help much either.  The creme brulee however was delish! Service was good, but not great.  I thought it was a nice touch for the manager to check up on every table there. Definitely will have more dreams of the beef marrow and oxtail marmalade ;P~
