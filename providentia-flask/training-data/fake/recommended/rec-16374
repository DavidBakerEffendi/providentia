Was visiting a friend in Park Slope from the city and wanted a place where I could get a chicken kebab, but this place didn't even offer that, only 1 fish kebab option.  VERY glad I didn't order the fish considering the quality of the chicken was dark meat, slimy chicken.  I barely took 1 bite of my whole $17 dish....for $17, at least give the customer white non-fatty meat.  My friend ordered the 'grilled chicken' and the couscous which was also an overload of poor quality chicken and only a little bit of couscous.  Don't order the chicken, it's awful.  This place must really be trying to cut costs with the quality of food they buy.
