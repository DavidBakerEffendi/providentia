HORRIBLE SERVICE.   I was visiting a buddy at UVM, awesome town btw, and we thought we would try this place.  Sure the food was good, but wow, was the service terrible.  I told the man as we were leaving that I was disappointed and was going to let people know about this on yelp and he said "go for it, I don't care about you guys at all, you're not even from this town, get outta here"  ---- is that the kind of place you locals really want to be eating? wow.   Come to Philly, we won't talk to ya like that!
