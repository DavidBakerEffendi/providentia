I'm constantly flip flopping between loving and loathing this place. I've lived in Park Slope for 6 years now, but just recently moved right around the corner from Cafe Steinhof. For a while the hubby and I were keeping up weekly date nights on Sundays when the bar-restaurant also shows movies. I love the weiner schnitzel, and even crave it when I haven't had it for a while... but the last time I had it, it tasted a bit funny and did not settle well in my stomach. Grrrr! Same happened with weekend brunch. We had been frequently going for weekend brunch, especially when friends or family came to visit, but the last few times we had gone we received horrible service, the food wasn't great (think soggy spinach, rubbery mushrooms and waaaaay too much dressing on the salad). One feature that never disappoints us... the beer! Then again, you would have to try really hard to screw that up.
