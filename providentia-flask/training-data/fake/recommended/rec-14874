This is my first 2nd review of a place.  Last time I was there I got the "Best Sandwich in America" and was a little underwhelmed (see my previous review).  This time I got the hand carved beef brisket with sharp provolone and roasted peppers.  To sum up this sandwich: OMFG.  This sandwich is delicious and found it better than their Best Sandwich in America, the roast pork.  To pay homage to Adam Richman, I'll use his B.I.T.E. Scale rating system.   Bread-  The roll is perfect in every sense.  Amazing and fresh taste, it's a big roll for a nice size sandwich.  It has the perfect hardness to it too for a hot sandwich Interior- The brisket is so tender that it's easy to eat. It's not cut too small or sliced too thin.  The sharp provolone they use isn't sliced with a slicer, rather it's cut in different sized pieces by hand--what a great way to do it!  The sandwich is topped off with a generous amount of roasted peppers Taste-  Everything on this sandwich compliments each other so perfectly.  Each taste plays off the other to bring out it's final, delicious result.  The brisket is seasoned to perfection and brings out it's full flavor and the sharp provolone gives it a nice bite to the sandwich without overwhelming the taste.  And the roasted peppers gives the sandwich a little something extra. Experience- It's hard to find a better quick and casual dining experience than in the Reading Terminal.  It's Philly through and through.  The seats are counter style and always packed at lunch.  You'll be sure to make some new friends anytime you go.
