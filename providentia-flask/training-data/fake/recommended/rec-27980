I have been to the Bomb Bomb several times.  Each experience was extremely positive.  Bomb Bomb has a relaxed atmosphere and the staff is  friendly and accommodating.  The kitchen has no problem with special requests.  My favorite dish so far has been the calamari with pasta. You won't go wrong with the Bomb Bomb.
