I stopped in last night for the first time in three years even though I've lived in Roxborough all of my life and still do at the ripe age of 59.  This was my first time visiting since the new owners took over and I gotta tell ya that it wasn't up to snuff. I ordered an Italian Hoagie, which if you understand anything about an Italian hoagie at all, the one thing for sure is that it's not Italian without the oil. I don't care about provolne, salami, cudagine or capp, it doesn't matter without good oil, preferably olive oil. I had to ask for a side of oil even though I asked for extra oil...it was dry! What do these kids know?  Well, forget about it...lettuce on the bottom which is a forbidden since this is what you taste at first before anything else. It lacked that great taste that the original owners made happen. Even the whole cherry peppers in the Jug on the counter were soggy and old unlike the original deli's peppers, as we called the place in the neighborhood. I won't be back, even though the new owners will make their millions since what they have is good in most people's opinion but not 'Great' as I will always remember the original Deli's steak shop. God rest your soul Mr. D and family.
