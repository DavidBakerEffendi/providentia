Completely worth the 45 minute drive into the city. Advice, get there early and have your entire party with you or you can't be seated. We were a party of two so we breezed in with no wait at 9:30. When we left the line waiting was about 20 people deep! Ambience was great - Southern hip flair. The coffee was bold and flavorful. The biscuits had crispy tops, but were tender on the inside. They gilded the Lilly with regular and cinnamon butters and homemade jams (strawberry, peach) also honey! I honestly could have just had biscuits and coffee and I would have been content. The shrimp in grits was a bit fishy- perhaps on purpose! Shrimp stock maybe? I would not have ordered had I known the heads would still be on the shrimp...ICK. The chicken and pancakes was tasty, bacon added a nice salty crunchy. Portion was huge. All in all delicious. I'm going to opt for a biscuit sandwich next time. I can't get enough biscuits!
