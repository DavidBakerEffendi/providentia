Came here on the advice of a friend. Now, maybe it's that I'm a native Californian so my expectations for tacos are high, but the two star description of "Meh. I've experienced better" was perfectly fitting. Tried four tacos: -blackened catfish: 5 stars delicious, best part of the meal. Almost worth bumping this review up to 3 stars. -al pastor: 3 stars fine. The pineapple and avocado were nice but not enough to save it. -housemade chorizo: 2.5 stars good. Needed more spice and flavor. -fried chicken: 2 stars just ok. Also had chips and salsa. 2 stars. The salsa was nice but some of the chips were soggy or chewy/hard, not light and crispy. Hear the breakfast tacos are amazing, so I would come back to give those a try, and for another blackened catfish.
