The food here is amazing. The people are nice. The prices are high and it's often got a long line. There is a bar area downstairs where you can get drinks and light eats without the wait. Well worth a visit but best to come off hours and be prepared that it won't come cheaply - note too that it's foodie size portions so unlikely you'll need a doggie bag.
