Eno Terra is a beautiful gem of a restaurant. They are amazing in all areas of hospitality- fresh, tasty food, impeccable service and great ambiance. I came here with a big group of people- there were about 8 of us, as well as 3 toddlers, and 1 kid. It's usually really difficult to serve such a group with kids, but Eno Terra was flawless when it came to service and food. I was thoroughly impressed at how they even catered to the kids- they made a special pasta, with a delicious butter sauce for the kids, and the entrees for the rest of us (pasta, short ribs, steak,) were extremely delicious. You can taste the freshness of the ingredients in every bite. I can't say enough great things about Eno Terra and how this gem of a restaurant stands out from the rest.
