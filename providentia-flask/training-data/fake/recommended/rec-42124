A great little brunch place.  I got two perfectly made over-easy eggs, a heaping pile of great rosemary homefries, and brioche toast -- more than I could reasonably eat at a steal for $5.  The other, fancier items on the menu cost more, but if you're in the mood for something creative I bet it's worth it; they sure looked good.  I prefer greasy spoons, but I can't give anything lower than 4 stars for a well made breakfast at an unexpectedly low price (given the venue).
