If you're not too picky about sushi, the half-price deal makes this place a decent deal. I mean, when the rolls are half-off in price, you can't expect it to be unbelievable. Definitely not as good as sono bana but a reasonable place to go if you're a student and want to feel full off of decently-priced sushi. The interior, particularly the lounge area, is nice. Every time I go there,  I think I should come here more because it really is a decent sushi meal for a great bargain. The peanut/avocado roll is great for vegetarians, and  the yellowtail & jalapeno rolls were pretty decent.
