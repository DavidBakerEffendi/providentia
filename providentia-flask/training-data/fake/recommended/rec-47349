It's funny how I was so excited to Â try this place one day until How I Met Your Mother made fun of it and then I was like, no thanks. What was I thinking? My friend who is also in love with burgers said I should skip Shake Shack and she would take me here instead. The burger was cooked just how I like it. It really is about the meat and it almost melted in your mouth. It must be hand ground, right? I have no idea. The texture seemed like they would just grind the meat in the back and my the patties themselves, avoiding the use of frozen patties that always have a funny consistency to them. This is just me assuming though, so don't take my word for it. I guess I could do some research but am feeling too lazy and would like to believe it's hand-ground in the kitchen! But yah, it really is a very simple, basic burger. HUGE simple, basic burger, actually. I'd go back.
