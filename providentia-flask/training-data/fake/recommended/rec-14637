Don't be put off by the dingy appearance of this small Chinatown noodle shop - the noodle soups here are to die for! Huge bowls of fresh, bouncy noodles with flavorful, not-too-salty broth. You can choose the type of noodles you want: hand pulled regular, hand pulled fat, hand pulled small wide, hand pulled big wide, knife-cut (I recommend the hand pulled regular). There are many options for what to get on top of your noodles - I've tried the pork bone and beef tendon, both of which are really good...my only complaint is that they don't give you a lot. There's also chopped cilantro and chilli oil on the table for you to add yourself. The chilli oil is MUST-TRY if you like spiciness! It's made with a lot of sesame, which adds amazing flavor.
