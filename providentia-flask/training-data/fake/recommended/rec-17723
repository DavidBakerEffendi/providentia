This is a great BYOB restaurant in the Ewing area. The creative menu was a hit with everyone in my family. We all found something on the menu that suited our taste. It's the first time in a long time that I went to a restaurant and the portions were reasonable. The atmosphere was very inviting and so was the man at the register. I have the tortellini soup and it was just what I needed when I was feeling under the weather. I really hope this place succeeds. It would be a great location for an open mic night!
