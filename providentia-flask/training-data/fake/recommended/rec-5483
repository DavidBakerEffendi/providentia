Freaking awesome ramen! I had mayu soup is to die for! Burnt garlic oil on top sounds weird and looks even weirder b/c its black. But its the most delicious & flavorful coating you can have on the ramen. Â For appetizer we had the pork buns crispy style and that reminded me of an asian style whopper, its really good too! Service was exceptional and everyone there is very nice and pay a lot of attention to their customers and the food.
