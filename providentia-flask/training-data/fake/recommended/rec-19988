Went to brunch around 1130 am encountered a 45 min wait time on Sunday. The food was definitely worth the wait time. I tried the pancakes, the sticky bun, the french toast and the eggs huntington. The pancakes are the fluffiest I have ever had. The sticky bun was okay, but still good. The pecan french toast was amazing. It was hard on the outside like toast but in the middle, it was soft and almost pudding like. The eggs huntington was cooked perfectly too, with the yolk gushing out when you cut it open. I will definately go back.
