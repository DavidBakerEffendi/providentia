A very cozy restaurant, warm ambiance and decor, with smallish tables crowded for dinner and if it lacks for memorable food it compensates with location and energy. Bread and lobster ravioli were good. If you are in the neighborhood - stop by for a glass of wine rather than cocktails since their french martini lacked not just the orange peel.
