Came here before a Red Bulls game and it was perfect for what we were looking for. It's a hole-in-the-wall bar with a very standard bar selection. Not a whole lot of seating, but eventually people got up so we had a table. Bartender and staff were friendly. They had a a very reasonably priced bar menu. We had cheesesteaks and wings, and they totally hit the spot. A great place to pre-game for the Red Bulls.
