4 stars for the atmosphere, cleanliness, customer service, the super sweet couple that runs the business and makes a genuine effort to get to know their customers. They changed up the menu so there is more variety, better pricing, healthy options etc. Bruschetta salad is fantastic. The tuna sandwich is made the way my dad does--traditional Italian style!
