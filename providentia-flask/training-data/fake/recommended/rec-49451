AWESOME! One of the best places I've been to! I'm quite the critic when it comes to sushi, especially veg sushi... The varieties of veg, rices and sauces were perfection. Prices were right on... worth every second of the wait for a table. I will for sure be back next time I'm in New York. Favorite: the February roll of the month was something with beets and absolutely amazing. Best veg roll I've ever had no doubt.
