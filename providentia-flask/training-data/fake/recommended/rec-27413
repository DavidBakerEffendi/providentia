This review is for their brunch service only. Unfortunately, I can't consciously give their brunch service any good ratings. First off, the seating way too long - over 20 mins - while half the place was empty. Then came the food service. It took the server over 15 mins to come to give us water. Then, the wait for the food, with the restaurant @ 75% capacity, took 30+ mins - and they got my order wrong. As for the food, we got the biscuit and omelettes. The biscuits with red gravy was great, along with the drinks, but the omelettes were not. Probably the worst omelette I have had in New York. It was worse than ones I could have had at a hotel. Â It was as if they thought the way to make an omelette was the same as making a soft taco. In conclusion, I have no idea whether their dinner service is good or not, but their brunch service is lousy. And I am being kind.
