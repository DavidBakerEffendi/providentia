This place blew my mind. I was told to get the Cherry Jones pizza and I was so skeptical. I had no idea it would be so freaking good! We also got the Hellboy, which was spicy and equally as delicious, but nowhere near as out-of-the-ordinary. The inside felt nice and intimate, but you could definitely have a group of friends here for dinner too. Paulie Gee was so sweet and chatted us up at our table. The only downside was the hostess was so rude I guess because it was busy, other than that I can't wait to go back.
