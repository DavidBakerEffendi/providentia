Two stars for food, 4 stars for acommodating, friendly service. For food from a chef who has been much touted, I would definitely say it was disappointing. We ordered the mussels in African spices--a mixture of spices that reminded me a bit of Indian curries, except the fire, and flavor was missing. The mussels were extremely fresh, but the broth was rather bland. Even sopping up the sauce with the extra bread and toast the waitstaff provided didn't provide for a flavor punch. My bf and I also tried the fish and chips. The fish was flounder, tender and moist and fresh, but the hard, crispy coating detracted from the texture and somehow did not complement the fish. My bf had mentioned that he had tried the place a few times before and had always been disappointed. He was motivated to try again because of the friendly chef, who actually had spoken to us one night as we had passed by. Remembering his enthusiasm and how gracious the waitstaff were, this is one place that I wish we had a better meal.
