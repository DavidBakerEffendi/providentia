I usually don't write reviews but when a place goes above and beyond I feel it's deserved. This place is cute and perfect for mother's who need time to enjoy a great cappuccino while kids play in the created playroom. Â There's one person that stands out here and truly makes a difference from the moment you enter the front doors and that's Jasmine. She is a worker who is kind, friendly, courteous and an outstanding cappuccino maker. My kids and I adore her. She remembers us and what we eat and always makes sure we are doing well. The Bahche truly has a gem in her and we are grateful she is there on the day we are there. Keep up the outstanding work. My twins and I thank you! Super cute place, friendly staff and tasty treats. I can't wait for my next skim vanilla cap.
