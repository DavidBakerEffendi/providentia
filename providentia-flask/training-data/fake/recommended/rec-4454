Had never had Taiwanese food before.  Found this restaurant on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  My husband cannot tolerate MSG and so we were delighted when the women who greeted us (Mei), offered the menu([s]--Taiwanese and more traditional Chinese) said she would make sure the dishes we ordered had no flavor enhancers. We ordered one egg roll and dumplings in peanut sauce appetizers and both were wonderful.  My husband had a spicy chicken dish entree and I had a lightly breaded and lightly fried fish (I think it was flounder) with wonderfully flavorful mustard greens and (I think) crisp bok choy (Mei said it was long water chestnuts).  Whatever it was it was absolutely delicious. We were treated as honored guests. The chef came out and said hello and the women who took care of us could not have more attentive or a nicer person.  The restaurant was relatively empty (it was early) but there were a number of take out orders and we didn't have long to wait for our food.   I noted a comment here about the ambiance.  The room is immaculate and tables are nicely spaced, seating is very comfortable.  Yes, there was a very clean clear plastic cover on the nice table cloths but that was not terribly off-putting. If good food, nicely presented in a comfortable atmosphere is what you desire you won't go wrong coming here. We are delighted to have found Iron Chef and their charming owners and am certain we will go back many times.
