Geno's is a great spot, for the experience that it.  Whether stopping by after a sporting event or a long night of drinking, Geno's will be there to serve you.  No, it's not the best cheese steak in the city, not even by a long shot.  But when someone I know comes to visit the city for their first time, the experience is worth the trip alone.
