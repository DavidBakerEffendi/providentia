Absolutely my favorite pizza in New Haven, despite fierce competition and the fact that it seems to be a new place. Pizza is great - excellent crust, great toppings on their 'artisinal pizzas' (funghi pizza, pecora, and clark street are standouts for vegetarians). Gluten free crust gets lots of thumbs up, and appetizers and salads are excellent - they really set Da Legna apart from the New Haven competition, especially if you have people with you who won't be eating pizza. Service is excellent, when mistakes have been made in the past the wait staff are quick to fix it and friendly throughout. Ambiance isn't amazing, but it's a great place to go with a big group and not notice. If you prefer to eat at home - pick it up!
