This is such a cute French place near Bedford Avenue, and they are most famous for their savory crepes. The decor is extremely cute and patrons are made to feel like they are attending a small indoor garden party. Such a great date place! I have been here twice before, and once I had a savory crepe (the Nicoise), and the other time, I had a cod and mash potato dish which was a special for the weekend. I liked the savory crepe a lot better. Also tried the Calimuncho, an sort-of sangria consisting of red wine and coke, which was quite good.
