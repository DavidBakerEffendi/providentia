Group of seven of us showed up for dinner. Little bit of a wait so we hung out at the bar - very good friendly bartenders. I like that they brew their own beer on site, and you can even peer in to see it. Our server seated is, very friendly and super knowledgeable about the menu and gave some recommendations. We did four pies (we had an eighth person back at the hotel) and a cheese plate. The cheese plate was a little bit small, even for one person. The pizzas though - amazing, and I'm a serious pizza snob. Two of the pies we got were specials and those just barely made it back to the eighth person waiting at the hotel. I believe it's a chain - this is one chain I would not be disappointed or upset to see in the ny/nj area.
