We went here 6/29/13 and loved it! There were four adults and a toddler and we all really enjoyed our dinner. The menu is unique and all of the food was tasty. We got our toddler The King of Chocolate's Crispy Mac & cheese, which comes with tomato sauce - she adored it. I really enjoyed my Marguerita Panini, which comes with oven roasted tomatoes, basil leaves, fresh mozzarella, and tomato-basil aioli. For dessert, a few of us split the Banana Split Waffles, which come with vanilla ice cream, milk chocolate truffle, and caramelized rice crisps (soooo good). We found the restaurant through Yelp and weren't disappointed. I would definitely go back! The restaurant is kid-friendly too--they have high chairs and we saw several other families there and everyone seemed to be having a nice time.
