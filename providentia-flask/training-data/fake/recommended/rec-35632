Very good experience, would definitely come back, but missing that one dish that really challenged our senses showed off the chef's creativity. My wife and I came here for a Saturday night dinner and enjoyed a 5 course chef's menu with wine pairings.  The wine pairings were okay. Next time I'd opt for a bottle or bring my own.  The food however is why we were here and we both enjoyed it very much. Highlights: Swordfish. I never order swordfish. I'm not a fan. I typically find it a bit dry and a bit tough for my tastes. But, it came as part of the tasting menu so I ate it. Boy am I glad I did. It was the best swordfish I've ever had. Perfectly prepared, beautifully displayed, simply delicious. Pork Belly.  As many others have already commented - crispy skin, succulent meat. I cant' think of anything that would have made this dish better. So why not 5 stars? When I order the tasting menu, I really want one dish to be something different, new, innovative. Something I'm not likely to get somewhere else. Fond didn't offer that to me. What we did get was very good food and extremely well prepared. And there is really nothing wrong with that. My only suggestion is on the amuse bouche.  It was a very tasty creamy mushroom soup served in a shot glass. The soup was great. I could have had a bowl or two. My suggestion is don't serve it as an amuse bouche. It is too heavy and coats the palate.
