This place is my go to hibachi spot. The Food is reasonably priced and you get a lot for your money. The hibachi shrimp is my favorite of any hibachi place I have tried (over aprx 15 shrimp you get).   Their ginger dressing is awesome and i always ask for extra. The sushi is pretty good and reasonably priced you are expecting "awesome sushi" go to a SUSHI restaurant, not a hibachi steakhouse. I always order a spicy tuna or salmon roll with my hibachi dinner. They also offer you  ice cream that included in the price of your hibachi dinner.  Not many places do that. Also they give you a LOT of any meat you order , especially the chicken. Their was a rumor that the health department found a CAT carcass in the freezer?? i dont believe it but i thought it was funny.  If it was a cat, it tasted pretty damn good.
