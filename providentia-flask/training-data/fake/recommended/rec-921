I loved this restaurant. We were originally going to go to a different restaurant but my friend received a message saying a reservation had opened up and we decided to go here instead. The waiter asked what we would like to drink and after me only asking for water(because we were walking around all day and I needed to rehydrate), he brought my water out along with a complimentary sparkling rose water drink which immediately won my heart. After looking at the menu, we chose to do the seasonal tasting menu and we were also told that if there were any dietary concerns, that they would make something else for us, for example, if you cannot eat seafood, instead of the warm lobster salad, they would make something else. If you want this, everyone at the table needs to be on board for it. We had a tasting menu at the Pump Room before so we were familiar with the procedure. Everyone at the table loved the squid ink pasta and the duck. Unfortunately, at the end we were full so we couldn't fully enjoy the dessert but it was good as well. There is no dress code however almost everyone was well dressed. There were a few people who had jeans and a button down shirt but it wasn't a big deal. The meal took about 2 hours and we were the 2nd to last table but we never felt rushed. I would dine here again and probably try the tasting menu again as well.
