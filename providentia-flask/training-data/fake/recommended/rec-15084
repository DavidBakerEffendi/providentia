Well, well well!  There is now an eatery in the area that is hitting the mark when it comes to taste, gluten free options and overall experience!  Our first visit was wonderful and exceeded all our expectations. We ordered the spring rolls, karma burger and sweet potato quesadilla.  The food was light and so tasty.  We ate on the deck with the sounds of the river in the background!   Highly recommend this place.  We look forward to our next Pingala meal!
