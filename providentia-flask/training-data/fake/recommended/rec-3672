Tom's. Great dinner food. Can't be beat. My boyfriend and I used to come here all the time when he lived in the neighborhood. Bit of a wait but they provide coffees and things for the people waiting outside. I love their Mexican omelette and pancakes. It's a friendly and unassuming place to eat with your loved ones. I wish they would expand their space so there would be less of a wait.
