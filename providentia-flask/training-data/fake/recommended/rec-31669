Upon our return from Greece, we were going through some sort of food withdrawal.  After reading several reviews, we decided to check out this Greek Taverna.  We were not disappointed.  The menu and food were authentic, the service was great and BYOB is always a plus.  Greek salad and Halloumi were the perfect start.  Mussels Saganaki and the Swordfish steak were equally delicious.   Really looking forward to going back!!
