When the word steakhouse comes to mind,  more often than not, you think shirt, tie and jacket or don't even bother. That was then and this is now.. Opening in what was an high end jewelry store, Je Caldwell, this steakhouse shines high above the rest. Dress code? If your happy wearing it outside, then they are happy to have you.  Once seated, you can't help but let your eyes wander at its wonderful interior. I did mention it was a jewelry store, right? For starters, their salad bar is self serve which allows quite the sample including a variety of cold cuts and stocked vegetables. But of course, you are here for the meat!!!, right? A word before moving on... Gentleman, loosen your belt before taking one bite of your seasoned meat, it would only save time later.. When the gauchos bring out their cuts of meat, remember this is a buffet which means don't fill your plate without eating what is front of you first. Waste not, want not. Speaking of which, the sides- mashed potatoes, plantains, and breads should be savored because these carb friendly foods are there to distract u from eating the whole cow. Since your mouth is probably constantly filled with some form of food the entire time, they  have a two sided coaster that flips green to bring on the meat and red to take a breather. Open for lunch and dinner, the menu stays the same but of course costs a bit more after 4pm. Truly a king's feast without having to wear the crown jewels. And to that notion, I'll say one better... most men don't understand or care for fine dining. In the category of steakhouses, that would fit but not here, not ever and what it really comes down to is enjoying fine cuts of meat with a drink of your choice wearing whatever feels comfortable and that is worth yelping about...
