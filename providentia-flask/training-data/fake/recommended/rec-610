We read the reviews and decided to give it a try. We couldn't find any photos online from the restaurant and didn't know what to expect. It is a very nice, rustic and low key restaurant, quite small, with a bar. The food was excellent and authentic. The service was very friendly, attentive and accommodating. They really took good care of us. The champagne sangria.... Delicious! It was just what we needed. The flamenco at the end of the meal was a treat. We are looking forward to our next visit.
