ya know what I love? Getting a table right away for brunch. Know what else I love? A frickin kick ass cheeseburger!! Cookshop you're right on time sugar. I made a reservation, so me and the girls got seated pronto and decided to share a few greasies, including said burger. We snarfed like ladies yo. We commented on it's flavor from the perfectly pickled pink onions to the butter crisp bun, gooey white cheddar and orgasmic bacon. The meat is so juicy and perfectly seasoned, grill smoked but not drippy. We almost forgot our usual spouting on how much men annoy us...almost! It comes with delicious fries so we also shared the escarole salad to absorb any lingering guilt. We bonded that day, over that burger, and friends, this is how NYC brunch is supposed to feel.
