This place is ok. A for effort in the design department though. It feels like ur in an LA eatery and it's open air which was nice. I came for brunch w/ a friend, I was REALLY hungry, and therefore had high hopes. To be honest, the brunch options were a little too fufu for me (though the presentation was very nice)....as a result, I left hungry but at least I was able to check off another 1 Michelin star restaurant (shrug).
