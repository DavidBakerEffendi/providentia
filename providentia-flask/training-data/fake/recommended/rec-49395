I got the Nutty Buddy wrap and Spicy Mang Roll Combo and it was totally delicious! Especially, when I threw on the sauces to kick up my veggies a notch. Beyond Sushi offers a nice assortment of rolls, wraps, natural drinks and healthy snacks. With a quaint Japanese sushi/noodle shop decor, Beyond Sushi may not be huge, it's still a nice place to grab an equisite bite on the go. I'd recommend all you Sushi deprived Vegans, look into scratching that old itch at Beyond Sushi.
