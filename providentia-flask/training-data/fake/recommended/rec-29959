The pork buns are the best I've ever had, but that's about the only positive thing I have to say about my experience here. Service was awkward and jumbled (we sat at the bar), so much so, that one server literally gave away our food to diners who had sat down 5 minutes earlier (they ordered the same two dishes) leaving us waiting more than a half hour between courses...no apology, no update, no "making it right', no nothing. The food outside of the porkbuns, heirloom tomato uni and seasonal cerviche was barely edible: The alkaline tagliatelle was awful - and mind you, I like "fishy flavors" - this dish was extremely salty and really amateurish for a restaurant with such a rich heritage. The noodles were way over cooked and sauce tasting like it came from a "SALE: EXPIRING SOON" section at Food Emporium. The roasted maitake dish was inedible. I love liver mousse and was really looking forward to this dish. This dish was composed of scorched (read burnt) vegetables, splattered liver mousse and what resembled, and tasted like, bacon bits out of a plastic container. We literally had two bites before completely giving up. Our server picked up the full, uneaten, dish and asked "great right" - yeah bro, it was so great we wanted to save some for the kitchen.... One could eat the spicy pork sausage & rice cakes all day long and never tire, however, as mentioned above, we had to wait 30+ minutes for this dish after eating other courses, leaving us full and unable to enjoy. Disappointed, especially at these prices.
