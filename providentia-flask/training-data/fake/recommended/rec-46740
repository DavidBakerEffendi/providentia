We tried this restaurant for the first time based on a friend's recommendation. Their standard menu is pricey $$$, but you can also order from the tavern menu in the dining area. My husband had the classic burger which was extremely delicious, even the bun was superb. Both the sweet potato fries and regular fries were fantastic...hand cut and cooked just right. The lobster tasted wonderful and fresh, but the bun was bland and dry. I don't see what the uproar is with a $19 lobster roll, that's a pretty standard price in Connecticut (Tula in Monroe charges the same price, but it's better). Why would you go through so much trouble to provide a fresh ingredient only to be overshadowed by crummy bread...blah! Anyhow, as a previous reviewer mentioned, our server was very knowledgeable of the menu and attentive without rushing us. We were seated in the "wine room" which I think is the best location in the restaurant. On another note, I recently called to make reservations for the upcoming weekend...by the time I hung up the phone I was ready to pull my hair out! This restaurant really needs to consider who they allow to answer the phone. It's as though the young guy who answered the phone had recently been released from a year of solitary confinement and had a complete lack of communication skills. Was he texting on his phone while I was talking to him or watching a riveting drama on the TV in the tavern? It will remain an unsolved mystery. Making a reservation should not be a frustrating process. I had to ask him, "do you want my name for the reservation?" in between the giant gaps of silence...UGH. It would have been easier to reserve a table with Moe, Larry or Curly!!!
