If you want Mexican food that goes beyond the taco, this is the place.  Their Chicken Mole is just to die for.  Who would have thought that chicken cooked in a spicy hot chocolate sauce would be good? But oh my, this is the best.  I have also had the pleasure of trying their enchiladas verdes and chili rellenas.  I have been there for lunch several times and have never been disappointed.  This is not a place to go for a quick meal, everything is made on the spot so plan on spending time there.  In other words, make sure you go with a friend you really like a lot.  An absolute gem in Hartford.  Agave Restaurant, although good, pales in comparison to Monte Alban's offerings.
