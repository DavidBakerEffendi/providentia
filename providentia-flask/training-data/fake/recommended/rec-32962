The drinks are DELICIOUS, especially the margaritas and sangria. There is also a special 1/2 off wine on Wednesdays. The food is exactly what you would expect from an inexpensive Mexican restaurant. The food is really good and fresh - I always order the quesadillas stuffed with veggies! The paella is also really good, but so big, you should share. I can't wait to return.
