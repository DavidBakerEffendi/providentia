These Guys know food. Their menu is creative and they execute on flavor. The space has a great vibe and they've got a solid drink list. The unpasteurized Pils Urquell was unique for the States. Would encourage 1-2 safer options on the menu for parties with pickier guests (can't bring my parents here).
