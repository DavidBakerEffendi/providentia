Have been frequenting Castaways for a few months now and have only once been disappointed, by a dish someone ELSE ordered (goat rotti). The Shrimp Rotti is a for sure go-to that has never failed me, on take-out nor in-house. I LOVE this dish and highly recommend. Ambience: complete bliss after work between 8&10p before the crow begins. Great reggae, good service, good food.
