I went here for dinner with a friend the other night and left very impressed. It was casual, but not chintzy. We wanted to order the spinach and artichoke dip to start, but they were out. That was OK though; we went with the hummus, which came loaded with extras like olives and feta cheese. Yummy! They gave us so much I still have plenty left over in my fridge today. I also ordered a cup of potato broccoli soup, which looked like neither, but was tasty nonetheless. For dinner, I had a bacon and blue cheese burger with sweet potato fries. The burger was huge and savory. Realized it was a BYOB while I was there, which is always a plus. It was steady business around 6:30pm on a Tuesday. The server was a little odd and slow with refilling our sodas, but that's about the only complaint I had. All of the food was magnificent and the atmosphere was enjoyable. Looking forward to back for brunch; the menu sounded delectable!
