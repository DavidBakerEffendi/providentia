Stopped by with a couple of friends last night. We ordered fried green tomatoes which i can honestly say was the best thing i have tried in a long time, No REALLY they are that good!! The Mac and Cheese Balls were Amazing as well!! They have a great back seating area, perfect for dates!! Love this place!! Cant wait to go back and try other things on their menu !!
