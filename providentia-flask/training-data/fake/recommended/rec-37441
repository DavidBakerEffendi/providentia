Great fresh pizza! Went with a few friends to try it out. The atmosphere is very romantic. That dark candle lit sort of thing. Shared two vegan pies with my friend. We got the In Ricotta Da Vegan and a custom pie. The In Ricotta Da Vegan had Italian Tomatoes, House Made Vegan Sausage, Post-oven House Made Cashew Ricotta Dollops, Baby Arugula and Extra Virgin Olive Oil. It was a very tasty pie! Everything seemed super fresh and it was hard to put down. The custom pie was the Simply Red with House Pickled Red Onions and Nutritional Yeast. Â I think there may have been mushrooms on it too. Also super yummy and fresh. They make a good pickled red onion. Ovenly Vegan Salted Chocolate Chip Cookies were a great way to finish the meal. I will absolutely come back here with friends and share a few pies or if I want to go on a romantic pizza date, which, believe me, is something I would enjoy very much!
