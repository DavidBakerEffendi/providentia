Food was fine although portions were tiny and I left hungry because they forgot my ravioli. Waiter was almost comically rude, leaving mid sentence before I could order and throwing our glasses of wine at us like they were bowling balls.  Hostess tried to make up for him but couldn't adequately cover the whole place.  Generally abysmal experience.
