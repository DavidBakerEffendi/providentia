For a lobster roll in the city, there is only one better that I know of, Pearl Oyster Bar. That said, Red Hook has two types, Maine Style (with mayo) and Connecticut style (with butter). Maine is normally what I've had in the past, but I have to say, the Connecticut is quite awesome. On the downside, 15 bucks for a lobster roll half the size of Pearl's (Which is only 4 bucks more) seems awfully steep. I could easily eat two or three of them, they are so small. Back on the plus side, the view of the city from the Dumbo location is just amazing.
