Well, I'll keep this review short and sweet because its been so hyped.  In my opinion, Artichoke lives up to all the hype.  I think that their square slice is the best in the city.  I like the margarita slice, too, but the square slice (CORNER!!) is absolutely the best.  The artichoke and spinach slice is garbage, but a lot other of people like it.  The crust has a great oily crunch to it, the sauce is more than abundant, and i love the aged mozzarella.  Its refreshing to see someone with a great pie using aged cheese while everyone else is hot on the fresh mozz.
