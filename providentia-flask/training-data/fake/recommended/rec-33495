A really warm, cozy place for a consistently good meal.  It's one of my favorite suggestions for an afterwork bite because its a lot more economical than dinner in most of midtown. Everything on the menu is healthful and hearty--my faves are the veggie burger salad and the chicken meatballs.  I also appreciate their beer/wine selection. Fair prices, no wait, all around goodness!
