This is a review pertaining to the bar only.   They actually have a decent selection on draft of local craft beer.  I don't think they have an specials on the crafts.  They should consider joining NJCB and continue to offer local brews! I have been here several times, it can get loud at times, but there are some seats in the back that are ok for groups.  Its your typical Princeton U crowd at times, if you dont like that dont go late on thursday ect.
