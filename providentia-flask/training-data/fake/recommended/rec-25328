I debated between giving Nook 4 stars vs. 3.  But I settled with three stars because while it is in a good location and the food is delicious, the service is shaky.  Food-wise, I highly recommend the eggs benedict as well as the potato pancakes for brunch. The issues is how TINY this place is--so much so that it makes you really anxious especially with the host bearing down on you and yelling at you to wait outside.  I've witnessed the host turn down large groups even when they offered to split up.  I've also had a particularly bad experience the first time I was here where the waiter was rather rude.  I asked for coffee with skim milk, and he scoffed, saying they do not carry skim milk, so I decided against getting coffee.  In response, he asked if I was "on a diet or something" as if it is so bizarre to not want whole milk in your coffee.  He basically argued with me for the next five minutes over MY decision to not drink coffee with whole milk.  Anyhow, but lucky they have really tasty meals because that's the only reason why I go back.
