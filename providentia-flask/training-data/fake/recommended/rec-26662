Went there on a Thursday afternoon after a day of walking around the Philadelphia museum of Art.  Was starving and got there a little past 2:30pm (closer to 2:45pm) when they normal close for lunch.  Was still told to sit down. My wife and I ordered the baked Brie (which was delicious), the angel hair Greek pasta with chicken which was also simple and delicious and also the crispy duck breast which was absolutely phenomenal (granted I am normally not a fan of duck so it was really good to me).  The fig sauce on the duck really is great.  Finished it off with fig ice cream after reading another persons review on yelp and yes it is definitely worth it. I'd eat here regularly if I lives in Philly.
