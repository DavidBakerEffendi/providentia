Wow. Never in my life had I ever had such good ramen.  The broth was thick and full of flavor and the noodles were cooked to perfection.  But what really made me fall in love were the PORK BUNS. Delicious, melt in your mouth, pieces of pork sandwiched with a bit of lettuce and sauce.  The only downside is the price.  But some things are just absolutely, 100% worth it.
