They would have gotten 5 stars if it weren't for the margaritas Seriously this place is BOMB. I've been here a few times now and tried a bunch of different things. A MUST GET is the Veggie Wings appetizer. I'm not a vegetarian, but SHIT these things will rock your world. It's seitan and it's just a little crispy, awesome wing sauce and your choice of blue cheese or ranch. The pickle chips (fried pickles) -- awesome as well! They come with this spicy mayo dipping sauce. And they're so so worth it. The menu is split up into texas-style and mexican-style. I've had stuff from both sides. Pretty much can't go wrong. The tacos were delicious. I had the carnitas (YUM), my friend had the vegetarian cactus and sweet potato (she said they were amazing). The service is awesome. They're friendly and fast without being pushy. Great people watching. The only bad thing are the margaritas. Not sure what it is about them, but not my favorite. But definitely not a deal breaker, next time I'll just get a beer!!
