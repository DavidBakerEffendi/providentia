Came here following a terrible dinner at Barbuto (see review). Â We ordered quite a bit as the night progressed, and the general consensus was that the drinks were solid but the food needed improvement: We ordered the sausage roll ($10), lobster rolls ($14), and two of the creme brulee ($9 each). The pastry on the roll was soggy and the sauce that came with it had a weird taste and texture. The lobster rolls were not, in fact, rolls, but sliders. Those were okay, though could have done with a bit more seasoning. The creme brulee was good but bizarrely came in three small dishes instead of one big dish. Overall, would likely return but cannot emphatically say that I would do so.
