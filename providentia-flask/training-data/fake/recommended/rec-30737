I was recently visiting NY from DC when I asked a friend of mine who is a bit of foodie which restaurant he would recommend.  My requirements included great, honest food with a twist and he recommended The Gorbals.  Needless to say, he knows his food!  My friends and I were NOT disappointed.  The food was amazing, the staff was attentive, friendly, and very helpful.  The menu is highly creative (one might even say irreverent, which I loved) but the execution is nothing more than genius! Although everything was great (and we had a lot of dishes),our table's favorites were the Falafel-crusted sweet breads and the lamb ribs with crunchy raspberries but don't stop there.  You MUST try the sticky toffee pudding.  I'm not a big fan of bread pudding but this one will delight every sense of your palate (sweet, salty and spicy).  Good luck in guessing where the spice is coming from.  Highly recommended!
