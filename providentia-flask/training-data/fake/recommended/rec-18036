FINALLY! I properly tried Mood Cafe, after having their Mango Lassi and Samosas for the Baltimore Avenue Dollar stroll over the summer. The menu has changed so if you're in the mood for chaats , you can go to Mood Cafe. He has as many chaats as the sister restaurant Desi Chaat House. I was hungry for Chicken Chaat. This was made medium spicey. It was delicious! Nice pieces of Tandoori chicken with other yummy treats mixed together! (chick peas, potato, mango, red onion, lentils and spices and crisps.The flavors all mix nicely together and tastes delectable in your mouth! very satisfying and filling and yummy. Now Mood Cafe also has 5 Indian dishes with rice (Daal, Saag Paneer , etc) Plus, several Lassis and some Indian Desserts. It was relaxing and the Owner is very nice! I live closer to Mood cafe than Desi Chaat House,so, now I think I will stop here when in the mood for chaat! I definitely will be back, for chaat and Indian dishes.
