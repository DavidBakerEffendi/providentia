My wife and I were huge fans of Green Eggs until this past Sunday. We had been looking forward to having breakfast there all week to start the festivities of celebrating our 7th wedding anniversary. Arriving at Green Eggs, we noticed a small crowd waiting to be seated. With such a huge fan base and great food, this was to be expected. We were told the wait would be around 20 minutes. That was not a problem, we were still excited about the food that awaited us. While patiently waiting, we were privy to see several couples, families and large parties seated. Mind you these were customers who had arrived after us. Still hopeful we'd be seated soon, we continued to wait and politely asked the hostess how much longer she thought it would be. She quickly and abruptly told us not much longer. After it was all said and done, not much longer turned into 40 minutes. It appeared that the hostess was preoccupied with seating those she was familiar with and/or those she found to be cool. I was under the impression that all Green Eggs' customers were important, but maybe not that day. As a result, we won't be visiting again. : (
