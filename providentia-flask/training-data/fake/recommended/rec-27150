Came here on a Tuesday night for my suite mates birthday. There was really no wait. as we walked in, we saw the grill where the cooks prepare the meal right in front of you; it looked cool, but we were seated in the back. Anyways, once we were seated we looked over the menu-- and as a non seafood eating (typically) gal, the options were very, very limited. I settled for the hot Udon noodle dish (only one of two noodle dishes they offer). Once we had all ordered our food, the waitress told us that there was $20 order minimum per person. I wish we had been told this before, as it could really be a deal breaker for some. Anyways, we then ordered more stuff from the menu to fulfill our $20 requirement. I ordered a side of chicken dumplings. When the food arrived, everything tasted very... hmmm i guess "authentic" would be the word to use. yeah, everything tasted very authentic. After the first few bites, I got used to the seaweed taste in my udon, and it was pretty good! also, the chicken dumplings were pretty amazing! overall, I thought the food was pretty good (considering I have a pretty westernized palette), and the presentation was great!! I would probably not return, but that's mainly because I am not a big seafood person, and that's mainly their specialty. also, if it's someone's birthday, let them know, they'll be sure to celebrate with you! ;)
