Sat at the bar after being rejected from Traif. Really friendly service. A bit brighter then I wanted it to be but I got used to it. Cool wine selection - really fun way of dividing the wines up by celebrity personality. The food: Scallop Ceviche - Really tasty, interesting flavors. I liked the plantain chips in it. Served in a little line of things, maybe would be better in a pile that would be easier to dig a fork under. Roasted Peppers and unmemorable accouterments- I didn't love em but my girlfriend ate 'em up. The dish was a bit flavorless to me and the components were a bit too seperate. Fish Taco - Really yummy. Great masa. Honestly though any combo of smoked fish and cheese (queso and smoked trout in this situation) will forever remind me of bagels and lox. Fried brussel sprouts w/ strawberries, etc - OMG AWESOME Corn Flan with Blue Crab, etc. - AWESOME AWESOME Dessert - Tres Leches - Not a real tres leches, but a take on it w/ cappucino. It was pretty good, not mindblowing, and not really tres leches. This place has total shiksa appeal.
