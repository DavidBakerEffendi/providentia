Okay, I am actually going to write one long review for a date I went on that started out at Corner Bistro but involved several other places as well. We met at the bar around 7p on a Thursday and magically got a table right away.  This was my first time there, so I was pleasantly surprised to see McSorley's on tap for $2.75! We each got one of those and ordered the Bistro Burger with fries.   The burger was delicious! Not the best I've had in the city, but good.  It sure is a fat burger though!  There isn't any seasoning or spice to it, but it's just a solid cheeseburger.  The fries, on the other hand, I will skip next time. They were plain shoestring fries that were just... plain. But the bar atmosphere was nice and cozy.  As we were leaving around 8p, the place was quite crowded and it was standing room only so if you want food, I'd just getting there earlier. Also, this place is cash only. With my belly full of burger, we decided to walk all those calories off by heading to the High Line. However, along the way, I couldn't help but stop at Chocolate Bar...
