Pork Buns - YES Best fatty pork piece plus hoison sauce all wrapped in a soft bun. Fuji Apple Kimchi - Maybe (YES, if you're familiar with kimchi) Apples in kimchi spices plus amazing bacon plus arugula. Hangar Steak - YES Wonderful melt in your mouth pieces of steak plus a mildly zesty/tangy sauce that works well. Sea scallops - YES Again, melts like crazy. Fried anchovy pieces are an excellent addition. You don't expect service to be very good at places that get reviews like this. Surprisingly, and to my distinct pleasure, the service was pleasant and not overbearing. Don't forget milk bar right next to it.
