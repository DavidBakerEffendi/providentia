FOOD:  the menu is fairly standard Chinese, but the execution is a little more healthy than traditional fare.  The vegetables are crisp and fresh. SERVICE:  this is a counter service place, but I had a great conversation with one of the family members who was very friendly and helpful.  The other employees seem to enjoy their work and are nice. LOCATION & AMBIANCE:  they are located on a main road through WeHa, Farmington Ave., but the parking lot is small and shared with other businesses and the dining area is very small (2 tables and a counter).  It has a clean and modern look, and there is an open kitchen. VALUE:  is excellent.  You can generally get a lunch or dinner special for under $10 which includes the main dish, pork fried rice, and an egg roll.  Hot tea is free!
