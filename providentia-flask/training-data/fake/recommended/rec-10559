We went in on New Years Eve at lunch with 4 adults and a baby in a car seat. It's cramped for such a group, but they happily accommodated us by storing our bags at the counter. I had the BLT with tomato jam and it was delicious. My daughter had the open faced Black Bean sandwich with avocado and it was also yummy. The cappuccino was perfect. This was my first time there and I was not disappointed. Â  I can't wait to go back. The service was great as well.
