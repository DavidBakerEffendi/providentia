I had the fried avocado and jalapeno taco with a side of guac (which came with a generous helping of fresh chips). AMAZING! The taco was probably the best one I'd had in years. The only drawback is the price is a bit steep for a small taco: Â it was pretty small for $3.50. But the tortillas come from some fancy company that makes them fresh, so I suppose Gueros has a right to charge a bit more for their tacos. Nice ambiance, friendly service--I will definitely go back (especially since I live around the corner from there).
