Happened upon Emporio after a long afternoon of shopping (with little result).  Nearly ready to pass out we ducked in.  Such a bigger space than you'd expect. The back room is massive with great skylights and lots of tables.   We both got a pasta dish. I had oxtail and my g/f another of their dishes.  Both were homemade pastas and delicious.  The portions were great, not too big.  Pizza at the table next to us looked like great thin crust.  We loved the menu and want to go back for a real dinner as this was a quick snack but very satisfying/
