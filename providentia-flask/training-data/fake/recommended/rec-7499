My friends and decided to check this out after we read that it's a restaurant that just focuses on PORK. What's not to love?! Also, if you go on a good day, you can sit out in the patio, which looked very nice when I peeked outside. They have $15 all you can drink beer and you go tap that yourself. Kind of cool but we passed on that to save room for all the pigs we ate :D We were a group of five and got one large plate and 3 small plates. It's more of a sharing restaurant, so don't be germaphobic. Crispy Pata is MUST. I don't care what you think about pork. If you're coming to this restaurant, you need to eat this. The skin was so crispy and the meat was super tender and moist, not dry at all. And it came with this AMAZING LIVER SAUCE. Who knew liver sauce could be that awesome?! For the small dishes, we got the quail adobo, which was really good and had really yummy sauce but only one tiny quail egg. It was awkward to split that egg, but no fear, my spoon-splitting skills are amazing. We also got the Grilled Pork Jowl, which was the most interesting. It was on the spicy side, but nothing too extreme. The pork was basically fried, crispy pork fat. Again, what's not to like? The watermelon went surprisingly well with it too! The last small dish we had was the Khao Soi, which is a curry noodle dish. It was good, but not as good as the rest of the dishes. The pork was really tender, but the curry was more coconut milky than I would've preferred. It gets spicier as you eat it though. We got some white rice to finish out the curry after we ate all the noodles. Â I would recommend trying another noodle dish if that's what you're here for. All in all, a good, piggy experience! My friend and I also got the Phuket Punch, which was good, if you want a cocktail. In my opinion, it's a little pricier than two dollar signs, but not something terrible. The four dishes, two cocktails and one beer came out to be a little over 100.
