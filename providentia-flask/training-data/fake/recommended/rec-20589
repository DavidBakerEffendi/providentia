I've been going here for years and love it, it's definitely a favorite of mine. I've ordered everything from fish dishes, to curry, to Pad Thai and it has all been very good.  I always order their vegetable soup- it contains vegetables and tofu in a simple broth but is flavorful nonetheless.  My staple dish there is the Ka Tiem, a wonderful mix of veggies and chicken with a delicious garlic-cilantro sauce.  I get it with tofu instead of chicken, a substitution they've always been more than happy to accommodate.  It's also worth mentioning that their staff is very nice, and that it's a warm and welcoming restaurant in general.  Service could be faster at times, but other than that, no complaints!
