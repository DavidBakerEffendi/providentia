I've been wanting to go here for a while.  And being the first warm day of the season, it was time.  First off, watch out while driving past this place.  Blink, and you'll miss it. That said, I think Mr. Stephen Starr spent a TON of many making this place feel like a random alley in the city.  Honestly, its a very cool place to chill.  As with everything Starr, its a little pricey, however the shear appeal of the 1L mug of beer in your hand is awesome. Go get $1-2 beers somewhere else, get your buzz on, then show up here and relax for the rest of the night.
