After much review, we chose Gramercy Tavern as our one special dinner while we were visiting New York last week. We were sorely disappointed. For that amount of money, I expected the meal to be outstanding, and it was not. We have dined in many fine restaurants and we have never had an experience like this, where the food for the most part seemed uninspired. Some courses were good, most were just okay, like the squid ink spaghetti. Our experience was surprising since there are so many great reviews about this restaurant. Not sure if it was an off night, but for over $300, I don't think we will take our chance on this place again.
