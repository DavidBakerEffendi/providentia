We went to this quaint little place for an early lunch. Was'nt too crowded. The menu is extensive, but we stuck to the basics. Tried the Shrimp Roll - wasnt anything exceptional. But the Pho was awesome! I had the Vegetarian Pho (without the Tofu). Mild flavors in the broth. They gave a side of fresh basil and bean sprouts to add to the Pho. My husband tried the Chicken Pho, and he loved it too. Nothing extra ordinary, but some days all you want is simple food!
