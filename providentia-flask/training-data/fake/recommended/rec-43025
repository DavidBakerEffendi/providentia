this is a nice laid back spots, well during dinner time it was.  the lighting is kind of dark, i would recommend it for a date.  The steak was excellent, juicy, and cooked exactly the way i wanted it.  I heard the chef was a girl, and she is a babe. that doesnt matter, but still thats hot.  The steak tar tar was very good. you should definitely get that as a starter, and the bone marrow popper.  When you get done with dinner, go to the bar, its a lot of fun. well i went there during gay pride week (im not gay btw)....umm... it was differnt for me, but i had a lot of fun that night. it was actually a wild crowd.  So to sum it all up... good food and lots of fun. drinks are good too, actually they were excellent.  Thank you Mr. bartender that made me that smooth hot fiery drink.
