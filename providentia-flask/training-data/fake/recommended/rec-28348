Don't waste your time coming here. The slow service and crammed dining space provides for a rather unpleasant dining experience also this isn't Manhattan their $7 bottled beer isn't appropriate. I came here due to its high reviews on yelp and have left thoroughly disappointed. The food was terrible, my medium rare steak came out extra well....not happy! I won't be coming back! Not to mention it's cash only...it's 2011 not 1869. How hard is it to take a credit card?!?
