This has been my morning go-to coffee spot on the way to work since I moved to Windsor Terrace and I have always loved the space and staff.  When my husband and I decided to plan a small wedding in the park and were looking for an intimate space with good food for our family dinner, we immediately thought about the Brooklyn Commune.  And it surpassed expectation.  Planning a menu and the breakdown of the evening with Eugenie was stress free and fun, Eugenie and the staff created a beautiful environment and were so welcoming to our families, and the food was a hit with our family and friends - especially the bacon wrapped dates, the perfect kale salad, and the molten chocolate cake - thank you, Chris!  It was a perfect night!
