thai/laotian food. i don't really know what laotian food consists of, but my thai dish was pretty good. i got the red curry and although it wasn't spicy enough to my liking (it rarely is at thai restaurants), i still enjoyed it. the curry came in a bowl that was uniquely decorated, kinda cool in and of itself. the outside of the restaurant is decorated with all these loud colors, but inside, the place is dimly lit and has a kind of cozy feeling to it. definitely makes a good date location.
