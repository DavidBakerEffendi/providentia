A tried-and-true favorite of mine and all my Astoria-based friends.  Panini the way it should be, a nice selection of wine, and a variety of small plates make it easy and affordable try a bunch of different dishes.  The Sweet Carrot Salad with caesar dressing and feta cheese makes frequent appearances in my dreams, it's just that good.
