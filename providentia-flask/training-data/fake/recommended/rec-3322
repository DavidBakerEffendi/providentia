Been here only once, but was quite impressed.  The "greek salad" that came with the spinach pie was not a lame side salad, but rather a large plate of chopped vegatables and feta, more like a Horiatiki salad.  The spinach pie was absolutely tremendous, enough to feed two or three people.  Breakfast burrito was hot and filling.  Will be going back.
