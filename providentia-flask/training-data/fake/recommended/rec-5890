I really was excited to check out pommes frites as i really think it is the perfect late night food stop.  Granted, by the time we got here, we were on food stop #8 of the day, so i wasn't really hungry, yet i still had room for  fries! The fries were really crispy and fresh.  My only real complaint was that they were still scalding hot after waiting to eat them.   Even the ones at the bottom were hot when we got there.   But they were still very awesome!  I also loved the little holes in the table to ensure that your cone didn't flip... genius! As far as the dipping sauces, the menu is slightly overwhelming.  I opted for the cheese sauce, which ended up being absolutely perfect!   I was very pleased.  The other two sauces we got had the word "chili" or "spicy" in them, so i opted to stay away.  I would like to go back and check out others. All in all, I think this place is pretty darn awesome
