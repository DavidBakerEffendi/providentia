Mister Hotpot is a hot pot joint nestled in the heart of the Chinatown in Brooklyn, Sunset Park. Eating hot pot is a traditional Asian meal where family and friends gather around a hot pot with soup and take their time to cook their own meats and vegetables. So far, I have been here twice. One time with 3 of my girl friends and once with my hubby. Both times have been quite enjoyable. My first impression of this restaurant was a cozy, intimate little restaurant with modern decor and loud dance music pumping. It is a very mixed crowd and exemplifies NYC quite well with a diverse mix of nationalities. Their staple milky bone soup was delicious and their spicy soup base was definitely spicy. We got our soup half and half. It was $15 and included plate of vegetables. We ordered various dishes including two plates of fatty beef which was very fresh for $6 each which I thought was a bargain. They also have a very large sampler plate of beef for $25. it is worth it if you have a large group. Their fish skin and homemade fresh cuttlefish paste was also very good. Another must try is their watermelon Â ice smoothie? Here are some tips: try to call and make a reservation as they are very busy during popular times such as Friday and Saturday evening, sign up for yelp deal to get $10 off (you can show it off your smart phone, check in on Facebook to get a delicious sorbet type fruit ice cream
