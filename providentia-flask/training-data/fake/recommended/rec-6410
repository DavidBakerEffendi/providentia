Been going to Ponty Bistro since they opened. It's a great neighborhood restaurant near Gramercy. Â The food is always fresh, delicious (they really know how to prepare tuna) and inventive. The chef/owners are friendly and welcoming, and often bring out special treats to your table to try. The decor is nice and the service is good (except the one night our waiter spilled food on me - twice!) And did I mention the two for one martinis? Nice! Highly recommended.
