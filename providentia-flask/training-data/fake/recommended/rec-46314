We really enjoyed this place. The atmosphere is great. The service was excellent. It's good to see a manager at a restaurant asking customers "how is everything" The entrees didn't really interest me too much, so we decided to order a few small plates. The hummus with mushroom was great, with a nice little kick. The Falafels were great, nice and crisp...portion was small so we ordered another round. The Burrata was delicious as well. We left satisfied and will be going back again.
