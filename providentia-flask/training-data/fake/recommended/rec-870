READ THIS FIRST- RECOMMENDED TO TRY AS A TOURIST DESTINATION: As my review of Geno's states I visit Philly 2 times a month for business so naturally I wanted to hit all the steak joints and decide who was better between the two. In my answer in the eternal "Team Geno vs. Team Pats" I would have to say: Who cares? EXPERIENCE: Like Geno's, it's a heavy tourist trap- just not that the neon lights and sirens. Plain and simple. Is that a bad thing? Maybe for locals but no it just means that if you are planning to visit- be prepared to wait. The workers are somewhat better than Geno's (sorry to compare) but no one was embarrassed while trying to gain info on the menu. It was busy as expected and it is nestled in a busy part of city. !!!Be prepared to search for parking!!! FOOD: It was good- steak is well done- roll wasn't necessarily fresh but not stale. But for $10 .. It should really knock my socks off. They are making money hand over fist, but if I want to pay $10 for an average sandwich, I'll sit in Citizens Bank Park and watch a ball game too. Overall- it was decent, and I would say try it to say you have. But I wouldn't say it's worth repeated stops or starting a new religion.
