I wasn't quite sure on how to rate this place as I have only had the experience twice and the one was positive and last night was not too pleasant. I was so excited to see this place move up into the neighborhood as I had really enjoyed it in Chelsea. I don't recall what was here before, but they truly transformed the place. The tiled floor is gorgeous and I love the 'intimate' lighting. They play a bit on this underground cellar lounge theme that works over very well. Their associates dress a bit over the top carnival like at times to just add to the experience. This one woman had this little bowler cap on and I wanted it of course! The first time I came here it was for take out and for 9.50 it was about 3 dollars cheaper then my place across the street that I usually go to. The food was of a good portion and I was able to save half of it for dinner the previous evening. Last night however, Tee & I came in under the rain and lightning little to our knowledge that a storm was a brewing inside. We sat down and our waitress was not very friendly and never broke a smile until after we signed for our check. We started off with a curry puff - so delicious! She had this Thai dish with shrimp and these poor little shrimps were buried into the rice, with their tails - kind of gross. My Thai basil dish with chicken started off good until I over turned a piece of the meat and discovered that it was nowhere near done. They sent it back to the kitchen and apologized but not credit was made to our bill which I found a little unsettling. I give it a mixed review because I hope this is not typical of the service. However, the stand offish service is sadly probably typical. The kitchen is new so they're allowed some hiccups at the start gun.
