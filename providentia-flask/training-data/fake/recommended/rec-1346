I haven't had much of a good experience with this place but the food is fine, they charged me 4$ dollars for a pretty meager amount of avocado in my burrito but adding guacamole is a 1$ which doesn't make sense to me. The first time I ever went the service was rude and continues to be edgy on my other visits, like I owe them something. I really like burritos, this one is pretty good so it saves the review, but come on Dos Segundos, I get a 7$ burrito at Veracruzana on 9th and Washington Ave that puts yours to shame. It sucks there isn't cheap authentic mexican food in No Libs.
