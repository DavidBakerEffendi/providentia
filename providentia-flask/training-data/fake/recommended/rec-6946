I've tried just about every pizza place in Ewing and this is my favorite.  The tomato pie is thin, crispy, flavorful and delicious.  I've tried some of their other pizzas, but they weren't particularly memorable, so I recommend sticking with the tomato pie.  I've only done takeout, not dine-in, so I can't speak to ambiance but it looks like the place gets crowded in weekends.
