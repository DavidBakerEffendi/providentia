One thing to note, as soon as you open the door is the food aroma. I've eaten here twice since it reopened and could only manage bar space, the last time, we sat at the end of the bar the 'chefs table', which was amazing. All the food is fresh and to watch it being cooked between conversation is fantastic. If you want quirky, this place has it in spades, and the fact the people that work there are french, really makes a difference. The menu has changed slightly since the first visit, which is nice, and the music is pretty cool. The decor seems like a work in progress but there are some amazing details you need to look out for. This is one of those places thats perfect for an unrushed dinner for no more than 4 people, wait for a table or sit at the bar, its like hanging out in someones kitchen.
