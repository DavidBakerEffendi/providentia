Where is the best panini place in NYC? HERE! I cannot understand why haven't the expanded. Their menu is out of this world. So far, I have been here maybe around.... 7 times? and I have never ordered the same thing. Why? Because I want to try all of their different paninis. If you live in the city, come to Astoria and spend a couple of minutes trying to figure out WHICH panini you are gonna go for.... you won't regret it! Oh, forgot to mention.. sometimes they come up with specials... just to make your selection a little bit more difficult ;)
