I have been lucky! The past few times I've been here, I never had to wait. There were tables available. Staff are friendly but in a rush. Food is amazing! And they have tons of selections! From chicken to pork, steak and to something out of the ordinary (love the motsu-pork guts)!!! I will keep on coming back to this place until I decide to leave NYC!
