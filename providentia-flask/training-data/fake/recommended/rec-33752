Best burritos I have ever eaten. I have only had the quesadillas and burritos here but I assume the tacos are just as good. The burritos are huge and taste great. The ingredients are always fresh and well prepared. I have had all the possible burritos and they were all phenomenal. For those who want a healthier option, they have "naked" burritos, all the burrito ingredients in a dish instead of wrapped in a tortilla. I haven't tried that but it seems like a popular option. Usually packed with the business lunch crowd from noon to 1 but there is a decent amount of space to sit and eat in-house. This is a great place to grab lunch or dinner, prices are comparative or lower any similar establishment and the quality is second to none. Opening a second location soon at 2401 Chestnut!!!
