Walking through the door at Petite Crevette gives you the impression of entering another place entirely--its menus written on brown paper and eclectic mix of decorations feels like your grandmother's funky bungalow in Miami in the best way.   I came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend prepared to take advantage of it being BYOB with a 6-pack, fearing that the staff would balk at us bringing beer, but instead our waiter cheerfully put it in the fridge and showed us to our seats.   The menu is really simple but it's still difficult to order because everything just sounds so good!  I settled on the Red Snapper which was a special that day, grilled whole and served with a caper, tomato, and onion mixture with mashed potatoes and vegetables on the side.  It was all absolutely delicious and I just wished I wasn't so intense about diving into my fish so I would have ended up eating less bones...  The boy got salmon paillard served over french fries, and he said it was some of the best salmon he's ever eaten.   Although this place is unpretentious, it is actually pretty expensive, so make sure you bring plenty of cash (there's an ATM around the corner if you forget like we did).  I'm trying to think of occasions to go back to Petite Crevette, with an eye towards trying some appetizers and eating more fresh seafood--can't wait!
