Loved this adorable brunch spot in Park Slope. The scones are a must - they are lemony and buttery. The salmon brunch special with poached eggs and asparagus was delicious. The salmon was perfectly cooked. The poached eggs on the eggs florentine were perfectly cooked, and the kale was delicious. I wish the bagel had been toasted more, though. The coffee was also delicious. The service was great.
