Came here for dinner off a recommendation from my cousin.  The restaurant has a pretty old school classic feel to it.  Definitely a place to see and be seen.  We had reservations and were seated quickly at a great table.  We ordered the duck confit, steak frites.  Both were really good.  The dick was crispy and had tons of flavor.  Can't really go wrong with anything cooked in duck fat.  The steak was tender and the fries were good too.  Bobby Flay says that the fries are the best fried food he's ever eaten.  I don't know if they were the best thing I've eaten, but they were good.  The table next to us ordered a huge shellfish tower that looked awesome.  Definitely gotta try that next time. The staff was great and service was what I expected from a well known place like this. Overall,  Balthazar was a great place to go out for a special occasion with good food, a good atmosphere, and good service.  Next time I'm in New York, I'll try to stop by again.
