I have enjoyed many dinners at Freemans.  Tried my first brunch today.  When I arrived, the greeter told me 45 minutes.  I watched many empty tables with customers standing around waiting to be seated.  After 45 minutes, I asked the greeter the status of my seating.  Suddenly my seats were available.  I don't understand the need to make people wait a fixed time period when there are empty chairs. Our waitress was angry.  Everything upset her, from requesting  sharing plates for our salad, to a dry martini (i.e., no vermouth).  I almost felt threatened by our waitress to speak out on any concerns or requests.  It was weird. The food didn't taste as good as I remember.  I hope this is a one off experience.  The greeter with the hobo sock hat needs to get over herself.  Freemans has a beautiful short haired bartender who makes amazing drinks and the best martinis.  But it just takes 2 unpleasant people to dampen your dining experience.   Cheers.
