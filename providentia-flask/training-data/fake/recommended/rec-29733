this is my go to breakfast and lunch place . it is such a friendly environment every employee is so welcoming and attentive to customers . extremely clean establishment. espresso and late bar was the best addition they added. whenever I go in I always have to get some kind of sandwich there all amazing. best potato salad also always get it for my side. it really is somewhere you need to go if you haven't already .
