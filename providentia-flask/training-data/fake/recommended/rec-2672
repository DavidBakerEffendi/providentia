I've been to Frankford Hall twice, and I've enjoyed the food immensely both times I've been. It's a fun, relaxed, informal environment and an all-around great place to kick back and enjoy a beer and some German food. I've ordered sausages both times I've been, and haven't been disappointed.  I've tried one of the burgers, too, which was also delicious.  The fries are above average, I'd say.  My favorite part of the menu (that i've tried) is the potato pancakes.  Super delicious, and the thick apple sauce that they come with is great, too.  I'm a huge pretzel fan, and the pretzels are tasty, as well. Service has been average.  The giant beer steins are a huge plus. Note: I went recently, in mid-November, when it was very cold, and tried to last a while outside with the heat lamps and fire pits.... We lasted maybe an hour or so.  The heat lamps were really unreliable and the fire pits gave off very little heat.  Perfect for spring/summer/early fall..... not so much in weather below 40.
