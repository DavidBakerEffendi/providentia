Best Middle Eastern in the city! The lentil soup is so good, I eat it in and take some home. Their falafel is reliably great. You can usually get wheat pita if you ask. Mint tea in the winter! I usually also get: Labne, Eggplant, Ful and Zucchini with feta. It's a feast! If you have a big group, sit upstairs. The owner is very kind. Go!
