One of the problems being Vietnamese in New York is that there are no good options here. Somehow Ducks eatery has gotten the spirit of the southeast asian food mixed with some of the best aspects of New American cuisine, and for what I think is a steal. The short ribs are amazing, and for the same price, a much heartier st. louis rib will fill you up. The pig ears are something fun I haven't had since I was a kid, but it's a taste and texture dish, not anything to try for substance. And the Yakamein soup reminds me of Pho, but my cambodian friends insist it's more like a dish they know. If you're a vegetarian trying to load up on proteins, then ordering the nuts will give you a nice snack served in a cute paper bag. It really adds to the relaxed vibe that makes me feel like the east village is actually a village I never order rice anywhere, but my friends ordered it here and I liked it so much after having a taste I ended up eating most of theirs. Good thing my friends are generous. Cocktails are a killer here. I'm pretty comfortable with my masculinity, so I always get the fruity coco 'ti punch. Highly recommended, and I've dragged so many of my friends here.
