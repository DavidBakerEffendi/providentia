I ate at Audrey Claire last night with my daughter - on a March evening so rare and warm that we could enjoy our meal at a sidewalk table. That was a good thing because the decibel level indoors exceeded that of a 1972 Led Zepplin concert from which my ears have yet to recover. Given a choice, the only reason to eat indoors would be that you don't care what your dining companions are saying. Given the conversations we overheard outdoors, that could be distinct possibility. Or, you might consider listening to your iPod while eating. But enough grousing. We had wonderful food. My daughter ate a great bowl of pappardelle with grilled arugula and portobello mushrooms. Fortunately, she's not a big eater so I got to finish it off. I enjoyed two appetizers - a warm salted beet and yam salad, with goat cheese. The sweetness of the vegies, accented by the salt, was remarkable. I also had a portobello mushroom "tart" - layered polenta, ricotta, mushroom, goat cheese and grilled leeks. Fabulous, and I don't use the word lightly. Attentive service set off an unexpected al fresco dinner. And I could hear every word my daughter spoke.
