Great great little place. Took me by surprise because the street looks like an alley. I went there for lunch while exploring Philadelphia and was greeted and seated by a very friendly staff. The only thing was that it was so cold, maybe because it was hot outside?! They had a free soup, which I tried and it was delicious and warm, what is what I needed in the AC cold place :) waitress was very friendly and suggested a beer that is locally brewed and it was delicious. I got chilly cheesesteak sandwich. It was great and filling. Very very good food, service and price!!!! Beer, sandwich, chips, coleslaw, pickle, and free soup - $11!!!! Great deal. Thank you Â yelp
