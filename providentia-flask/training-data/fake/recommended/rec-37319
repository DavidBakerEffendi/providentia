I am impressed! It's hard to find a good, decently priced, place to eat lunch in Williamsburg. My criteria for a perfect caf√© is the following: good food, good drinks, wifi, places to sit with plug ins, and good customer service. Sips & Bites knocks all of these out of the water! As many other reviewers noted the sandwiches are really unique combinations. These are sandwiches you won't find anyone where. On recommendation from reviews (and asking the guy behind the counter for his opinion) I got the Yellowstone. It was amazing. Now my biggest problem is that I want to try the others but I am so addicted to the Yellowstone I order that every time I go. /firstworldproblems Anyway, come check this place out. They're very nice and friendly. The tables are a bit small but plenty of outlets and free wifi to get some work done (a MUST for me).
