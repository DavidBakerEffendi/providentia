Place doesn't have their act together. One tv showing Eagles game which you would expect in NYC but they advertise as a "Philly bar". Picture grainy, no sound. They used the same line as this summer- "we are having trouble with satellite reception". Playing audio from the Jets game because as the server explained "the manager is a Jets fan" fair enough. As I was leaving the aforementioned manager came over to give us a hard time for trying to apply a couple of free drink tokens we were given because of the inconvenience. Â We never were able to use them and can't see us ever using them now.
