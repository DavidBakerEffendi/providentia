hey I am French and lived in Spain for 3 years. This is NOT a tapas bar. i just moved into an apartment on the block so i picked this place for a date. To make a long story short: AVOID this trap. Poor service, slow slow slow even on a quiet night to just get a drink (had to go to the bar and get menues after I asked 3 times), cocktails were not my taste but the staff could not care less... i canceled dinner and we went somewhere else. weird place. Nobody came to check my coat
