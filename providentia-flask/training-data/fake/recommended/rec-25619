I just had the special for the day 'Beef Quesadilla' Â by far the best Quesadilla I have had in the midtown area. It was not overstuffed or too cheesy. They add an amazing Chipotle sauce and an avocado(guac) spread, that is not over salted. I've only eaten half and I'm satisfied. I will conquer the other have in a few hours.. :-). Overall great service and food.
