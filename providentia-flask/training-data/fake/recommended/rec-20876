Just as Amy C has to say, you are hit in the face with the smell of hickory and fire as you walk in the door. This... is a good thing. This is a great thing, this is why you came here in the first place. This tells you that you'll love the BBQ here. I was jonsing hard for some barbecue, so I ordered the sampler to check out the ribs, brisket, and chicken wings. First off, they seem to serve all their meat without any sauce, and with very little if any dry rub, wet rub, etc. I'm somewhat anti-condiment, so usually with BBQ I like to have the meat seasoned so I can avoid sauce if possible, but that wasn't really the case here. No real worries though because they offer several sauces, so surely there is something to please every palate. The brisket was quite possibly the best, most tender brisket that I've ever had. The ribs were fantastic also, smokey, tender, pulled easily from the bone but not falling off (the proper condition for ribs). The chicken wings had this interesting, burnished sort of skin, much like a Peking duck might. Again, relatively unseasoned, but not dry either. I also had sides of yams and collard greens, both of which were good, but not great. Next time I'll be sure to try other side dishes.
