Thiru, the Dosa Man, Dosa Boss, the Dosa with the Samosa, is without a doubt one of the best vegan options that you can get in an area deep with vegan options. I've been going to him for 6 years - ever since my grad school days in NYU - and he has consistently delivered top notch vegan Indian fare made with great ingredients. Notes: His "spicy" is an "ok" level of spicy. Those who hail from real spice eating cultures will have to ask for extra spicy, meaning if you think tabasco, cholula, and other generic hot sauces provide heat, the regular spicy will do just fine. If you crave an immigrant level of heat, you will need to ask for more.
