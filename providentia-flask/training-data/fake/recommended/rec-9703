Max's is in a neighborhood that's, let's say, not in the better part of Philly. Being from out of town, I drove to Max's my first night in town @ 11pm on Friday, and when I mentioned that to someone the next day they gave me the "are you serious?!".   But regardless of where Max is located, they make some pretty damn good cheesesteaks.  The beef was moist and juicy, american cheese was melted deliciously and the mayo and toppings I had (peppers, pickles, ketchup and mustard) were great.   For $8 you get about a 10 inch sandwich which is STUFFED with succulent beef... maybe not the meal you want at 11pm if you're trying to eat healthy, but it's oh so satisfying. Have yet to try all the steak places in Philly, but from what I've had this is pretty great, and hands down better than Pat''s or Geno's (which are the more touristy spots). But it's all personnal preference. If you like: -soft buns -lots of meat -juicy meat -sliced cheese -mayo Then go to Max's. If you're a cheese whiz fan or like harder buns, go elsewhere. Simple. Not a single bad thing to say, staff were friendly as well, and loving the urban vibes coming from the bar next door.
