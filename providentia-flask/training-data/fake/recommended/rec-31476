I was surprised to find something like this in Jersey. (I'm a NY'er). The coffee was excellent, there were so many choices. The coffee was served in a hug mug-very tasty. We even ordered breakfast which was just as good. I could see this in a Park Slope or somewhere in Manhattan. Definitely worth a trip.
