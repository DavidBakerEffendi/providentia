I popped into this cute little bar yesterday for Sunday brunch with friends. The menu seems small but the food is really tasty. I ordered the fried Catfish Po' Boy and  a biscuit on the side and was so pleased! The fish was well seasoned and I loved the pickled veggies on top. The biscuit was served with some some sort of hot sauce jam and OMG...I need it in mouth again STAT!  Prices seem fair compared to the quality of the food. At $7 a pop I felt that the mimosas were a bit overpriced. I mean...who can really have just one or two mimosas? I'll be skipping them next time in favor of booze. The Asian server/bartender helping us was a sweetheart but seemed a tad overwhelmed as the place filled up. He's cute though so he gets a pass lol. I'll definitely be back for happy hour one of these days.
