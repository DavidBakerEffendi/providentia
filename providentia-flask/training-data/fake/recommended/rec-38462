Market Table is no Market Fable! ....That was bad, but I'm still somewhat proud of it. Top. Notch. It's been almost a week and I am still fondly fantasizing about my dinner here. Everything from the crispy jumbo soft-shell crab craftily stuffed with pesto to the angus strip loin over fontina fondue, cauliflower side-dish, bottle of Garnacha, and pineapple upside down cake rocked and shattered my world. My father was also extremely impressed with his creative scallop crudo and tremendous veal cutlets over fava bean puree. The portions were rather large, the service was impeccable, the ambience charming and yet unpretentious, and the location was unbeatable. Carmine Street is a haven for foodies and wine-o's alike. Another note about service - I came here with my father, who likes to make it his personal mission to suck the blood (Russian expression) of all waitstaff anywhere that have to deal with him. He is probably responsible for the resignment of most waitors in the tri-state area. He is that bad. But Market Table -- he loved, and for the first time in his life, tipped 20%. I don't know that I'll be coming back with my dad, but I will absolutely be coming back for a special occasion in the hopefully-near future.
