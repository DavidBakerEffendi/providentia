First of all.. Cash only. I found out the hard way :( but there is an ATM across the street at the bar. Anyways, a very cute Thai restaurant located in Brooklyn; there is outdoor seating (extremely cute). The staff was very polite, attentive and the service was fast. I got the seafood fried rice which by the way was soooooo worth the price. Loaded with shrimp and squid, large portion. The appetizers were so fresh, by far the best calamari I've ever had (and the sauce it came with was deliciously spicy). Thou there were many people here, I was surprised at how fast the service was. Definitely will be going back whenever I'm in the area.
