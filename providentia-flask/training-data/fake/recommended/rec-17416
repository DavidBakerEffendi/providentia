Can't say enough good things about Cuban Pete's! I have been here a handful of times each time a great experience. Food is all great weather I've gone just for their delicious selections of apps. And a pitcher of sangria (byob) to mix in. Or if I have a full dinner the food and service is 5 star. Love Cuban Pete's
