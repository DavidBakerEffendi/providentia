The space is fantastic.  This would be a great place to take someone for a nice night out, or even a great first date place if you knew (or hoped) that person might turn into something special.  (I could imagine going there year after year for and "anniversary dinner") I went with 2 friends for brunch.  Since they do not accept reservations for brunch we asked if at 10:30 when they opened there would be a line.  The hostess said that would be ideal as it takes about 1/2 hour for the place to start hoping for Sunday brunch. She was exactly correct. we were the first ones seated, and at about 11am all the tables were filled and there were a few people now milling around outside waiting for an open table. We had the meatball sliders to start.  They were amazing, and I could have honestly eaten about 6 of them.  These were on the cover of Bon Appetite magazine about 2 years ago, and I have been really wanting to try them. I ordered the sausage biscuit with greens (really broccoli rabe) and poached eggs with a light hollandaise sauce.  Really there was no sausage flavor (as it turns out I asked the waitress and she said they use sausage fat to make the biscuits, but I really couldn't taste it.)   ($76 for brunch, 1 app split, 3 entrees, 1 side, and 3 teas) If I had a few more days in NY I would come back for dinner.
