A very good burger, not the best I've ever had, but definitely quality.  The fries however, were pretty terrible.  Don't expect the waitstaff to be nice to you, or even acknowledge your presence, but you expect that in NY places like this.  For the price though, a good spot, just remember to bring cash, no credit.
