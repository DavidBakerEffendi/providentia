Okay seriously, I cannot get enough of this place, and neither can my family!   I have been here so many times.  We order from here at least once a month.  We've gotten food for friends here before too, and they always love it.  My sister and I recently took one of our friends here to dine in, and she agreed, this is the best Indian food she's ever had.  When you dine in, it's so wonderful.  The waiters are very attentive and they truly care to know if you enjoy the food.  If you want to take someone here on a date or to introduce them to Indian food - you will not regret it! Also, this place is super super clean (yes, that includes the restroom!)  :) Best restaurant ever, hands down.  The food is definitely fresh and it is always so full of flavor.  Everyone who works here is super nice.  Love you Kamal Palace!
