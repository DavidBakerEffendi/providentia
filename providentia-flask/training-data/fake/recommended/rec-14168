Not that they need another review, but *wow* this place is fantastic. Even though we got here 30 mins before it opened, we were still left out in the cold waiting for over an hour after they opened for a table. Happily, they make the wait worth it by passing out samples from time to time. I am taking off one star though because I am a biscuit addict. And while their biscuit was good, it wasn't warm and, therefore, couldn't live up to the expectation I had on it. I would go back and give them a second chance though =)
