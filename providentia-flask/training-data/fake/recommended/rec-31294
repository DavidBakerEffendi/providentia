Good and simple. Great pho at a good price. 6.50 for a small bowl that fill the ladies up and the large will made the guys think they're pregnant.  Great choice of meats, you can mix and match and they give you ample amounts of mint, bean sprouts,holy basil, &chillies to put in your soup. Service was very fast.  The cold condensed milk was a nice strong dark roast, almost like in Vietnam. The fresh spring rolls were the right size and both the peanut sauce and nouc mam dipping sauces were excellent. I will be back again and again....
