You know whats satisfying. You finally get to the place you have seen a dozen or so times on Food Network or Travel Channel, sit down and the meal is just as great as how it was described on TV. The roast pork sandwich was perfect. I have never heard of the combo before til I saw it on tv. I'm not even a fan of roast pork and this place makes you want to eat it for breakfast and dinner. Interestingly we did arrive at the market around 10:30-11am because we heard the line gets crazy. They do not bring out the other meats til after 11am. I believe it was the brisket and the roast beef. We sat down right at 11am and there wasnt a line but 5 min later there was a line alllllll the way to the back of the market. Seating is limited so I would just take it to go and go sit in the seating area. They also validate parking if you spend over $10.
