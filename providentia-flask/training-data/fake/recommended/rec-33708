An awesome Irish bar with the greasy food you crave. I totally dig the fact they have about six flavors of Lambic on hand and I have been known to have emptied out the stock once or twice. The music that the bartenders play is usually your favorites and when they have the DJ, just about the same thing. And it doesn't hurt that the place seems to staff itself with pretty good looking people. (Both bartenders named JP are my favorites.) On a nice day it rocks to sit at the top of the bar near the door because they keep it open and somehow it gets good light mid to late afternoon!! This is definitely a place I can go by myself and have a few or with friends it's equally as charming. Definitely a good place to hang. Also, when the scaffolding acros the street was still up, that was prime parking for your bike. However, now that it's gone, not so much space left to lock up.
