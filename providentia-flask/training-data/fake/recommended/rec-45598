I think I might be the only person who doesn't like this place. I've given them several chances and I've always been underwhelmed. Once, when I ordered general tso's tofu, the tofu seemed to be raw with sauce just poured on top. At least bread and fry it or something! No thanks. My eggroll also had a weird gray thing in it. The other two times, the food was good but I later got the worst headaches of my life. I don't have a problem with MSG so maybe it's just coincidence, but I've never had headaches like that any other time. I'm not willing to risk it at third time.
