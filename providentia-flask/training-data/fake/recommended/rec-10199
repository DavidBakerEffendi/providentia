Apparently, this is a hot spot.  I had a late night bite here with a couple of friends about a month ago.   I prefer the fries in McDonald because they're more crispy; the fries at this place aren't that. But  what sets this place apart is the plethora of sauces available.  My friends and I ordered different sauces so we can sample.  I particularly liked the rosemary and pesto sauce.  Btw, the fries come in big portions, so a medium order is enough for two people esp. if you only wanna snack.  And this is a fast food place so there's very limited seating in the back.   Overall, this place is an interesting experience, but really nothing to write home about. ehh 3 stars.
