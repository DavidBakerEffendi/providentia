My 4* is for the food. This place would get 5* for service, being very friendly and generally accommodative. Bistango first caught my eye when I was searching for good Gluten free options in the city to go to with a close friend who had recently been diagnosed with a gluten allergy. When I saw an InBundles coupon for $15 off $30 I jumped on it. As it went, the expiry date was approaching, I had an extended out of town trip pending, and we had difficulty coordinating schedules. Result: gluten free friend left in the lurch, and I ended up there with my usual gluten loving dining companion. Having said that, we still had a great meal in spite of not taking advantage of any of the gluten-free cuisine on offer. The two of us share a gnocchi with short rib ragu and spinach, a cavatelli with sausage hot cherry peppers and brocolloi rabe, and a side of mushrooms. Nothing was mindblowing, but everything was tasty and hit the spot. Coupled with a couple of glasses of wine (reasonable selection, reasonably priced) it was an enjoyable meal.
