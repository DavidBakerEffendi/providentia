I gave the food 5 stars but the service two stars. There was ten of us and we all really enjoyed our food, the burgers tasted great and where cooked right! And the fry selection was amazing, but the service was spotty. Our server was nice and smiling but it took a long time to get change from our checks and when we needed more beverages, we couldn't find her, but what we could see is a bunch of people hangout around the host stand. One of was even the manager on duty! Not impressed by that at all. We tried it. Probably won't be back for a while.
