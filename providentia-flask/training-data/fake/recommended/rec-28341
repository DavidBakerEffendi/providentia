Awesome restaurant. I came here with friends and we ate enough food to feed a small country and put me into a coma. I ate so much I almost died. But, I just had to eat it. If you go here, you'll understand. They divide the menu into "small" and "big" which somewhat matches starters and entrees - however the smalls could pass for a meal for one person, and the bigs can easily be shared by two people. In my opinion, the smalls are also better. They have something called "Dublin Dr. Pepper" and if you're a fan of Dr. Pepper you will love it. Also, get the cornbread. Don't question me on this. It is prepared and served in a cast iron pan, with butter and honey. I didn't get or try the salad/wedge, but my friends did and it looked real good. Also, order the mac & cheese. This is not an option! I don't care what meat/carb/fun-free diet or plan you think you're on. It has bacon bits in it. Like I said, I almost died. I'm still working on the bigs. Some friends had the roast half chicken, which looked good, but not quite my style (a lot of white meat). I had the country fried steak. Let me reiterate that it should be shared. Fried steak is not exactly an idea that makes my mouth water, but I ate all of it by myself, so it must have been pretty good as far as that goes. It came with mashed potatoes (good) and cabbage with bacon (not crazy about the greens, but the bacon helped). I washed that down with a chocolate bread pudding dessert, which was also meant for two people to share. I guess it was just one of those days. I planned to take half of it home for later, but I got bored and just kept picking at it until it was all gone. Oh yeah - it was good. I'll add that the restaurant also has a really nice, chill atmosphere, a great place to come with a big group or with a date, or better yet a double-date. The waiters are super friendly, too. A home run.
