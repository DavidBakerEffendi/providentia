This is probably the best burger I have EVER had! The hype is real. I came here around 530 with my bf. There was no wait time and the place was actually kind of empty. They have two floors of seating. We were seated on the upper level. One thing I wasn't crazy about was how close the tables were to each other (if you only have a party of 2) but I guess it's excepted in popular restaurants. I ordered the truffle burger and my bf had the manly burger. First bite of the truffle burger and I was in awe. It is the best burger I have ever had. The meat was so juicy and tender. This burger was also NOT greasy at all. It was full of flavor and everything in the burger compliments each other.  The waitress recommended having the burger medium rare and medium rare it should be! It's perfect with a little pink the middle. The manly burger was also good with fried onion ring inside the burger.  We also ordered sweet potato fries. That was okay but the ketchup that it came with was delicious.  We also tried their garlic aioli and it was the bomb! Everything in this restaurant is very good. One request would be bigger portions. After having finishing everything I def. had room for something else. But this place does take burgers to a whole new level. $12 a burger? I think it's worth it and I will def. come back for more!
