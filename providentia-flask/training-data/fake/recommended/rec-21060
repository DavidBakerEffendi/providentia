Quick review:  pricey for what it is, over-hyped, and noisy - better for drinks with friends than a sit-down meal. Ok, we've given Egan a few shots now, and it has yet to really live up to some of the hype.  The food can be good - lamb stew one time was quite good in fact - but mostly not anything to rave about.  Have had similar quality food at local diners and at a better price point.  The interior is quite nice, but the bar in the middle of the restaurant makes it very noisy no matter where you are in the restaurant.  Definitely sit in the back if you want to have a decent conversation with your dinner party.   Service definitely needs improvement as well.  Hostess was downright rude.  Also, not very kid-friendly.  Would go here for a beer or a casual bite with a friend maybe but it's not worth a 15 minute wait or the rude hostess - actually, will probably not be back.
