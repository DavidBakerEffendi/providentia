Wolfnights is the old Three Monkeys.  I really liked Three Monkeys and was a bit sad when they closed down.  Wolfnights does not seem as welcoming to drunkards as Three Monkeys was, but then again I went on a Sunday night.  There is a variety of interesting combinations for wraps.  Wolfnights even freshly press their own wrap dough.  They proceed to cook it on a heated hut contraption. -People like the Brother's Grimm Wrap--chicken wrapped in chestnut chilly dough.  The crunch of the plantain chips mixed well with the sweetness of the raisins.  I do wish that the sauce and the meat weren't buried in the bottom of the wrap because in the first 10 bites all I got were lettuce and pickled mushrooms.  An inexpensive wrap for $6.95. -My friend met his soul wrap--the Underworld Wrap with angus meatballs, toasted cashews, and granny smith apples.  He said, "I am pretty in love with that wrap.  Those Cashews, man!"  A little more money for the beef...$8.95. -There is only one guy taking orders and making the wraps.  He wasn't all too enthusiastic, but I don't blame him.  When I asked for more sauce and a glass of water, he seemed overwhelmed by my two requests.  No worries though, he delivered what I asked for as soon as he had a moment to breathe.  Side note, Wolfnights wasn't terribly busy. -You can sit by the window in suspended swing seats.  I thought the swings were an innovative idea.  Though It can get cumbersome to be flowing back and forth in between bites.  I also hit my head on the chains holding up the swing when I turned to talk to my friend. I do want to come back to try the falafel wrap and the shrimp wrap.  The wolf has me hooked.
