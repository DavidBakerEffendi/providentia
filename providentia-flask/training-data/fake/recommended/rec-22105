What a great place nestled in Bed-Stuy with amazing Italian comfort food, great selection of wine, and a very relaxing place to sit down for a quite dinner.  The owner put a lot of thought and care in the restaurant and it really shows with the experience you get.  You never feel rushed, the food is always good, and the staff is very attentive. great for a date or quiet dinner.
