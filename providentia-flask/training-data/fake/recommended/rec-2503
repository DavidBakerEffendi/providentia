You know what? I'm not even going to bother to write a proper review everyone has repeated what I am about to say. To keep things short, this place this damn good and damn deceiving. You see fifty people ahead of you? Don't worry, it'll only be five minutes. You wonder how and where the vendor gets its food? It is the result witchcraft and magic. Is it clean or sanitary? You're probably drunk/high and you don't care anyway. For all those people wondering if they should go get some? Go get some. Wait on line, know what you're getting, have your money out, get your food and get the hell out of their way; they have a job to do. Is it the best food you will ever have? Probably not. Is it even good food? Nope, far from it. But the simple fact is no other place is open until 5 AM and serves piping hot food to a large crowd. Advice? Easy on the hot sauce (people always make that mistake the first time) and never go easy on the white sauce. And watch your car, unless of course you want $115 ticket on your windshield, courtesy of the NYPD (Jersey people will never learn).
