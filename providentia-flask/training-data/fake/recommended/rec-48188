The place is not very far from the centre off all the tourist places , but one of the best Phili steak places .. The staff is helpful and a very casual place .. You can even make the sandwich as spicy as you want , the chili is amazing and halepeno Â are just to die for .. The place is nothing very fancy but food compensates for everything
