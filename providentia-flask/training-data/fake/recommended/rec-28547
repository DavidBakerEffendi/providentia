I wanted to write a review while still at the restaurant but the good food had me so relaxed I did some writing on my book instead. Home and eating the last of my "Crack Bar". Shaking my head in a good way. Sort of like in a baaaaad meaning good way.  I had the grand master veg --a sort of casserolish veggie thinge w/ a side of sauteed greens. I thought it was priced ok and worth it. So was the Crack Bar, my dessert.  I eat a lot of raw so it can be pretty expensive so strangely enough I wasn't super shocked by the prices...but oh the Wild Fish Sticks? Um $25 a lb and I got one just to taste.  Thought about giving the one fish stick back when I saw it was $4.14 but since I cook a lot I was curious thinking what is Hu Kitchen  gonna' do to this wild fish in a stick. Um, can you say delicious?!?! Well, say it. The roasted chicken smelled great and annoyed the hell out of me since I cannot eat chicken anymore. I tried the cauliflower rice --just  a taste- but felt like what I make at home tastes better. I give 5 stars---it's super clean, staff is cool, the decor is nice, music wasn't too loud and I loved everything I ate. Will return and will recommend to those in my life who cannot do grains, gluten, dairy, sugar and soy.  I have many restrictions right now for health reasons. Do you know how lovely it is to stumble upon a restaurant that actually serves my needs? Like I ate good without cheating!! SO glad I walked past that Thai spot. I get Hu chocolate bars once a month from Fairway but wasn't aware of the restaurant. If Hu Kitchen were a person I would hug them! Not cheap but the bomb.com.....Makes me wish we lived in a country, in a culture where good food that's good for you doesn't have to be so damn expensive but maybe that's a blog post and not a YELP review. Hu Kitchen wins for me. My health accountability partner & I will be visiting this spot.....
