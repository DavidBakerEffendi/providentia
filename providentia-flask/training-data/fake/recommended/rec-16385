We went to Bufad on a rainy Sunday night. We did make a reservation because the place is very small. It is really nice inside and simple and we were greeted immediately when we walked in the door. The service was really great all night, people were constantly checking on us and seeing how we liked everything. We ordered an appetizer of grilled octopus,  an arugula salad and the special pizza of the night. Everything was very good but the pizza was the standout. The was the Cacio é Pepe pizza with Italian fennel sausage, roasted peppers, shaved pecorino cheese and black peppers. The grilled octopus was crispy and had a nice flavor. The arugula salad had melon and good portion of Prosciutto. We also had an interesting rice  pudding and gelato dessert. Bufad is as good as pizzeria Vetri, which is really great and blows away Pizza Brain. Bufad is also BYOB which is nice and it keeps the bill down Our total bill for three people was around $50. We will definitely will be back and for 3 people I would recommend one appetizer and 2 pizzas.
