Holy Lamb-Shanks, Batman, this place was good. As soon as you walk in you're tempted with the display of deserts, but the portions were so big that no one had room left to try them. Next time we go -- and there will be a next time -- we won't make that rookie mistake. They were not stingy with the pita bread to start and the eggplant dip was amazing. Diego, the server, told us that the Double Lamb Shanks are marinated for five hours and beautifully braised and he wasn't lying. The meat was the definition of fall-off-the-bone. It was so juicy and tender that I never had to use my knife to get to the meat. The pasta and feta were a great touch that turned a good meal into a memorable experience. The gyro platter was good. There was so much lamb on the plate and the white sauce went well with the herb-covered pita. Both meals were left more than enough for lunch the next day. Every employee that we came in contact with was very friendly, and Diego said that he has had every option on the menu and helped guide our choices.
