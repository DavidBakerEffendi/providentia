This place is pretty rad.  It's got a great ambiance good for a small group or a romantic date.  They also have a high chair so even my 2 year old has has a few delicious meals here.  We've been here for dinner, take out and brunch and we've always had uber attentive service (ummm, my son looooooves a few of the lovelies at this place).  They have delicious cocktails and great food.  It's always hard to pick when you come here.  It is super easy to gorge out on the food and huge portions so come hungry!
