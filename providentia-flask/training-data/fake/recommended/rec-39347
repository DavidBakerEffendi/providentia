Although it may look like cheap American Chinese food from its outward appearance (in a strip mall) this place has delicious authentic Chinese cuisine. There are the dishes you would associate with classic american-chinese fair, but far more that are interesting and probably new to you! This would be fun with a group if you have a lazy susan spinner on the table so everyone can taste the dishes (as you will see Chinese families doing). BYOB too! They are reviewed in the NY Times too. Check it.
