I like Meme.  The food is very good and the service is great.  Nice wine list, too. I visited Meme on November 12 with a family friend who visited from Los Angeles.  The wait was about 15 minutes at 7:15 as the tables were turning over.  We waited for one of the corner tables on the window.  I had a quick word with the diners who left right before we entered, there was a small traffic jam getting through the door and I used the moment to ask about their dinner.  They were very pleased. We sat, shared a starter of grilled octopus.  It was fantastic and the garnish was great, as well.  We had the special, tuna two-ways.  There was a brochette and a piece of grilled tuna steak.  I was very happy with this.  It was quite good and the portion was perfect to split between two people.  We finished off with the lemon tart.  I'm not much of a dessert guy, so my friend had most.  But, I was pleased. Overall, great place.  I'll be back.
