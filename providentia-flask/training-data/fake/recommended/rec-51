The main concept is simple. Salads and stir-fry made to order. The execution is fun - use their touch-screen a la Wawa to create your meal, and then enjoy it within 5 minutes time (much less for a salad). Locally sourced ingredients, and I'd say you can taste the difference. Super busy during lunch on weekdays, pretty easy nights and weekends. What to try for those who want a recommendation: Create your own stir fry - Egg noodles Grilled Chicken Broccoli Bean sprouts Mushrooms Bok choy Oyster sauce Create your own salad - Spinach Tomato Onion Avocado Grilled Chicken Fresh lemon (don't underestimate how amazingly yummy this is compared to a traditional dressing) Expect to pay between 10-15 bucks, but also expect to fully enjoy your food and feeling great afterwards.
