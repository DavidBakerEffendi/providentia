Went to dinner for the first time here last night and it was AWESOME! I highly recommend the Enchiladas del Mar!  They were fantastic!  Also, the portions were very generous.  I had dinner last night and lunch for today :)And the guacamole for an appetizer was a great starter.  I definitely will be back again soon!  And the service was just as good as the food :)
