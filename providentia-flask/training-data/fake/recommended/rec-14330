Believe the hype! The NY and Grandma style slices are great here. My favorite is the Grandma (square style) with just mozzarella and tomato sauce. They have a few tables to sit down, I have only been here around 2 and never had to wait long but I expect it is fairly crowded closer to noon. Plus, you get to check out the multitudes of celebs that have eaten here, they all have photos on the wall with the owner.
