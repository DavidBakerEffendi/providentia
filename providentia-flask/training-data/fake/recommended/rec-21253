I've been to Momo Sushi Shack twice now.... within the span of a week.  Both times I've made a point of ordering new things and all of my choices were excellent.   As a sushi purist I was surprised to find how much I enjoyed the uni and salmon with wasabi stems.  The stems added a nice dimension to the texture and flavor of the dish without the expected wasabi spiciness. I also ordered the yellowtail and scallion with fresh wasabi.  This $5 dish comes presented in a tiny bowl and packs so much flavor that my friend actually commented on my blissful appearance as I savored every bite. I don't normally opt for hot dishes at sushi restaurants, but both of our visits were on abnormally cold and rainy days this summer.  The first time I ordered the curry udon with seafood.  It was incredible!  My only suggestion is to wear a dark colored shirt if you slurp your noodles like me.  On my second trip I had the pork belly.  The delicious fattiness of the pork belly was cut by a wasabi cream and the broth it came in was so delicious that I ordered a side of rice so as to not leave a drop behind. In addition to the awesome food, Momo's staff is friendly and accommodating. The prices are very reasonable, the level of freshness is great and the shack's interior is very welcoming.  Overall, I really couldn't ask for more from my sushi experience. I will definitely be back for more Momo Sushi Shack!
