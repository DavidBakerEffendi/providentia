Amada was a taste sensation!!  We braved the snowstorm of the decade, and sloshed through puddles of grey melting snow to keep our lunch reservation.  Try the tortilla espanol with saffron aioli and chicken broshettes to start.  The sandwiches were very tasty, with distinct flavors melting together on fresh crusty bread.  The rock  floor area in the front was unique!
