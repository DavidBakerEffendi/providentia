Went for a Saturday brunch this past weekend, my friend got the eggs florentine and i got the croque. The toast was the right amount greasiness and the combination of cheese and ham is yummy but not something to write home about. However, my friend and I both agreed that the potato fries were simply heavenly. They were fried to the perfect crisp and no annoying potato skin that I need to pick out. The cubes were large enough to still taste the potato but small enough to be still crispy. Flavored perfectly too. Just the fries will bring me back to this place again. The prix fix is about $15 or so, not expensive for NYC. Although I wish they would give us refills for the orange juice/coffee. Now the restaurant itself. The space is definitely very tight, even for a place in NYC. They tried to cram as many tables and chairs there as possible, which is understandable given the amount of business they are trying to cater to. Another thing that I'm not so keen about is the waiting. We were asked to wait outside but the waitress wouldn't take names. In another words, we have to wait outside this whole time without being able to wander around and come back. So given the physical conditions of the restaurant, I take one star away.
