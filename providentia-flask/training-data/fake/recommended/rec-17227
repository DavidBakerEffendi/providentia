I went to Bengal Tiger while here in NYC on a business trip with a friend. The food here is excellent. The service is excellent. The price is excellent. We came here and got the Prix Fix Dinner for $14.95, which included an appetizer, entree, and dessert. I ordered the vegetable samosa for dinner, which was delicious, and plentiful for a single person. I than ordered the curry lamb (spicy) with basmati rice and an order of naan on the side. The curry lamb was delicious and I recommend the naan for dipping in the sauce. The entire entree was delicious, like lick the plate delicious. Finally, the dessert was Kheer, the only option, which was an indian styled rice pudding. It was rich, creamy and sweet. It had some chutneys in it and I enjoyed it very much. All together, the food price and service were all excellent and I definitely enjoyed the experience here. Â Will visit again when I come to NYC.
