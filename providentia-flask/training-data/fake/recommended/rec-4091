Oof.. What a dog. When they first opened I got a flier in the mail advertising Brick Oven Pizza. Being in NJ, I am used to most pizza places being generally above average and good. It's hard to get pizza wrong here! Unfortunately, Brick Oven Pizza is the one place to do it wrong. The dough is too thick and sticky, and the cheese.... Glue, I guess? Actually, it reminded me of the pizza you would get for free at school, or even a better example: Chuck-e-Cheese pizza. Yes, it's on that level as far as flavor goes. I'm not sure if the pizza here is really brick oven or not. I'm certainly not going back to find out.
