Take your order out,..... Best Egg White Omelet.  Very large portion.   Great sourdough bread.... The blueberry pancakes were very good.  But, I think they were too dense, for my taste. I think the staff is really nice... Given the fact, that CSB is a mad house all the time, they handle the crowd really well, and they don't seem to be frustrated during the most hectic hours... People waiting for a table, like to block the entrance door.  I understand, there is no specific waiting area, but I don't think they should block the entrance door.
