continued from my Geno's review So we finished our steak and walked across the street to Pat's, what a world of difference, like coming from the glitzy Vegas strip to old school Fremont street, this place had more character like a well worn perfectly fitting jacket. My wife did the ordering this time and she stumbled as well but the person at the counter told her it was all right Â and told her how to order correctly. the steak came out a little under seasoned but with the right amount of cheese and the same soft roll. I'm sure if there was a little more seasoning that day, it would be just as tasty as Geno's. So my verdict on the debate, If you had to eat at one, go to Geno's but make sure you order correctly otherwise you'll feel like an outcast, then take that steak and sit over at Pat's for the friendly atmosphere. But this was just one visit to either location, I need to go back again and have a couple more steaks if not for hungers sake.
