One of my favorite in NYC. I have been here more than five times and the quality has been consistently good. You must sit at the counter and watch the chef prepare and hand you the food. I must admit that love the atmosphere and friendly service more than the food. Have Grilled everything with their warm sake! It offer such unique experience.
