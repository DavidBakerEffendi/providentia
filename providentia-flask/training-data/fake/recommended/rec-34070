An excellent relaunch of this fire-damaged favorite.  The new space is much larger, with a good-sized bar area with tables where you can (at least currently) order food.   The bar itself should be a draw with a number of inventive recipes and a reasonably priced wine list.  For what it's worth, I was not a huge fan of the margarita that I tried.  It was a bit too bitter for my taste. My party ordered a range of items from the "small" plates menu including the tripe chili (don't fear the tripe; it just adds a slightly gamey richness to this already-delicious chili), meatloaf sandwich (on buttery Texas toast), quail (beautifully seasoned), wedge salad (a classic American favorite, and something that, until you actually eat it, you kind of forget how good it is), jalapeno cornbread, Dr. Pepper ribs, oysters and brussels sprouts (which unfortunately didn't actually make it to the table).  Not a loser among them.  I highly recommend going for the tripe chili and the ribs, as those were probably my two favorite items.  I would have liked to try some of the large dishes like the trout, and I'll be back for that. My only very small gripe was that there wasn't a steak for one on the menu.  On a menu that is very heavily geared toward Southern food and cuisine that isn't particularly healthy, I would have liked to see a simple grilled meat option that you could order a single order of.  I felt like having both the steak and the pork dishes being for two really just left the person wanting a basic meat thing with only the fish options.  Like I said, though, that's a very small gripe.   I will definitely be back to this restaurant and imagine that it will only continue to improve during this launch phase.
