Incredibly mediocre- my chicken fingers were way over cooked and they were soooo crunchy and hard. The food is pretty plain and flavorless. The decor is terrible and all of the walls are peach with American flags. I ate with 5 other people and all of their food looked very ehhh-ish. Eat here if you're desperate.
