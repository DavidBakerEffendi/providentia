Came here on our trip to Philly. The wait is pretty long but well worth it. The portions are huge!! Best of all the menu is vegan friendly. :) I had a vegan scramble with home fries and vegan sausage. Was stuffed! The restaurant seems to be built from three houses combined. It's very unique and has a home style feel. I highly recommend this place.
