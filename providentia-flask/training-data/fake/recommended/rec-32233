The concept at this Biergarten is pretty cool. The food is good and interesting, and there a lots of great beers on tap. It can get a but loud, and if course because it's in the now trendy & hipster Fishtown, there are lots of skinny jeans running around in this place. Additionally, parking is virtually impossible to a weekend, so if you can Frankford El it in, I would highly recommend you do so.
