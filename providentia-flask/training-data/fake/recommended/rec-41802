OMG THIS PLACE. I could eat here forever. Except only during happy hour. Crushed margarita is awesome but don't take it outside, it's illegal and they won't say anything. But the police will sure say something. I recommend eating all the tacos all the time. Don't get stuck on a favorite as they are all amazing. Maybe someday there will be real outdoor seating where you can sit with your crushed margarita. In the meantime there is often a likeable crazy man to keep you company on the bench. If you get him a taco he will tell you amusing stories. If you don't get him a taco, he will still tell you amusing stories. Oh yeah, it's a one tortilla kind of place. Sometimes you need a fork. It gets reeeeal busy. Don't go during peak meal times.
