I will talk about the Hibachi since I can get better sushi elsewhere. Don't get me wrong they have standard rolls for decent prices but this place should be known for its Hibachi, that or someone should talk about it hehe I went with my family and we chose hibachi because I do not think there is any other hibachi place in NH.....am I wrong? Anyhow, our chef person was fun, entertaining, put on a good show as he prepared our hibachi-ed meals. Priced fairly well if you have a big group you can enjoy more! I would not suggest young children going there but then again parents do what they want. Other than that - nice decor, pretty friendly wait staff, I think there is also live music every once in a while. For those unexpected leftovers bring along your own take out containers!! SAY NO TO PLASTIC BAGS!
