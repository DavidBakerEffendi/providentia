Planning an office party or meeting? Or just having a few guests over for lunch or dinner? I highly recommend u try catering with Hummus & Pita Co.! It will leave your co workers & friends drooling when they see a nice big platter of fresh falafel,shwarma, & chicken, or steak taboon! Pita chips baked fresh daily also go well with a couple of large side orders of different flavored hummus's! My favorites the sun dried tomato or roasted red pepper hummus!! Mmm mmm mmm...delish!! So next event or get together call Hummus & Pita co. & inquire about their catering. You can also pick up a catering menu next time u stop in or online on the website. 2 thumbs up!! I can't get enough of it!!! ; )
