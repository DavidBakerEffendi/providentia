This review is based on delivery.  I ordered their lobster roll, asking that the lobster meat not be fried.  This was repeated at least 4 times so I was pretty confident I was going to receive what I asked for.  Nope.  The lobster meat was tempura fried.  And for $17+ tip, I should hold off and buy myself a lobster roll from the RHLP since there wasn't much meat in the roll.  The atmosphere looks so inviting every time I walk by around dinner, but I think I'll try Ani Sushi next time I have a hankering for sushi delivery.
