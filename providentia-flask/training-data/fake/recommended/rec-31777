While Day By Day is a bit lacking in atmosphere, the food and service are reliably good and often great. One crowded weekend brunch, I didn't hear my name called when our table was ready and we ended up waiting longer than necessary. When we realized what had happened, not only was the host very apologetic, but we were comped some delicious baked goods. I especially recommend the potato pancakes, the stuffed French toast special, and the chorizo hash (not on the menu but seems to be a frequent special).
