Think of a place that was prob once really good, got alot of attention and hype, then became complacent. This is that place. I heard about this place from a friend who said it was deeliiiiicious. And going there, I saw the hype of the place but it didnt match up to its food. I ordered a Philly cheesesteak, everything on it with American cheese. I got a sandwich with cold steak, barely any provolone cheese and way too many onions. Â  I was with a party of five, three of which did get provolone and two american. but i guess that was too much for them to handle and just decided to give us all provolone. We would've gone back for them to change it but the line was too long And we had already gotten into our car. The only reason they got a second star was because the bread was pretty good. All in all, don't believe the hype.
