This is one of the best local Indian restaurants I have found. I am very picky about Indian restaurants because I am Indo-Guyanese and can cook better Indian food at home. That being said, I have been here several times and the entrees here are great. The desserts aren't so good so I pass on those, and sometimes during the lunch buffet they do not refill the buffet offerings frequently enough, but I definitely recommend ordering from the menu here.
