Went in search of a chill lunch place to eat and do a little work and decided to try out Walter's. It was almost totally empty at 12 pm on a Thursday, which was perfect for me. The atmosphere is great-- welcoming and airy. I love the giant circular bar, good addition to the space. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fries, and both were excellent.  The fries were perfectly crispy and salty, and the pork had a great sauce, which paired well with the pickles and slaw it came with.  I was totally stuffed afterwards, and at the lunch prices, it was a pretty good deal!  The servers were very attentive and easygoing.  I'll definitely be back!
