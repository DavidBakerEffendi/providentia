I love this building. Visited it a couple times in the early nineties when it was Revival, but this was my first trip back. Thankfully I skipped its incarnation as Cayote Ugly. We sat right by the open window in the front. Great people watching spot. On the window sill next to us was a cool collection of carnivorous plants. I asked for my burger rare... And they did not disappont. Perfectly rare burger. Great Â thick steak fries. Carolyn had the buffalo shrimp. Great server (Anny?) and an attentive and friendly staff. Not sure the $10 pitcher of lager was worth the price (since pints were $2.50 and I think we only got about three and a half pints out of the pitcher) but everything else was well worth the price.
