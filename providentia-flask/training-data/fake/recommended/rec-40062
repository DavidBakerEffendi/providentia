Went on a Sunday afternoon with my boyfriend after seeing several people stroll in. We both ordered the burger topped with a fried egg. It was amazing!! They had several cheeses to choose from, my bf choosing the cheddar while I chose the pepper jack. The fries were big, fat steak fries, which I don't think restaurants use enough. Â My only complaint was that the service was very, very slow, which can be a problem when you have the meter running.
