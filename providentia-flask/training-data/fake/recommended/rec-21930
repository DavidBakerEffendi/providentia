I went here because I had a Groupon, otherwise I would never have known it existed... and I'm so happy I found it. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the atmosphere- it's just a little bit too casual for my taste- and the dinner rolls were not quite worth the carbs. Otherwise, I couldn't find a thing I didn't like about this place. Food was delicious; the bread could have been a little heartier but everything else was great. I had the pan-seared filet mignon in a reduction sauce and crumbled blue cheese- this thing was the best steak I've ever eaten, and I'm a serious foodie. One of my companions had the porterhouse and that was delicious too. We shared the Clams Casino and the Shrimp in Garlic Sauce, both were very good. Our waitress was Melissa who was a lot of fun, very friendly and attentive. I'm looking forward to going back! Updating my review: I recently went back for a second time for a birthday and had an even better experience. It didn't seem quite as casual as I remembered - felt a lot cozier, not sure if they changed things - and even the bread was great. I had the same dish as last time, but tried some new appetizers, which were just as good as last time. Our waitress memorized our names (there were six of us) and addressed us by name whenever she spoke to us. This is the friendliest, coziest, most delicious place around and I'm a true pain in the neck about restaurants.
