Stopped for brunch after running errands in the neighborhood. Surprisingly crowded and overheard 40-45min wait for seating inside...on a weekday! Over the weekend, I can understand, but seems a little ridic that folks were willing to wait on a Monday. No wait for seating outdoors and surprisingly warm sitting outside in the sun. Ordered the ricotta pancakes which were delicious. Great portion sizes as I people-watched other's orders waiting for my second cup of coffee. No free refills sadly...and service was a bit slow, but overall good food and I would return.
