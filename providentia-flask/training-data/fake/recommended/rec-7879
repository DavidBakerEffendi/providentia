I so wanted to give this place 4 stars, but I just couldn't. The main reason being the service. I had made a reservation for a party of three for a Friday evening at 9pm. Our assigned table wasn't immediately ready so we were told it would be a few minutes. I get it, it's Friday, they're crowded and you can't force someone to leave their table so another party can be sat. That being said, I just wish the staff would have been more attentive. The hostess told us our table was still occupied when we were first told to wait then... that was it. For the next 25 minutes the hostess stared at us as we waited awkwardly in the front entrance (they don't really have the room to wait). Not once were we offered a seat at the bar, or a drink, or even a menu while we waited. Once finally seated, the wine was delicious. They had a fairly large selection and the hummus app I ordered was tasty and very filling. Our waitress never said anything to us about our wait, and was quasi-attentive throughout the evening. I would most likely go again, but with the notion I may have to wait awhile to get my wine.
