Everyone should go to Pat's at least once. I took my daughter in law there for her first cheese steak (she is from Missouri). She loved the neighborhood, and energy between Pat's and Geno's. The steak was good, but if you are from Philly or the surrounding area there are better places to get a cheese steak.
