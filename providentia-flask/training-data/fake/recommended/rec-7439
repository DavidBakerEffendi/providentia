¡Ay, caramba!  Since leaving Southern California 14 years ago, I have yet to find good Mexican food on the East Coast.  There are a couple of decent places in New York City, but they're not home to me.  But then I found Taqueria LES and I was home for the first time in a long time. The ambiance of the place is exactly what you want from a good hole in the wall Mexican dive.  It was clean, tacky, and a Mexican flag and piñata hung from the ceiling.  Even though it was 30 degrees outside, it started to feel like sunny California to me. I got fish tacos and a carnitas tostada.  First, the fish tacos... Fish tacos are my litmus test of a good Mexican place.  These fish tacos were fresh, crisp, lightly fried and not over cooked.  They were topped with tangy salsa verde, cool crema mexicana, and crunchy cabbage.  These tacos were legit and I was in love. My coworkers and I concurred that the carnitas were a delight.  They were tender, juicy, and just the right combination of salty and spicy.  They melted in your mouth.   Hands down, we decided that this was our new Mexican home away from home.  Now if I could just get all of my Cali friends to move here, I'd have no reason to ever go back to Cali - well except for the sunsets. ordinarylifeextraordinar…
