The wait doesn't matter. As with all the other reviews, the staff is super friendly, the food is great, and it has a great vibe. There are chairs to sit on while you wait, and we got free coffee, cookies, water, orange slices, strawberries, and lemon pork. Try to get on the patio, its nice out there!
