This restaurant seems to be a relatively undiscovered gem. I'd love to continue not waiting for seating, but I think it's more important to up the business here so it can continue to stay in business. I've been here twined and thoroughly enjoyed both experiences. The first time I had the chicken and waffles, which were fabulous. This time I had the eggs Benedict with chipotle hollandaise. The hollandaise was not very spicy, but I discovered that you have to tell the servers you want your food spicy. Also the Benedicts are made on Yorkshire pudding. Difficult to cut/eat but the texture I swell worth the struggle. I also ordered a Bloody Mary and specified spicy, and that was delicious. The service is quick and attentive, the noise levels appropriate, the decor is sleek, and the waiting area is comfortable. In short, I'm looking forward to coming back for dinner.
