I really enjoyed the cheesesteak sandwich, but I felt uncomfortable with the atmosphere.  I felt like the people might be racist and later heard there were rumors to corroborate that.  I give them an A-OK for the actual food and not the environment.  I haven't tried Pat's yet and do plan to, but I hear both places are overrated and there are better places nearby (Jimmy's).  Either way, my profile pic is from my visit to Geno's, and I still intend to try Pat's someday.
