We went recently with our kids. The kids loved it but the reality is this is very average food that is very overpriced. The feel is basically that of any average chain restaurant. The cost of a hamburger is close to $15 and again, Â nothing special. I was not even wowed by the $6 hot chocolate. But if you have kids, I am sure they will think it is fun.
