We, 4 of us total, came here because it was busy outside last night for dinner time and we decided to do a walk in for lunch today and it was still about 45 min wait. There's a second floor and it is gorgeous especial with the Christmas decorations everywhere. The waiter was extremely nice and explain everything well, from appetizer to entree and let us know that the sizes of the food are family shared. We got fried calamari as an appetizer and it's the biggest appetizer we've ever seen. We also got lasagna, shrimp paramagiana, and chicken scalloped scapiana, and the portion sizes were huge, and really delicious. We had to take two entrees to go. Great food, great company, and awesome service!
