I don't usually write reviews, but when a place this delicious opens two doors down from you, you feel compelled. We went here every day for a week until we'd exhausted the menu. I'm just going to mention my favorites here, but everything is good. The herb chicken is perfectly cooked, and extremely flavorful and moist. Well seasoned. The burger is legit. The wafco is surprisingly light and crisp, thanks to the Asian-style veggies (no, this is not Taco Bell). The cheesecake is 100% homemade (we watched it coming out) and quite delicious -- it's lighter, and reminded me more of the cheesecake I've had in Japan than of NY style. The brussels sprouts are also tasty, but when it comes to sides, BISCUITS AND SAUSAGE GRAVY are king. The owners are also friendly without being overbearing, and regularly give us (for free) stuff they're experimenting with for the menu. Last time it was sweet potato beignets (really hope they become a permanent fixture because they were delicious). The space is very cute, pleasant, and modern, too. Come here. Your mouth will be a happy mouth.
