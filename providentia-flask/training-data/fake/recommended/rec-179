If you love to look cool and you want to bang, go to Rudy's. Nix the Yalie season and go during the summer when the locals are more visible- they're the ones who ride their bikes and stay for 30 minutes, but still quite a parade. Eat frites with samurai, curry ketchup, dutch special, or pesto mayo. Say something under your breath to the bartender and depending on the time of day, you'll definitely get some spit in your Stella Artois. I like Rudy's, really I do. It can be a bit overwhelming for the conscious, daily alkie, but a treat for the once-a-monther looking to tear someone a new asshole or share a drink with friends. Don't be overwhelmed by the dank sweathole and live a little.
