I've been going to Vincenzo's on a regular basis for over a year now, and I wish I could give more than 5 stars, because it definitely deserves it! Sue and her staff treat you like family, not just another customer. Â Everything is homemade, and if you want to "think outside the box," and Sue has the ingredients, she'll whip it up, no questions asked! there are the "regulars," who are there every day for breakfast and/or lunch; it kind of reminds you of the TV show, "Cheers," where "everybody knows your name.". Sue's father-in-law is in and out, making deliveries reading the paper, and chatting with everyone. If you're looking fir delicious homemade food and a great atmosphere, Vincenzo's is your best bet!
