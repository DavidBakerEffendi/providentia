Great little place, everything we had was delicious.   We split a salami plate, some bruschettas and some risotto.  Everything was good.  The salami plate was little bit too much salami for us, but maybe would have been good for 3 or 4 people.  The risotto had red grapes in it (which made be hesitate before ordering), but was really quite good.   I left not quite full, I think perhaps I haven't mastered figuring our the right number of small plates for dinner.
