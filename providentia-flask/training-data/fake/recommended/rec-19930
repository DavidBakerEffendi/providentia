The spinach melt is really good.  I have yet to try "The Red Onion" since becoming carnivorous again, but I really, really want to.   I think the key to their sandwiches is that they use high quality ingredients.  Their cookies are good too. This was the first place I ever ate at in Burlington.  Not a bad start at all.
