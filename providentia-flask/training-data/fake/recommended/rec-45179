Usually when I hear the words Â "vegetarian" or "vegan", I run screaming for the hills. Sorry, non meat-eaters, but that's just how I roll. I need my protein and murder. I do love my veggies and fruits, but meat is where it's at for me when it comes to lunch options. Anyway, I came to Stone Soup with my stepsister (who has weird dietary needs) anticipating feeling hungry after lunch. Oh, how I was wrong. It turns out that Stone Soup DOESN'T hate meat-eaters and featured some tasty sandwiches on their menu. For a place that caters mostly to vegetarians and vegans, Stone Soup holds their own, at least when it comes to making a Turkey Melt. The veggies were fresh, the cheese and turkey were yummy, and the bread was a soft and tasty complement to the fillings. They even give you chips on the side. Hooray! And though I ordered a bottled water, I think the filtered water (which is in a huge cooler-like apparatus typically used for Gatorade, complete with tap) is free. Don't quote me on that, though. It was a pleasant surprise to go to a restaurant that I would normally avoid like the plague. Maybe next time around I can be convinced to check out their salad bar. Or maybe not?
