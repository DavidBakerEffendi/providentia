Grill 21 serves good Filipino food - I had the pork adobo and lumpia, which I liked.  It's a tiny restaurant - they fit about 10 two-person tables there, which leaves not much room for anything else, and there are a few tables outside.  The smallness, however, allowed for good conversation - I met some nice people there to talk to while I ate.   It's nicely decorated inside, with bright colors on the walls.  The owners are a Caucasian-Filipina couple - I met the husband, and he's a nice guy.  A little slow on service (the owner had to pitch in to help bus tables), and somewhat more pricey than the usual Filipino restaurants, although the food here is made to order, rather than the "point-point" cafeteria style of many Filipino restaurants.
