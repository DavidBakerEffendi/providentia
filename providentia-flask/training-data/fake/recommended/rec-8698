Follow up review on MR CHU Fo' YOU my friends. Soooooooo, as promised...not only have I returned once to Mr Chu for their soup, I've probably been here 6 times after my initial visit! Yes, their soup is that spectacular. Huge bowl of deliciousness, loaded with the meat of your choice, try any of them and they won't disappoint you. I've done the shanghai bowl and their seafood bowl, wonderful, just wonderful. And for $6, bring it, i'll have two bowls next time I go.
