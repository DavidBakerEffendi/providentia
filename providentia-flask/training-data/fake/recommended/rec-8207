The Sizzler burger is amazing!  One of the best you will have,  They bring in fresh ground beef from their burtcher shop in the back.  The sprinkle special seasoning on the burger as they cook it.  Friendly service too.  I have the fries with crazy and it was also super dleiccious.   The process:  Go to the grocery register and put your order in and pay. Grocery guys hands you a ticket. Go over to the cooking area and hand the cook the ticket. Wait in the store or outside while your burger are being cooked.  It's cramped inside but no big deal.  I like how you get to see your burger cooking. Everyone is friendly.  Oh, and credit cards are accepted!
