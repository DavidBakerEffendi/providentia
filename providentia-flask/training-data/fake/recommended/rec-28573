Great cocktails, yes. Pretty average food. You feel cool just knowing how to get here...in a car service. Way too creepy to even think about walking, especially after you've sipped your own, and tried your friends drinks all night long. The waiters are great, I love it when someone can manage to snark on each person at the table without even knowing us. Bonus points for that.
