When I moved to NJ from CA in the mid-90s, I moaned to all my friends about the lack of good Mexican food here.  All I saw was one crappy chain after another on Rt 1.  But then I discovered Tortuga's Mexican Village in Princeton.  Away from the crowds of Nassau St, this cozy little cucina is a welcome treat.  Nothing flashy or pretentious about it -- just great food, great prices, ample portions, and nice mellow atmosphere.  I haven't had a bad meal in a decade, so I can't recommend it highly enough.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. Tortuga's is locally owned.  There was previously a sister restaurant in Trenton, which moved to Lambertville a few years ago.  I'm pretty sure I've seen some of the same staff there for ten years now in Princeton. It is BYO, which I personally find a good thing.  And cash-only, which can be an issue since I can't think of a nearby ATM.
