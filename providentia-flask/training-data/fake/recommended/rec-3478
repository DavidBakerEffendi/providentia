OKAY. I don't even know where to begin with this place because it is that good. The food = excellent. The decor = awesome. The prices = unbelievable. We came and took advantage of the $6.95 lunch specials. My boyfriend got the Milanesa-something-or-other sandwich and it was HUGE. And DELICIOUS. I'm talking bigger than his head huge. I got the duo special with a queso-jalape√±o tamale (my first time ever having a tamale), and the chicken mole tostada. I'm not a tamale fan but it was good - I'm glad this was the first tamale I ever had. The tostada was out of this world! The portion was really great as well because it filled me up and I had no leftovers. We also split the salsa trio - delicious! I wish it came with more chips because we wanted to keep eating it after we were done...and it was only $3! And the fact that our bill came to $18.40 for two entrees and an appetizer is awesome. The decor was amazing - colorful and gothic at the same time. I really liked it. The only downfall to this place is that it's a small...as I was going into the booth to sit I was practically sitting on the random stranger at the table next to me. The waiter seemed like he wanted everything to be fast - our food came out in literally, like, 5 minutes after we ordered it, but that doesn't mean that we want to leave right after we finish eating. But besides that, really cool place. I will ABSOLUTELY come back again for drinks and dinner!
