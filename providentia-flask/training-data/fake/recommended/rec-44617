Never mind the fly I had in my salad once, Â but there seems to be a real problem lately with getting anything other than lettuce! I don't mind paying $10, $12, $15 at saladworks, but this one in Hamilton doesn't seem to get that I can buy a bag of lettuce at the acme in the same parking lot for $3. Apparently the manager seems to think 3 pieces of chopped tomato and broccoli is more than enough, and mentioned that he will be helping me from now on...really? You can't just make a salad that is proportioned and worth the $10 without SPECIAL help??
