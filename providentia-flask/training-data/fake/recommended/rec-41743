Mayfield is everything you want a restaurant to be. Excellent food, the quality of the produce is fantastic. The kale salad is to die for. I would suggest requesting a fried egg on top, makes for an excellent, protein rich meal. The fries are hands down the best. I have no clue how they do it but fries are a must, ask for some extra Sriracha mayo! If you are in the mood for something else, I highly recommend the trout although having said that the burger is also great. The bartenders are funny, friendly, and most importantly excellent when it comes to making drinks. My very small annoyances with Mayfield are twofold. Firstly, one of the male servers can be quite obnoxious. Whenever I go, I try and avoid his section as best I can. Secondly, I would like to see a stronger beer selection which includes lighter, crisper beers for hot summer days. None of these negatives would ever deter me from going to Mayfield but changing these two aspects would certainly warrant 5 stars from me.
