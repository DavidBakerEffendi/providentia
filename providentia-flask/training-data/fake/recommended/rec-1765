this place is REALLLLLLLLLLLY small. i came here for sushi a while ago based off a recommendation from a friend who claimed they make lobster REALLLY GOOD. not quite the case. i'm also not a fan of places that go wild on creating these fancy pants rolls. if you are enjoying sushi, you should have it at it's natural state, with soy sauce and some wasabi.. not with all these funky sauce additions, flakes, and whatever else concoctions. i'm not against having it every so often but Â truth be told these types of rolls were made to attract non japanese sushi eaters who aren't familiar or arent keen on eating sashimi at it's raw state, and to mask the discomfort. my experience here wasn't bad but it wasn't good. i have my special sushi joint that is wayyyy cheaper, and wayyy simpler. my kind of style.
