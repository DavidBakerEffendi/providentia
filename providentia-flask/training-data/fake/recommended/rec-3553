I know, I KNOW, it's a CUTE PLACE! I agree that it's probably one of the most well-decorated restaurants in Prospect Heights, or as some call it, the upcoming Park Slope. It's restaurants like Chavela's that contributed to the gentrification of Prospect Heights. I also REALLY liked the service. The staff was always helpful and did it all naturally with a happy demeanor. It's always packed with a wait. I can't really vouch for their Latin food though... it's a filler. One of those places you go to fill your stomach if you're craving Mexican. If you're REALLY hungry, I suggest getting one of the Plato Don (Vegetarian, Carne (meat), or Pescado (fish)). They REALLY fill you up AND you get quite a good variety. Just check out the pictures. I got the carne, and I wasn't too impressed. I feel like you'd be better off if you went vegetarian. The chicken was alright, but the steak was sorely overdone, dry, and chewy with no flavor or juice. The guacamole was bland. In fact, they don't really get good reviews on their food overall....maybe except for the tacos. Don't feel like I'm coming back unless there are alcoholic drinks involved.
