Overall experience was a 7/10... Went on a saturday night & ate in the main dining room: were 1 of 2 until 9:30 and then we 1 of 3 tables.  So it was kind of a dull experience overall. The food was pretty good, but selection was limited & dishes were pretty conventional.  As were the serving ware -- HATED being served something in an ikea bowl -- a bowl i know that costs $1.00.  Really unprofessional. That being said, the quality of the food itself was excellent. So that's why it didn't get a higher rating from us -- great quality, but remarkably boring.
