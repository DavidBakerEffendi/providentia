Had lunch there today with an old parisienne friend of mine who's unbelievably allergic to garlic and onions. Tall order for a Turkish place but still, we had a great lunch and the waiter took extra special care to make sure she didn't kill over. He was also cute and I think he had a slight crush on here but I digress. Anyways, I happily enjoyed the grape leaves solo. Recommended!
