Worst service ive ever seen. Counter girl started yelling at me when I asked why i was missing some of my food in the bag. Got no refund...rather than saying sorry, she told me shes been working there too long to deal with me.. im not sure what that means. When I asked for her name she told she doesnt have to disclose that information!
