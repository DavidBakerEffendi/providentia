Beehive Oven is AMAZING. Went in for dinner last night and to schedule catering for breakfast for the morning after my wedding. Treva and everyone were so incredibly helpful in letting me taste different things to figure out what I wanted, quantity etc. Everyone was just so warm and extremely helpful! Super excited to work with these folks! Also dinner was KILLER we had the fried green tomatoes, a beesting (kolsch with st. germaine, tea, and orange), a moselle biscuit (collard green, egg and fried chicken), and the chicken fried steak special with corn. It was an insane amount of food but so delicious! Will definitely be making this a regular stop!
