A really great joint. I'm going 4 instead of 5 stars cause ordering and waiting can be a pain, especially on nice days, but I don't blame them for that. Just a warning. Great crusty bread and attention to detail. Watch the line (no cutting!) and listen for your name, cause if you miss out, your sandwich could sit there a while. Oh, and "outdoor seating" constitutes two small tables, FYI.
