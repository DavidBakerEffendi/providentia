Hahaha one of my favorite foods in the world is french fries (sad) and this place does them really well! They have a large variety of dipping sauces to choose from and the ones I had were very tasty!!! I would definitely love to try more of them over time. I also got a cheeseburger that was only so-so, which is what prevented this place from getting the 5 stars. Overall, a great dive bar with friendly people :)
