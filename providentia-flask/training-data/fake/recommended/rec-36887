Went to Balthazar tonight. Had 6:00 reservation. Seated promptly. Had Pumpkin salad and then Salad Nicoise for dinner. Pumpkin was raw, not seasoned, and bland. I didn't get it. The salad was nothing--totally eh. The Salad Nicoise was good, but didn't fill me up in the least. Tuna was eh. I've been here before and it's been okay, but it's not worth it. The meal was very expensive and the food just wasn't up to par. Service was okay. Go somewhere less well known for better and more substantial food.
