I typically search out places like Hummas - and in fact, I love places like this. Most of these small or family run kabob places are decent and I've rarely eaten a bad kabob anywhere. But this is one of the few that I'll take the time to review and give 4 stars. I had the chicken breast platter with pita, hummus, rice & tomato, cucumber - and while i might not go to the moon for it, I'll definitely go back again when I'm in University City. I thought it was quite good and a very decent value - and will be one of those places I frequent because it was right the first time. The food was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the serving size was just right. The place was clean and easy to get into safely. Yes, it is a small place but comfortable.
