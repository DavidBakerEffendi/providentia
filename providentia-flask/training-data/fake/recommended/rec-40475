I knew the minute I walked inside... This place is awesome! Excellent small grocery. I have definitely fared better here than at any of the chain grocery stores. Fresh Coffee all day. I take the train to go to Manhattan every morning. This place has a lot of breakfast options, prices better than NYC. try homemade oat meal! When I come back Â home, I get my dinner. They have fresh made sandwiches, salad options, pasta and hot dishes. I just noticed that they deliver :)))
