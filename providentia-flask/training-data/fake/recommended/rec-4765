REALLY GOOD the place is tiny though... There's literally only one row for the waiters, people going to the front tables, people going to the bathroom, etc. The environment is relaxed, the food is good and shareable. We got 5 different empanadas, the guac and plaintain chips (which I thought I wouldn't like but I ended up loving becuase the plantain chips did not taste anything like plantains! more like tortillas chips), a hazelnut latte, and it ended up being a pretty light, but filling meal. Like I said before, the place does get really crowded and you're literally sitting next to someone else listening to their conversation because they try to "maximize" their space, but all-in-all a very good experience.
