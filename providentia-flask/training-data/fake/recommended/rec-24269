We went to Village Whiskey today after having waited outside until 12:15 for Frog Burger to not open *groan*.  I had been there once before for Dining Out For Life, and had enjoyed myself.  We ordered everything on the menu that time, and it was more a novelty dining experience than a real one (i.e. we were too drunk to notice anything).   Today we told them we only had about half an hour, and they had our food out within 10 minutes.   Only downside is the price.  $5 for what are fairly run-of-the-mill fries is highway robbery.  However their burgers are quite tasty, and the service was friendly and accommodating.  If you're looking for a reliably good burger in Rittenhouse-- this would be the place to find it.
