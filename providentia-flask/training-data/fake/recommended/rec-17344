One start just for scenery. Waited 15 mnts to be sited, when the place was practically empty. Then waited 10 more mnts for the waitress to hand us the menus & to clean the table. We ended asking her to clean it!!! Then the appetizers & main course arrived at the same time. The buffalo wings were nasty and to top it off, we asked to bring them with bone and got them boneless. Our steak was supposed to be medium well!!!  it was well cook, greasy, the baked potato was hard & the veggies wasn't cooked. No FLAVOR. We couldn't eat it so. We Left a $50 bill & walked out. First & last!!!  wORSt experience ever.
