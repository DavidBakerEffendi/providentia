This past weekend on my first trip to Philly, bf and i decided our trip would not be complete w/o trying out a Philly cheesesteak.  nevermind that i try to eat a vegetarian diet, our local friends set out to help us accomplish the goal.  our friend remarked that this wasn't his favorite cheesesteak place either (he prefers tony luke's), but that this place was good as well.   we arrived about noon on a weekend and the line was wrapping around the shop, so we figured, hey - it must be good!  the line was long, but it moved very quickly.  within 10 minutes we were up to the counter.  we're the kind of people who usually don't carry any cash, and just use debit/credit cards.  this place is the kind of place that doesn't accept said debit/credit, only cash.  usually there is some sort of sign to point this out, but here i saw none.  luckily, it wasn't a problem this time. bf ordered the whiz wit, and i got the prov wit at the first window, and sodas and cheese fries at the second window.  this place is kinda pricey when you consider that it's fast food.  $25 later we dug into our food while standing across the street (it's outdoor seating on a few picnic tables only).  the prov wit gets my "A-OK" vote, but i can understand why others wouldn't like it.  the meat was sorta dry, there wasn't much cheese and there was a lot of bread to the cheesesteak -- however, when i eat meat, i prefer it this way.  the cheese fries were flavorless and extremely salty.  i'm glad i tried out a philly institution, but prolly won't be back.
