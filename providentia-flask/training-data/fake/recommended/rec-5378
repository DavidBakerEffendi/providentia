I must say I have nothing but rave reviews for this bar/restaurant. The ambience is so well laid out and they have the best Nerds shaped chairs that are super comfy! The service is wonderful super accommodating and very personal. Now to the food and drinks - my husband wants to take the cheesesteak egg rolls home for a a forever supply and I loved the mushroom flatbread! The drinks were perfectly made and were so delicious. We need a duplicate in Maryland!
