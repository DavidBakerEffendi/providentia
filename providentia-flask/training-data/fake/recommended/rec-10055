Decent Italian cuisine experience. Came here for anniversary dinner. Date had the fresh fish of the day (Tilapia) & I had some pasta for their lunch special that day. Calamari Fritti as appetizer. Both dishes were pretty good. The fish was well done and soft to the bite. Pasta could've been a little better, or maybe wasn't to my liking. Calamari was probably pre-made, but the tomato sauce that came with it tasted homemade, which was nice. Complimentary bread, but some of ours were too hard. The tomato sauced breads were still warm and soft to the bite, so that's a plus. The food rating overall: Good Waiter service & Host were pleasant! Maybe because we came on time, with the place being maybe 70% full, so they have time for most of us. At least my water kept being taken care of. Decor was pretty romantic-ish, sweet, and cozy! I don't know if it was because the holiday decorations were still around, but still. I like. MINUS TWO STARS: -We came at lunch time. Holy shit. I'm glad we did. Dinner prices... -Portions...Ehhh...I mean, it's filling, but you could probably eat more. Bread + water fills up the stomach, so maybe that's why the portions get smaller? However, I'd like to get more for my money. I'd come here for first time dates if someone's feeling for Italian. At least it'll be cozy. l I'm not a big fan of going to chain restaurants like Olive Garden.
