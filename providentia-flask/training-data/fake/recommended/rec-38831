Pizza at Luzzo's is great.  But when I called to put in my order today, they quoted me a new - different (higher) price than at their website.  Normally I do not quibble about two dollars, but this time I happened  to have the exact change for my pizza, tax + delivery tip (the place is cash only and so is delivery).   When I pointed out that the price on their own website is different, they said that the online menu is for a different location!  Well, it its not, it has a little map next to the menu and the phone # of the 1st ave place.   Not a nice way to treat someone that orders from your shop once a week, Luzzo's. Having something else tonight.
