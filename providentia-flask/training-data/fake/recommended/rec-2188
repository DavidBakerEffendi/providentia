After hearing a lot about Pat's and Geno's, I finally tried both of them last night and I definitely prefer the Pat's experience over Geno's. This is mostly because Pat's more laid back atmosphere and lack of aggressive pseudo-xenophobic undertones made me feel better about eating there. That being said, I have had much better cheesesteaks at Redding Terminal Market at lesser known shops. The meat at Geno's was pretty dry and flavorless.
