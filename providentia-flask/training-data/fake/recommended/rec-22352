Oh my oh my.  I had one of my memorable meals here.  I wasn't expecting perfect bistro food.  I got the large order of mussels with broth and bread+flavored butter and goat cheese. Split with a friend.  I could not stop eating -- the food was so good. The broth!!! Good tableside gerkins too. I was traveling from out of town on a Wednesday, so I can't say much about the wait.
