We have been here twice and tried most of the items on the menu. The culinary adventure began with the friendly and cozy ambiance. Our dishes came out at the same time so we could share our plates. Beef Rendang was cooked to the perfect velvety texture, meat was coated with perfect amount of sauce, subtle yet complex flavors continued to develop with each bite. Definitely recommend this dish. Our other favorites were the fish curry, egg plant (from the small plates), chicken wings, papaya salad (has a hint of coconut flavor to it), chicken wings (not what you would expect so make sure you try these). The nasi goreng (fried rice) was very tasty and came with satifying portion. Each bite consisted intense but not overpowering shrimp flavor. This dish came with crunchy shrimp crackers and fresh cucumber to balance all the flavors. We wish we had room for dessert, next time. We liked the food here a lot. Perfect little place to catch up in the middle of the week with friends (what we did), or just sit at the bar area with the book you always wanted to read but never got to (what I will do next time). p.s. Great coffee!
