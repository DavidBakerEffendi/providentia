Very pleasant addition to the neighborhood. The staff are friendly and enthusiastic and the food is of great quality. They have wine specials that are well worth a look and are a good deal. We've eaten dinner here several times and have always enjoyed it. Be sure to try the calamari and zucchini fritters, they are a great way to start your meal.
