It's my favorite Japanese dessert place~ Came here for tea with friends before and it's a cute little get together place, if the wait is not too crazy. But I always come here to order their great desserts. Black Sesame Creme Brulee - i don't like creme brulee, but you have to try this... Sakura flan - it tastes just like when cherry blossom just about to bloom, but not blooming yet. The subtle sweetness is perfect for my dessert requirement. Just a little pink in the white palette. The texture is so smooth, reminds me of home made tofu in EN Japanese Brasserie. Zenzai - if you like green tea flavor, you will enjoy this. I am a huge green tea fan so I love zenzai! Mochi is always good too. But the star is really the sake ice cream! Red Bean Butter Toast - it's pretty good but it really looks better than the taste. They will always have special desserts of the day. I remember getting a raspberry parfait and green tea parfait. Both are very very good. So get the parfait when they have it. Taking a star away because their food menu is really not that great and over priced...
