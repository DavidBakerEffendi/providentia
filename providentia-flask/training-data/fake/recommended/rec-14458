Delicious food.  I got the pork chop and it was great.  I loved the seasonal options and that they served maple butter with their bread.  You can really tell that the owners/chefs really care about the food that is made here.  I loved that the runners described what was on every plate before serving it.  Our waitress was very attentive and seemed experienced.  I highly recommend ordering a cocktail from here, they are unique and better than any other place I've had in NYC.  It is impossible to get into this place, which is proof of its popularity and quality.  We booked a reservation a month in advance for a Saturday night and the only openings they had were at 5pm and 9:30pm.  I'll probably be back for lunch since I'm not into booking reservations that far in advance.  I took a star away because I think some of the items on the dinner menu are over priced.  My boyfriend ordered the strip steak which was more than $50 but was disappointed with it.  Overall I will definitely be back, but most likely for lunch/brunch or drinks
