In the midst of tourist town, Becco stands out for its value and friendly service. I've been here about five times over the years, and each time, couldn't convince myself to order anything but the prix fixe (appetizer + unlimited servings of Becco's three daily pastas for $21.95).  I've never had a bad experience, and if I'm not going to a show, I admittedly get one more round even when I'm totally stuffed, take two bites, and then ask for it to be wrapped up (poor form, perhaps, but it's so worth it to have leftovers for lunch the next day)! I would suggest making a reservation to avoid any wait.  We've occasionally been pushed into tight corners due to crowds, but overall, the dining experience has been consistently pleasant and very satisfying.  This is my go-to spot in the threatre district.
