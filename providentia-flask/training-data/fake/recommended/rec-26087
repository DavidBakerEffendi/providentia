Superb. I'd been hearing good things about Anella for a while now, and I can finally confirm they are true. My girlfriend got the pork chops and date dish which was unbelievably delicious. She's a foodie and claims it to be "one of the best meals I've ever had." I had the roasted chicken dish which was also excellent, although not quite as good as hers. The wine was also fantastic. I'm not sure why Anella's is marked as an Italian restaurant, because it's not. It's comparable to the (also excellent) Five Leaves. The service was perfect and the ambiance was relaxing. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is I think it's not acceptable for a restaurant of this price range to only take cash.
