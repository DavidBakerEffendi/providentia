The newest sandwich shop in West Windsor, NJ!  Welcome to the hood - we're glad to have you.  I went to Jimmy Johns for the first time last week as a quick dinner for the kids between evening activities.  I needed something quick but not unhealthy.  I used the online ordering feature which I absolutely loved.  It makes it so easy to customize any sandwich to each kids taste, which any mother knows can be a chore.  There's nothing worse than holding up the line at Subway with a child who puzzles over each ingredient. When I arrived at the store a few minutes after ordering they were working on my order and it was done momentarily.  Very quick and friendly service.  And every special request that I placed online was there when I unwrapped the sandwiches, right down to whether the sandwich was cut in half or not.  That's a special request which I actually wish was standard because I forgot to add that on half of the sandwiches in our order. The rolls are good and it looks like they scrape out some of the extra dough to make room for the meat and veggies which I really liked.  I don't like having to fight with the sandwich to take a bite.  Everyone enjoyed their sandwich - fresh ingredients, plentifully applied on a good roll.  That's all I need in a sandwich.  My only complaint is that they apparently don't use pickles on their sandwiches and opt for the cucumber instead.  I tried this, thinking maybe they know something I don't, but no, they in fact do not.  The pickle would have been much better than the cucumber.  You can buy a whole pickle, but you can't put that on a sandwich! They also have a very limited delivery area. There is a map in the store and my neighborhood is out of the delivery zone. They say that they like to be super-speedy with their delivery, thus the limited area.  Ok.  I'll drive there and pick it up.  I'll definitely be returning.
