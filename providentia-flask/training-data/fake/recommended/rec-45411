I was VERY excited to try this new star-powered restaurant and it did nothing but exceed my expectations! I thought the food was creative and wonderful (the menu changes daily). The staff was INCREDIBLY welcoming and very knowledgable. I've had dreams about the desserts and must go back for the cookie tray soon. Overall, I am very happy that Rucola is right down the street. It is a mixture of all the things I love about a restaurant: Great wine, Great people, New and interesting Food, Comfortable and welcoming space.... Way to go guys!
