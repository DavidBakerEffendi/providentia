totally prooves that the UES is lacking some cool beer bars - if you didn´t know its location, you´d probably guess you´re in Brooklyn or the LES. The beer selection is great, I do, however wish they´d offer more lighter (both color and alcohol-wise) beers and beer flights. Some waiters are still training I guess, but overall, a great place definitely worth checking out and coming back to
