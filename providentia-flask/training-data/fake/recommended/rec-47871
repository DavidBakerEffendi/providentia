Mashed Potato Pizza? Did that! It was definitely worth it, although I was on tenterhooks over whether they'd include gravy -- hmmm I still don't know how that'd go. We had the regular red sauce pie with the mashed on one half and shrimp and fresh basil on the other - HEAVEN! Good thin crust, very college-bar feel, cracked couch, sticky table, live music on Mondays. Rinse, repeat as necessary.
