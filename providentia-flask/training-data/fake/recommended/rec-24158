I am not one for writing reviews, but i must say I love to read them and use them to help me make a decision.  With that said, I absolutely love this food truck..I work near by and stumbled on this street and went to the falafel truck first because this line was too long and I only have a 1/2 lunch break and  I couldn't really read the chalk board.. A few days later I returned and decided to give this truck a try, I have not been to any other truck since.  Everything I have had is absolutely wonderful.  So much so that I will be hositng a Thai Cuisine at my home in the future..Clearly not as good but I need my friends and family to love this food like I do.  If you are ever in the area please give them a try you can't go wrong and the people will definately guide you...Enjoy
