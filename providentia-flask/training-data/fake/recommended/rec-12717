If you are visiting NY or even if you live in NY, you have to make this a stop whenever you are in town.  As simple as it sounds, their chicken rice is so good! My friends and i shared a plate and the plate itself is pretty big.  I came here around 3am and there was still a line.  Then again this is NYC after all.   We got the chicken over rice and added extra extra white sauce and a tiny bit of the red sauce.  I heard the red sauce is super spicy so we only got a little since we didn't want heart burn in the middle of the night.  I was excited to take my first bite and it was amazing.  It was actually beyond amazing and it's best to eat it when it's still hot.   They give you a few pieces of naan to go with it, but i saw it's best with it.  I can eat this every day! I regret sharing it with my friends now.
