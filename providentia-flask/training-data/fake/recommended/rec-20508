In my opinion, the reviews that most accurately reflect what you are likely to experience at this restaurant, and especially so with regard to the manner in which food is prepared and served, are also that spell out their experiences in negative terms. We had dinner there this past Friday, and both of the dishes--the Stuffed Filet of Sole and the Pasta Pescatore--were of the quality that the sooner you can forget about them, the better you'll feel. As we "share" each other's entrees,, I had the opportunity to taste both dishes, and while the Sole dish was "bad," the Pescatore dish was "really bad!" I cannot, in fact think of ever having a restaurant meal that had less to recommend itself than this one. For starters, the sauce on the pasta dish was terrible. It had been watered down to the point where it had little by way of taste or a pleasing aroma. I don't know how long it had been sitting around, just simmering away, but when even the garlic cloves have absolutely no flavor left in them, the time to throw out the old, and start anew, has long come and gone. Both the small piece of lobsrtail and the few shrimp in the dish were tough; the clams and mushrooms so overcooked that they little left by way of either texture or taste, etc. Â As for the "Stuffed Filet," although it was advertised has ing stuffed with lobster, all one could see or taste were bread crumbs. And it, too, had the look and taste of having been something (as one other commentator mentioned) of being something that had previously been frozen (if not actually purchased in the condition), and then placed in a microwave. The previously made comments about the salad were kind: "wilted" should have also been used. Plus, it had little by way of a tasty dressing. The place is not inexpensive: the cost of the two entrees was just a bit under $40.00. However, when the bruschetta turns out to be the highlight of the evening, you just gotta know that you came to the wrong place!
