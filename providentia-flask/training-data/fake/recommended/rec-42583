This place is nice and clean after the new renovations.  The beef with broccoli and fried chicken wings are the best I've had in the area.  Haven't tried out the lunch buffet yet, but it looks like a good deal at $3.99.  The only gripe I have about this place is the long walk from the front door to the counter.
