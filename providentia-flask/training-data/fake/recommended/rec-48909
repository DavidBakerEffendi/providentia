Best Indian food I have ever had! I'm a facts guy so here are the best things about this place. 1. Â Super friendly staff. The owner came to greet me when I got take out. She gave me a little discount because it was my first time there. She said "it's your first time here but it won't be the last". She was right! 2. Delicious food. Really authentic and flavorful. I got the naan, paneer makhani, and the chana masala. They all came in little plastic tubs which was perfect for leftovers. I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to spice but it was the perfect amount of heat. Ask for more heat though if you want a real kick! 3. Prices were super reasonable. I was really surprised by how low it was just for 2 people. And they didn't skimp out on quality or quantity either. Plenty of rice was included as well. We need more restaurants like this!! A real treasure and I'm happy it's so close to home.
