If you don't sit in the main dining room where they sit large parties the seating at this restaurant is terrible. My girlfriend and I were sat up in the upper dining room which seemed like a separate run down restaurant with cheap furniture, low ceilings, and seating where you were probably touching elbows with the table next to you. We asked to be moved downstairs only to be moved to ANOTHER room off to the side of the main dining room only to suffer from the same plight. They just didn't get the hint. Food was pretty good, the duck, brusslesprouts, and lamb chops as recommended were all amazing. Waiter was attentive too. As a pretty easy-going yelper that should give you an idea how bad the seating and atmosphere is at this establishment.
