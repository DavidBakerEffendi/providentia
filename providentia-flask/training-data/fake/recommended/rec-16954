. On Wednesdays all classic burgers are only $5.00, and craft beers are half-price. The portions were generous and, of course, the price was right. This local eatery has specials every night and the wait staff are so efficient and personable. I have eaten at the Verona Inn on other nights and the food has never been a disappointment. The mahi bites appetizer are scrumptious and the nachos and cheese quesadillas are equally as delicious. This place can become a regular stop for me.
