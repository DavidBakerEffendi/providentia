I'm giving it two stars only because the pork buns are actually very very good! A couple hours after I left this place tonight my stomach is killing me and Im gagging and vomiting with a sour stomach all night. I will never come back here again! I had the classic Ramen which I think it's  very over priced for $15. I asked for extra paste and that's another $2,  I also had coke and asked for a refill and each refill is another $3 and the waiter never informed me.  Another thing I hated.. they freakin come In between you and took your plates right away literally! They are constantly moving around you and looking at you, they need to relax and let me enjoy meal.   I didn't finish my ramen and asked if I could have it to go... Only because it was expensive and they told me no! Why can't I It take home, it's there policy? Would it turn into a jelly like substance if left in the refrigerated? F this place and their stupid greetings along with nickeling and dimming their costumers!!!!!!  Iv had better ramen at a reasonable price and I will never come here again!
