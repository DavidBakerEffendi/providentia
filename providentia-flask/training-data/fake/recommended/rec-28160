Food was delicious and service was excellent!   It's a small, cozy place.  They typically only have seating for up to 4 people, but they were able to squeeze our group of 5 in one table without a hassle and we still felt comfortable.  The tapas came out quickly. We ordered the following tapas: Paquetitos de jamón, artichoke and manchego wrapped in serrano ham - this was my favorite - so delicious! Pinchos morunos, lamb skewers with moorish spices - lamb was done nicely! Gambas al ajillo, shrimp in olive oil with garlic and chili - this one was just okay, thought the shrimps were a bit overcooked Pan con tomate y tres salsas, toasted baguette topped with tomato puree with trio of spreads - pretty good, I like the green spread, but can't remember what kind it was... Patatas bravas, rough cut potatoes with spicy aioli - very tasty Bocata de lomo adobado, marinated pork loin, piquillo pepper and tetilla cheese sandwich - yum! Mushroom and egg special (forgot the name of this dish) - super good (although a bit on the salty side, maybe it was meant to be salty, but it went well with the egg!) I would definitely come here again!
