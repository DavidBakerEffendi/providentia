Over 3 hours for dinner with 6 other women on a Wednesday night in a fairly empty restaurant??? I think not.  We arrived promptly for our 7pm reservation and didn't finish until after 10pm.  That's crazy.   The service was painfully slow - we needed to ask for bread after sitting for 20 minutes and then our appetizers and main dishes (and dessert!) crept out of the kitchen at the rate of one per hour.   The food was okay, nothing great, considering the wonderful reviews that this restaurant consistently gets.  My appetizer of mozzarella with tomatoes was mediocre; the cheese was rubbery, not creamy and delicious as I had hoped.  The salmon entree was very good, however I had been looking forward to the halibut on the menu which was not available.  The gelato dessert was fine - nothing special. I was here once before and was looking forward to my return visit.  I will not go back again very soon.
