We stopped by for dessert and drinks. The food was really good! We got a chocolate cake and a pear apple pie. It had a more homemade touch rather then fancy shmancy. It isn't up at the professional level cooking, but still very good. I LOVE the atmosphere here. The woman who served us had a nice quirky personality rather then just strait up business. She treats her customers like long time friends. Very Refreshing.
