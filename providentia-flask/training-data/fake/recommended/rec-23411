I had a custom grilled cheese- sourdough, muenster, gruyere & arugula. It was perfectly grilled, not too much cheese, truly expert. The tomato soup was weak, undercooked, tasting only of dried basil. The music was a bit loud for a weekday afternoon and gave off more of a bar vibe than that of a cafe. Cute decor. I'll go back the next time I'm in the mood for a $9 grilled cheese
