I'm a bit baffled as to how this restaurant got four stars. Brooklynites should know better. This is an example of when hipsters try to re-create a classic dish for other hipsters without keeping it authentic. I've spent about 2 months total traveling all around Japan and I can honestly say there is nothing remotely authentic about the food here. It was a big let down. I'm still on the hunt for authentic ramen in Brooklyn, but until then I guess I have to go into Manhattan.
