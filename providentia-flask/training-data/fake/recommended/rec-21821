yeah, you can tell this place uses the freshest ingredients and it's prepared to bring out the most flavor.  The service can be spotty, but there was a super sweet server there last time I went who gave us both a complimentary salad, even though we hadn't ordered the prix fixe.  props to her!  love the creative assortment of dishes
