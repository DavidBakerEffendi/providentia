I ordered the pancakes and turkey bacon there one saturday morning and let me tell you, this place is amazing. You can tell everything was made from scratch. The butter that comes with the pancakes were obviously recently churned. The pancakes are the best I have had in recent memory. They were very fluffy and moist on the inside. Most of the time they come out dry or slightly dry but this place was on point! The bacon was the heartest couple slices of turkey bacon I have ever seen. It all tasted very fresh! The place is very cheap too!
