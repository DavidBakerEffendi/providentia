Had high expectations for a restaurant that was nominated for a James Beard award and received many good reviews but was so let down. For appetizers, grilled octopus meh tasted like anywhere else, lamb tongue meh tasted like pate, snails meh bland and gritty. Entrees weren't any better if not worse, rabbit was overcooked and salty. Grilled lamb loins also salty along with lamb ribs that were charred to the max accompanied with some measly pieces of fava beans. I figured maybe desert will be the redeeming factor so I choose the mocha semifreddo with fiordillatte and toffee. Sounds fancy right? It turned out to be a very small serving of chocolate ice cream placed on top of a giant wooden cutting board that took up half the table. Talk about highway robbery, $200 plus tip down the drain and still hungry and disappointed. If only the food was as creative as the wording on the menu. Don't believe the hype!
