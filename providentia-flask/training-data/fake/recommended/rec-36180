Absolutely offended! We ate a very expensive dinner at Balthazar Saturday night, April 13, and were abhorred when solicited for a tip from the cost check guy. Now let me preface by saying that I have been a waitress and a bartender and a GM before. I know how tipping works and that people depend on tips for heir livelihood. And normally, we would have tipped. We just didn't have any small bills and we were unsuccessful trying to get change from the bartender because he was so busy so we just made the conscious decision not to tip this time. But the fact that we were actually stopped and told what to tip was embarrassing and unprofessional. If anyone on my staff would have done this to a customer they would have been fired. Come on Bathazar...you should be classier than this.
