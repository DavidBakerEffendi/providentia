Lots of meat, rice, and salad for an inexpensive amount. Depending on the day, the season, and the time of day counts when you stand in line to get food from the halal cart. The chicken and rice is pretty tasty and you can gorge your food with limitless amounts of white sauce, brown sauce, but be careful of the hot sauce. A lot of hot sauce can make your food possibly inedible. That happened to me and my friend a few times because we dared each other. You have been warned.
