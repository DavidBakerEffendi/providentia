In summary, eclectic food with loud music like a bar in a seated setting overflowing with hipsters. After peering through the window and seeing a mountain of fried chicken on a single plate is when we decided this is where we'll have dinner. The place was bumping, but the wait was minimal. After seeing a fresh order of fried chicken come out, the wifey and I decided against it because this was way too much food for the two of us, so we ordered the following small plates: fried kale chips, smoked chicken wings, bread and butter, and the fluke crudo. All were delicious. We were bummed they were out of the pork buns though. After we finished our plates and to our surprise, we were given a complimentary plate of squid ink pasta. Awesome gesture, but I was quickly reminded of the strong and undesirable taste the first time I tried this elsewhere, but like a champ, I tried it again and it was superb. We killed off the plate. I do have two complaints. The first being six small chicken wings for $11 was over priced. The second was the music was really loud. My wife and I had a hard time conversating. If you're hungry and are with two or three people, then get one of the dinner specials. If you're not that hungry, then get four or five small plates. We had the butternut squash pie for dessert, which was pretty good. I can't remember the garnishes because I started this review about three weeks ago and forgot to finish, but trust me, the pie was good. I'd like to try their lunch menu the next time we're in time.
