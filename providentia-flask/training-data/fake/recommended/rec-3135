Didn't intend to go here, but the family was hungry and they wanted to go into the first decent place they saw. We walked by daMikele and both the restaurant and the menu looked decent so we tried it out. Absolutely no regrets! We were able to snag the table by the window, lots of space and charming little booth chairs. Great for a family style meal. We ordered the traditional brushette and two large pizzas, the margherita and the truffle / mushroom white pizza. The latter is to die for! Everything was so tasty and the service was phenomenal. I will definitely come back.
