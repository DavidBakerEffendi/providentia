I started coming here about a year ago and been coming back ever since... The food is delicious and the bar atmosphere is awesome ...I have to  say I am very happy that I've been coming back ever since... their food is amazing starting with appetizers, kebobs, lambs, and the delicious deserts including "baklava" my favorite..... the staff is great very nice people.....I really like the bar atmosphere when it gets packed with people and everyone is just having  great time .....to finish the night off you can't go wrong with smoking hookah in their new location hookah lounge on the second floor of the restaurant!!!!!
