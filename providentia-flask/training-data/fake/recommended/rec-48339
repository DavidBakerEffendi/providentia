This is my favorite bar in Park Slope. They have awesome food, it's a casual and cozy vibe inside, and the bartenders have always been attentive. The beer menu is always changing, so it's fun to try new things every time you go. It's cash only, though, so that is annoying, but the pulled pork sandwich and the macaroni and cheese are delicious. I'm so happy it's just right up the street from me!
