Brownies. Now that's what I'm talking about. Il Bambino is a little whole in the wall place along 31st Ave, surrounded by trees, apartment buildings, converted synagoges and a few lovely churches.  My pastor's wife introduced me to this little place.  She comes to this place for one reason and one reason alone. She loves the brownies. They're chocolately, large, nut filled, not too moist, not too dry, and an extravagant experience in the OMG MY THIGHS ARE FAT NOW way of living.  I can't recommend this place enough. They serve sandwiches, have a giant pig painted on the wall, and serve a large number of cupcakes from crumbs. If my church didn't already serve me free food, I'd be all over this place after service every Sunday like White Oprah on a TV camera.
