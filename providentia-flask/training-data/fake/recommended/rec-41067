One of my favorites. A bit pricy, but you're paying for the quality and thought put into the food. So it's a great spot for a relatively nice night out and a memorable meal. I've enjoyed everything I've tried. Excellent guacamole. Delicious drinks. Their tacos and quesadillas are some of my favorites. Flavorful stuff, all. Some gluten free options for those who need (unmarked, but just ask). Â I've brought people visiting town to this and the midtown location and it's always a hit. Like many spots, the lunch menu is a bit more affordable for those on a budget who want to give Toloache a try. I recommend the village location over the midtown one.
