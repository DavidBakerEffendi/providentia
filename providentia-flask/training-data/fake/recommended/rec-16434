Went with a group of friend and did the Bo Ssam.  A HUGE pork Shoulder for sharing with a group of friends is a must.  The sauces are good that come along with the juicy pork.  be prepared to eat. it's a lot of food and a lot of pork The drink selection is good as well. atmosphere is great. make sure you make a reservation, especially if you want the Bo Ssam which needs 24 hour notice.   should try to do this once in your lifetime!
