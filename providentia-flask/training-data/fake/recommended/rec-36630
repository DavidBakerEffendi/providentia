This might just be the freshest sushi I've ever had!  The decor of the restaurant was bright, clean and simple (which appropriately matched the type of cuisine).  My friend and I started out with the green tea powder dusted shrimp which was delicious.  I then selected one of the prix-fixe sushi & sashimi combinations which I thought came with a decent amount of food for about $20.  My friend went for the omikase.  We finished our meal with red bean and green tea mochi ice cream (how could we resist?) which was small, but yummy. I thought that the service here was quite lovely--which was surprising, given that when I called to make reservations the host informed me that (a) I couldn't be late or else they would give my table away and (b) we only had the table for an hour and a half (i.e. no loitering allowed after our meal).  While we did escape within our alloted time, I didn't get the impression that we were being rushed out of the restaurant at all.  Overall, I really enjoyed this dining experience (although I was a little surprised by the tab).  The sushi was definitely fresh--but it'll probably never be my all time favorite sushi place because the menu was so traditional and simplistic.
