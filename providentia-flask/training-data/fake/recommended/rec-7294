Like everyone's raving, their falafels are GREAT. Not too big (some might complain, but this limits the calories for each ball... better for people on diet), nicely flavored (although sometimes the Harissa falafels came out too salty...), crispy outside... Even their whole wheat pita is very soft, not stuffy or hard to chew. Try falafel sampling if you're unsure of which flavors to get (and getthem with one side salad for more nutritious meal), but generally, just get falafel sandwich. You won't regret it. Smoothies........... Not recommended :( might be good, but too pricey for that
