Sweet Jesus!  This place is out of control.  I would consider moving to NYC just to be closer to this cart.  I have no idea how food that is seemingly so simple can taste so good!  I went here two times on my three day trip and I regret not going more.  My mouth is watering as I write this review, so I am going to keep it short.  Go here often if you are lucky enough to live/work/be close.
