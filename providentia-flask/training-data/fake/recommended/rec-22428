This place has a cool concept but is still working out the kinks of a new restaurant. The beer menu offers nice variety and all beers were reasonably priced. We got the potato cauliflower soup and and rustica pizza. The soup was fantastic. The pizza was very average. We got three beers, a soup, and a pizza for 34.00. This makes it very reasonable for old city. We went on a Saturday night and the staff was a little over stretched. The food menu is a pretty limited but I think in time with some minor changes this place could be awesome.
