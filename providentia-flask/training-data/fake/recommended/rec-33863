Wonderful dining experience!  On New Years Eve, 26 friends gathered for an excellent 5 course meal.  The exceptional  appetizers included clams casino, stuffed mushrooms and calamari. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the marinara sauce and vodka sauce were delicious.  The guests complimented the chef on their entrees which included grilled salmon, chicken francese, and veal parmigiana.  The portions were enough for even those with a large appetite.   The tiramisu, cannolis,and cheesecake were also enjoyed by all. Many of the guests have eaten at the restaurant on regular occasions. Others commented that they would be back and would even like to schedule a family birthday party in January. The servers were friendly and  efficient. I would highly recommend this restaurant.
