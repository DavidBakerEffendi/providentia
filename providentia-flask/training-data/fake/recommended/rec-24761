Stopped in on a Friday night for a couple drinks.  There's a fairly large fenced-off seating area on the sidewalk with large tables as well as a bar and a number of tables inside. When I entered a number of people were munching on baskets of peanuts, which seems to be a highlight of this place.  Bar tender was very friendly, but draught list was a little disappointing.  I ended up with a harpoon ipa for $4. Nothing particularly special about this bar but everyone there (customers and staff alike) was friendly and beer prices were reasonable.  The outdoor seating was very nice to have. Would definitely stop in for drinks again.
