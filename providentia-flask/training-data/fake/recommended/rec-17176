Having been a patron of Shanghai Bun's sister locations, I had high hopes for this place. And for the most part, it did not disappoint. Soup buns were good, but unfortunately no crab-pork variation available. BYOB is a plus. Also a 10% "cash discount" in the form of signing up for a VIP card. Price is GREAT especially for the location. Why 4 and not 5? The restaurant does not allow you to customize any of your dishes. Yes, I know that customization is not a "right", but the other sister restaurants allow you to customize dishes (for example, requesting a specific type of noodle for your noodle soup). We were told politely by the waitress that we could not customize because they used to take customizations, but the chefs made too many mistakes, so now they just stick with whatever options are available in their computer system. Womp womp. Fair pricing and great food. Overall, thumbs up.
