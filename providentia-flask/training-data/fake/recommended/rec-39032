The place is charming and warm.  A great date restaurant.   I love a restaurant that serves an amuse bouche.  Always a nice touch. The bread was fine but nothing special.  It should have been warm.   The venison and fish were delicious but the portions were a bit small.  My companion started to panic that he was going to starve.  It was fine but a bit pricy for three medallions of Venison.   The chocolate panacotta smore was absolutely heavenly.  But, again, a bit on the small side.   The service was good but rushed.  We were in an out in an hour.  This restaurant is too pricey to be in and out in such a short time.
