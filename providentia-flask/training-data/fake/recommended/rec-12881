It's definitely authentic kind of New Orleans. COST: The sandwiches cost about 8.00 - 9.00 each. They do have a few beer kegs. Not sure of the cost per pint. SITTING: There is almost nowhere to sit. One table for 6 and a few places around the walls and counters. FOOD: I had the beef rib sandwich which was very good, on sliced bread. I'd have it again. So it has less carbs than the friend oyster sandwich with the big french bread. I tried the fried oyster sandwich. I wasn't super fond of the dressings on the fried oysters, but I did like the beef rib sandwich enough to want to go back sometime if I am in the area. The sandwiches given to you rolled up in waxed paper, no plates, utensils, etc. THE PLACE: It's a complete dive with windows that are barely holding onto the wall with removable hooks. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back, because there really isn't likely going to be a place to sit down. You are probably going to have to take it with you or outside. STARS: I give it 4 stars for the money with the understanding that it's a dive with good / fast food and probably not much place to sit or to chill out for a while.
