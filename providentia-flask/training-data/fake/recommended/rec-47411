As an Italian-Anerican from the New York area, I'm hard pressed to be truly amazed by Italian food. We had the chef's selection appetizer (excellent), veal chop (nicely cooked), pizza with mushrooms (excellent but too salty), and lasagna (too salty and watery). As there were five of us, we all shared. We all agreed it was very good and would have been excellent except it was all a little too salty overall. The desserts were the zeppoli (bite-sized pieces with chocolate sauce on the side; perfectly fried and sugared), apple crumble/pie, and sorbetto. All fine. Service was fine. It was VERY busy when we were there and we saw the waitress often enough to get what we needed and leave a good tip.
