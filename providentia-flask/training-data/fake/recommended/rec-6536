This place was recommended by a French friend and there were at least three other French ex-pats eating there when I went, so that says a lot. Plus, the food is really good and unlike a lot of other French restaurants, the owner/cook doesn't mind nixing the meat if you're a vegetarian comme moi. Also, it's BYOB sans corkage fee!
