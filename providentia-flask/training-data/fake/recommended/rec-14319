Very popular brunch place. Always a line and for a reason. Been twice and both times we very good. Omelettes are good but my favorite was Norwegian Salmon Benedict. One of my favorite dishes and while this isn't the best one I've ever had it definitely holds it own. Great up beat atmosphere and cool decor. When I visit the city I always consider this place for brunch.
