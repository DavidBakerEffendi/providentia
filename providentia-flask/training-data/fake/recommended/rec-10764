Staff is usually always friendly. But today wasn't the most pleasurable experience. Ordered mussels, house oysters, shrimp fried basket and snow crab legs. $92.54...I guess I didn't order enough or leave a big enough tip. I was told to go to hell by the waiter whos name is Dylan by the way. Yea... That'll be the last time they see me and my money !!!
