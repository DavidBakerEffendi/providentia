The owner, Donna, is welcoming and friendly and the space is attractive. I had a great crimini mushroom omelette (which the chef customized using egg whites) with tasty crab cakes and a Mimosa made with freshly squeezed OJ. The combo (omelette, 2 sides, coffee/tea and mimosa) is a decent value.  My server was very attentive: They were out of skim milk for the latte I requested, so I just asked for a regular cup of coffee (which was good).  She offered to bring me several other milks, including almond milk.  When I settled on whole milk she brought it heated. A nice touch.
