I've been going to B2 for a long time. Years. It used to be a place I liked. I don't what happened from then to now, but the staff there (with some exceptions) is just terrible. They're so rude it's startling, treating you as if you've wronged them by coming in. What's crazy is that I start believing that I must have (because why else would they act that way?) and find myself becoming apologetic for my trespasses against them and tipping heavily to make up for my sins. But I'm just a friendly neighborhood person who comes in, asks how their day's going, order my coffee, say thanks, and leave. Â I don't get it! I work on the avenue and my customers complain to me about B2 (not knowing the resentment I too harbor) and my boyfriend recently was so sorely mistreated by a short haired female barista that he ranted and raved about it for a week. He now calls the barista who worked that day his nemesis (which is hilarious btw). He and I have started calling the place S2, short for "SUCK 2", because B2 seriously sucks (and we are immature with our jokes). Immature as we are in private, in public, in B2, we are very nice, we tip well, and we say please and thank you, so man, I don't know. Because I always told to say something nice, I will say their vegan soft serve is awesome and cheap. Just know if you go there it's not you, it's them.
