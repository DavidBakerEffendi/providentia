The service here kills this place.  My roommate and I stopped in for a couple of cocktails last night.  They put us outside, got our drinks and promptly forgot about us for about an hour.  No refills, no food offered.  We actually had to walk into the restaurant to ask for the check, and then bring the check back in with my debit card.  SO BAD!  It's a shame because the drink was very, very good and the space is pretty.
