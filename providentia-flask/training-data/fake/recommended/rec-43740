This is one of those amazing little shops in my area that I have to thank Yelp for. I would have never wandered in on my own, but with some guidance I found it, loved it, and have gone back many a time. Food: My first time in was when I had a craving for a simple sandwich for lunch at work one day. I was quick to zip to Yelp, and found Lamazou. I smiled, thought it would be a great idea, and when I got there I waited in a line outside the door. Now, I'm of British heritage, it is in my blood to queue, but it cracked my up that New Yorkers were having any of it. Just goes to show how great Lamazou is. One glance at the lunch menu and I knew what my mouth and tummy wanted: Their Flaminco. Serrano ham and manchego cheese on a baguette? Sign me up! Since that fateful lunch day, I have continually returned to Lamazou for the occasional simple and inexpensive sandwich. But my relationship has evolved. When I do wine parties with the girls: I go to Lamazou. When I do tapas dinners for friends: I go to Lamazou. When I feel the craving for any sort of Kinder chocolate (although they lack Kinder Eggs): I go to Lamazou. It's an amazing little shop, and if you're in the area, you must shop by. Venue: It's a tiny shop, it can probably only hold about four customers at one time, but every single space on the wall is covered with European imports and delicious foods. The men behind the counter make a mean sandwich, and the woman at the cash register is quick to recommend something to do with anything you might want. While I've never asked, I'm sure you can get things special ordered. I plan on asking for some andouille for a gumbo I'm working on, and I'm hoping they can get it for me!
