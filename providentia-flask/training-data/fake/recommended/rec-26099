I like it super spicy, so I got the extra hot. It was spicy as hell. At one point I was unsure if the chicken was hot to the touch or if my mouth was just scared to go back for more. I recommend the 'hot' so you can actually taste the chicken. If your lucky, grab a seat by the window and watch the crazy lady at the bodega across the street dance.
