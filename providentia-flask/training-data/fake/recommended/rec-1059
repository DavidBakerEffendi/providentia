I was in town for a conference and stopped here for lunch. Having gone to school in Louisiana, my standards are pretty high for cajun cuisine. This place met my expectations, just barely. I had their breakfast bowl featuring andouille sausage, egg, and some other things I now forgot (memories do not age well). The food was spicy, but not overwhelmingly so. There's a decent amount of salt, but does not overpower the taste of the ingredients. I had a good conversation with one of the workers there. So the service is fast and friendly.
