Mostly loved it!  But I would go back with a party vs. a date because of the bustling super-sized ambiance. SPACE: B-   Moody & Charming but Loud & Packed. Did I mention LOUD?? SERVICE:  A- Loved our waiter and his suggestions were dead on. Food came really fast.  Too fast maybe? FOOD: A   Warm Goat-Cheese Carmelized Onion Tart -- delicate and delicious Risotto w Morels and Asparagus -- creamy, cheesy perfection Duck Shephard's Pie -- very very rich and gamey -- loved it! Seared Salmon -- tender, savory & perfectly seared Chocolate Pot de Creme -- eeeh, it was okay. No big deal really.
