Loved the atmosphere. Amazing turkeyBLT. BLTs are one of my favorite Sammy's but I rarely order them because they can be quite ordinary. This however, was not. It had basil and chipotle mayo. MÃ ginifque. The chai latte was very good. It was too spicy for my liking but it was a very good chia. Over all, I've already dreamed and craved that BLT, two days later, and next time, Nutella mocha. I will def be back soon!
