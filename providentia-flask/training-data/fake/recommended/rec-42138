Tried this place out for the first time over the weekend for brunch.  The cafe is very cute and homey inside, I really liked it.  Very personal service and the food was great.  I am really looking forward to trying lunch and dinner there.  It's wonderful to have a new restaurant that isn't italian, pizza or something deep fried.  This is an excellent addition to the neighborhood and hope it sticks around for a long time!
