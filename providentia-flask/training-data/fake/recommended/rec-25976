I was prepared to suffer through a long wait but somehow we were miraculously seated right away. The burgers were undeniably good (if a bit on the greasier side than I like). Â The flavor was incredible rich and overall, done very well. I'm happy I tried it but I'm not crazy in love. More of a preference thing than anything else. We agreed that the Truffle burger was better than the classic umami burger. Avoid the onion rings, they were terrible. Four big onion rings that had a really thick batter. So every bite was all oil and zero onion flavor. Also, even though our waitress knew it was our first time at Umami, we were never told the specials or had the sauces described to us....both tables seated after and next to us did. Umami burger falls into the "go to say you tried it" category for me.
