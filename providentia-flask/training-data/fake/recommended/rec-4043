I can't really review Sunshine Co., because it hasn't opened yet.  However,  I passed by it this morning on my way to get a cup of coffee and spoke briefly with one of the owners.  It looks like a cool space--not too fancy, not too casual, with a great bar area.  I wasn't able to find out much, but I did learn that they will be serving New American cuisine, and they officially open for brunch tomorrow.  The word on the street is that this new venture is coming to us from the very same people who own Vanderbilt Ave. Cafe, so it should be good!  I am giving it four stars for now because I'm super psyched (yes, I am still using that phrase because I'm just that cool) that it's opening up right here in my beloved Prospect Heights.  Stay tuned for an update once I get to dine there.  In the meantime, check it out!
