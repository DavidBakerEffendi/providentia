Came with a party of 4 and had a quick wait on a Sat around 1:30. They have a few chairs out front and they'll bring you drinks as you watch tourists taking pics of the "Friends" building. It's a cute spot, definitely tiny so if you can make reservations I recommend it. We had the meatball sliders (delicious!) comes with 3 but we asked for 4 to split. Also had the cheese burger, fries and poached eggs. All were well done. Their while sangria is great!
