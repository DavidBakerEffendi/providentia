Ahoy octopus, you gettin' in my belly! Love a good Greek restaurant and I'm so happy this place opened up months ago so I do not have to trek into Queens for their delicious dessert. Sometimes I wish I can fast forward the meal just to get to the dessert! Odd layout though. I had to wait for a table and ended up just loitering the area and bar because there weren't any room to wait in the front without being in the way of other customers coming in.
