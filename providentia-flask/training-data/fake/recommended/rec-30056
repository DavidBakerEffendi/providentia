My wife and I have had the luxury of dining here a few time in the last couple of months. The steak is spectacular but the service is even better! Enjoyed the service and atmosphere so much that my brother and sisters agreed to chip in and have my Dad's retirement dinner here. After inquiring about it, Cindy, the manager, assisted with every detail and made the process completely worry free. Cindy assisted with menu options the private room and made sure that the evening went without any hitches! Even printing special menus that read "Congratulations on your Retirement". A party of 18 and they made us feel that we were the only people in the place. Â She even gave a courtesy follow up call a couple of days later to make to sure everything met my family's expectation. I was happy to report that it did! If you have a party that you would like to splurge on I highly recommend! Great job guys and I look forward to my next visit!
