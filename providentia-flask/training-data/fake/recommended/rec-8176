This is the real deal. I lived in Beijing for 6 months, and the way this shop makes their noodles is the authentic way. If you don't know what I'm talking about, the noodle-maker takes a ball of dough, stretches it out, slaps it down onto the board, folds in half and then repeats. That probably didn't make any sense, so you've gotta go and see it for yourself. What to order? You can't go wrong with their niu rou tang mien (beef noodle soup). The beef isn't too fatty or too dry, and the soup base is seasoned just right. If you're in Chinatown, I think this is one of the best quick meals to be had. Sure, the wait staff of one person isn't going to be the nicest nor most attentive server in the world, but you don't go to a real hole in the wall to be pampered.
