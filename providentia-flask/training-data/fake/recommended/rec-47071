I just ate at AC a mere eight years after my last visit to this sleek BYOB joint, and it still lived up to my expectations and remembrances. Partially because of the street it's on, and its open air in the summer minimalist space, it reminds me of eating outside in the summer in London. A green apple is placed in the umbrella hole in the center of the table, waiters are alert but friendly, and the place maintains a slow and steady buzz. My remembered favorite was still on the menu--mussels in a tomato broth with a slight zing of heat. I also sampled the delightful haloumi cheese app with fig jam, salted beets and cheese, and a rich and creamy pumpkin risotto--cooked well but much too creamy for my taste (some salt or less cream and more fresh pumpkin and it would have worked better). Then, the night was finished with a chocolate bread pudding (though I still wonder how the cardamom creme brulee tasted). I even considered eating here on another night of my stay so I could try some other dishes and relax on the lanai, but I was drawn elsewhere. Until next time, Audrey Claire.
