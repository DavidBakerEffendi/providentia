I bought several cookie trays for Christmas and not only are they some of the best cookies I have ever had.. the old school Italian's I gave them too were also extremely happy to enjoy the delicious cookies. They were so good, I went back on Christmas eve and picked up 2 more! Â Easy in and out and I now have a new christmas tradition!! Thanks you! Buon Natale a tutti !
