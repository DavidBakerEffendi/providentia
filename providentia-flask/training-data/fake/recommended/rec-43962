Not too busy on a Saturday night, picked up as the evening wore on.  Tableside guacamole was a fun feature. Good selection of Tequilas. We parked in the lot next door, which had filled up with clubgoers by the time we'd finished our meal.  I enjoyed it but wouldn't go out of my way to dine there again.
