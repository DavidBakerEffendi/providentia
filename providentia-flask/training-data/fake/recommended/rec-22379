As you can tell from the previous reviews, Ivy Noodle gets a bad rap. But there's a reason why, for years now, it's been the first stop for students looking for a quick, good meal. You can't beat the prices at Ivy, and it's open until 2 in the morning, which is useful. The service is extremely fast. Often, around midnight, I'll call for take-out, order scallion pancakes and chicken lo-mein (both great) and then promptly walk from my dorm to the restaurant, which is about three minutes away. Without fail, the food will be ready by the time I get there, I will pay my $5.50 and head back home to eat. Not too much seating in restaurant and all the tables are filled on Friday or Saturday nights (usually room at counter).
