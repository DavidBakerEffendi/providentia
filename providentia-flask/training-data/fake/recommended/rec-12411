I went to this place on Thursday afternoon still waited for 1.5 hr. You can tell their business goes pretty well. The service is okay. One thing I felt uncomfortable was that the waitress asked us directly what we wanted to order for food literally 2min after we sat down. My speculation is that the waitress thought we already figured out the menu while we were waiting. It is not understandable unless they handed out their paper menu to us outside before we sat down. Let's talk about the food. I ordered eggs benedict and my friend ordered blueberry pancake. To be honest, I don't feel wow when I had the food. They are just average brunch you could have like everywhere else. In sum, it is not worth waiting 1.5hr for having the food. P.S. prepare your cash because they don't accept cards
