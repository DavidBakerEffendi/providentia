First off, if anyone is a fan of 'Friends' then you have to try this place out. It's located in the building used for the 'Friends' show. They have a couple of amazing appetizers. I was really impressed with the meatball sliders and the duck breast. Foie gras is usually my all time favorite, but I felt the foie gras at Little Owl was only ok. I would definitely order the meatball sliders or the duck breast over the foie gras. The lamb t-bone entree is delicious and its cooked to perfection. They marinate it perfectly so there is no gamely taste left on the lamb. The lamb is definitely my favorite entree at Little Owl. We also ordered their pork chop, which supposedly is one of their trademarks. However, I was severely disappointed. I felt the pork chop was too dry and it was a bit flavorless. The waitress noticed that I wasn't enjoying my pork chop and she asked me if I wanted to try another entree instead. I ended up getting the veal cheek dish and this one was pretty good. Its a very savory dish and the meat is extremely tender. It can be a bit on the heavy side though, since they wrap the veal cheek in cheese. Service at this place is wonderful and for that, they get 1 extra star =). The bill is presented to you in a cute little red book, and it adds a cute charm to the experience.
