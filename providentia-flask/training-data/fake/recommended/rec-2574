The Fan is what it is, and it's a sports bar. In fact, it's the best place anywhere in the area to watch NFL games on Sundays. There are TVs all over the place, so if a game is being played somewhere, it will be on at least one television. The beers are fairly priced, very cold, and help wash down the free popcorn they give you. Unfortunately, the beer selection kind of sucks. What I mean by that is that they don't really offer anything other than the basics. Luckily, New England Brewing is literally across the street, so you can always find at least one of their fresh, locally made brews at The Fan. Food wise, the menu is pretty unspectacular. Flavor wise, the same. I've never really eaten anything there and thought it was really good, but I can't recall eating anything I thought was terrible either. I say stick with the basics while your here. Chances are you'll be happier with your food that way. Besides, there's no way I'd come here unless it was to drink beers and watch football, so it's not even that big of a deal that the food is mediocre at best. At a place like this, as long as the food isn't terrible, I'm okay with it. Bottom line... if you're looking for a place to go out and eat, go somewhere else. If you're looking for a place you to watch the game, throw a few back, and maybe grab a bite depending on how you feel, The Fan is really the only option.
