Super cute space with yummy breakfast, burgers, and salads. Usually stop by here when I'm in the area to a light breakfast-- Coffee, Toast w. Nutella-- or a light lunch-- usually one of their salads-- the pumpkin one is tasty. If you're looking for a different twist on burgers, they make a mean and tasty 'Bronte' burger with sweet chili sauce... yumm...  on lightly toasted white bread (oval foccacia or french bread roll??) Tried their oatmeal and it was really different and decent-tasting, but I prefer my Irish. :-)  It was darker than most oatmeals I've seen and had a gritty/grainy texture. Also-- if you're looking for eye-candy... the waiters are hot!! :-)
