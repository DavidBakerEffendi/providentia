Good lord, this place sucks! I went there for breakfast today and it was terrible. The waitress was inattentive and moped around like she hates life. My Eggs Florentine was cold and utterly tasteless. We waited 15 minutes for the opportunity to ask someone to bus our table. And then the ultimate insult: THEY HAVE BATHROOM ATTENDANTS. (Are you fucking kidding me!? I just turned around and left.) Obscenely overpriced for such a crap experience. Never. Again.
