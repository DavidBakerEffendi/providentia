During a recent trip to NY, I ate lunch here with my brother and his wife. He had a tuna burger, she ordered ravioli, and I had a great BLT. We enjoyed great food, and very attentive service. We found a hair in the ravioli, our wait person was mortified and brought a replacement out. The manager stopped by and was very apologetic and comped the ravioli. Despite the hair incident, everything about our visit was great. I plan on coming back, next time I travel to NYC.
