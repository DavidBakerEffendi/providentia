Atmosphere is lively and up beat. I actually don't drink alcohol and only went in for food bc they are open until 4am. I was staying across the street at the Hilton. Ordered the chicken wings, they were hot and on point. The music is fun and the people are way nice. The bartender Kevin and doorman Jason are super sweet! Big hugs for being so sweet.
