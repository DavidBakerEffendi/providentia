great little spot near bryant park, without the bryant park pricing. Went there yesterday on a recommendation from a friend - very coZy little restaurant with fast service for a hungry appetite. Tried the unda chicken roll -apparently it was the most popular. It was just ok... however the beef tikka and shami kabab roll were much better! I think the staff just pointed to a random roll for me... *roll eyes* the masala chai was not as good as I would've expected - save your money on that! otherwise overall - cheap , and flavorful food in a jiffy, so I say A-OK!
