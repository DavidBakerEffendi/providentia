Our party of four went in around 8:00p on a Sunday. We learned that in small towns 8 is late. Our hotel recommended the place.  We felt the food was decent, not over the top, but good. The house wine was not bad for the price and they give an ample pour. This review would be better if the wait staff would have been the least bit cordial.  We felt like the guy just wanted to get out of there. I always wonder how restaurnat owners allow the staff to tear down what they have built.
