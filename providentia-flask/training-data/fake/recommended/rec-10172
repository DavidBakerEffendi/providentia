All I can say is YUM! My friend and I do lunch or dinner once a month to catch up and she usually finds the best restaurants. So this time I had the task of trying to keep up with her fantastic choices. A coworker recommended Pio Pio and it was terrific! She had the Arroz con Mariscos which was HUGE! Lots of different seafood mixed with rice. I had the Picante de Camarones. The sauce was fabulous. I wanted to take a bucket of that home. It was just enough for me, but perhaps not enough for a bigger eater. The decor was relaxing and we were surprised at the amount of space and seating. I will definitely be going back for more.
