Wow!  What a wonderful restaurant!  I called last evening to see if they could accommodate a group of 25 high school students for lunch today.  Not only did Christine say, "yes," she suggested we do family-style entrees so that we could sample a variety of dishes.  I'm not sure what the names of the dishes were, but everything was amazing!  We had thousand layer bread, mango chicken, Kung pow chicken, a beef in a cream sauce, yummy noodles and two other dishes.  All of my students agreed that Burmese food is wonderful; I'll definitely be back!
