Take some elusive giant squid, throw out those displeasing tentacle parts, then deep fry what's left, and serve it with a side of awe inspiring tomato sauce.....and you have some of the best calamari anywhere.* I see that this place is categorized under "Dive Bar", and that's fair, beer is stale here (let's pretend it adds to the atmosphere) and it's mainly frequented by blue collar folk (truck drivers, longshoreman, firefighters, etc.).  What makes this place stand out though is the fact that it has good bar food.  Fried seafood, burgers, deli sandwiches, all good for a quick, filling, and cheap lunch to those who work in Newark, but I feel that to most NY Yelpers daytripping to Newark, this place will be sought after more the "experience" than the food. *I would rate this place 5 stars if it wasn't for persistent smell of ammonia, but that tells me the place is clean though, no?
