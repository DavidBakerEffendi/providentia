I thought this place had really cool/funky decor inside - I was looking all around when waiting for our food. Brunch was great - The apple caramel french toast was really good, everything tasted fresh & was reasonably priced. I thought the drink specials could have been a little more generous & our seating was a little cramped, but I guess that's expected on a busy Sunday. Our waitress was a little inattentive, but again - It was really busy & we managed to only wait about 7 minutes before being sat when everywhere else in the area had an about hour wait. All in all, I would definitely recommend & come back!
