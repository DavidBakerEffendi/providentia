A beautiful atmosphere coupled with an eclectic menu makes for a sophisticated dining experience. I went here for an early dinner on a Friday night. I love the selection of seafood and the wonderful martini and mixed drinks Halcyon has to offer. The decor is beautiful with an elaborate light decor at the main bar and a lounge feel upstairs. I have also been to the lounge upstairs for work-related happy hours and the finger food (calamari, sliders, salad, fries, etc.) has always been spectacular. On my Friday experience, I had a shrimp dish which was rather lackluster as it only had shaved cucumber and cooked shrimp which was supposed to have tandoori spice but lacked any clear spice in the taste. However, we all shared our food and the Chilean Sea Bass special and the soft shell crab made up for my dish. They were fantastic! Coffee and desserts are also excellent. I highly recommend dining here if you're looking for an upscale, fine dining experience off the beaten path in Montclair.
