HOLY BACON! This place was packed when we got there but were able to be seated pretty quickly. The bacon sampler with the beer pairing is a must. Actually I think my favorite item was the jalepeno bacon. I had never tasted anything like it. The BLT with egg and avocado was great as was the lobster roll. I did not love the Banh Mi, unfortunately did not think it was very tasty. For the two of us we could hardly finish the sampler, BLT, Banh Mi and the lobster roll. We definitely over did it, but it was so worth it. Looking forward to coming back and trying more bacon selections.
