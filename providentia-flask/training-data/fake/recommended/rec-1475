Ate here many times, from the early days when gangsters used to sit in the back corner to these days when tourists flood the place. Pretty good wonton noodle soup.  Authentic, I think comparing this place and Big Wong across the street.  I think this place slightly ahead with their chicken broth.  The wonton is good but it's not really authentic.  Traditional wontons are smaller and less fatty.  These are bigger and fatty, I think they're good but don't use them as reference for authenticity. Service is so-so, if you'r Chinese you get respectable service but for tourists I've seen the waiters ignore them at the door because some of them don't speak good English and rather not deal with them until a waiter who can speak English greets. For those out of town, I'm sure this place will blow away most Chinese take-outs in your vicinity.
