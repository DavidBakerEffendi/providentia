This place is fantastic for inexpensive, healthy, and delicious lunch on my lunch break. I walk over from rittenhouse, bypassing all sorts of competition. I really liked the ample room and lack of insane hustle and bustle that comes along smaller popular local healthy lunch spots (looking at you honeygrow). Today's Soup was a highlight, Curry Chicken Stew warmed me right up! Of course, all the pita's a incredible, fresh, and everything is clearly made in house. BOTTOM LINE: Try this spot out. These people are creating something out of love and with serious pride in the product, so you know it's gunna be good. P.S. Don't forget to get your pita will "all the veggies"!
