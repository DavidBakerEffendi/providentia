I stopped by here for a few drinks the other night. There are two bars inside and a separate counter where you can order food. I had the Franziskaner Dunkel-Weisse and the Karnival Kolsh, which were both very good. The atmosphere of this place is great! There's a pretty big courtyard with tables, trees, lights, and 2 ping pong tables and board games you can play for free. I unfortunately wasn't hungry enough to try the food, but next time I'll have to. I definitely would frequent this place if I lived closer! There's nothing like sitting outside with a beer on a warm summer night.
