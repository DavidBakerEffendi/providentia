My husband and I had just seen Avenue Q and walked over to Toto Ramen for some dinner. The line was out the door and it was close to 15 degrees outside so we headed on over to Noodie Thai Kitchen for some soup. This Thai place has a small selection of appetizers, noodle dishes and soups with noodles. (don't expect to get any curry here) We ordered the crispy spring rolls for a started and they were GREAT! Lovely flavor and texture. I could have eaten the app to myself My husband ordered the beef and crab soup and I ordered the veggie noodle soup. My husband liked his but i felt the veggie soup had NO flavor. It need salt, acid, heat...pretty much everything. PLus, the noodles pretty much fell apart when i tried to pick them up with the chopsticks whiles my husbands ramen looked amazing. My soup did come with 2 mushroom dumplings which were excellent. The food was inexpensive but I most likely would not get the veggie soup if I were to come back. I'd load up an appetizers and maybe get a pad thai
