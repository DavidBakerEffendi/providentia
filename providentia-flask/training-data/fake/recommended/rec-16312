We came here on a Saturday around 6pm and were seated within five minutes. That's pretty bad ass, especially since we were heading back home (Baltimore) after spending the day in Jersey. My boyfriend raved about this place, and since we were gonna pass it anyhow on the way home...we ate here. Before we went in he said it was a hipster joint. That's pretty accurate. Our waitress was nice though, something we were not expecting. We all got beer, and then the magic started to happen. We got the chips and salsa, which was delicious. Simple and good. I ordered the fried cactus and sweet potato tacos, and I fell deeply in love. Never again will I doubt my boyfriends taste in places to eat. I have found heaven in the form of this taco. Come into my belly, taco. We will go on magical journeys together. Forever. He got pulled pork, which was awesome. Also, they do indeed have horseradish. Your waiter or waitress will inform you that they don't. They do. Tell the you've been there before and that you've had it before. The fries are drop dead delicious. I want to marry them. I don't remember what my friend got, but I assume it was also delicious. Our bill was around $60 which isn't horrible for three meals and six beers. We left stuffed and happy.
