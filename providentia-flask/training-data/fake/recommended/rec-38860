Best burger I've ever had. Before going here White Manna in hackensack held the title for the first 33 years of my life. I honestly have no idea why it's so good.  They cook the burger on a flat top griddle.  Seems like fresh chop meat.  Bacon is crispy and cooked fresh.   Area isn't bad (not great tho).  Bar is dingy.  But trust me go here for the food.  Even the fried calamari was amazing.
