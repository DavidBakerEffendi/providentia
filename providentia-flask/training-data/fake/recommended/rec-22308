Sautéed ground meat over yellow rice with a side of lettuce and the two sauces.  I was stunned for a moment until the aromatic whiff from my food container beckoned me to take my first bite.  WOW!  It was so unique, so tasty, so spicy (not as in hot spicy...but as in flavorful spicy).  The meat was tender.  Clearly marinated and then cooked in a wonderful blend of spices.  I got hints of cinnamon, coriander, cumin and much much more.  Once you start eating this stuff, you will find that you cannot stop.  How simple in appearance and presentation, and yet how dynamite to taste!   The red sauce is quite spicy...so be careful with how much you use.  The white sauce is calming with its creamy texture.  I believe it is made with sour cream, yogurt with a dash of vinegar, salt and pepper.   It was the perfect complement to the dish.
