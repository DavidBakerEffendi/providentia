Probably my favorite diner in Burlington.  The atmosphere is perfect - the wait staff will be chatting with customers seated at the horseshoe counter, and everyone is down to earth and friendly, customers and employees alike.   It's all good diner food, but I want to point out that their veggie burgers are much better than average - the burger is really flavorful and it's on a real roll, not some wonderbread bun.  Veggie burger & fries ($7) are a common lunch-time take out for me.
