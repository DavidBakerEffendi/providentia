The bistro burger here is quite good regardless of the price. It's cheap but you'd never know it. The psuedo dive-bar vibe of the place plays into it's charm making the experience kind of fun and "insider-y." I wouldn't say the burger is top five New York-wise though it does make my top ten. That should be important to you for some reason.
