(this happened on 4/28/2011) After a spooky day of fun visiting the Eastern State Penitentiary and a walking Ghost Tour of Olde City, my cousin (a Philly local) and I stumbled upon this fine establishment! The ambiance was great! Beautiful gilded ceiling tin, an awesome deer head with a monocle, cigarette holder and top hat, dark wood, and just so comfortable. Our handsome bar tender made our drinks PERFECTLY! I had a belvedere and tonic (simple yet surprisingly so easy to screw up) and my cousin had a white russian. He made those drinks with love & care! Next time I visit Philly, I'm definitely gonna make a point to stop here :)
