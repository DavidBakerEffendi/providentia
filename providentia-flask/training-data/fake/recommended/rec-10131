1. Upon bringing share plates with the apps, our server noticed my plate wasn't clean, so she scraped the food off my plate with her nail, right there at the table, before placing it in front of me. ARE YOU KIDDING. 2. 15 minutes after the apps, we were given our check. "Um, we haven't gotten our food yet," my friend said. The server apologized, but it was still another 10 minutes before we were fed. SERIOUSLY. 3. A third server sloppily picked our check with the credit card inside, and he flung the credit card across the floor without even noticing it fell out. It was eventually located. REALLY. Also bad: I asked our server which curry was spiciest, and she responded, "basil sauce." It wasn't a curry, but she was so confident I took her word for it. The dish was neither currylike nor the least big spicy. And the rice was dry. This was my second time at Room Service; I wanted to give the place another shot after a mediocre dinner here a few months ago. No fancy chandelier or cute headbands makes up for a lousy meal with such obscenely bad service.
