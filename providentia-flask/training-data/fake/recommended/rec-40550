We really wanted to love this place. We did. The atmosphere is charming...nice location. Staff were friendly. But like other reviewers noted, they seemed very understaffed and we had to wait a very long time for our food, even though there weren't that many people there when we placed our order. From what I could see, there were only 5 people working the whole place: a bartender, a waiter, a runner, a chef and a dishwasher. With the exception of a few things, the food was dissapointing. The pierogies were the only success for us; too bad they were so tiny. Portions are very small...my burger was little more than 2 inches in diameter. I love greasy food, but the onion rings and chips were so oily that I couldn't eat them...and they were completely underseasoned, which made things worse. All we could taste was dirty fry oil. The chicken pot pie croquettes were mushy and they had no seasoning at all. We did a lot of waiting there, and received a lot of greasy, tasteless, unsatisfying dishes.
