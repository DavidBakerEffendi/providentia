Either quality has changed or it's just overrated.  Waited in line for 40 minutes, which isn't bad given how long folks usually wait.  We ordered Mozzarella, Onion, and Sausage, and it was really just...meh.  I mean, really.  The pizza was mostly soggy, and what best metric for a good pizza aside for the crust?!!!  If you want to take me up on it, try Tappo's by Eataly.  Perfect thin, crispy crust, and just overall delic.
