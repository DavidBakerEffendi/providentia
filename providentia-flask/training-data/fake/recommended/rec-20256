So happy this place is here!  Great busy vibe (shocking for a monday) and even spotted an irish rock star in the back corner on my way to the bathroom! The good of it:  competent but not pretentious drink scene at bar, hand sliced meats, handmade pastas that melted in my mouth.  Super friendly staff who know their stuff. The bad of it: it's crowded and loud. We chose to sit at the bar and that seemed to have the more breathing room than the tables but I'd rather eat in a popular spot than a dead spot! Need to go back with a bigger appetite to try more...we never made it past the pasta section!
