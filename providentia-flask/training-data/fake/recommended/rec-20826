Wow.  Really good food.   Hubs had the banana pecan French toast and - wow.  Just wow.  A must try.  I had the West coast scramble; eggs scrambled with cherry tomatoes and topped with avocado.  It was good, but after tasting the Hubs' French toast, it paled in comparison.  The home fries are just plain fried potato chunks (no onions or other things to spoil them) and toast comes dry.  Milk and juice come in large mason jars; about 12 ounces worth.  Hubs also had A side of bacon. It wasn't crisp, but not all soggy and fatty either.  Perfect for him.   This is a great out-of-the-way place with really good food.  We will be back.  It just might become our new place for Saturday breakfast or brunch.
