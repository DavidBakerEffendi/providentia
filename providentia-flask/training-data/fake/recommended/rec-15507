Two stars for outside patio. It is great and a nice escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. The food is not tasty at all. We had the calamari which was not crispy. It wasn't soggy but it was like rubber, it was thick and Â hard to chew. The carpaccio was ok but not recommended. Gnocchi or duck breast were not recommended either. To sum up not recommended.
