Can't believe how far this place has fallen. Sticky, nasty table & seats, THE rudest waiter I've ever had in New York in my 20 years. We asked for some sauce on the a spring roll and the waiter screamed at us. He Â was so aggressive that I was almost afraid he'd throw something, unprovoked. The duck was way too bony and had too little meat, like a couple millimeters. Not coming back ever again. Yikes! Update: an hour and a bit after eating there, I got home felt sick to my stomach and threw up what I ate. So gross. :( Now I wish I hadn't eaten there! Be careful, folks!
