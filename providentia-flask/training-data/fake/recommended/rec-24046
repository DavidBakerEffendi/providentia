This place was in my neighborhood and I really wanted to like it. I gave a few tries even, but how underwhelming. The food is not worth what they charge. For example, overpriced burritos stuffed with rice and a touch of shredded steak or tacos which you must assemble. (I'm not lazy or anything but when eating with a group of friends, I spent more time "assembling" my dinner than enjoying it. Oh, and if your going to do that, separate plates for the tortillas, not folded and jammed on the edge of the plate to get nice an soggy.) I was told to "go for the margaritas" and was let down again. I thought they were tasty but pretty weak. After all the pitchers that our table ordered, I shouldn't really be remembering how the food was. Service was like whatever. Â The manager tried to call out our entire table on leaving a weak tip, when they actually miscounted (by a lot). If your going to call out a table, I would recount. Great mexican across the street. Eat there.
