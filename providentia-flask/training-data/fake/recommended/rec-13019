Scrumptious and deli-oh-cious! $16 per lobster roll. Tried both the Maine-style and Connecticut-style rolls. So so good. The bread is toasted and you can taste the butter on the bread. Sinful. They are generous with the lobster but the sandwich/roll itself is a bit on the small side. *sigh* I wished there were 2 more bites to it! It was gone so fast! The lobster filling is all pre-made so service is quick. They just lop on all that goodness, put it on a tray, and call your name. I deducted a star because they don't have any cheap drink selections. If you want water or hipster soda, you'll pay $3. If you want iced tea or lemonade, you'll pay $4.50. Ouch.
