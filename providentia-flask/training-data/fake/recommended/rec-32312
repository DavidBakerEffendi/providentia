That's it, I'm officially done. You drew me in many times in the past, I even proclaimed my love for you in my review. Why is it you must hurt the ones you love so much? I knew you when you were the little upstart in a plaza with two other pho shops, and helped you along until you stood atop South Philly as the lone heir to the pho throne. My family has come to you early and often, and many a friend have been sent to you. And now you spit on my face and act as if we never knew each other. I came in with a friend, and we sat. That's it, we just sat. We know what we want, we always get the same dish; pho with steak, brisket, and flank [sometimes meat balls when I'm feeling particularly fancy]. After five minutes, the lunch rush hit and the place went from having a dozen people in its seat nearly filled in a matter of moments. It then became apparent that you don't want me around anymore. A server went to a table that sat right by us immediately after they sat down. A waiter was taking the order of a party of 12 that just finished taking off their coats. I waved to a waiter, and he proceeded to walk towards us... and stop at the table next to us that too just sat down. Everyone was getting served but us. Dead fucking last when we arrived first by a large margin and sat and watched while every other person was attended to. That's it Pho Ha, you can take your shitty broth and pour it right up your asshole. The novelty of crappy service at a Vietnamese restaurant wore through its last thread that afternoon, and you'll sooner see me throw a brick through your window than to have me sit in that shit hole you call a restaurant.
