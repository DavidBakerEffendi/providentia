Poutine. That is all. The poutine is awesome. I've seen some negative reviews on it but I saw no flaws. Very tasty, very hot. Just perfect. The combination of frites with hot chicken gravy and cheese curds is great. I'll try the sauces next time but for now the poutine will always be my go-to. I would give them 5 stars except that they're always busy, usually only 2 guys behind the counter and I guess they can't take more than one order at a time, I want to think its because they want to pay careful attention to each order. But when I'm in a rush to get to work and need my quick poutine fix, not cool. Â I've tried at different times. It's all a matter of luck. But yes, do try that perfect poutine. Extra napkins.
