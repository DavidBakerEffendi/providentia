I've been several times and keep coming back... a rarity for NYC where there are tons of restaurants to experience and explore. The first time I came here was with a friend for happy hour... for anyone who isn't familiar with happy hour, this is a must do... half price cocktails and small bites at half prices, are definitely worth it.  Having 2 cocktails and leaving stuffed off food for less than $30 is less than what you normally pay for 2 cocktails and tip elsewhere.  Although service is kind of slow (it's a huge space for happy hour) the drinks were delicious and food was nice a hot.  However since it's such a great happy hour spot, I highly recommend coming early as it was super crowded by the time my friend and I left. The second time I came with a colleague for restaurant week, and again Ilili did not disappoint... the choice of 2 full-sized appetizers per person, the main course, and the dessert were impeccable and made to perfection.  It was so much food I couldn't finish it all! The space is also quite large so it can actually accommodate a larger group which is also another rare find when it comes to NYC restaurants. I highly recommend this spot for great food, good cocktails, and great ambiance for a night out on the town!
