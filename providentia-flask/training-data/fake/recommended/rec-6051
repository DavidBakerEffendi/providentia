Cool neighborhood breakfast spot. The staff is really nice and friendly, the space is nice and open, they have a few tables outside. We tried the omelette Â and pancakes, they were both pretty basic. They have a large selection of items ( like muffins and cakes) I want to try other things in this place and maybe try to be a little more original in my order because I do believe I can find more tasty and interesting things to eat at this place... Hopefully.... I will update the review if I go back.
