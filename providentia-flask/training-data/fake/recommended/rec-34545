I absolutely love this place. Amazing find via yelp. Hole in the wall tiny place in Chinatown that serves CHEAP, delicious dumplings. Cash only, fast moving line, know what you want before you get up there. The number of dumplings vary from order to order but the $1 fried pork and chive dumplings is for 4. I also got the pork and chive boiled dumplings in broth, which was about 8, and had soup inside the dumplings. DELICIOUS. Seriously I have to come back to this place. It was like Asian soul food. Comfort food at its finest. I also tried a duck pancake, which was alright. It was good, but keep with the dumplings. I'll be back if I'm ever in New York again!
