It's very hard to make a reservation, the tasting menu is good, pork feet hot pot is yummy except too salty and hopefully not msg. I got paranoid a little bit about the chives on top lol. Appetizers are surprisingly good, they said the pork in salad was shipped from Japan, it really tastes better. Still very small room but its kind of lovely.
