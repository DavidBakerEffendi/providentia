The food here is delicious and you can't beat the wine prices, especially during happy hour. They have a huge wine selection if that's what you're looking for. It's a little pricey for the portion size, but I've been here a few times and everything I've tried has been delicious. My favorites are probably the quiche lorraine and the escargot.
