Franklin Hall was made to celebrate man's greatest inventions-beer and pretzels.  Beer was made to drink from mugs larger than a human stomach.  And pretzels were made to soak up dark beers and taste great.  Franklin Hall was made for Beer and Pretzels.  Even Seinfeld would love these pretzels.  They make you thirsty.  This place is truly brilliant.  They turned an abandoned building into an open beer hall stocked with long wooden tables, a fire pit, ping pong, jenga, and a pretzel factory.  Did I mention beer?  There's a lot of it.  Franklin Hall is the type of place where it's easy to lose track of time.  You can sit on the benches and chat with wayfarer-wearing, yuppie friends all day and easily transition into night time drunk fest.  It's not as hipster as the rest of Fishtown/No. Libs, which is both a strength and a weakness.  Call it trendy.  Regardless, Philadelphia needed this place.
