Can only speak for the brunch, but it's great. The pastry basket is heavenly. If you're with a friend, you should definitely split it. I'm salivating right now at the thought of getting it again. At this point, I've pretty much tried all the brunch entrees and I highly recommend them all. The eggs benedict specifically. However, it is a bit lacking with service. Even if the restaurant is not full, you could be waiting for a while for your waitress to take your drink order. Otherwise, fantastic place for brunch on the weekends.
