Zest! This place was really great.  It is a very small restaurant on the LES, but the staff is great and the food is great and best of all.... BYOB!!   I personally don't eat sushi but there was a very wide array of sushi options on the menu and everyone at my table ate sushi and said it was great!  There are some very interesting and delicious appetizer options and since you can BYOB why not splurge on 3 or 4 different appetizers for your whole group!?  The staff has wine bottle openers and will bring buckets with ice if you need to chill your wine.   Overall we had a great experience at Zest, if you plan on going I would definitely call ahead to make reservation because like I said, the restaurant is very small.
