looks nice from the outside but that is it.. Came in one night, because of the interesting decor  to be confronted with a showering of cheap glass chandeliers  Like someone took a gigantic chandeliers and put it in this placed it in the middle of the restaurant. So it's actually looked pretty cool , if overstimulating. You can gaze upon the enchanting chandelier or interesting art works on the wall but what good is a place if the food and service doesn't match the wonderful decor? It's at least different and not another restaurant (at least from the outside). The food and drink prices are reasonably price by NYC standards, it's can get a bit loud and when I was in there, The tables are so close that it feels like I was packed in like a bunch of sardines. The service was down right poor... the waiters just don't care.  Food was okay just edible and filling.  Oh yes did I mention it got a "C" health grade rating outside.  Gross!   This restaurant is very similar to QI in midtown... maybe the same owner/chef.   . Don't be fooled by the posh decor and enchanting chandelier.  Quality/Cleaniness/taste of the food and service is much more important than the decor. Not so memorable experience go elsewhere if you can..
