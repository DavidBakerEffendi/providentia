Sorry guys, There is a lot to like about corner bistro. The good value beers, the good looking burgers. I've been 2 times all on the request of friends, and the second time I ended up with food poisoning. I can never go back. ... Please up your hygiene, or send a free burger my way. I understand you feed a lot of people, but its just no excuse..
