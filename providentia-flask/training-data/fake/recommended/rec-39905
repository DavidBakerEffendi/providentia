I love this restaurant! The only reason i didnt give 5 stars is the fact that the hostess is horrible at seating people. Anytime i go i expect to wait 20-30 minutes at least. But i guess where in the east village isnt there a wait for amazing foood? which it is...very yummy. The brunch is a great deal, i love the shrimp poached egg over potatoes...amazing. Dinner is great too, the flavors are so fresh! Lobster quesadillas are so gooood. If you havent tried it you need to come here.
