The pork and chicken buns are delightful, though I wouldn't put it past any of the food truck buns I've had in my lifetime. The ramen is quite possibly the best ramen I've ever had, and I hate to be "that guy" that says something is "best" but as of today, this is what I'm going with. I had mine spicy with some pork belly added and and extra egg. You really don't realize how big the bowl is or how much they give you until you get to the end of it. I had the thought in my mind that I was going to order extra noodles (an option on the menu) but quickly tapped out as I lifted the bowl and guzzled down the broth.
