I have been living in Crown Heights for some years now and was looking for a change to my "culinary scenery." I did not want to stray to far from home so I searched Yelp for some options and came across this establishment.  I was not disappointed.   The food and service were great.  And,  what you get for the price... it's a steal.  I will definitely go back to this restaurant! PS:  Great spot if you're trying to impress someone with your Brooklyn restaurant credibility.
