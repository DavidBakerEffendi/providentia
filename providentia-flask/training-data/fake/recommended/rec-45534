Most of the food at Korzo is probably a 3.5 for me but because it's a block from apartment and because of a few stellar menu items, I'll give it a solid 4. The wait staff is helpful and nice. The service is not swift but it's always correct and the food is always good. The burger is a standout on the menu. It's won some NYC awards and they are deserved. It's a unique presentation in the same-old-same-old of burgers and the rich flavor of the meat are truly hanker-worthy. Bonus points for being local grass-fed meat. Â  Other pluses: The beer and wine selection is always great and changes regularly enough to keep things exciting. Food and drink specials almost every night of the week.
