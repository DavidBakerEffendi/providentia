I had been waiting to try Fogo, ever since I heard about the concept. " What's that , you say?! They bring out different meats to you, until you pass out?...Sign me up!" I figured, by the occasion of my 40th birthday, I'd had a good run and now was as good a time as any to commit meat suicide. My little sister was kind enough to treat and we invited some other friends and headed for the city. I was impressed with every aspect of Fogo. The staff, the decor, the concept and the food. My only complaint is that I cant put it away like I used to. I almost got sidetracked by the pile of crisp bacon on the salad bar. After tearing up said salad bar, the meat skewers started flying and I only had time to proclaim, with a mouthful of cheese, " You mean theres more!" Sometimes, in an all you can eat establishment, the qualiuty of the food suffers. Not here. Everything I tried was top quality cuts, cooked to perfection. When I return, preferably for lunch, when the prices are cheaper but the experience is essentially the same, I plan on dressing like one of those meat gauchos. On my way out, I'll swing by the kitchen and grab a few skewers. People may wonder why Im passing their green lit tables, but by the time they realize my scam, I will be enjoying gthe best train meal anyone has ever had.
