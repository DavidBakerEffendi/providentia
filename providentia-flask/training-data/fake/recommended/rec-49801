Excellent Isan Thai- don't listen to the naysayers. Just ate dinner- LOVED. Amazing Nam Tok Nuer- Spicy grilled beef. Perfect balance of spicy, sour, salty- ordered medium spicy-I like plenty of spice, it was really great. Pork Larb- refreshing and delicious. Fantastic sauteed morning glory with crisp pork and chili. Would order any of these again in a heartbeat. Definitely get the sticky rice. Kids loved grilled chicken liver skewers, fried ice cream and coconut juice drink. Service was sweet and efficient. Decor was clean and basic. We normally head down to Zabb Elee in the East Village (same chef) or Queens, but this is tremendously convenient to UWS. Already looking forward to our next visit.
