We came to the Strand Bistro after an action packed full day of touristing.   We dined beside the fire place.  A Chefs Bistro Burger was the perfect end to a wonderful day in NYC. The burger was perfectly medium-rare, the fries were the perfect amount of crisp and delicious.  We received great service, especially taking into account our waiter had another table of 25 people to attend to.
