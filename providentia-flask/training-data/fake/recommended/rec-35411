The field of NYC pizza reviewing is so rife with contention that it's all but impossible to get any perspective.  We're all a bit pizza nuts and get trapped in the polemical loop circling what constitutes "the best". Are we as strongly opinionated about any other food in this city?  I suppose we feel in some strange way that NYC pizza belongs to us, or stems from us, or is us...a kind of food proxy; hence all the heated debate. Anyway, where does Luzzo's stand in the fray?  I've eaten here several times and it has oscillated from very good (3 stars) to outstanding (5 stars) depending largely on whether the resident pizzaiolo is manning the ship.   On their outstanding days, the pizza comes out of that blazing coal fired oven in 2 minutes flat.  As you bite in the crust gives off a puff of steam (the rapid bake time traps the moisture).  There is just a smattering of char on the base to add that subtle carbon twang.  The sauce, the cheese, everything tastes so bright and articulate; it is just barely cooked and has yet to dissipate an ounce of intrinsic flavor.  Utterly ethereal!   If you wait more than 5 minutes, it is a soggy mess of disjointed flavors.  More than any other dish, this hinges on timing for the pizza you start with bares little resemblance to that which you are ingesting at the meal's conclusion. As for the service, what can anyone say?  It possesses that rare continental combination of aggressive and inattentive - polarities fostered in countries devoid of tipping.
