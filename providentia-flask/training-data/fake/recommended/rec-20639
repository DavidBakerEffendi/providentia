Went to super hero sub shop for the first time last week. It was really good and the staff is super friendly. I only gave it 4 star instead of 5 because there is limited sitting room inside. BUT for those of you traveling in packs, there's a giant park directly across the street so you can always go there if you can't find a spot. Definitely recommend this place for all you sub lovers!
