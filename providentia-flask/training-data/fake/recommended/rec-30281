Meh. Came here for brunch this weekend because of all the amazing reviews but must say I was a bit disappointed. The place is nice, the service is good but I really wasn't impressed with the food. We had the French Toast and Huevos Rancheros. The FT wasn't terrible but tasted more like bread pudding rather than the actual thing, I didn't even finish half of it. The eggs in the Huevos Rancheros were way overcooked but other than that it tasted ok I guess. Cocktails were good. Location is great. Don't think I will be coming back though... There are tons of better brunch places in the city.
