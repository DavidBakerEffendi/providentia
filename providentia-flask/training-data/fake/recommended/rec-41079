Started off on the wrong foot when one of the waitresses said she would get an outside table ready for 3 but shortly thereafter it was given away to another party of 3 and we were forced to sit in a 2-top that the manager said was "very large". Yeah right. But our waitress was nice, food was pretty good- chicken kebabs and crab cake and hummus were good, steak wasnt. Â Probably wouldnt go back. Lots of other great mediterranean places who treat you nicely.
