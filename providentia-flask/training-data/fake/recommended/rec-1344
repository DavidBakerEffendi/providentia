I was contacted by Tashan's GM because of my review and was offered a $75 gift card to try it out again. Unfortunately it took me a couple months to actually get to Tashan, because on my recent visit the food and service was excellent, and I could have been enjoying their great Indian food in the interim. Everything that we ate was tasty and cooked perfectly. Some of the dishes we had were: goat cheese nan, somosa chat, tandoori shrimp, roaster veggies w/ a paneer in the middle, the Malai Kofta lollipops, Saag Paneer, and the Tandoor Chaamp. I do think that they should warn you that the "small plates" aren't actually all that small, but given my only complaint is that you I a fabulous lunch the day after, I can say for certain that I will be coming back soon. I'm giving Tashan 5 stars because not only is the food & service great, but obviously their management knows how to deal with picky customers, which is a skill I still am personally trying to master in my own business.
