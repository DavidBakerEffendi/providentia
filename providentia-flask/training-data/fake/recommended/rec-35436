I love Big Wong and go here every time I'm in the city. The service SUCKS, but it's okay because the food is good and it comes really fast. For $3.80 I got a huge bowl of pork and century egg lugow (aka congee aka jook) and a fried crueller. Yum. I should also note that everytime I go here, the bill is wrong in my favour. Weird...
