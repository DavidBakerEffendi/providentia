I recently visited Taiwan, and went to the Taipei train station.  I went to their food court, and saw one section with 7 beef noodle soup restuarants.  That's right, SEVEN BEEF NOODLE SOUP RESTUARANTS IN ONE FOOD COURT.  I thought I died and went to heaven.  My wife and I ordered from two separate beef noodle soup places there.  We wanted to see how good beef noodle soup can be in its motherland- taiwan. I hate to say it, but nanzhou hand drawn noodle house in philadlephia was better than the two popular ones I tried.  I was shocked.  Beef noodle soup better in philadelphia than in taipei?  NO FREAKIN WAY. Yes Way. If you want to know specific reasons to go, just look at any one of the many reviews on here.  All I know is, when I have beef noodle soup in the future, I will compare it to the best I've had- right here in philadelphia.  I loved the food I had in taiwan, but the beef noodle soup was better here in philadelphia =)
