My friends and I decided to visit here for dinner. I've called just the morning of going to make a reservation and the staff was very nice in helping me over the phone in accommodating everyone. I had originally made a reservation for 5 people and yet we ended up having 7 people, However, the restaurant quickly figure out a way to accommodate all of us even on a busy Friday night. It was crowded in the restaurant. Busy= good food :) The staff was also very very nice. we tried a little of everything family style and there isnt anything that we tried that we didn't like.
