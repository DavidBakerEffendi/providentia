SETUP: 10-day vacation in New York May 2011. CAST: Three die-hard foodies. RANK: 1ST!!! IF YOU READ A REVIEW - READ THIS ONE. Fantastic. Why? 1. Small, intimate 2. Locally owned 3. Service that garners a 20% tip. 4. BYOB - NO corking fee, and 5. FRENCH CUISINE Nothing short of perfection. THe owner is a local guy who loves food. Loves cooking. And he spreads that to his staff and - HIS FOOD. Now, real fast: THIS IS IMPORTANT - - **BYOB** Â WINE. VODKA (and tonic). Whatever you please, because they do not serve alochol. One reviewer criticized La Sirene for this reason, but if you know this ahead of time, THIS ROCKS - because you get to bring your poison, and there's no corking fee. (It would be a drag if you weren't aware walking in at dinner time). AND... BRING CASH. They don't like credit cards. This keeps the prices down. WE have this deal between us when we eat. We almost always order different plates, and there's almost always a great dish and a less than grat dish. Someone get's jipped. But not tonight - all three dishes were stellar! I had the duck floating in a bowl of fava beans (sp?), various other veggies. Thick warm yummy. If you don't like duck - this duck will change your mind. My son had the sirloin and my wife had the pork tenderloin. Now - don't go there looking for these, because the menu changes - possibly weekly or daily. This is a local, passionate chef who is far more talented than many know. RUN (with your booze) TO THIS PLACE.
