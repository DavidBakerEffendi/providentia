Came here with a gift card from restaurant.com, and it worked perfectly.  Great atmosphere, playful (e.g. crayons to draw on the table with) yet also mature (with the bars and candles and such).  The menu isn't too inventive, but it is just solid pub food.  I had a great burger (that came with a jar of delicious poupon mustard), fries, and split a bottle of wine with two friends.  My friend said her chicken salad wasn't great, mainly cause the cut of the chicken wasn't very good.  My other friend really enjoyed his turkey burger with bacon, cheese, and mushrooms.  For 3 entrees and a bottle of wine it came out to about $100, but with the coupon it was knocked down to $75 (since the r.c coupons make you give 18% gratuity).  The waitress was great-down to earth and unobtrusive.  Great, casual place that feels a lot grungier than it really is.
