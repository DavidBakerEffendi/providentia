Went to this place for brunch.  The only thing that I really liked was the fact that there was no wait and that they took reservations for brunch. But there's a reason why there's no wait for this place for brunch. I got the breakfast burrito.  It was pretty good.  But it didn't taste any different from a Chipotle burrito with egg.  Except that it was smaller and twice as expensive. My wife got the crab cake eggs benedict.  I thought that the hollandaise sauce was good.  But the rest was not.  She said that the crab cakes were the worst crab cakes she's ever had.  I would have to agree.  I don't know why people like them - it was mostly breadcrumbs. As for service, it's hard to tell because I think our server was new.  We got pretty horrible service, had to wait for lots of things, never got the coffee refilled, got the bill wrong the first time, etc.  But I think she was new - she was so clueless.  So I don't want to fault the restaurant for that.  But then again, I probably should. Two stars.  I'll never go back.
