When we were in Philly, my husband and I were looking for yummy place to eat. Rangoon came up during our Yelp search, having never had Burmese food before, we decided to give it a try. Our food was delicious! We had the thousand layer bread with chicken sauce, Shan noodle and a beef curry dish. Best meal in Philly so far :)
