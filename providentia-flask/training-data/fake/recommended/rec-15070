They have ginger ale water ice. Enough said. Ok, I'll say more. This ice is so good and there's even chunk of frickin' fruit in it! Not bullshit fruit either, REAL FRUIT! I can't even hope to fully explain how good this stuff is. Just go. Get a large BTW because if you don't you'll regret not having more.
