Let us begin by saying that the food is very good. We order the Ocean City wrap all the time & it is delicious! However, today's experience amongst other encounters with the customer service was pitiful. We placed our order in person at 8:31 & were promptly told by the female cashier that this order would have to be take out because they close at 9:00 sharp. As small business owners we feel that this is an unacceptable practice. We received our order from the kitchen at 8:38 & had ample time to sit & finish our wraps before 9:00. However, we had to take it home and eat it cold. As small business owners, if our doors are open until 9 that means the doors get locked at 9 & whoever is still seated stays & the clean up begins when they are done. It's not like a 3 course meal is being served here. After all, this is better quality fast food restaurant. We feel they have a lot to learn as far as customer appreciation is concerned.
