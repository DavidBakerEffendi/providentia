Let me start of by saying I went to Clinton street right before my flight out of New York. I had 2 hours before I had to be at the airport for my flight. As we walked in, we were told there was a 2 hour wait for 3 of us. This was around 11AM on a Thursday. For one person however there was a 30 minute wait.  My friends were so adamant about my trying the blueberry pancakes the told me to eat there by myself. So, they left and I waited. As a side note I visited Prohibition Bakery across the street within that period and had a few mini cupcakes. It was definitely worth it as an appetizer to make time go quicker. Back to Clinton Street. I promptly ordered the Blueberry pancakes.  I was skeptical about how "earth shattering" these pancakes claimed to be. After all, how amazing could they be? They are pancakes. I was pleasantly surprised. Blueberry compote and powdered sugar adorned the pancakes. They were by far the best pancakes I have ever had. But by no means "earth shattering." The game changer was the maple butter that was provided on the side. AMAZING!!! It was a silky mixture of butter maple syrup that must have crack in it as it is amazingly addictive... I would absolutely go back to Clinton Street. Unfortunately, since it is such a small location, the more people you take, the longer you will wait. I would say it is absolutely a place to even go alone.
