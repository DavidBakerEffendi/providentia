After living in Hawaii for about a year and a half with its high cost of living I've become accustomed to the ridiculously priced items and the expensive dinner bills...And I expected the same when stepping foot into one of the biggest cities in the world. So when I opened up the menu and saw the prices for the appetizers/entrees I was shocked. Not only that but the decor (chandeliers, hostess/bartenders - dressed to kill) of the restaurant would immediately lead you to believe that the prices would be high. I paid $4 for 6 large pieces of sesame crusted tofu. 4 BUCKS! Served with a sweet dipping sauce. Although they weren't fried they were big so after 3 I had to move it to the side so I wouldn't get full. We both ordered a mojito, I got the pomegranate while my girlfriend got the guava. Both were good, not overly sweet. They have a wide range of flavors too! When looking at the reviews the pad thai in an egg omelete seemed popular so I assumed that when ordering the pad thai with chicken, that is what I would be getting. Whoops! I should have read the menu more closely. There are two pad thais, and the one with the egg omelete is the Room Service one. Just an FYI. Â  I was happy with my Pad thai though. The noodles were a little thinner than what I was used to and the sauce wasn't overly sweet. It was tossed with bean sprouts, eggs, and onions and at $9 it was a good value. I even brought my leftovers home. Oct31Challenge:31/31
