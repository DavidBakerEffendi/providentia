When I go out for sushi, I tend to have to make do with an avocado roll and leave it at that. I couldn't believe my eyes when I sat down at Fat Salmon and saw EIGHT different veggie rolls on the menu. Are you kidding me, is this real life?! And then my jaw hit the floor when I saw six kinds of vegetarian nigiri. Have I died and gone to the big veg sushi bar in the sky? It took all my will power not to order everything, so I settled on two rolls: shiitake and midori. They were kind of skimpy and not total flavor bombs, but they filled me up and were way better than some standard veggie rolls I've had in the past. I was impressed when they brought out a bottle of tamari for another customer, very cool. The place is pretty trendy, great if you want to break out your cute heels and not feel over done, but perhaps a little much for the casual afternoon sector. The service was slow but pleasant - it took us close to an hour for lunch, but we weren't in a hurry. I will definitely be back to try every single roll and nigiri! I feel spoiled silly by all the options and can't wait to dive face first in it all.
