I'm as picky as can be when critiquing Mexican food... I couldn't say anything negative about Fonda! The hibiscus and cucumber margaritas were killer, as was the esquites (corn side dish). The guacamole was very fresh and made excellent. And FINALLY, a place that serves guac with fresh warm tortillas AND chips AND extra chipotle spicy hot sauce on the side, for those that endure extra kick! The mole enchiladas were superb; presentation, taste, authenticity and portion!  To our delight, I didn't even see that beans and rice came with the entrees. Being Mexican, everything could have been a little more spicy, but very tasty for all you gringos. My girl had the chile rellenos, muy bien!!  She doesn't really like beans too much, but loved the refried black beans! We sat at the bar and service was quick and the food was served prompt and accurate. On a side note, I've learned from Yelp that anyone who mentions something about a bathroom before the food in their review is an ass and one shouldn't read past there, as it's probably someone lonely loser who thinks by posting about a toilet makes them a great critic on restaurants. This site isn't about bathroom reviews, and if you mention a bathroom in a food review, just like the bathroom, there's just a lot of crap in there (your mouth). Lastly, the only thing I could recommend is a better name than Fonda (spanish for small restaurant), as it's quite roomy with tables all the way to the back. This Mexican approves this message and restaurant! I can't wait to go back and try some of the other things on the menu...
