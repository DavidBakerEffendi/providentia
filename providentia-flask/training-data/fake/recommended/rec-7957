We were a group of seven and the food was absolutely delicious all around. So, why the three stars?  Well, when we arrived at 11:30 a.m., the service was terrific.  We were warmly greeted and the hostess quickly added a seventh seat to the table we had reserved for six.  Our waiter was very friendly, delivered our beverages and made suggestions about what dishes he particularly enjoys. Somehow (and, really, I am not hallucinating because I checked back), I got an old menu that listed a different set of ingredients for a salad that they still offer with the same name but a different set of ingredients.  Of course, that happened to be the salad I ordered.  When I brought this to the waiter's attention after the first few bites, he was apologetic and offered to bring me a different salad.  I said it wouldn't be worth the time and effort since the salad I got was pretty good and I didn't want to hold up my dining companions.  I suggested a free dessert instead to which the waiter readily assented. When I went out to check the stack of menus again, I was intercepted by the manager who engaged me in conversation about the problem.  To say he was officious is an understatement.  He argued with me and said it was his "operational" decision whether to replace the salad or provide a free dessert.  And here I was thinking I'd saved the waiter and the restaurant aggravation and expense.  Oh well, I guess no good deed goes unpunished. After the main courses were delivered, the waiter got another large party and it was very difficult to get attentive service.  And, I must admit, that the manager's remarks really ticked me off. So, while the food was fabulous, the overall meal (for me at least) ended up leaving a metaphorical bad taste in my mouth.
