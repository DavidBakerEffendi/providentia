If you love crispy, Belgian fries, then this is the place to be! They fry them on the spot so every batch is nice and hot. Every fry is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The selling point is definitely their sauces because there are so many options. I've tried the mango chutney and parmesan peppercorn and the classic cheddar cheese (can't go wrong with cheese fries). The mango chutney is UH-mazeballs and worth a try and you don't know what else to pick and like that sweet tangy flavor. The Parmesan peppercorn is also pretty good. The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because the store is so small. If you go during lunch hour you probably won't get a seat because they're usually all taken and can be pretty inconvenient to eat them on the go. However, this is definitely my go to spot for fries when I'm in the area and can't wait to try more of their amazing sauces!
