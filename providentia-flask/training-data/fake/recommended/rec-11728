I lived in Bushwick a few years back, and I frequently visited and ordered delivery from Life. I heard about the changeover from friends and we tried it a few nights ago. I tried the three sides, garlic mashed, sauteed corn and steamed veggies. The mashed potatoes were to die for and the corn was different and delicious. I wished I had chosen a different 3rd option as the veggies were too bland for my taste. I also tried the buffalo chicken sandwich with a side salad. The chicken was a little dry - I wanted more sauce. The dressing on the house salad was very good. I really enjoyed my experience as a guest - great and speedy service, and I love the renovations. I'd definitely come in just for a drink as the bar staff was super chill. People coming in looking for some old favorites from the Life menu might be disappointed, but I think there are more than enough new choices to make this place a new neighborhood fave.
