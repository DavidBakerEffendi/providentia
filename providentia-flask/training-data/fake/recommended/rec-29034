For me restaurants are about service and food. Gusto does an amazing job on both. The waitress that is usually there is great. Â She always has a sunny disposition and brings water out for our dog, when we sit outside. The pizza is very tasty and my friends highly recommend their salads. If you want a relaxed, tasty experience, visit Gusto.
