This place is definitely authentic Italian! They had cookies, olive oils and drinks that are only found in Italian places such as this one. The staff is incredibly friendly and quick! The place was busy which is also a good sign. My husband and I ordered sandwiches which were delicious. They serve Boar's Head deli meat which is our favorite. All meat and cheese tasted fresh! We would definitely recommend trying them out. The only down side would be lack of parking.
