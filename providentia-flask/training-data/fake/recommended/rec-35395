I've been here plenty of times. It's a good place that delivers, you're reliable American food restaurant in mid town. In fact, this is where I go when my Euro friends are in town and I need to prove to them all restaurants are not greasy fast food joints and that American cuisine is quite good. The only negative thing I can think of is that, normally, the wait can be long. However, in every situation we've had good wine while we wait. I love their burgers and their salads are also notable.
