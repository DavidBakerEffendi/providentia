Typical sports bar food, I was not impressed. However, Â that crab cake burger almost made me punch my boyfriend in the throat. DAMN! Who knew something so simple could insight violence?! He ordered it, I didn't but I had a bite of his and I didn't want to give it back. I was mad as hell. I'll come back just for that.
