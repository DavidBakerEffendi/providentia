I love Char No. 4 so I decided to visit Maysville as well. Arrived at around 7 on a Friday and was told the next table was at 9... ok. Can I just wait at the bar for a cancellation? Sure, the hostess told me. Worst case I'd have a drink with my friend and leave. Lo and behold, 10 minutes later we were seated. My drink was transfered from the bar and we were well on our way. I had my usual at Char, a Noreaster, and my friend had an excellent Spicy Buck. The waitress was nice, checked on us when needed and gave us space when we were eating. We had a Beef Tartare for the table, then I had the Duck Breast with shaved foie and my friend had the Arctic Char. Both were excellent and perfectly cooked. I like a slight bit more fat on my duck, but they worked with the ingredients really well and every bite was a pleasure. For dessert we had this like... apple ice thing? It was 7 dollars. It was pretty good. Really deconstructed though. The reason this isn't 5 stars - it's a little pricey for what you get and there were some Olsen twin like people at a table near us who were making me insane. One guy in a suit, another in a Def Leppard T-Shirt and two extremely thin girls with the loudest, most nasally voices you'd ever heard. It was like an SNL parody of an annoying girl. Hearing them made me lose my appetite.
