What's not to love about the Ice House? This is a chill place with super friendly staff, a loyal local crowd, a good selection of beers, cheap (tasty) food, and a great backyard. My liver doesn't love the amount of time I spend here, but I do enjoy spicy Tecates, pulled pork sandwiches, sweet potato fries and most of all: sitting out back on a warm evening. The only downsides are that they are cash only (but have an ATM and put up with me paying in quarters when I'm broke) and that they only have basic cable so limited NFL games on fall Sundays... Otherwise, Ice House is A+++++
