Best vegan chicken sandwich ever. Get the chicken cheesesteak. It is greasy and gross but super awesome. It is on South Street, which is a cool area of Philly. The restaurant has sitting room, but can get very sweaty and yucky during the summer. They have vegan desserts too, which is cool, though I didn't have any.
