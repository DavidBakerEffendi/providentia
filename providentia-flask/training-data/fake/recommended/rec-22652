Came here for their Trivia Night last night and I am definitely going to come back (whether it is for trivia or just hanging out). I didn't know what kind of beer I wanted and the server was really nice and asked what I was in the mood for and gave me a great suggestion (Sixpoint Apollo). Their menu looked great and I ended up getting The Hot Mess, their most expensive item ($11.00), which was Sweet Potato Tots and Waffle Fries smothered in chili, cheese, diced tomatoes, banana peppers, jalapenos, onions, and sour cream. It was delightful! The atmosphere was great too! Even though it was summer, it was kind of chilly outside in the garden and they were willing to turn on their heating lamps.
