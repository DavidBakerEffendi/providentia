We don't go to NYC often anymore, so when we do, we look for a good place to eat. Based on what I read about Hu Kitchen, this was our choice for lunch today. It was a HUge mistake. And not an inexpensive one. I had what was reviewed as this amazing vegan lasagna - the Grandmaster Veg - that was supposed to have eggplant, carrot, green cabbage, cashew, marinara, garlic and chili flake. What I had was a lasagna look alike thing that had a ton of shredded carrots, onions, what I suspect was a vegan cashew cheese substitute, some traces of marinara, and whatever made up the dark tasteless topping. I had some curried cauliflower on the side which was tasty but cold. My wife and son both had rotisserie chicken that was no different than what we can make at home with a side of mixed veggies that were simply sauteed mixed veggies. Both bland and everyday. A huge place where you order like a cafeteria and hope to find a seat because the place is packed. Mostly younger professionals who get upset and roll their eyes when you ask them to move their large, expensive leather bags so you can sit down and then proceed to occasionally glance at you, roll their eyes, and move their bag closer to them while you eat. (O.K., that's pretty much descriptive of most places in NY now.) The staff were neither friendly nor unfriendly. They just put the stuff on the plate. Its impossible to really get any questions about the product answered since they're in a rush to serve the next person like any cafeteria. Oh, well. Live and learn. There are probably 15 other vegetarian / vegan places in the same neighborhood. They don't have to worry.
