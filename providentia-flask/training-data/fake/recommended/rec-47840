Went to Plan b, in Milford, CT, and was extremely disappointed. Waited over an hour to be seated, to then eat the nastiest burger I've ever had in my life. Â In addition, having it accompanied by mediocre onion rings that tasted like they came from burger king. Save yourself the wait and money and go to Prime 16 in New Haven.
