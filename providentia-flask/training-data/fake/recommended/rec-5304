Went to BurgerFi around 12:30 on a Friday. The restaurant had a solid crowd but it was not overcrowded. This was my first time there so I ordered the BurgerFi cheeseburger(just a regular cheeseburger with L, T, and house sauce) & fries. It was a solid burger, better than average, but not the greatest burger ever. Sauce was pretty good with some bold flavors and better than having the typical ketchup on it, so I would definitely recommend getting that. I received a hefty portion of fresh cut and golden brown fries so no complaints with that item. I would say the burger and fries are comparable to Five Guys. I haven't been to the other burger chains like Elevation Burgers, Shake Shack, etc so I don't know how it compares those places. The service was fast. They gave us a buzzer for when our food was done. We waited about 5-10 minutes for 2 cheeseburgers and 2 fries. The tables were clean &, the cashier was super friendly. The burger, fries, and small soft drink came to about $13 which is average for a meal in center city if you go to some of the other food outlets or terminal. Overall it was a good experience and I would definitely visit again based on the taste, price/portion and service.
