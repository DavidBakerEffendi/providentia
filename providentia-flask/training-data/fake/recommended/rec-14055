Sophisticated Southern now in an airy corner loc.  We were sat in a 4 top corner and needed the table for the feast that ensued.  Friendly, attentive folks are servers here and it was a fun and delicious dining experience. Ate: Biscuits- $4 Mac and cheese with bacon(of course) $9 Meatloaf sandwich with housemade pickle and housemade chips $10 Smoked trout with okra and pickled onion rings- $14(I thinkk) Friend drank a Pims cup.........Southern drink she said. Biscuits were amazing, crispy at the edges- biscuit perfection really,  Mac and cheese with the pork was tasty- could have had a more cheesy top and more darkly baked for Franny's taste.  Trout was yummy, pickled onion rings were insane.  Best of the savory dishes is the meatloaf which is pork, veal and beef wrapped in bacon with a spicy chipotle slaw on pullman bread. plus spiced chips. Doggie bags to take home after all this food- food coma came next............
