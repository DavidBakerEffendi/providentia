Ok, so maybe I spoke too soon.  My first visit was during beer week and my experience was only at the bar that night.  I have since returned to CTH at the behest of the Bar Manager, Andy, who actually reads these reviews and cares what customers have to say.  I must admit, I was impressed with dinner and will definitely return with friends.   I shared an appetizer of Shrimp and Grits with my husband.  It was a delicious blend of shrimp, ham, hominy grits & cheese.  Then I had the Friday night special, sea bass with asparagus and a quinoa salad.  The fish was perfectly cooked, flaky and tender.  The sauce that accompanied the dish was fabulous, although I wish there had been a little more on my plate!  My husband had the ribs, which were obviously nicely smoked and fell off the bone.  His dish came with cole slaw and fries, both very flavorful. Most importantly, the beer list at CTH is impressive and diverse.  For a beer snob like myself, it's heaven.  They even have a tasting notes system where you can write up which beers you had and what you thought of them so the next time you come in you can ask the server for your drink history. I highly recommend CTH to serious beer fans and curious beer novices alike.  The food is a perfect compliment to the beers and the ambiance is clean, warm, and inviting.
