The owners of this restaurant are horrific people who mistreat their patrons. I have had several encounters with them where they have been completely disrespectful and their behavior has been intolerable. The food is mediocre at best and the sanitation is questionable. The quaint beautiful neighborhood of Soho deserves a better restaurant where the owners don't accost the members of the neighborhood who live close by. I can only hope that they get shut down and that the space is replaced with a Â restaurant that the neighborhood enjoys.
