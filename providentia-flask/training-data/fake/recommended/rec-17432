I came here on a Saturday and if the food wasn't anything short of excellent I would have given it 2-stars. The food was amazing, couldnt get enough of it. Its a BYOB restaurant so great news that a wine outlet was a few stores down to mix with their signature sangira. They have an extensive sangria menu which is awesome, feel free to bring whatever kind of liquor and you are guaranteed to have a great mixer with it. BUT the crowd and noise here was unbearable. There is not a high turnover with tables because the atmosphere does make you want to sit back and enjoy. But unfortunately I did not enjoy myself on Â Saturday night dinner. You can probably get the biggest bang for your buck coming here on a weekday or for lunch. It was just TOO crowded and TOO loud for me to enjoy my time with friends and family.
