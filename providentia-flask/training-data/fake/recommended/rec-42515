We have lived in manhattan since 1977 and have been to our fair share of restaurants, the good, the bad and the ugly. This dining experience was one of the all time, 30 year plus, WORST meals we have ever eaten in a restaurant..and it ain't cheap! The noise level is deffening, it is boiling hot and crowded. the service was amateurish and inexperienced. The wait for food abysmal. The menu uninteresting. The food..absolutely inedible. Crab louis salad could have been prepared in a korean deli for 1/3 of the price. The scallops were an over cooked, over caper salted mess. Inedible. The hangar steak was an embarrassment For dessert..a grilled donut, who would ever think of such a thing or a sundae with pretzels..what is this a four year olds birthday party. Just an awful place, stay clear..idiotic help to boot. Disgusting..stay clear
