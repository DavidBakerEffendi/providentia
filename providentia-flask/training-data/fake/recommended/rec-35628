After reading the awesome Yelp reviews and passing by this little hole-in-the-wall joint multiple times, we finally made our long-anticipated inaugural visit to Mama's today.  We got the combo platter (which is listed on the online menu, but isn't an obvious option inside the restaurant) and a side of grape leaves, allowing us to try most of what they offer for under $12.  We tried to add a boreka, but sadly they were out. Everything we had was great -- well-seasoned and hearty -- and the portions are plentiful.  Although most of the entree items are fried, they are not greasy or over-salted.  A standout was the latke, which is pleasantly dense and full of flavor. That being said, it was the hummus and pickles that really make Mama's memorable.  The thick and creamy hummus is lightly seasoned and comes topped with tahini, olive oil, and some awesome house-made hot sauce.  We ended up getting an extra order to go.  Don't pass up the pickle bar, especially the pickled carrots, which are cooked through and infused with a subtle cinnamony-cuminy spice blend. Can't wait to go back and try a boreka!
