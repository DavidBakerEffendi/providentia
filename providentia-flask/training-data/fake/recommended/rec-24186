this place is great and definitely worth the wait! i got the steak and eggs - so good! you can tell a dish is perfect when it doesn't need any salt or pepper. the red velvet pancakes were a must try for my first time. luckily, you can order the kid's size! great portion to share in addition to an individual meal. the latte was just lovely. atmosphere is eclectic and modern. staff was super friendly and work their butts off to keep the place efficient. i cannot wait to return!
