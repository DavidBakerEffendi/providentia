Jim Leff, founder of Chowhound, tipped me off on this place when they first opened, so naturally I gave them a try. Many times. This had to be over ten years ago, and I tried all the sauces--although they didn't have nearly as many then as they do now--and yeah: they had good, reliable fries. I eventually weaned myself off them; fortunately they're not right next door. I got them again tonight, and I have to say Ray's on Avenue A are usually about as good and they give you about twice as much. I still had to share these, and fortunately they travel well. (I've never eaten in at the shop.) Because they have so few vegan sauces, I didn't bother; I like to mix Vegenaise and a drop of Mamoun's blistering hot sauce at home.
