I wish I could give 4 1/2 stars. The blueberry pancakes were amazing.  To be more specific, the texture of the pancakes were spot on.  Slightly crispy on the outside but soft and warm on the inside.   I shared my blueberry pancakes with my friend and she got the salmon eggs benedict.  We both enjoyed the smoked salmon eggs benedict from Clinton St better than from Norma's at Le Meridian. Service was average and the wait was not as bad as I expected.  When we first arrived there were many people waiting outside.  They take down your cell phone number and text you when your table is ready.  As long as you're back within 5 minutes you're good.  Luckily, there's a coffee shop just one block down so we were able to grab some coffee and kill time there.
