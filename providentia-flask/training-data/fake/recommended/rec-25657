From the big windows and comforting decor, to the meal filled with perfect dishes like calamari with guacamole and chili crema, a unique take on falafel, and a spectacular brussels sprout side dish with pecan, pears, and bacon, Market Table brings its A game, and guarantees a fantastic West Village lunch. Working by the Empire State Building all but guarantees a terrible lunch outing.  Until you realize that the B and D trains get you to the West Village in under ten minutes.  Then your world opens up. Market Table was high end lunch perfection, with interesting and fresh plates that will have you giggling with joy over the knowledge that you escaped food hell, even if just for a bit.
