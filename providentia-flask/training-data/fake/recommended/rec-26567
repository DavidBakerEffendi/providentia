I came here on a rainy day for couple of drinks witha friend. Nothing out of the ordinary. The bartender made me a drink with Jack Daniel's Honey which was a nice touch. Â The place was not busy at all (I'm guessing cus it was cold and raining.LOL). Nice little dive bar. Definitely going here again. Came here to have a drink and a chat with a friend. Nothing special. It served its purpose.
