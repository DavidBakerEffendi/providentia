We decided to try this place despite seeing some negative reviews. Â The menu choices were definitely not what I'm used to for Thai food. We shared the Noodies Duck Curry with rice. It was quite good. The only problem was the duck was over cooked for my taste. The other dish was Kea Mao spicy stir fried noodles. It was very good. We also had the Jasmine iced tea and Lychee Thai tea. I enjoyed the lychee tea. Two in our dining party thought the Noodies Duck Curry came with noodles, not rice. They asked the waitress about this and they happily replaced the rice bowls with noodles. We also had a large party of 8 and asked for separate checks. They were hesitant at first but they accommodated us after some discussion. Overall a positive experience.
