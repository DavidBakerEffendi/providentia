I'm giving this place 5 stars because it's an excellent value.  Great Italian comfort food.  The service during our experience was fun, friendly, fast and great all around.   I've seen multiple people comment on the pasta being undercooked.  Of course we all know what al dente means, and this place serves it on the firmer end of that definition.  Which I personally prefer but some people may not.  The linguine grotta bianca I had last night was excellent.  It would get high praise if served at a fancier more expensive restaurant. There's definitely a charming, romantic quality about this place, at least in the evening.  I really enjoyed it.  And it was so inexpensive.
