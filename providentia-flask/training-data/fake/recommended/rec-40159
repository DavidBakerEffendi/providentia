Wow! I have walked past this place so many times since it is right around the corner from my apt. I finally decided to check it out after my friends were raving about it. They were right about this place! Everything was so delicious! I have never had so sushi so fresh in my life. The tuna sashimi does melt in your mouth. We also had the Locust Roll (the perfect mix of flavors and crunchiness). The M & M with marinated beef was also different and fantastic. Service was great and the BYO part is another plus. We have gone back 3 times now and can't wait to take all of our friends there so that they can enjoy sushi done right!
