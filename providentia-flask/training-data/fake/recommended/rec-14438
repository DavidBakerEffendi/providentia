Amazing value. $6, I waited 3 minutes to order and 2 to get my food, so fast. The white sauce on chicken and rice was amazing, much better than chipotle. And the best part, no bad after effects! Not an hour later and not the next day. Definitely going back when I'm drunk, seems to be a trend among yelpers.
