Fat Buddha is a super cool spot with friendly staff.  I'm hooked on the Dragon Wings and Soy Buns!  The food here is delicious and reasonably priced. If you're looking for a fun night out, absolutely stop by. The Dj's are always rocking the best music and no doubt you will end up on the dance floor. Can't wait to go back.
