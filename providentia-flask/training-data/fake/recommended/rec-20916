A novelty hotdog joint where we tried Texas Hold'em, Big Kahuna, and the soup of the day -squash or pumpkin-. Great dogs, although not big enough, as it was gone before I knew it, and the soup was very uninteresting, as if it could have been poured out of a Campbell's tin and microwaved. Would gladly try other things.
