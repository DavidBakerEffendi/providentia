I came here with my boyfriend for Restaurant Week last night (prix fixe $35).  We got 4 apps to share.... lamb meatballs, mousakka, tuna belly, and the Maine shrimp all of which were excellent.  The lamb meatballs were in a wonderfully paired sauce that was easily the winner as our favorite app of the night.  The moussaka was just like every other place you've ordered it at, with the tuna belly and shrimp being great! For entrees we got the lamb leg and trout.  He and I are big on sharing so these were a great contrast.  The meat was extremely tender on the lamb and virtually melted in our mouths.  The trout came with a light lemon sauce and minced olives which was great, but not quite as impressive as the lamb.  For dessert we got the candy bar and the ashta.  The candy bar is both tiny and excellent.  Despite it's tiny size, you must share it because of how rich it is.  Wonderful, but rich.  The ashta was perfect to balance the candy bar because it's light and citrusy.  I would highly recommend both. We shared a bottle of $40 Lebanese wine (the cheapest on the menu) which was smooth and worked well with our meal.  The served samples of the Fresh Meadow, which we didn't order, but I would if I came back.   Ambiance is fine, but nothing shocking.  Service was great.  Very attentive and helpful.  This place is DEFINITELY worth coming for Restaurant Week.  You get more then enough food, all of which will be great.  The prices may be a tad high (at least for me) for a regular night out.  But while the special is going on, I'd definitely recommend using this as your opportunity to give it a try.  We both left full and thrilled with our meal!
