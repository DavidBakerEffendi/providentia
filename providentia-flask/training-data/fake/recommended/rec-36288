was in NYC with BFFs in April and Balthazar was recommended for lunch by a BFF's local sister-in-law.  Had the Friday Plat du Jour of Bouillbaisse and it was pretty fantastic.  Loads of seafood and even a lobster claw peeking out of the tasty broth.   Aside from the food, two things bothered me - the snooty matre de and the African American attendant in the ladies bathroom handing out paper hand towels....Really?
