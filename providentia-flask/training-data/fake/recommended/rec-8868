OK, what the hell? I knew this place was going to be good, obviously from all the suggestions from my NY friends and yelp reviews, but I honestly thought the Halal cart was just a good place after a drunken night. No.. this place wasn't good, it was addictingly good. I kept explaining to my BF what halal was bc he's never had it and he was actually a little apprehensive about trying the cart.  When we arrived on a cold night, thankfully we came a little bit on the earlier side (around 11pm) and there wasn't a line.  We ordered the mix rice...holy crap it should be illegal to sell this stuff on a corner of the street. We DEMOLISHED that plate.  Our mistake was ordering only one for 2 people.  I had to go back in line to get another. Every bite was so effing good.  I really wish we had a halal cart in LA. Everything was so good together.  The rice, lettuce, meat..and the sauce!!! Mix it up with some red sauce and white..UGH SO GOOD! We literally just had dinner not too long before we came to the Halal cart, and surprisingly enough all of a sudden I had room to eat a whole plate and then some. LOL it's just too good.  Seriously a must eat in NY! Can't wait to go back!!
