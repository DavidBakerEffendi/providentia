Can we say yummy in my tummy. Everything on the menu is delicious just make sure you come in on an empty stomach everything is huge! By far my favorite place to eat for the past ten years. Desert is a must too even if your going to take it home. Some of the waiters need an attitude adjustment at times but the owners are always nice and welcoming kind of guys.
