This time around, I got the carne asada nachos, and hoped it wasn't as salty as the al pastor nachos... Not only did I wait around 30 minutes, but I couldn't even finish the nachos. Chips tasted stale and had a strange after taste, and there was very little meat. Overall, the nachos lacked flavor and was bland, disappointing, and underwhelming. 2.5 stars for the carne asada nachos.
