I came here visiting from out of town and was pretty underwhelmed. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but everyone was raving about how good this place was. I had the margarita and pepperoni pizzas. Both were great, no doubt. However its not the best wood fired pizza I've had. Theres actually one in tiny cedar city utah (of all places) that holds the record for best pizza ever. Its incredible. I love pizza though so I won't say I was regretful to eat here. It was good food.
