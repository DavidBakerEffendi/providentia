I'm a fan. I wasn't around for the glory days of the legendary diner, so I can't speak to whether this iteration has lost the plot, as a couple previous reviews suggest. I will say this though, I came here fully expecting to leave in a self-loathing, must-get-to-the-gym-immediately fatty food hangover state. Nothing of the kind happened. I realize the menus change all the time, but my lunch was refreshing, subtle, delicate, and nothing like the foie-and-marrow-saturated gorge-fest that put the original diner on the map. On the server's suggestion I went for simple crab claws and then something called the "gravlax box" which was a nordic salt-cured salmon dish fused with Japanese-style rice, all exquisitely presented. I don't really care that there weren't 3,000 calories on the plate, this was a brilliantly simple execution with unexpectedly complex flavors. Maybe terrine-foie-marrow-etc. will be this place's calling card, but based on what I had I'd trust them with anything, even if it sounds boring or pedestrian. If nothing else, Dinette earns the coveted twin titles of "best food I've ever had in a classroom" and "best museum cafeteria".
