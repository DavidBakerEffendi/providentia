how else can you get a pound of food with meat, bread, dairy and vegetables all for the low low price of $6 which is completely unheard of in new york???  Chicken and rice is da bomb! actually it does feel like a bomb in your gut but it's nice to have a meal that actually makes you feel full unlike all these restaurants trying to serve food in ounces instead of pounds.  And the fact that you no longer have to wait because they've branched into multiple other carts (just look for the guys with the yellow shirts) and you can have it day or night.  If you have to hit a cart in the city, this is the one to hit.
