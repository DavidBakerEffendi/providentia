I had this place on my radar for a while before we got a chance to try. It's a nice barn that was turned into a pizza place with a huge pizza oven in view. We went for their vegan pizza, especially since they have house made cashew ricotta. You can get a slice with daiya almost anywhere in BK but frankly, I'd rather pass. After looking at the menu, most of the pizzas had very little on them but had extravagant descriptions to make them sound fancier. Like, don't list olive oil as a topping. I figured we might as well get the pizza with cashew cheese, since that was why we had come, but it cost $18. That's too much for an individual sized pizza. Really. It had the cheese in dollops and has homemade vegan sausage with sauce and arugula. We could definitely have made that at home. Really disappointed with what we got for how much we paid. WTF is up with these vegan restaurants in BK getting way too big for their britches. Not that they are an exclusively vegan place, but hey, that's even worse for their prices. I guess vegans weren't meant to have pizza after all...
