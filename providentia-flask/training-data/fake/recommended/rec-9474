HmMnM.. Just freaking delicious. So impressed! I've been meaning to check out SoCo because of their signature red velvet & chicken waffle. I've been stalking all the pictures yelpers have been posting on their yelp page because it was such a fun and interesting concept. Let me just tell you... all the done-up lighting, artistic angled, filtered up pictures of the food I've come across doesn't nearly justify how amazing it tastes. Hm. Just hmmmmmm... SO. We arrived around 3:00PM on a Saturday and this place was PACKED.  SoCo is very spacious which I appreciate. Pretty decent bar space for past time and no unnecessary squeezing and hovering of strangers over you as you're waiting to be seated. Very casual setting. Basketball game on TV.  Instense crowd getting really into the game cheering and screaming but it was so fitting with the theme of the restaurant. My big brother and I were so eager to try everything that we ordered 5 things off their menu LOL. Appetizers 1.  Cornbread. - GET ON THAT. Free with yelp check-in. The warm corn bread topped with mildly sweet butter was Hmpppp. On point. 2. BBQ chicken Gumbo - really good 3. F-Qued wings - really good Entrés 4. Aunt Cruz's Mac and Cheese - Mac and Cheese served on a skillet - explosive cheese flavor, by far the best mac and cheese I've ever had. That topped with Sriracha sauce that they gave us was just HMMMP 5. Buttermilk Fried Chicken - redvelvet waffle topped with friend chicken.  I would have settled for my expectations of a semi-dry and mediocre tasting waffle like it looked in pictures but it was NOICCEE. It was sweet enough to do without the syrup. The fried chicken had such a uniqueee flavor. It's not your typical fried chicken flavor! So meaty, tender and moist, and served at perfect temperature. Perfection.
