A high-end Lebanese restaurant. You walk in and ahead of you is an attractive bar and lounge area, to your left is a large dining room. The decor is pretty, but neutral enough for either a fancy date or a business meeting. Came here for a work dinner with several people so we had our server bring an assortment of appetizers, entrees, a little of everything. One of the standouts for me was the Lebanese wine selection. At one point during the meal I was fearful that our dinner organizer (a passionate wine aficionado) was going wine crazy. The glass I was sipping was so excellent I was certain we were downing something very expensive, but to my surprise it was a very reasonable $60 bottle. The Lebanese wine industry needs to get the word out about their excellent product! Service was great and helped us flawlessly with all our complicated needs.
