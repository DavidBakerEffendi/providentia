After a very long day and brutally cold night my brooklyn buddies suggested Gueros for margaritas & tacos. They swore by the chips & queso & the awesomely sized margaritas. I had a fried avocado taco which were amazing. Tasty, creamy and built like a perfect taco. The chips and guacamole were awesome too, guac could use some more spice but I still ate the entire portion by myself (obviously I love avocados). The fried shrimp tacos wasn't my fave over the fried avocado one. Kind of wished I got the catfish instead like my friend who raved after every bite she took of hers. Margaritas were tasty but I went for a nice shot of Don Julio to warm me up. We stayed for a good hr after we ate just talking & catching up. Great little spot, especially if you're local. Which unfortunately I am not.
