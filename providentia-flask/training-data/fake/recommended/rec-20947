Tried this truck at the Meadowlands Food Truck Mash Up. Although there were only 2 things left on the menu you out of the 5 or 6, one of the options was what I wanted anyway. The Shrimp Po' Boy had a soft warm baguette with lightly crisp shrimp. Crisp pickles and lettuce with a nice mayo that had a light kick to it. The service was nothing memorable but at 11pm and the Fest had been going on since 5, I couldn't blame them for just wanting to focus on getting orders out. Overall I had no complaints. Would have loved to try the Jambalaya but they were sold out :-( Â  Doubt their in my area but hey, maybe we'll meet again.
