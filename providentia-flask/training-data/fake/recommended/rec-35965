Delicious! We went there via the advice of Sakina (GM/hotel) and she praised this place...excellent food and service. We had a great time and the fish was devine. I would recommend everyone to go there and if you need a hotel contact her. rooms4unyc@gmail.com Â you will be thrilled. We had a group here from aussie and uk and tried all the places she recommended. Becco was super and the manager Jim was so sweet. Thank you Jim. See you all again soon in NY. shhhhh we don't want this place to be tooo popular!
