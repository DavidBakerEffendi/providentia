MMMMMM, tried this place for the first time and I loved it! What most people say about their Belgian fries tasting like normal fries is true. Its the sauces that makes the fries stand out. We tried the Sweet Mango Chutney Mayo, Cheddar Cheese and Peanut Satay. By far my favorite was the sweet mango chutney. The Belgian fries are more of a snack then an actual meal, so my suggestion is to come here if you're interested in a something light. This place is a bit more spacious than Artichoke pizza, so you'll have no problem finding a seat to enjoy your Belgian fries.
