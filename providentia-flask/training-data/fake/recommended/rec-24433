Really great atmosphere and delicious high quality French cuisine. The interior is modern and cozy. It can get a bit loud for intimate conversations around dinnertime, perhaps brunch would be a better time if you want a quieter atmosphere. At the end, the waiter brought our check inside a little French book, thought that was creative!
