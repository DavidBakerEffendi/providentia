No Anti-Valentine's Day Date would be complete without a giant heart piñata, however, since those were in high demand this year, my friend and I decided to travel south of the border (as south as you can get in Northern Liberties) to El Camino Real. The place was packed and I was jamming out to... Mariah Carey?  Music choice aside, the place has a great atmosphere.  We were seated right away, although I must suggest that they not cram THAT many tables next to each other -- uncomfortable!  Despite that, the waitstaff was incredibly attentive and I rarely went without a filled water glass.   Be sure to get the $1/person all-you-can-eat chips and salsa... which reminded me of homemade cool ranch doritos! My friend and I ordered the brisket and beef short rib sandwiches.  We both agreed the meat was succulent, although the sauces were overpowering. (Buyer Beware: If you are on a "real date," I would suggest ordering it sans horseradish!).       For those of you who, like myself, like to peruse the menu online before going, note that it is not exactly the same.  Much to my dismay, the Orange Push Pop drink listed online does not exist and so I settled for the spiked rootbeer.  Better luck next time.
