I've only been to the to-go side so I can't speak for the sit-down resturant but here is my review of Govinda's To-Go for the entire Govinda's To-Go menu check out veganguineapig.blogspot.… No trip to Philadelphia is complete without a visit to Govinda's To Go. I was on the hunt for a good vegan chicken philly cheese steak and I was pointed straight to Govinda's To Go. What no one told me was that, if you don't come in with willpower of steal, you can leave Govinda's To Go at least 5 pounds heavier. The only thing that saved me was that I gave up sweets for lent, but trust me the next time I head to Govinda's I'm preparing a 10 mile run before and after so that I can eat at will, guilt free. Not only did Govinda's have the best chicken cheese steak I ever tasted but they also managed to make me a partial fan, or I guess I should say less of a skeptic, about the infamous ham tube. I just might invest in a ham tube of my very own after my omni friend declared that it was delicious in Govinda's version of a ham and cheese hoagie. But Govinda's To Go is more than just great sandwiches they have an amazing assortment of vegan cakes, cheesecakes, tortes and pies. Not to mention 7 flavors of vegan ice cream, including my all time favorite butter pecan. And just when I thought that was enough I noticed a box of vegan donuts of every flavor on the counter. If there was ever a test of my ability to stick to my lent sacrifice then this was it. But somehow I made it out of there without a bite of one of these tasty treats. veganguineapig.blogspot.…
