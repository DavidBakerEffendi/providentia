Interesting place.  Came here for an early dinner last Sunday.  It's been renovated since it was Cosi.  They've added some nice booths downstairs, though the space is still a bit awkward with the big staircase off to the right.  The upstairs has a nice huge new bar, but was all closed off due to the light business they're currently doing.  The decor overall is almost nonexistent.  To go with the firehouse theme?  Not sure what to make of it, but could use a bit of help.  Anyway, let's get to the food.  The menu is an adventuresome take on traditional Americana fare.  It was hard to know where to start or what to choose, but I ended up with one of their "All-American" burgers and my wife with a "Grilled Brooklyn Flat," a pizza of sorts.  The burgers are double decker, very tasty and juicy, possibly steamed (not grilled).  Mine was the "California Dreaming" with pepper jack cheese, avocado, roast red pepper, spinach, cucumber wasabi, on a potato bun.  A real interesting mix of flavors and the hand-cut fries that came with it were excellent. The flat was the "Mexican Margherita" with jalapeno, bacon, tomato sauce, cilantro, mozzarella, garlic.  The ultra thin crust was just OK and the jalapenos (a plethora) were fresh, not pickled, and were blisteringly hot.  Better that they were pickled, so you could taste the other flavors.  Service was a bit awkward, as three different people, one probably the owner/manager, checked in on us at different times, trying a bit too hard to please, but nice enough.  I'd definitely go back to try some of the more adventuresome items on the menu and sit upstairs when it is in full swing.  Could be a real happening spot.  Oh, one last thing.  The music selection is classic rock, mostly 70's and 80's.  Some good, some not so.  It'd be nice if they could mix it up with some more contemporary indie rock sounds.  They don't want to appeal to just boomers, do they?
