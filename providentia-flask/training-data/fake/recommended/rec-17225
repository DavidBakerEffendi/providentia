I decided to give this place a second chance after being disappointed for the first time. I went for a friends birthday and I was disappointed once again! I ordered arroz con pollo and the chicken was very dry and the rice was dry as well. How do you ruin arroz con pollo?! Also the meal has so many bones in it I was afraid I was going to choke. The platanos were soggy, overall the meal was horrible and I couldn't even finish my meal. My friend didn't enjoy her meal either and she ordered the chuletas, she said they were dry as well. I was also annoyed that my friends bought wine because it's byob but they charged us bc we had sangria and the pitcher cost 13 bucks! The service wasn't that great it's very crowded with no space and it looks an accident waiting to happen with all the waiters running around and bumping into people. I will never come here again.
