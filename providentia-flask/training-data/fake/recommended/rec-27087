My family and I decided to eat here after looking up top rated Italian restaurants in Brooklyn. I was very impressed. The food was delicious as were the desserts. We got the arugala schmoogala and the ricotta pizza. Normally I don't like too many toppings on my pizza, but each one was completely unique and delicious. The crust was soft just the way I like it. The pizza sizes were a bit small, so if you are going with a large group, I would recommend getting a few pies. There were 5 people in my party, and we only ordered two pizzas. Two people in my party got the salads, and I tried both - they were also delicious and very unique in terms of the taste and the ingredients. Finally, you HAVE to try the ice cream and the salty vegan chocolate chip cookies. I am not a vegan food eater, nor have I ever even given vegan a thought, and these cookies were 100% amazing to the point where I want to go to the bakery and try some of their other products. To add a nice personal touch, Paulie Gee himself came over and spoke to our party. I saw him walking around speaking to everyone in the restaurant. It turns out he works and lives right near where I grew up and reside. He was extremely friendly, and he wanted to make sure we were having a good experience. One warning - it can be a bit warm inside as every seating area has a view and is near the pizza making station. The air conditioning was also broken when we went, so it was a bit warmer than I would have liked. This changed a bit once the doors opened in the front, but keep this in mind when you come and order a cold soda or beer from their bar!
