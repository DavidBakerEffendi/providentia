Excellent saganaki, probably the best I've ever had. Grilled octopus was tender but had no flavor, Horiatiki salad was perfect, very fresh. A little overpriced, for example the shrimp appetizer is $16 but only comes with 4 shrimp. Cons: Bathrooms are a little scary and the service was slow. Pros: Nice looking place, had a nice vibe to it. Communal table not as nice as the front tables so make a reservation.
