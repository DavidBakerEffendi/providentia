Went for lunch today. Service was impeccable. Staff was friendly, efficient and sandwich was ready in a flash. My friend and I each had the Mensch which was delicious. We also shared an order of crunchy onions which were really good. I recommend this place highly, and would rate Jake's equal to or better than any other sandwich shop in Philly.   Will return for more,  and probably pretty often.
