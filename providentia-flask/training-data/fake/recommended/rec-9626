The food was amazing!! Got to New York looking for a cool different types of food, and after checking some yelp reviews we found Pio pio.  After walking into the small entrance it opened up to a giant dining room which I first scared us.  But the large room and busy bustling customers did not deter the food.  The shrimp ceviche with scallops and octopus was amazing!!  We had a codfish and another fish dish with shrimp and scallops and octopus it was incredible!  The green sauce was addictive!  The drinks were delicious and the bartenders/staff were very helpful when trying to figure out what we wanted next . Would definitely recommend this place a must go if you're in the area!
