Went here after reading reviews on yelp and talking to some of the locals on how Pat's and Geno's have gone a little commercial, we wanted to try a real deal Philadelphia steak. If I were brutally honest, I wasn't that impressed. I had the mushroom cheese steak with provolone.  The smell was delicious, and the meat was slightly higher than pat/genos, but I was overwhelmingly seasoned.  I think that it was because they expected the cheesewiz to add enough salt, but they should have compensated for the provolone lovers out there.  And on the flip side, their peppers were overly salted... I know I just sound super fixated on salt, but it really really makes a difference. I do have to say the service was cool and friendly, and very patient while I was trying to figure out 6 orders.
