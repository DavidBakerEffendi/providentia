Have walked by and not sure I'd actually want to go in and sit down, but they have great takeout and prompt delivery. My personal favorites are the Szechuan noodles in hot oil (which are stuffed with pork and drenched in a spicy peanutty sauce) and the range flavored chicken (sweet and spicy sauce and nicely cooked chicken). Makes for yummy leftovers...
