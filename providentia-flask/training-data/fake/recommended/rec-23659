Checked out Yelp for breakfast and found Handy's which was a bit out of the way from the hotel district. I figured it would be less crowded than the closer restaurants. this place just has a horeshoe counter which makes it a bit cramped but it also means it is truly a 'local' spot. my family of 3 jammed ourselves into the stool space but it was worth it. I had a veggie/ham/cheese omlet that was one of the best and largest I have ever had. The vegetables seemed right off the farm and the slab of ham was ample. People stared at my plate like it was a carrier that just docked on a river. It was good. Wife said her shortstack of blueberry pancakes were great. Staff was very friendly and service was quick.
