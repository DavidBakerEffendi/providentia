I was reluctant to come here because I didn't know much about Cuban food, but I am glad I made the walk in the rain. I will lay out my rating easily: -Food: Excellent. I had a beef stew dish that came with white rice, black beans and fried plantains, and a side of a garlic dipping sauce. The stew, rice, and garlic sauce were kick ass- I basically devoured it. The plaintains were a bit bland (but tasty dipped in the sauce), and black beans are black beans- not much more to say than that. My boyfriend had Â Chilean sea bass in a mango habenero marinade which came with sweet plaintains and rice- his dish was spot on. SO GOOD. It was also the daily special so I'm not sure how often it will be on the menu but I would definitely recommend! -Service: We did have to wait a while (3-5 minutes or so) to be greeted and then were told we had a 20 minute wait to be seated. We got drinks at the bar, and while they were good, I'd have to say the bartender was pretty slow. Once seated though, our server was very attentive, and we didn't have to wait too long to eat. Still had to wait a while for our drinks. Overall, I would definitely go back to this tiny Cuban joint- great for a date night!
