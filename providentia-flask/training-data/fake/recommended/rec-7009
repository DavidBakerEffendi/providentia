I wanted to not like this place, as bad as that sounds. I was feeling very hangry (so hungry I'm angry), and it was really, really crowded. (It was their $1 on all Montaditos Wednesday, a deal that was going on the entire week for the holidays.) My boyfriend kept insisting it was worth it, though, so we waited in line and ended up even standing at the bar to eat our food. Not expecting much, I ordered 3 montaditos and a side of fries. I can honestly say that the food greatly exceed my expectations - it was DELICIOUS. Each of the small sandwich was so good, I couldn't possibly pick a favorite. The shrimp and fried onion montadito was surprisingly fresh and featured more shrimp than I expected for such a great price. Next was the salami, cream cheese, and lettuce montadito, featuring just the right amounts of each ingredient. Finally, I had a montadito with ham, brie cheese, lettuce, and mayo - AMAZING. The fries were of the thinner variety, and they give you a ton. They were good, but I honestly think next time I'll skip the fries and get more montaditos. There's literally 100 different options, so it'll take me a while to work through them! Another thing that impressed me was the service. It was insanely busy, and the place just opened, so I was expecting worn out employees to rush me through the process. Not so. Everyone was friendly and upbeat without being annoyingly perky. The only down side to this place is that it's so popular - especially one $1 montadito days - it becomes really hard to find a seat. If you live nearby, consider getting it to go, or prepare potenitally stand and eat. The prices aren't bad even on a normal day - I don't think any sandwich is above $2-$3 - Â so if you don't mind spending just a little bit more, you could have better luck finding a table. Definitely coming back here again.
