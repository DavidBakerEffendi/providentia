This place was busy for brunch on a Saturday so me and my friend sat at the bar to avoid the log wait for the table. The service was decent and the food was soooo good. I got the crab cake eggs Benedict and my friend got the chocolate chip banana pancakes. The portion size was big so me and my friend split our meals, we were both in the mood for savory and sweet. The crab cake Benedict was yummy , but the hash browns probably could of used more seasoning. The pancakes were really good to, just that the only thing is the bananas were definitely not ripe enough. There were so many options on the menu here that sounded great that I can't wait to go back even though I'm hardly ever in Astoria.
