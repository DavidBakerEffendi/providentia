This is quite the chic Thai restaurant. I'd say it's a pretty good date place, but can get a little loud. The decor is nice, including the huge chandelier in the middle. The drinks are delish and the food is good too. Try the squid ink spaghetti!! It looks interesting but is quite tasty. The calamari appetizer and the fritters are great. Good portions. Only bad thing was the waiter was not very attentive and service was a little slow, but bearable. Overall, a good place to get Thai on the Westside.
