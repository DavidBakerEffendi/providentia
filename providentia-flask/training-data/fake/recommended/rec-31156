I love this place- or, at least I have until the last time I was there. The atmosphere is very fun; the outside seating and bar are especially hip and the inside is cozy and reminds me of eating at a relatives house. The food is delicious- however, the last time we were there the service was INCREDIBLY slow, and multiple patrons complained about the food (myself included). I'm hoping it was just a fluke, though it seemed like they changed up some recipes. I do love this place and the servers and hostesses are really great, so I'll be back just to make sure! I'd recommend the filet mignon with the port wine reduction... swoon!
