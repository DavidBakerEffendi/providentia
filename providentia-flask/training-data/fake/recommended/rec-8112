steak, steak, steak ..mmmm. If ur a guy just skip the salad bar (which is rly good) n go all out on the meats, which r basically seasoned wit only salt. u will never move, u just sit n the meat comes to u. I recommend eating the meat only wit the some fried banana, which are pretty good. Prepare like for any buffet cuz u need to get ur moneys worth. If ur in the mood for meat, this is the spot. Its a chain but it keeps the quality control pretty well as far as Ive seen.
