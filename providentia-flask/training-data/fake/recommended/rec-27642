What a great little place! Who would have thought to find great Mexican food and drinks in China Town...:) I have been here several times and i havent eaten anything i didnt like. The portions arent huge so you can enjoy various dishes and still have enough room to have a few cocktails. As other reviewers have stated that the margaritas are great, they are but I recommend you ask for Michelada (pronounced - Mitch-e-lada) with either a Tecate, Dos XX, or Cerveza Sol beer. If your not into beer, thats o.k. but you have to at least try one to say you have tasted it. Its very Mexico City and you can impress your friends with the fact that you know about a Michelada. Enjoy! Lupe
