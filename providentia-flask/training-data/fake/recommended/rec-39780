Went here with my sister (visiting from Virginia) and my newborn in a stroller.  On a Wednesday afternoon around 1:30, it was no problem to get a seat and park the stroller next to us. Service: VERY slow - even though not too many people there.  We weren't in a hurry so it didn't bother us. Food:  bib lettuce salad and the artichoke, mushroom pizza was excellent.  My favorite in all of NYC now!  Thin crust, fresh toppings.  Was good for two people for lunch...unless you are really hungry.
