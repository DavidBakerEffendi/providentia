I was here the other night with three friends. I believe they had all been before but it was my first time. Off the bat, it was a really cute space. The menu was full of really good options. Breakfast all day is a sign of a great establishment. We split a mac & cheese right off the bat. It was great. Definitely not enough on the plate to split four ways, but i definitely enjoyed the each of the four spoonfuls i got. Everyone was super pleased with their main course except for me. I got biscuits and gravy. The gravy was delicious, the egg was cooked well but the biscuit was a little lackluster. It was too dry which didn't lend to absorbing the wonderful gravy. My meal specifically was not 4 stars, more like 3. But the overall experience was warm and welcoming.
