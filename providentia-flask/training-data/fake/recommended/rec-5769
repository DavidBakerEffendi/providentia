This is one of the best restaurants I've been to in a while. If you're in the mood for some southern comfort, don't hesitate to check this place out! Decor was adorable! Kind of napa valley cross southern twang. Service was 5/5 stars. Our server was so sweet and friendly. He gave us the best suggestions and was honest about how big the portions were. My bf and I started with the bacon mac and cheese. It came out bubbling in a cast iron skillet with a nice crunchy crust. It had the perfect amount of bacon and was rich but not overhwlemingly. Definitely, the best mac and cheese I've ever had. Next we had the smoked bone marrow with buttery texas toast. If you like bone marrow, get this. Just trust me. For an entree, we shared the t-bone steak with twice baked potatoes and a wedge salad. It was HUGE. Do NOT order this for just yourself. The dressing on the wedge salad was personally too rich for me. The twice baked potato was amazing. The skin was crispy and the inside was nice and soft. The steak was one of the best steaks I've ever had. It was so tender! I now know what people mean when they describe steak as, "melt in your mouth." Lastly, we had the sweet corn custard. Amazing texture and flavor combination. The custard wasn't too rich or heavy. The fruits were extremely fresh. The little sprigs of rosemary and toasted cashew added great flavor and texture. I could literally eat this dish all day. It kinda tasted like a fruit tart minus the pastry part. All in all, I had the perfect dining experience here. I can not wait to come back!
