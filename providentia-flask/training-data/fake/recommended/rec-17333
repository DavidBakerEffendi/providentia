Co workers raved about this place. I don't see anything particularly special about it. What I ordered made my stomach flip in knots and it also didn't taste good going down altogether. It was their own rendition of hockey Parmesan and I didn't like the mayo based sauce that was used. I do want to try there thanksgiving dish I heard it is good. But after that first order I've never ordered again.
