The beer selection was great. It would have been nice to see at least a token vegan or vegetarian dish on the menu, which would seem to make sense considering the neighborhood and the fact that it is 2014, but I guess they are aiming for something else. So be it. My core issue was with the service. We were there on Sunday night; it was not exactly dead but definitely not heaving. After seating ourselves at the bar it took over 10 minutes to get served and getting a refill took even longer. I witnessed other bar seated customers dealing with similar issues. I understand that they may be working out the kinks, fine, just give customers a heads up, I think folks would generally be sympathetic. Most people aren't looking to be waited on hand and foot, just descent service. The vibe I got from the staff was more like they were doing me a favor. My experience makes it very tough to justify returning or recommending it
