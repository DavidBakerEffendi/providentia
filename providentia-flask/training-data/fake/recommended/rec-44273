THE PERFECT SANDWICH is hard to find. But when you do find it, you have to pay homage. From superior ingredients to the freshest-baked bread and sauces that make you say, "Dammit, I kind of want to drink that!", the ideal Sandwich has to strike a delicate balance, and the people who make them have hit upon something way more important than just a portable meal. Meat & Co is this place. BTW the Tuna is Bad Ass!
