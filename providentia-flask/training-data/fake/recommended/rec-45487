My favorite restaurant in NJ.  I eat here 2 - 3 times per month and have never had a bad meal.  A great staff who know what they are doing, can actually describe a menu item, and not just tell you that it is good.  Sitting at the bar is always a fun place, you are bound to talk to the people around you and leave in a better mood than you came in, thanks in part to the bartender Craig.   Always looking forward to my next visit.
