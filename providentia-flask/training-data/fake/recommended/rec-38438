Wow!  Completely awesome!  I've had BBQ and Soul food from all over the country but who knew that the best of the lot was only about two miles from my apartment in New Haven?   Every thing here is incredible.  We had the BBQ pork, collard greens, mac and cheese, potato salad, candied yams, corn bread, hush puppies and peach cobbler and sweet potato cheese cake for desert.  Every bite was perfect.  Honestly, I've rarely had a dining experience like this and cannot wait to get back. The folks that own the place are incredibly warm and welcoming.  Visiting Sandra's is like going home to eat - can't give it a higher recommendation.  Do yourself a favor and go!  Go now!
