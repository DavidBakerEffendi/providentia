I love bacon and bacon loves me; obviously coming here is both gastronomic and a Mecca for me. The flight is fantastic,although less a fan of the jalape√±o bacon...oh well. Their BLT with bread from Amy's Bread was a delightful surprise since that bakery is fantastic. All in all, I was happier than a pig in, errr, bacon?
