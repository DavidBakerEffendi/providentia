I get the allure of a speakeasy-- it makes you feel current and informed.  I can't say I am above this mentality because it was somewhat thrilling to find this "secret" location.   The food and service, however, were a bit disappointing.   The service was inconsistent : drinks took 20 minutes to arrive, and once they finally arrived 2 people received the wrong drink!  Once the correct drinks arrived, however, they were excellent.  The whiskey contained  this gigantic ice ball-- I've never seen anything like it.  The dishes were rarely cleared between courses and by the end of the meal I had a large pile of toothpicks and serving spoons on my plate. As for the meal itself, there were a couple of delicious stand-outs: the crudite (sweet baby carrots and radishes) paired with a cheese fondue, the kobe sliders, and  the mac and cheese (one of the best I've ever had).   The branzino was less successful-- we had to debone it ourselves and while we did the best we could,  I kept pulling out small bones from each bite.  The miso cod was fine, but a bit dry.   The star of the show?  The telepathic toilet.   .
