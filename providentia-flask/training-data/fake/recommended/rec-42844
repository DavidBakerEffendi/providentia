Perfect ambiance, delicious food, great staff, great drinks, what else can i say? I came here with a group of ten for a birthday dinner. Our waitress was the nicest waitress I have ever had in NYC..she must not be from here. Elise, you rock. The bison, linguini, mussel appetizer, and pork chops were favorites at the table. Our table probably ordered 40 drinks, absolutely delicious. Will return to this joint in the near future.
