Atmosphere - Casual, Dark, fairly loud Service - Very friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, prompt Drinks - Some of the best margaritas I've ever had, try the el Dorado! Food - Complementary chips and delicious salsas.  Guacamole was some of the best I've ever had.  Girlfriend had a chimichanga which was very good but nothing extraordinary.  I had the pork shank which was cooked perfectly, the meat fell right off the bone.  The stew it was sitting in had flavors I have never tasted, but man were they good!  The side of creamed spinach was also very good.
