It's quite rare I go to an Anglo Saxon restaurant and I manage to eat three dishes I have never tried before.  Walter Food's new American food managed to give me just that. We went for brunch on a rainy day and got a booth looking out over W Burg which was a great place to watch the world go by.  This was coupled with impeccable and charming service that allowed you just to slouch back into their green leather seats. The food, well, it was new (for me). Biscuits n Gravy, grits, French dips... apparently all American classics. Good but not great to my palate.  For instance the French dip could have done with the meat being more lightly cooked so the blood soaked into the baguette to give it extra flavour.  However, maybe this is not how they come. I just don't know. The others at my table had a crab benedict and a English breakfast-esque assortment which were more to my taste. I will definitely go back for dinner and will probably stick to dishes which are a bit less new New American but a great place.
