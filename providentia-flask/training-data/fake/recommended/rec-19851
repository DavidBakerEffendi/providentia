I hit up this place a while back with a friend.  We waited 15-20 minutes outside.  It was my first time at Il Bambino so we ordered a few different paninis and appetizers and two (2) rounds of beers.  These fancy sandwiches cost a fortune.  Our final bill was $100+.  Although this place was good (only good not great), I would not go back.
