Waited about an hour even on a tuesday afternoon but it was worth it I must say. Got the country breakfast and cheese grits on the side and it was really good.  Even a simple thing like a biscuit (which has surprisingly been screwed up at a lot of the other places I have tried around nyc) was great.  I'm glad I got the extra cheese grits because they were some of the best I have tasted.  Should give this place a try at least once :)
