I went here this pass sunday 3/3/13, The food was great, the service was nice and the servers were very knowledgeable about the menu. The owner was very kind n make sure we had a great table, Being a spanish women coming to this place made me feel at home. I Loved the decor, the atmosphere and the location. The only reason why i gave it a 4star was because their was no waiting area. when its packed and your standing waiting to be seated theres no where to really to stand, serves were come by you with food, people walking in n out. It jus got alil uncomfortable but besides that i will recommend you checking out this place. Ooh the mango mojo 5stars
