Went there for Sunday brunch. The wife and I got Sunday roast. It was great, although the steak was a bit tough for us. Friend got tomatoes on toast ( which does come w eggs). I had a bite of that and it was great too. Drinks were nice. Selection looks good. The place is nicely decorated and good atmosphere. I recommend.
