I used to live right down the street from Taco Riendo, and to be honest, I could eat here everyday for the rest of my life. Everything was cooked perfectly and authentically, and you could sit and eat your meal in their little cozy corner little restaurant (huge windows made up for lack of indoor space) or you can take it to go, theyre very quick about preparing the food. I like the glass soda bottles on ice. Might not be everyone else's cup of tea, but for me TR hits the spot.
