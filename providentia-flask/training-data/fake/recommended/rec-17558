Generally speaking it's a nice place ... take away the standard and not surprising air of  brooklyn hipster ... our server is bright and kind ... the hostess was a bit snarky .. Yeah, you with the hat ... if you dont want me to sit side by side with my fiance then dont put me at a 6 top bench ... I mean come on ... your policy?  Its 9 on a Thursday night and half of your room is empty ...for real... don't seat us at a 6 top ... or make it work .. as any skilled restaurant employee would do. The food was delicious thankfully -- the celery root salad was fresh and crisp and by far one of the best I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying. As this place goes, we had to have the shrimp and grits and chicken fried steak. Both divine. I did wish they had a better beer selection -- especially since my first and second choices were not in stock ... end of the day, it was a good meal -- except for Snarky McSnark at the door ...
