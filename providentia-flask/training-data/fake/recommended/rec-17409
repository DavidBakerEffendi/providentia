I had heard rave reviews from my co-workers and thought great Cuban food and Sangria was the way to go. Atmosphere was wonderful... until we were sat in an uneven corner on the outside patio. We went on a weekday and the place was not busy at all. Later on a couple was also sat right next to our table. I understand rotating sections, but really ? This place is large but seating is cramped. Our server was not very attentive, but an older server seemed to also keep an eye on us. Not the best service I've had. Tapas were delicious. Our entrees were plentiful ! I think one entree could actually be shared between 2-3 people. We ordered Cuban Pete Sangria which was bland and watered down. Â For dessert we had the tres leches cake and at the mango flan. Mango flan tasted like it had traces of mango in it, otherwise, bland. The tres leches cake was awful; it tasted like cake just soaked in regular milk. In essence, I'm giving this place 3 stars for atmosphere and appetizers.
