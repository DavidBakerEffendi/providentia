I go here approx 2-3 times a month for no reason other than it is a good location to catch up with a good friend.   Basically, the coffee drinks are decent...staff is adequate...cupcakes are (usually) on the stale side, but you can sit and hang out for as long as you want & they don't hassle you. They do seem to have some sort of napkin rationing issue...as in you get 1 per person and thats it. Even if you ask for more.  Weird.
