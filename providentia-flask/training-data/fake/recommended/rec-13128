WOW - one word to describe this delicious 'hole-in-the-wall' place. EVERYTHING is good here and it's worth the wait. You can't go wrong with anything here. The staff is amazing, the decor is so cozy and warm, and the food is just delicious! Party had the shrimp crepe, spinach crepe, chicken crepe and all were heavenly! I'm now a crepe fan because of Pates Et Traditions... + plenty of parking + large selection of crepes (savory and sweet) + big portions + made with organic buckwheat flour + fresh salad - hmmm... probably nothing but if I had to name something... takes only cash? There is an ATM machine in the restaurant though. Can we go back yet? Why do I have to live in VA and be so far from this place?!
