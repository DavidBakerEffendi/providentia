Cool Restaurant But Creepy Mirrors! *** I recently visited friends in Philly and they took me out to Continental Midtown. The ambience is awesome and feels somewhat like a trendy, retro spaceship inside. I'm gluten-intolerant and in general I was dismayed by the lack of options (there's a LOT of hidden/added gluten in their dishes, so check with your waiter!), but then the manager heard about my concern and came over and literally sat down with me at our booth and went through the menu options and variations with me until I found dishes that I was excited about and that were gluten-free. And he continued to check in with me throughout the meal to make sure I was happy with the choices we had settled on. It was like having a personal shopper, but at a restaurant! Our waitress was really nice too. I HIGHLY recommend the lobster mashed potatoes with red wine sauce. They were to die for! The two-way mirrors in the bathrooms are totally CREEPY, though. Everyone standing outside the restrooms can see you through the mirror but you can't see them. And unless someone is standing at the mirror as you're entering the bathroom, it's not obvious that you're seeing into the bathroom because you can just see the tiled wall (I thought it was some design as part of the retro decor outside the bathroom when I first entered), so then you go about you business in the bathroom then go to wash your hands, check your teeth, adjust your clothes, put on make-up, cover up your zits, or whatever in front the mirror, not realizing that people (often just men) are standing on the other side laughing and staring at you. One of the staff even walked by as I was standing outside the bathroom after realizing that the mirror was two-ways and he laughed while saying that his favorite times to watch were when women adjusted their bras and pushed up their breasts. TOTALLY CREEPY.
