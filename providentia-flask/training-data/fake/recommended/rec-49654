Most amazing burger and truffle fries!!! The ribs fall off the bone, finger licking good, I was bummed that I was sharing them with my friends, next time I'll order a whole plate just for myself! Great atmosphere in each of the separate bars and dining areas! The Irish pub is downstairs, very casual and traditional Irish fare with darts and tv's.  The bar upstairs serves everything and the dining room is a cross between a casual sports bar and a really nice restaurant, depending on where you sit.   From the main dining room You can't even hear the Live music playing in the front bar, Jazz on Thursday's (I think).   Overall, Ricalton's Village Tavern is Fabulous!!! I've been there 3 times in the past 2 weeks and I'm looking forward to going back!
