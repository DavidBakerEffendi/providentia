Just ate here today for the first time and I was mad that I did. The hot dog bun was cold and too large for the hot dog. The hot dog was just very forgettable and being that it's a place based on hot dogs they better get it together. One pro was the fries which were not amazing but the malt vinegar aioli dipping sauce earned them 2 stars.
