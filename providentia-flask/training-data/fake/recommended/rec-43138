Haven't been here for the sandwiches yet. They do look mighty tasty though.  Might have to give in eventually and split one with somebody.  So I've only been here for the happy hour.  The happy hour was surprisingly good.  They have very good drink specials and the waitresses were very nice and attentive.  I did go on an off night though.  I imagine it gets a little more crowded and crazy during a busier night.  Still I had a good time and it was very pleasant so I will be back.
