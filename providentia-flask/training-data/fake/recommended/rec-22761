I visited this restaurant with a group of five which made it extremely fun to try all the many dishes we ordered. This was my first experience at a Korean BBQ so I do not have a basis for comparison. We tried the pork collar, marinated boneless short ribs, pork belly and two different ribeyes. All of the meat tasted delicious and juicy but the short ribs stole the show. We also had the seafood soup that comes with the combination for 5 people. The waiter was very efficient and friendly. Will definitely go back!
