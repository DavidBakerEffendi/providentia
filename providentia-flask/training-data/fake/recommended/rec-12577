I came here with my boyfriend for valentine's day dinner. We both love breakfast for dinner and he had heard about the pancakes. All I can say is amazing. Absolutely amazing. The mini biscuits you get when you sit down are delicious and crumbly, just as biscuits should be. All sorts of food envy and delicious smells wafting around. We decided to each get our own entrees and then share the pancakes. I ordered huevos rancheros and my boyfriend ordered eggs benedict. Delicious. I had no problem cleaning my plate. And the pancakes. The pancakes! We ordered the fresh coconut pancakes. Light fluffy pancakes with shredded coconut and caramelized pineapple with warm maple butter for dipping. OMG. Food so good it will make you want to slap your mama. Truth. The only downside, IMO, is that the tables are pretty close together. You can pick off your neighbors plate if you want to. There is literally no space. The place is quite small. But the food is so good that it. Just. Does not. Matter.
