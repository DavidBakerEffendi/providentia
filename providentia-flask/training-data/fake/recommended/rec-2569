Great place. I wish all cities had this type of market.  The way a food court should be, not the corporate chain-restaurant filled schlock they have in the malls these days.  Multiple food stalls.  Variety of every type of food- diner, asian, middle eastern, seafood, etc...and amish.  Also a bunch of non-food stalls.  Great produce also.  I wish I had something like this where I live.  I would never need to cook again. I had the amish breakfast - pancakes and bacon.  The pancakes were decent but the bacon was TO DIE FOR.  Not the crappy thin stuff but the nice thick slices.  I'm salivating just thinking of it.  After that, I splurged with a soft pretzel.  OMG!!!  Right out of the oven.  So hot and soft.  Finished it even before I got out of the place.  I wanted to try so many other stands but my stomach failed me - too stuffed. Just a warning.  Great ambience if you like the down-to-earth, in-your-face, about-the-food-only environment (which I love)  Don't expect 4 star dining wait staff.  Most places are take out only.  Others have stools and a counter.  There are communal tables that are open to everyone but be ready to sit next to strangers.
