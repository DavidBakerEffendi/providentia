Hands down the area's best traditional margaritas. Limey, sweetly sour, yummy. You really only need one! Tasty homemade chips and salsa, addtional vegetarian options available (I just asked and they accommodated), and friendly, welcoming staff. It can get a little crowded and if overwhelmed, service can be a little slow. Â Don't even bother trying to get in on Cinco de Mayo unless you don't mind waiting in line.
