Just as Restaurant Week came to a close, I accepted the gracious offer from ilili's management to come back for a do-over of my previous experience. I am amazed at how "night and day" the whole evening was for myself and my guest. We were seated in the main dining room in a nice corner table near the center where we could take in the entire space. I seriously didn't realize how much it resembles a labyrinth, albeit a gilded and romantic one. Our server was attentive without being obtrusive and seemed to be genuinely excited about every ounce of food we ordered. The establishment had also arranged for a complimentary appetizer to be offered to us, which was a pleasant and completely unnecessary surprise. The little treats were like a Lebanese style panchetta (made of veal) in a mini pancake sandwich...so delicious. Once we had stuffed ourselves silly with all the Lebanese goodness the Pre-Fixe had to offer, the check came with an immense thank you and no rush at all to leave. While I finished my desert, one of the managers, Sheena, came over to thank me for returning and to ensure that I had a much more satisfying experience this time. I really have to say how amazing they handled this whole service issue. They really care about the individual links and go above and beyond to make sure that each guest's experience is as good as it can get. You guys won me over and I will be back with more Mediterraneans next time. Feta cheese for everyone!!!
