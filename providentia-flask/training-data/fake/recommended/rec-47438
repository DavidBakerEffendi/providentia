Came here with a friend for lunch during restaurant week.   Overall, the ambiance was nice and the service was excellent.  The food however wasn't quite what I was expecting based on reviews and word of mouth.    I ordered the watermellon salad as an appetizer, and this was delicious.   The combination of watermellon and feta worked really well.  For our entrees, we tried the grilled brook trout and the southern fried chicken.   The trout was fine, but nothing mind blowing.   The fried chicken was about as good as you would expect from a fine restaurant.   Call me crazy, but fried chicken is best left to Popeyes.   The best part of the whole meal was the dessert.   The pistaccio semifreddo and cream soda float were really tasty.   Overall, not a bad dining experience, just didn't get a true feel for the quality of the restaurant based on their limited restaurant week menu.
