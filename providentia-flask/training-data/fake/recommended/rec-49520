Thick cut fries are my favorite kind of fries and the ones here are perfect. I don't like how you have to pay $1 each for the sauces but it's sweet that you can sample them before you make a decision, I always end up feeling bad cause they're so busy to ask for samples so I've only tried the roasted garlic mayo which was good. Maybe I'll muster up the courage to try poutine next time....
