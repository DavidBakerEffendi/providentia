On a nice day what I love about this setting is the openness of either sitting inside next to the wide open windows/doorways or relaxing at one of the few outdoor tables.  If you shy away from the sun the inside is nice and dim with an eclectic collection of artwork that will have your eyes darting all over the place. I've been happy with the food the last couple of times I've been there.  I'm not much of a brunch person, but the menu is diverse enough that I didn't have a problem finding something I truly enjoyed.  The service has always been friendly and quick.   If your going in the evening for drinks I found the place was an average bar.  (This area has some very solid bars to compete against).  Kind of on the noisy side, so not so great for a group, but definitely good for a date.
