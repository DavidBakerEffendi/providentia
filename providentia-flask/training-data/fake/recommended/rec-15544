Very excited about what we ordered, but when my guy and I got home, we were so disappointed. The food was flavorless and needed seasoning, big time. The place was packed, and we can't figure out WHY, after our bland ravioli, truffle-oil-drowned flatbread, and tasteless salad. Maybe an off night? But three out of four dishes being 'misses' tells me no.
