Brooklyn Beet Company is an awesome addition to the neighborhood. Great cozy atmosphere, friendly and attentive service, and fantastic food. Definitely try the beet-tini! It's the perfect balance of beet and citrus flavors, not to mention it's generously strong. Not a big beer selection, but it's varied enough to please any palate. The chicken schnitzel was perfectly crispy and really well complemented by the beet ketchup and beet hot sauce that are available on every table. The portion was large and came with AMAZING garlic mashed potatoes and a salad. The goulash was also delicious, perfectly spiced and satisfying. This is the kind of comfort food that will only get better as the weather gets colder.
