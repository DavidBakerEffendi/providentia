Excellent place to visit for restaurant week. There were 20 options on the menu and each person can select 2 from each menu section (total 4 for each person). There were 4 of us, so we were able to taste 16 of the 20 pintxos and all were excellent. Particularly noteworthy was the perfection with which the octopus was grilled. Not an easy food to prepare by anyone, Garces does an outstanding job of accentuating its tenderness by pairing it with equivalently tender potato slices. Organic chicken with Truffle whipped mashed stands out especially brightly in my memory, partially because I'm a genuine sucker for anything truffle and partially because of the visible black truffle shavings. Finally, the duck confit, paired in alternating pairs with black cherries on a skewer had a delightful la peral jus (crudely- a blue cheese sauce) drizzled on top of them. Great sweet/savory combo. Although all of the meats, cheeses and olives were excellent, it is hard to rate them next to the other portions, since everything truly had the potential to be a meal on its own. My dining-mates ordered a pitcher of white sangria, and were seemingly very pleased with it. Any of the above would make excellent meals on their own. I couldn't complain about this restaurant if you asked me to.
