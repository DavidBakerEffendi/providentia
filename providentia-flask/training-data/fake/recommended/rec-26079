Had high hopes- place was good but not great. The guava caipirinha was delicious, the pa de quijo was also quite good. The bife de cavalo was ok, the meet was tender and well seasoned but the beans were mediocre, tasted like a can of goya bean soup- good but something I can heat up at home. And the signature Brazilian dish, feijoada was really just meh. Not horrible but lacking in complexity that can only come from hours cooking. Overall the food was decent but not great and definitely overpriced.
