For the last five years Supper has been an intense obsession of mine. I first started coming to Supper with a very attractive boy in a band that played at the Mercury Lounge quite frequently and we would come to Supper and drink wine, eat Priest Stranglers, and feel lusty. Five years, and a series of dreamy boys later, I still think Supper is one of the most perfect date spots. Supper is so great- perfectly prepared, simple Italian food, a nice cozy atmosphere, and an excellent wine list. When I am craving pasta, it is always the Priest Stranglers in their slightly spicy marinara with ricotta cheese, and lots of basil that I want...The daily supper specials and bruschetta are also always delicious and satisfying. The portions are well-sized, it is very affordable, there is always good music on (I first heard Cat Power on my very first visit to Supper), and almost always a really long wait. But, its worth it. Plus, while you wait, there are a plethora of drinking establishments in the neighborhood that make wonderful places to bide your time. In short-- I've taken a four hour train ride, more than once, with my primary goal being a day in Chelsea dream-shopping for art and a long, lazy dinner at Supper.
