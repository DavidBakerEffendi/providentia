Philadelphia born and raised. I am a huge fan of cheesesteaks and a bigger fan of the little joints outside the popular four throughout the city that serve up the best sandwiches in town. (Delessandros, Murphy's Saloon). So after living across the street from Sonnys for two year, we decided to finally try it one Friday night. I was definitely unsure. First thing - we walk in and the place is empty. Not what I expect from one of the best cheesesteaks in the city. We order and took the sandwiches back home. The sandwich was dry dry dry. Meat was killed and not a good Philly roll. We will not be back.
