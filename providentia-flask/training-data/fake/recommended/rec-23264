This restaurant was very good, one of the best I've had in the city.  The appetizers were well seasoned (kale salad nicely balanced acidity) and the gnocchi was delicious.  The scallop noodles were okay, kind of novel, but the sauce on them was phenomenal.   My friends and I thought two of the three entrees we got were kind of underwhelming (the salmon was overcooked and the curried halibut just so-so), but it was still a good experience.  The chicken dish, surprisingly, was delicious.  It's hard to make chicken interesting, I think.  And hard to mess up salmon.  So who knows what happened there. The only complaints-- there are very few vegetarian options.  Also, no interesting drink options that are non-alcoholic.  However, despite these complaints I will be coming back here.
