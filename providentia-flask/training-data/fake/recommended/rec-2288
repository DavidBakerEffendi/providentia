This place was packed and with good reason.  Not wanting to wait, we ordered to go and ate in the car.  I got the spicy pork balls with spicy meat sauce on a hero with provolone.  First the bread was perfect, crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  It is the perfect match.  The meatballs were tender and the spice gave it a mild kick.  My brother would tell you it is very hot, but he is a wuss when it comes to heat.  Can't wait to go back.
