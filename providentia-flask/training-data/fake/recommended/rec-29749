The Counting Room is dependable when it comes to strong, sociable bartenders, a really good beer and wine list, a few yummy (though limited) sandwich-y options for dinner, and local Williamsburg color. It can also be relatively crowded/noisy for the size of the space--and even more dark--but the vibe's always a 'good' one...
