No line at lunch on the snowiest day of the year in NYC!  Got a table for 6 immediately.  Was totally delicious - definitely all about the meat patty and deliciously soft, sesame seed bun.  Toppings are minimal - very unlike Five Guys.  Fries are mediocre- too crispy and thin for my taste.  Had a great time here; can't wait to get a beer the next time as drafts are $4.  Burgers are around $6. Was totally a steal and a really unique experience.
