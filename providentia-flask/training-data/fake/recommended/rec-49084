This has always been in my "must try" places since we've heard good things (the fact that this place is always packed is clear evidence of that lol). The place did not disappoint! I think the biggest hurdle anyone would face here is actually getting a table. We've come here before where the wait was up to 2 hours! Fortunately, the last time we went was only 25 minutes (for a table for 3), so we got lucky. I wouldn't advise going here in a big group. The meal itself was pretty tasty. The best thing I had were the fried green tomatoes. Great batter + good cheese + ranch = mouth-watering!! Definitely get that as your appetizer. For the main coures, we ordered the "Sweetheart Deal for 2" (yes, we actually ordered that lol), and it was definitely more than enough food for two people. It comes with your choice of four sides, and we got mashed potatoes + gravy, mac & cheese, collard greens with turkey, and BBQ fried rice. The BBQ ribs were delicious, and some of the sides were great, too. The only thing I was meh about is the mac & cheese, sadly. They make it with pimento cheese, which is not a great cheese to make mac & cheese with, in my opinion. I actually liked the BBQ fried rice the best, which was a pleasant surprise. I also liked that their sweet tea wasn't insanely full of sugar that we would get diabetes just from drinking a glass haha. Service could have been better. It wasn't horrendous, but there were a couple of times where we had to actively search for our server because it's been a while since we saw her and we needed something (and they weren't too swamped or understaffed to justify her being MIA). Overall, though, it was great experience, and really great food that I would come back when I have a craving for BBQ!
