Good soup! I often come here for take-out lunch since I work in the area. The small soup and half-sandwich combo ($6) is a perfect amount of food, and can be very filling if you get one of the richer soups like a bisque or the cheeseburger soup. The menu varies day to day, but they always have a few standard menu items if you're not feeling adventurous. Yes, the piece of fruit that comes with the soup is often kind of sad looking, but it's a nice touch.
