4 of us had dinner here recently on a Saturday night, it was a great experience & we had a lovely evening! The decor is beautiful, swanky/trendy, a large chandelier in the middle of the dining area & antique mirrors on the ceiling. The waitresses are dressed up in 1920s style with fascinators on their heads. The space is long and narrow. The crowd, young/lively/energetic. The service is very good-friendly & efficient. We were seated as soon as all 4 of us were there. They have a good mixed drink selection, tried the mojito & lychee sangria both were great. We had the coconut calamari & the avocado summer roll for appetizers, a variety of entrees which included the peanut Sauce Fried Rice (YUM) and Pad Thai. One of my friends ordered a dish that was way too spicy for her and the waiter took it back without any fuss and got her a fresh order of an alternate dish within 5-7 minutes! Over all, a very fun night. The best part is....$.....you get GREAT value for money at this place, we were actually surprised by the bill. A great dining out experience without burning a hole in your pocket. Probably my new fav Thai food spot. The one very SMALL negative: The place can get rather loud, but that's not a deal breaker.
