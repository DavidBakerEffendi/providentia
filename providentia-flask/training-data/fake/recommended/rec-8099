You know what I love most about Johnny Brenda's? It's not the great local beer selection, the unique food menu, loaded jukebox or the pool table. It's not even the fact that they have pretty good shows upstairs which don't mean a cover for people hanging out on the first floor.... It's that there are no TVs! Yet there are two 1-star reviews of this bar simply because they have no TV! If you like TV so much maybe you should sneak a six pack into Best Buy! They have TONS of 'em! JB's rules!
