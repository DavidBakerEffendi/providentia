This place is gonna be perfect someday. As of right now, it's got a few growing pains I think it needs to make it through, but it's pretty close to perfect for having been opened a few weeks. The brisket is so super flavorful, as is the pulled pork. If I can't decide, I opt for the 50/50 which has BOTH! The sides are probably the weakest part of this place... The potato salad is a little tooooo dressingy and the mac and cheese is kind of bland. I ordered the baked beans once on delivery and it was awful. I commented on the facebook page about it, and they said it was a bad batch. I'm eating a different batch of them right now, and while they're still a weeee bit sweet for me, they're pretty effin delicious. The root beer is also to die for... seriously, get some ice cream up in this shit so I can have the best root beer float EVER. My favorite thing about this place is how I feel like a celebrity every time I walk in. I've been given free pie, free cornbread while I wait, even some free spinach pie and another Greek dessert because it was just there. Everyone who works here is super nice. I wanna see this place succeed so badly, but since every time I walk in it's packed and it took me over a week to get to even try it because they kept selling out of everything, I doubt I need to worry. Also, my roommate and I bought a piece of roast for a party we were throwing, and holy shit, that cut of beef was so tender and amazing. The prices a little high for the amount of food you get. I know it's free range and grass fed, but I'm hoping they can try to lower it a bit (or give me some bigger helpings perhaps?) *Two restaurant orders, two seamless web orders and one take out order so far and they've been open barely a month, haha! If that doesn't speak to the fact that this place is good, I don't know what will.
