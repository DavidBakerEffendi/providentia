This place is great! I went here with a group of my friends for my best friend's birthday. After telling the restaurant before hand that it was her birthday they had a card waiting for her. We all ordered bottomless brunch and the drinks came quickly and weren't watered down. Our waiter was Casey, he was very attentive and never made us feel rushed to leave. The food was delicious and the portions were huge. We will most definitely be returning!!
