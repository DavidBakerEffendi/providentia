I guess you can say that I was really disappointed with the restaurant though I still did give them 3 stars for their wine selection, the price of the wine and the steak that my friends had that they seemed to enjoy. Most of the food that I tasted there was very salty which i guess made me drink more wine and therefor order more of the wine. Also i guess i gave them 3 stars because the service was not bad, not great but not bad. So bottom line is that for the money I would go somewhere else but if you like good wine for a good price than i guess it's worth checking the place out if you are in the neighborhood.
