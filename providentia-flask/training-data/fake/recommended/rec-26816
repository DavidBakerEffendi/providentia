Having two celiacs in the home makes getting specialty treats difficult. The Cakeover makes dessert special for us again. We bought the dark chocolate birthday cake and served it to our non gluten free friends and everyone loved it. I came back to sample some cookies and pastries. The jelly filled linzer tarts were special and the rugelach were delicious as well. The owner is super personable, too!
