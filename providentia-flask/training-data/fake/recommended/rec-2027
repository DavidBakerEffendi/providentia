A great bar!  I didn't eat anything here, but the food looked and smelled fantastic. The bartender we had (Scotty) was informative about the beer and was a fun guy to talk too.  Didn't try to but into conversations too much, but was there for a good laugh and we had a great time.  Definitely a great place to grab a beer and watch a game!
