I've been a patron of this restaurant since it originally opened on Belleville ave in Belleville.  The owner (who is a sweetheart) moved it to Montclair a few years ago and I've followed because the food is that good. Always consistent. Always yummy.  Always budget friendly.  You can easily have 2 apps, 2 entrees and a dessert for $35-40.  I live 30 mins away and still come up for the food, the Panang curry and crusty tofu is my favorite.
