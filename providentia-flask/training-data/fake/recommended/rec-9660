pan fried pork bao - 5 stars steamed pork soup dumplings - 4 stars steamed crabmeat & pork soup dumplings - 4 stars fried chives & pork dumplings - 4 stars scallion pancake - 3 stars Shanghai seafood fried rice cake - 3 stars decor - nice in the front but not so nice in the back.  If you are a large group, you will be at the back.  Space is cramped too. Got complimentary meat bao - looks great but not that great.
