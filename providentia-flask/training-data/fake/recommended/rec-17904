We went here for dinner a few weeks ago, and although there was a wait - the waiting area seating was comfortable. It was fairly loud inside, but nice atmosphere. The food was actually really good. We had previously gone when they first opened and were unimpressed, but this time the food was tasty. We had the coconut shrimp, and mahi mahi which were both delish. DO NOT get coffee after dinner, it was atrocious. We will definitely return.
