Essential stop when in NY, if for nothing else but the history. The pizza is wonderful. Truly. I'm not sure any place can claim "best pizza on the planet" but this is definitely one of my favorites by far. I love the crowded atmosphere and the fast service. Plus they give pitchers of soda and that just makes life so much easier.
