My husband I went in to split gnocchi and ordered what seemed to be a Caesar salad from their new menu. While the salad was interesting and had a unique flavor because the lettuce was grilled, it was one cross section of the lettuce head. We were really disappointed, especially because it was a $14 "salad." While the flavor was there, the price was not an accurate reflection. As for the gnocchi, our server told us it was made in house, and it was pretty good. Certainly wasn't the best gnocchi I've ever had, but it wasn't the worst either. For ~$24, it was a decent size plate and we easily split it. However $20+ for a plate of pasta seems a little steep considering how cheap it is to make. Overall, the food was good but the prices will probably deter us from returning. I'm fine with paying for an expensive dinner, but I want to get what I paid for.
