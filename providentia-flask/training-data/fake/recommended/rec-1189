Cheese Steak challenge. Who's going to win? Â Pat or Geno? After touring historic Philadelphia, it was time to settle the cheese steak question. Which one would I like better. At the corner of Passyunk & 9th Street you will find the two iconic cheese steak place in Philadelphia. They are literally across from each other. That gave us the chance to taste them side by side. The breakdown: Bread: slight edge to PAT's Whiz: even Grilled Onions: slight edge to GENO's Meat: GENO's The score: PAT (2) - GENO (3) By the thinness of margin, Geno WINS. The meat was the clincher. Geno's steaks were bigger pieces, tastier & more tender than Pat's. Don't get me wrong, I like them both. Pat's was delicious. And I wouldn't mind taking the same taste test next time I come to the city of brotherly love. Note: *Pat himself was taking the orders. *There are 2 windows. One to order your cheese steaks and the other to buy your drinks. *There are picnic tables & chairs where you can enjoy your sammy's. I challenge you to take the same taste test for yourself. Who would you prefer? Enjoy !!
