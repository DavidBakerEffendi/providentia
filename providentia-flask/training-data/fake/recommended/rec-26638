After trying out the three Italian store here, this is now my go to place for Italian supplies. I have people who comes in and buy their whole week of supplies, or may be they have a large family. Either way, hard to see someone spend a c-note if the food is not good. I particularly love their meat balls. Goes very well with their fresh pasta and home make sauce. The olive bar and anti-pasta bar are excellent. I am not a ravioli fan, but their ravioli is something to write home about. Only draw back is that it is a tiny place and it is always crowded. Luckily, people here are much less pushy then the other two places. Â Everyone move around the olive bar and pick out what they want and wait for their turns at the cashier. All very pleasant. An extra star for the nice customers!
