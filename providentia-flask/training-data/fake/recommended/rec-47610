Love Nixs! New hartford hotspot! I give 5 stars for the customer service and food combined. I've been here twice, staff have been great second time; above and beyond (thank you, Chris!). Food comes next, first time here we tried the raw bar platter shared nicely with 5 people. Pork sliders are definitely the ones to try here, it was my favorite app that was ordered from the whole group. This is a newly opened restaurant, potential lounge (;)) and I've heard from other friends/patrons who had different experiences, I guess it's a hit or miss but don't knock it till you try it
