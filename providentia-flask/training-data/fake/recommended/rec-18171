Okaaaayyyy you win, JB's. I come here too often to still dislike it. I haven't sat at the bar in ages, and the waitstaff is usually really nice. Plus, they STILL have Dogfish Head's Chicory stout on tap, and that stuff is supposed to be out of season. Mmm. Edit: I have seen a few shows here. Just an update for those wondering.
