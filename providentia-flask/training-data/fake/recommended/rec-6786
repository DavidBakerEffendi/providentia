I love a good Italian sandwich so when I read the article on Philly.com I knew this was a place I wanted to try. I walk past it on my way to work and today was the day. I walked in to find a modern style deli counter with large paper rolls hanging on the wall with the menu written out. The menu was simple with about 8 sandwiches on it. The Capri caught my eye first since I love fresh mozzarella but after looking at all the choices I went with the Italian Stallion. All fresh Italian meats and cheeses including salami, coppa and sharp provolone served on a seeded Italian roll. The pepperoncini aioli was excellent with the right amount of spice. Â It was the right balance of meat, cheese and bread. I will definitely be back to try the Capri and the Uncle G...roasted turkey with crispy pancetta? Yes, please!!
