A decent variety of dimsum, sushi, regular Chinese and American food on the buffet line. While it is greasy here, it is large and the service isn't too bad... seat was a bit sticky, though. Â That, and it took a while to get a re-fill on simple water. Some place to go if you have a large group of very randomly different tastes, as there's usually something for everyone.
