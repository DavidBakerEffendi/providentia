Wow! I was so impressed by this place! This restaurant was on my list of must eats for Philly after reading the yelp reviews and being a huge Mexican food fan. El Vez did not disappoint. The food was amazing and fresh! We had the guacamole with mangos, red bell pepper, jicama and habanero peppers. It was unique and fantastic! We went during brunch time and my plate of huevos sopes which was basically a Mexican version of eggs Benedict was incredible. I also highly recommend the mahi mahi tacos....one of the best fish tacos I've ever had. Their menu items are Mexican dishes but with a unique flair. Put this on your list too!
