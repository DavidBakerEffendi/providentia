Rigatony's has become my new go to Italian place for delivery. I've enjoyed their chicken and veal parm sandwiches, a couple of different soups (chicken noodle is chock full of hearty chicken), and their thin crust pizza. It's reasonably priced and delivery is quick. I can't speak to the restaurant itself, though, but for delivery it's a cinch.
