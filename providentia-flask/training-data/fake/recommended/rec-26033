Love this place! The decor is so cute and they have outside seating! Â My husband and I came here to get a sweet tooth fix the other night so I've only tried their dessert crepe (caramel, almond, whipped cream and vanilla ice cream) and it was terribly delicious! So I will be def. going back for some brunch/lunch crepes. We also had a glass of the sauvignon blanc, which was nice and crisp very refreshing. They are very generous with their wine, which is always nice =) Oh and the wait staff was very nice! Excellent place.
