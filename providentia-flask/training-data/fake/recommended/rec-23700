When I called to place my order I was told it would be delivered in 45 minutes to 1 hour. The food did not arrive in the time promised. I ordered the chicken soup and the soup was incredibly salty. I also got the vegetable casserole, it really had no flavor what so ever. My husband ordered the lamb shish kebabs, he asked for the meat to be cooked medium, but when it arrived the meat was dry and bland. We will definitely not be ordering from here again. I am really surprised at how tasteless the food was considering the yelp rating.
