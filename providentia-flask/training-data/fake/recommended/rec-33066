If you've got a seafood kick, this is the place to go.  Packed on evenings and weekends, of course - it's Princeton, but now that they take reservations you have no excuse not to give this place a try.  It doesn't try to be over the top fancy which is important for a seafood gem so the flavors of the fresh ingredients aren't masked.  Try to get there early if you want to indulge in their specials (they run out early on in the night).  Good food, lively atmosphere.
