It was saturday afternoon, overcast, I was out roaming around with my camera playing my tourist role. My tummy started to grumble big time, so I whipped out my phone like Quick Draw McGraw, and in a flash the Yelp's nearby button had me heading toward Nanzhou. The place was packed, but I was at the head of the queue, I preordered the sea food noodle standing by the door, the line outside was getting longer by the minute. A couple were done eating, but they were taking their sweet time. Yo, give up the seat already, go yak somewhere else! Well, I don't think I say it out loud, but they definitely caught my stink eye though. I ended up sharing the table with a lady and her young son waiting behind me, they seems to be in a hurry, and it beats eating all by myself. I was trying to peek at the TV behind me that was playing some Chinese movie, and happened to see the guy at the next table with a bow of wonton, OMG, how could I missed the wonton on the menu, I haven't had wonton in ages, I started to drool just looking at his bowl, so I had to order one too, plus they were only $2.5, you can't go wrong there. I tell you what, those were the tiniest wonton I've ever seen in my life, but there were at least a dozen or more in my bowl, they were oh so delicious! And then my steaming bowl of sea food noodle magically appeared in front of me, same tasty broth, the noodle was cooked perfectly, yumfest. I got out for just under $10, with a few bucks for tip, you can bet your sweet cheeks I'm coming back for more.
