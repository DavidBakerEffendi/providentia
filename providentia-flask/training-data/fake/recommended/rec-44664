So damn good! The sandwiches were delicious and the wine was even more delicious. Great atmosphere. Loved all the samples on our way in. Cute little hidden table area near the back. Enjoyed being able to pick out and purchase a bottle of wine next door and then sit down and eat and enjoy the food as well the as bottle of wine.
