This place was very casual. I loved it. We got seated with 2 Japanese girls that were visiting new york for the week-end, which shows how people randomly sit at the same table. The service sucked, (we had to ask for one dish several time, we got rushed out of the restaurant cause it was late) but I would completely expect that. We ordered a scallion pancake, chinese spinach, and soup dumplings (and some other dumplings, but I was not there for the first one). The pancake and the spinach were ok, but the soup dumplings were delicious. If I go back there again, I would go to the point, and only order soup dumplings. The dumpling were able to hold the soup with no problems, and were not soggy on the outside, while every bites will fill your mouth with the delicious soup !
