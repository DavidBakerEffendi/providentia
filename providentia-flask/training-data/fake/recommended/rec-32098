I live right around the corner from here and I have stopped in a few times for various items. Their PT Coffee is always fresh and delicious! I have gotten a few of their specialty drinks and have yet to be disappointed. I've also gotten just a plain coffee, this was a bit too strong for my liking but still good nonetheless. I have gotten a few muffins from here as well, always moist and delicious! Recently I tried their dumpling soup. WOW! First of all you can SEE every ingredient from the large string beans, to the healthy amount of chicken, carrots, beans, and even cracked pepper. It then is served with a dumpling that is the perfect size to have a bite of it in every bite and not have time to get soggy. I will be coming back for this for sure! The atmosphere is warming, the owner will personally introduce herself to you and you can tell she is passionate about what she has created. The other workers always have a helpful hat on and are patient with you when you are trying to decide what to order (as everything sounds amazing!) They also deliver your meal to the table for you, which is nice. There is music playing that is somewhat loud so if you have work to do (which the set up is conducive and inviting for you to stay awhile and get some work done) bring headphones. The best part about this place: NO CREDIT CARD MINIMUM!!! I hate going to coffee shops, realizing I don't have cash then not being able to get something because there is a $5 or $10 minimum and my coffee is only $4. Or worst, ordering a muffin or something small to meet the minimum and having it taste horrible. Also, I have not been here on any of these nights but as I walk by I notice live bands in there sometimes at night. I wish they advertised the nights that this occurs better as I would definitely plan on stopping in one night to check it out.
