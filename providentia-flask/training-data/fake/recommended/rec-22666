Came here for the first time today with a friend for lunch and was kinda torn. The French dip was good but really tiny for 9 bucks with just a small side of greens. Au jus was oily, shiitake mushrooms were really scarce, baguette was OK, roast beef was tender but a little overdone, but what saved this sandwich was the horseradish mayo incredible.   From what I tasted the adult grilled cheese  was great, thick buttery bread, sharp aged cheddar, & delicious caramelized onions. Overall good service but wow holy hipsters....I'll be back for dinner
