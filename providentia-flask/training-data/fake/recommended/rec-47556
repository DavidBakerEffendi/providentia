I went there for the first time because I wanted to finally experience the legend that is Rutts Rippers..I must say I walked away kind of disapointed. the 2 dogs i ordered were ok, not great, but ok..they were a bit overdone and chewy ..and the onion rings were really so so..i didnt like the homemade yellow relish that much either, Â it was warm and soupy. the rolls were real disapointing too..yknow I dont know what the hell i was expecting out of a hot dog, maybe a little too much, but the way people go on about these I really thought this was going to be the holy grail of hot dog eating experiences. ive had better pushcart dogs in town..i did love the throwback to the 50's bar set up tho and retro signage... may go again and give them one more try if im in the lyndhurst area.. but never traveling over an hour for them again. Ill be sticking with Galloping Hill Inn in Union or Charlie's in Kenilworth for my hot dog needs in the immediate future..
