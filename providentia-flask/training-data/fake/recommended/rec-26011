This was my second time at Beco and I really enjoyed it. The food & drinks are great and generally pretty cheap. We started with the cheese bread & Portuguese sausage which were both amazing. A number of us got the pork & bean stew main dish. It is traditional Brazillian and very good. The item that stole the show though was the steak sandwich. It was fantastic! Great flavor, good bread and it comes with the cutest mini fries you have ever seen. We also worked are way through multiple pitchers Â of caipirinhas which were delish and at only $28 each are a good deal. The only reason I won't give this place five stars is because I was pretty unimpressed with the service. We had a reservation but when we arrived they said it would be at least 20 more minutes before we could be seated. It also seemed like they were a bit understaffed because once we were seated the waitress barely came to our table. Regardless, we had a great time and it is a fun somewhat hidden gem.
