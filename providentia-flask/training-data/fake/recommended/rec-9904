Wow! What a great find. Like a diamond in the rough, this place was an unexpected find that quickly turned into a big hit. The Matador combo and sangria are amazing, and easily shared by two. The space has a beautiful build out featuring floating walls and a ceiling of branches. The staff are helpful and friendly. We will definitely go back.
