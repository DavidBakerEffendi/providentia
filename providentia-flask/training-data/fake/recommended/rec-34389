Fantastic, one of our favorites nearby.  Again a flatbread style pizza which is nothing like regular pizza (i.e. Juniors, or Three Brothers).  They have a wonderful selection and you can make your own but simply outstanding taste and if you like things spicy ask for the hot sauce and make sure you have extra water or whatever you are drinking as you'll need it but it awesome if you like spicy.  Salads are always good and and dessert too and almost all items are local and organic.  Again get there early, or late or you can have them half bake pies to go and cook at home but just not as great as when you get a table there inside or out in the alley.
