Have been trying to get a table here for a while, was surprised when OpenTable had room during restaurant week, so booked for a group.  While we wished we were large enough for the private room table, we got a corner table which was plenty spacious for 5.  We went on the early side and it was certainly packed by the time we left. Very cool space, must be great in the warmer weather when they open the doors. Four of us had starters, 2 the salad with pancetta, I had the kale and pecorino salad which was fantastic, and one had the citrus salad, which was good, but not as special.  Kale salad was a real hit. For dinner, one chicken, one pork, one monkfish stew, one bucatini with clams and one gnocchi with walnut pesto.  The gnocchi were super light and also crispy on the outside, not sure how that was managed, but it was delicious.  I didn't try the meats, but the pastas and the fish were all delicious. Great service, great wine list, would definitely go back.
