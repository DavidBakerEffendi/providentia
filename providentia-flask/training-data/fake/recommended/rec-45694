We went there last night and although I hadn't been there before, my fiancée had.  Absolutely great food, ample portions and terrific atmosphere.  Vasantha's place is a gem for Bayonne and we're lucky to have Andrew's Project in town. You won't leave hungry or disappointed!  Excellent place to eat and you certainly won't feel rushed.
