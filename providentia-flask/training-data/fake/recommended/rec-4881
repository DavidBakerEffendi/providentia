The service stands out the most.  I've eaten dinner at this restaurant three times so far.  Each time, the service has been very friendly and attentive.   The food is good.  I've tried the chicken schnitzel (that's flat, breaded chicken), grilled hangar steak, and pasta with rosemary sauce.  Good, good and good.   The desserts are yummy... and heavy.  They have a nice carrot cake.  I few months ago, I tried a berry bread pudding.  I'm still digesting it, but it was good ;)
