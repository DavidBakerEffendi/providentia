Dalessandro's has been my favorite Philly Cheese Steak choice since the first time I tasted one of their sandwiches. Recently, I asked someone to pick up a couple steaks on their way over. When the steaks arrived, and we sat down to eat, I was so disappointed. I huffed that Dalessandro's must have changed a key ingredient or ratio. I was so sad. Turns out, my friend had gone across the street and picked up sandwiches from someplace else, without telling me. If you can TELL the difference - there must be a reason :) (My friend will not try to trick me again). Always great service, love the beer selection. Take-out or eat-in it's a great, casual, be easy kind of place, with tasty food.
