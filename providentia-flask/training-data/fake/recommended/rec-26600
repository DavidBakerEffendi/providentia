I have never had a bad meal at Il Bambino, and I've gone here for all possible meals. The crostinis are always a delight, impossible to choose between them. Mozzarella, pesto and chili oil? Yes please! Goat cheese, honey, rosemary? Yes again! The truffle egg salad? You will never be the same. The tapas plates are great to share with a small group, everyone gets to try. There's an excellent list of accompanying wines. I haven't even mentioned the brunch menu! It's bliss. You can keep your tab low, but you won't want to. It's worth it.
