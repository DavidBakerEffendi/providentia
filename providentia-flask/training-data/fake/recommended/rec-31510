I can't speak highly enough about L'Angolo. I went there for dinner for the first time a year ago as my "carbo-loading" before the Broad Street Run. Let me tell you, there is no better place in the city to fill up on pasta than L'Angolo. I've been there several times throughout the year since then, and every time I have been there (regardless of the occasion or party size), the service has been impeccable and the food has been incredible. I would make recommendations, but I have seriously not had anything there that I wouldn't recommend and/or order again. No matter what you order, you won't be disappointed.
