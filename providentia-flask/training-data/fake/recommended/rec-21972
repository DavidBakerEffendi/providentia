I was curious to see if Ippudo would live up to the hype, especially after having tried several other really good ramen places in the past. First, let's talk about the wait... or lack of a wait, actually... We drove in from NJ on Sunday morning and parked a couple of blocks away. Since Ippudo opens at 11am and we were worried about the wait, we actually showed up around 10:30am and were the only people there. Within the next 20 minutes, several more people showed up and a small crowd started to form. Everyone was seated quickly as soon as they opened and we noticed anyone arriving between 11-11:30am were pretty much able to be seated immediately. My tip is that if you want to avoid a long line, get there early. Now, onto the ramen. I ordered the Shoyu ramen and hubby ordered the Classic. We both thought that the noodles were by far the best noodles we have had at any ramen place and so yes, they absolutely lived up to the hype. The broth was also very good. The pork itself was nothing special (which is the primary reason for the 4-star rating) but I suppose it's the noodles and broth that are really important. Pricing was okay by NYC standards ($13 for shoyu ramen and $14 for Classic). The service was friendly and ambiance very pleasant. So did it live up to the hype? I'd say yes -- it wasn't anything mind-blowing but it was still some of the tastiest ramen I've ever had.
