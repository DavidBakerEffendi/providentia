I'm a huge fan of ramen and always had to run into the city to satisfy my urge. Not anymore!! Absolutely delicious, priced fairly and on par if not better than all the other ramen spots in NYC. Only drawback is that it is a little cramped and you will definitely be waiting for a table (I always look at this as a good thing). If you're in downtown Brooklyn and are looking for some good eats, hit this place up.
