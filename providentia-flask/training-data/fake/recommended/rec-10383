Review is for he Bar Only! We only came in here for beers, wish we would have ordered something to eat.  This was the first bar that was on our list to go to since it is a Historical Landmark & one of the oldest (If not the oldest) Bars in New York (Yes even alcoholics can enjoy American History).  We had a great time sitting up at the bar talking with one of the locals & the bartender who was really nice.  You can actually take your beer outside of this bar and sit at the outdoor chairs though there is no official patio, the bartender said they are the only bar allowed to do it.  It is nothing really all that fancy but just really really cool place to go and everyone was nice.
