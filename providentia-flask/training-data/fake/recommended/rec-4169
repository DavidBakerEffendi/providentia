Was there on a Friday evening and had to wait a long time to get a drink at the crowded bar. Was pleased to see that the restaurant was so inviting and well-appointed (white table cloths, etc.). Ordered the 'special' fish fry and it was awful: much greasy batter and almost no fish.  The waiter's service could be described as ambivalent at best. I've gotten less attitude from homophobic counter servers in hick town diners.   With so many great restaurants in Philly, Knock is really not worth the patronage of the gay community or anyone else. My sincere regrets to the family with children who were poorly treated at this place.
