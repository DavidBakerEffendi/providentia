Ordered the hot pot.  They  "combined" multiple portions into ONE bowl and then charge you for 2 (if you come as a couple).  We ordered 2 portions of plain udon to fortify our hot pot  noodles for which they charged us 8 dollars -  for what was clearly 1 small portion.  I caught them red-handed and pointed this out in the bill.    They denied it....I think it was a kind of Japanese face-saving thing to hide their embarrassment.  Didn't pursue it further though as I didn't think it was worth their Japanese chef committing hari-kiri over a bowl of noodles.  Sorry suckers, we're not coming back.
