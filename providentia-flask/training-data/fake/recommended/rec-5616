Amazing Japanese! Pork bun was out of control, ramen was awesome, add a bottle of sake and it was an amazing dinning experience.   The staff was great, very helpful with menu selections and attentive to service.  Went just after 5 when they start dinner service and there was no wait, leaving the place over an hour later was another story.  Go early, very early, but if you must wait know that it will all be worth it once the food hits the table.
