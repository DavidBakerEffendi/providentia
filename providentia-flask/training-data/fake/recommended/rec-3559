Mixed experience at Umami Burger points me toward three stars, though I'd definitely go back to try the burgers again: 1.  The wait outside (on this past Saturday night, at least) is totally manufactured.  I HATE THIS.  The hostess told us 30 minutes for a party of two at around 7:45, but we waited 10 minutes while only seeing one group of four come out.  When they led us in, there were not only a couple open tables on the first floor, but the second floor was about 2/3s full.  Having people stand around outside maybe increases your cool quotient, restaurateurs, but not when you're faking it.  I hate to think how long they force people to wait when closer to capacity.   2.  Our server was completely wasted.  To be fair, he led off with "tonight is my last night working here, and I am working a double" -- but that was basically the only thing I understood him saying.  I'm no puritan, but it didn't exactly project the best image for the restaurant.  The service in general seemed really disorganized, lots of plates crashing and glasses breaking behind the bar and in the pickup area.   3.  The food, however, is very good.  I had the Hatch burger, medium rare.  The roasted pepper was not spicy at all, but the burger was perfectly cooked and juicy.  I thought the truffle fries were quite good as well, though maybe they could have been done a little crispier for my taste.  The accompanying sauces were all excellent.  I'd buy their hot sauce and ketchup by the bottle. (Also, to the reviewer whose friend proposed -- I'm pretty sure we came in on the middle of that.  The ice cream sandwiches did look good.  Congratulations!)
