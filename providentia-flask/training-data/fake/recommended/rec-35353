First impressions.. looks deserted from the outside.  We go in, an Indian girl in her mid 20's welcomes us in Japanese.  A little strange.. but ok.. get seated, ALL the patrons except us were Japanese, a good sign.. ALL the waiters were Indian, again.. a little strange.. but sure whatever. Sister ordered a dinner set and I ordered a chicken katsu curry.  Food quality was good, the portions for the price was not.   The $11 chicken katsu cutlet was 4 small pieces in a swimming pool of curry.  Dinner set tenderloin cutlet was served soggy in a sort of sauce.  I've never understood soggy katsu, but it is the second time I've seen it done. Where it starts going downhill.. ordered a bottle of sake for our group of 3 and the waiter shows up with 2 cups.. what are we supposed to do, drink out of the bottle?  Ordered water, didn't come until we were almost finished eating, after we had to ask for it again. Paid the check, and the waiter sends it back saying we didn't give enough tip.. that maybe we made a mistake.  No mistake son!  I pulled a Joe Pesci from Goodfellas.. bet they'll think twice next time they try to charge a tourist 20% tip on the post tax amount. Bottom line, good food, small portions, overpriced, complete lack of cultural understanding.  Will not be returning again
