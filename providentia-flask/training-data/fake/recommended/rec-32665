It makes me sad to write this review. I LOVE Da Mikele in Tribeca, the sister restaurant to Ovest, so we thought to give this a try. The pizza was soggy, we were given the wrong appetizer (sardines instead of rice balls, really?),and our waitress must have been having a bad night, she was downright rude. The nail on the coffin's head was when the smell of weed came wafting into the restaurant. I asked my husband if he could smell it, he could. I see our waitress and a waiter laughing about it next to us. I turn and ask them if someone is smoking in the restaurant, they laughed and said no. I asked if they could close the window or at least ask the people smoking to step away from the open doors of the restaurant. Our waitress scoffs at me, rolls her eyes and says no. I got up to leave, to the embarrassment of my husband. I told the waitress this is unacceptable for a restaurant and I would not eat here. She walked away and 5 minutes later the smell was gone. Never eating here again.
