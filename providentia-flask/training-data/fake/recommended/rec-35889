A little bit of Paris in Soho, Manhattan.  This exquisite restaurant never disappoints.  The food is superb and the staff is friendly and sophisticated.  The decor is beautiful and inviting.  I always invite friends visiting from Europe and South America to join me there.  We all love it and recommend it highly.
