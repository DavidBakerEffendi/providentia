I love the Gateway Bistro!  Staff is always friendly and food is always delicious!  I usually get the mixed salads.  Like stated previously, if you add a lot onto these salads they get kind of pricey but if you get the standard salads listed they are average price.  They only take debit or cash which just changed maybe this past year but when I have a little extra money to splurge, I always go there.  They have everything and have a lot of healthy options for you to choose from.  Go there, you won't be disappointed!
