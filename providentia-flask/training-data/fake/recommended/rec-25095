Appetizer of steamed dumplings was great. The "chef's special"'of crispy chicken was pretty much inedible. Chicken was so thin and the frying process just made it chewy and stringy. I've always had a good meals here in the past. This was a huge disappointment. In their favor, they did take the meal off the bill hence the 3 stars.
