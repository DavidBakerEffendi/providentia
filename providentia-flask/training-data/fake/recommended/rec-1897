I flew from Houston to Philly and took a cheesesteak tour.  I don't know what it is about food up north (no offense) but it tends to be pretty plain and dry.  I get why people who leave Houston always say they miss the food (bbq, tex-mex etc).  So aside from the fact that I believe if you thinly sliced ribeye and grill or griddle with onions, salt, pepper, and garlic powder, then put it on a hogie roll or bolleo bun with either chili con queso, cheese whiz or provelone- that you will end up with a cheesesteak better than any that the blander Philly has to offer.   That said, this was actually a pretty good cheesesteak.  The flavor of the ribeye and the roll came through well.  They use provelone and it was awesome as well.  They are great at grilling onions and they stop right when they carmelize.  It was good enough that when my friend flew up there next day, I took him there too and it was awesome again!. Very friendly staff, its a fair part of town, but fun to hang out at the tables outside, listen to the locals talk Eagles football, and watch the neighbors in the row houses next door enjoying the weather.
