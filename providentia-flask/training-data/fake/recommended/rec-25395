DO NOT EAT HERE! I figured I would support this place on its grand opening, HUGE MISTAKE! Ordered Flank Steak Pho and grilled chicken, ended up violently ill a few hours later; ended up in the the emergency room and several days off from work. If they can't get it right on its premiere, this is an indication of what's to come. As I type this I am still a hostage to my bathroom. So, if you like being violently ill. this is your place!
