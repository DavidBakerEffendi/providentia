Phenomenal. One of the most consistently great brunches in the city. The eggs Benedict are to die for! The servings are large and the quality outstanding. Speaking of outstanding, prepare to be out standing in the street for anywhere up to 3 hours from the time you arrive. Prepare your day accordingly. Just a tip: there is a place not one minute up the road that is cheaper, faster, and less crowded. The food is slightly worse and the portions a bit smaller but certainly worth saving you a good sized chunk of your day.
