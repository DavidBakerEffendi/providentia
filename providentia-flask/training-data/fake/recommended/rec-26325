Awesome falafels. I was very impressed. A bit pricey but you do get what you paid for. I really would have wanted the place to be a little bigger but that would take away from it being so cute. You should give it a go. Scared? Get the green falafel sandwich with the first drink on the Drink list. That'll make you happy :)
