Went to katsu-Hama for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed the meal. Prices for the set meal range from about $15-$20 and we chose Berkenshire katsu and a miso katsu. Had reservations for two but stil waited about 10 minutes for a table, oh well.   Some previous comments about the wait staff not being Japanese, but didn't make any real impact on the dining experience.  The hostess was Japanese, the majority of the wait staff were Indian.  The other diners at the restaurant were pretty much 99% Asian. The food was pretty good.  Started off with a pancake type appetizer and thought it was fun to grind the sesame seeds to add on top.  The aroma when grinding the seeds was also very pleasant. Ordered the pork Berkenshire set meal.  The Berkshire pork was a couple dollars more expensive than the standard pork and is to be of a higher grade meat and I guess a higher fat content.  I thought it tasted good but a bit too fatty for me.  I actually more preferred the miso pork set meal that we had as I'd rather have more meat than fat.  But I guess it comes down to preferences. On each table is a container of the brown sauce that you ladle onto your meat and rice.  I love that type of sauce and like that I can add as much as I please where others serve katsu with a predetermined amount. Had to read the menu a couple times to make sure I understood that the difference between ordering ala carte vs. the set menu was the addition of rice and miso soup.  I thought it weird because I don't know how one would want to eat katsu without rice. The miso soup served with the set was fantastic.  Very flavorful and loaded with onions and seaweed.  The rice was just that, white rice.  The katsu pork is accompanied on the plate with a pile of shredded lettuce with dressing on the table you add.   Overall, a good dinner experience at a reasonable price.  Katsu is one of my favorite Japanese dishes so I'm fan.
