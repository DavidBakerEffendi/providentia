Nice place in Korea town to pick up quickly & go! Woorijib is buffet style self serve restaurant with lots of pre-packaged dishes. Most of their foods are delicious. When I was living alone, this place was like a heaven since you can buy various small dishes (korean banchan) and eat them throughout the week as long as you have rice at home! I still go there for lunch time to time!
