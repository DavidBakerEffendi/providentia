This is one of my favorite places to eat in Philly.  I know that most people love it for brunch, but I usually go for dinner because I absolutely love their dinner entrees (plus I don't like to wait).  I love any of their meatloaf or pork chop specials.  The meatloaf stuffed with long hots and bacon is absolutely delicious and the portion size is huge!  It comes with either garlic mashed potatoes or mashed sweet potatoes (or half and half as our waitress suggested the last time we were there, perfect!) and a side of veggies.  I've thought about ordering their stuffed french toast for dessert, but that would just be insanity.  They have a great dessert menu too...my favorite was the white chocolate bread pudding, but that was a few years ago and I haven't seen it back on the menu since then.   When I do make it for brunch, I always call beforehand and put my name on the list so I don't have to wait too long.  I think their egg white frittata and omelettes are some of the best in the city, so light and fluffy.  The Le Bus toast that comes with the savory options is delicious as well.  You can't go wrong with their french toast (although it will make you feel physically ill if you eat the whole thing) and special pancakes.  I wouldn't recommend ordering their regular pancakes, they're just so-so and you will be disappointed when everyone else gets their food.   Overall, a great place to enjoy huge portions of delicious comfort food :)
