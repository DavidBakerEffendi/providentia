EVERYTHING is good. Oxtail stew knocked my wool socks off. They open at 3pm which is pretty late, and I've been craving it so hard sometimes that I'm there at 3. However, in my experience, the food tastes better in the evening when everything has had a chance to marinate and slow cook for a longer period of time, or at least that's my guess. I remember the oxtail and curry goat tasting better at night, but the jerk chicken was great all the time. That being said, it's not AWFUL at 3 by any means. The difference is between really good at 3 and Oh-my-god-this-is-so-good-i-have-to-rethink-my-Â­life good. The place is tiny and you can miss it if you're not looking for it, which is awesome because it doesnt attract tourists wandering from the brooklyn museum. The upstairs reminds me of being the cabin of a small sailboat. It gets a little toasty up there when all the food steam rises to the ceiling.
