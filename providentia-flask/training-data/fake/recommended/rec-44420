Great place for lunch.  Always passed it on my way to other brunch spots but finally got around to trying it. The chicken sandwich was quite delicious (suggest adding bacon) but would recommend subbing home fries for regular fries as my dates home fries were spectacular (I helped myself).  Service is very nice although did feel a bit cramped at our two person table.
