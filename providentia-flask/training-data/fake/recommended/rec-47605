Ichiban is a great place to go to for good, reasonably priced sushi.  The sushi itself is about a 6 on a scale of 1-10. However, 2 visits ago there was a hair on my sushi plate.  It was definitely not mine.  And last time I went, there was a bone in one of the rolls, a black extremely chewy thing in another roll, and a gnat on the plate.  To be honest, I haven't been back since.  And now every time I think of sushi, I'm doomed to imagine bugs, hairs, bones and weird chewy things.
