I'm really big on wine and hadn't been to Terroir yet, so it was delight to find such a great wine bar.  They had a lovely selection, here's what we drank: A bottle of White Rioja -- a varietal I hadn't had before, it was SUPERB and I want to find where I can buy it for home. A bottle of Riesling -- it wasn't too sweet, just right for the varied tastes of our group.  Lovely. A magnum of Muscadet -- lovely.  And this is where it got a bit hazy. But, I DO remember that the waiter was terribly helpful, the food paired very well (of which I should have ate more!), and everything we drank was a party in my mouth.  I'd definitely come back here.
