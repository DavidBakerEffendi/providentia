I think it's safe to say that I'm still in the honeymoon phase after moving to LIC.  If that's the case, Open Door is a little like that drink in a coconut they give you on the beach every morning. Friendly staff, good food and a great ambiance. You can tell Nick, the owner, is in it for the love.  The brunch is consistently top notch (duck confit hash and the capn crunch french toast are my go tos, but try anything - it's all good).  Pair that up with unlimited mimosas and you're good to go.  Not to mention, the prices are more than reasonable.  Overall, a solid neighborhood spot.
