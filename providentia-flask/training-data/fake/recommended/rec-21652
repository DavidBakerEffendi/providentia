I have been going there for over 35 years, so listen up. The food is VERY good. If you have a problem with your meal, just tell them and they will take care of it. The wine prices are VERY high. The service is good-great (they move fast). My Wife and I had our wedding there in 2004 and we were treated like royalty. You need to know what time of day to go there or you WILL wait. Iberia down the street is not even in the same league as Fornos.
