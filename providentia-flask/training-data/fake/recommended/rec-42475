I moved to Montclair back in March of 2013 and was always looking for a place with Middle Eastern food that was quality food and quality service.  I've been here a couple times, but tonight really stood out. I called around 7:00pm to place an order for one beef and one chicken shwarama, gave my name, and was told it'd be ready in 10 minutes.  However once I got there, I was told that somebody else with my exact name picked up the same exact order and that mine wasn't there.  They told me that they'd make the order again, but at that point I was pretty frustrated and left.  While I wasn't sure exactly how accurate that claim was, I was sure that I wouldn't ever come back. When I got home, I called to find out exactly what happened and hung up with the front lady even more frustrated.  What got me was that, the owner himself called me back a minute later and apologized for what happened. On top of that, he told me that he'd make a new order and have it delivered for no cost! I couldn't believe it! This was QUALITY service, and while other food places would simply act like it didn't happen, this guy made it a point that he didn't want to lose a customer and fixed the problem as best as he could. The order came and the food was as usual amazing, but tonight the quality of service is what stood out.  You guys are awesome, thanks for customer service that really cares!
