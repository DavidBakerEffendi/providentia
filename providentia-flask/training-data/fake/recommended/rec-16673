Being a breakfast person, I have to have eggs every weekend since I can never have them during the week, so brunch is my favorite time of the weekend. And my vote for best brunch in the EV is definitely Yuca Bar. They have a $15 pre fixe brunch which gets you your meal, coffee/tea, AND a bloody mary/mimosa/screwdriver. Personally I always get the breakfast burrito, which is fantastic. I always get the home fries, which has potatoes and sweet potatoes in it. Awesome. The portion is big as well, I can never finish the whole plate. When the weather's nice, you can sit outside as well, which makes for a nice Saturday/Sunday morning or afternoon, depending on how much you drank the night before. The Smith always get the pub in the EV for whatever reason, but it's food doesn't come close to Yuca Bar. Meanwhile you'll wait for an hour at The Smith but you can always sit right down at Yuca Bar. Hmm, maybe I shouldn't be telling everyone this, as I don't want to have to wait for my burrito.
