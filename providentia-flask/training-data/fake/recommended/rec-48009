This place is a true delight!  The last two Sundays I've been running errands in the LES or Chinatown and wanted a quick and cheap breakfast sandwich.  I took a stab at searching for "sandwich shop" on yelp and I saw this place.  I can't believe I was so lucky to find it.  I have now been twice and just got a simple egg and cheese on a biscuit.  It was only $4.95 and it was amazing.  They put a lot of egg on there and the cheese is melty.  The biscuit it excellent as well and I really could not have asked for a better breakfast sandwich.  I agree that it's small and not the most comfortable seating, but if you are getting something to go or wanting to stop in for a quick meal then it's perfect.  It's not a place to come to brunch with a group of friends. On my way out today they stopped me to give me a fresh and delicious beignet that they had just taken out.  Both the beignet and this place are true treats!
