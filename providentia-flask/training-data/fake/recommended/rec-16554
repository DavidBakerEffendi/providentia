I went here last night before the Herbie Hancock show at Carnegie Hall. The food was universally amazing. We ate almost everything on the menu, so if there's a clunker on there - then I just didn't encounter it last night. This is a great alternative to the sea of mediocre, theatre district options. A little warning. The place is cute as a button, but it is also Â TINY. We were lucky enough to snag a table, but I don't recommend taking your chances. Make a reservation!
