Johnny Brenda's is such a cool spot to catch a show. I agree with others who described it as a both intimate and spacious. The balcony is great and gives you a terrific view of the performance. I also appreciated the upstairs bar, which has the same draft list. No jostling downstairs to get to the main bar. Bathrooms are clean and big. They even have an old-timey photo strip machine, which is pretty awesome. Good, reasonably priced, seasonal draft list.
