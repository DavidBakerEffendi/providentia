I showed up at Jones for a birthday party on a Saturday night with my girlfriend.  We had a reservation for 8:00 PM but we were not seated until about 8:45.  We had a bigger group which is why we made the reservation, they struggled to accompany 10 people.  The waiting area is close to non-existent.  We had to wait in front of the doors moving to let people in and out.  The atmosphere was very trendy, nice and clean.  Music was a little loud which made it hard to hear the other people with us.  I looked at the menu and decided to share a dish with my girlfriend.  She got the cheese (hold the beef) burger and I got a black and white shake.  The shake was a little over priced for the size.  If you wanted a "grown up" shake with alcohol, be prepared to spend about $11.00  The food came and it was nothing special.  The burger was alright, the shake was alright, and the fries were cold and soggy.  Since it was someone's birthday, one of the guests with us made a pumpkin cheesecake.  The restaurant was going to charge us a $10 "cutting fee" since it wasn't their dessert.  I can see if we were a smaller group, but like I said before we were a group of 10 ordering a good amount of food.
