Nam Nam is a great addition to the neighborhood.  I had the chicken sandwich yesterday and was pleasantly surprised by how tasty it was.  The meat/ cabbage to bread ratio was very balanced and is similar to the ones i've had in chinatown.  Coffee is a good value.   Staff is friendly, the cafe doesn't have an awning/ sign so it can easily be missed.
