The grilled corn and Cuban sandwich is legit! I have tried to sway away and order other entrees on the menu but I always go back to the amazing Cuban. I like their shrimp tacos too, if only they served 3/4 tacos instead of rice and beans. Only setback was my friend's chicken salad was dry. Service could be better. Fortunately there was no wait for us but Â we never got water to our table. I know the tables are small and every inch of space gets fill up quickly but c'mon guys. Basic table service requirement is to serve your patrons water once seated!
