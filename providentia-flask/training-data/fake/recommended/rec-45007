i've been wanting to try this burger for a long time and on a rainy night after work, my colleagues and i went for it. i got the bistro burger and fries and it was a good "bar burger," but nothing to go crazy for. the burger itself was juicy and tasted good but was cooked medium rare when i asked for medium well, the bacon was deep-fried to the point of it being dry, burnt and shriveled up into tiny pieces - so it had absolutely no flavor. the fries on the other hand were really good. with all the delicious burgers in this city, i wouldn't waste my time with this one again.
