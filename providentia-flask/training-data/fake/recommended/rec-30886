My guy and I happened on this cute place by accident and was delishly (his new word) surprised. I actually give the food a 4. One star comes off because although the place seemed pretty clean it had a weird smell and holes in the seats of the booth (not sure if that is part of the overall aesthetic). Also, the waitress provided reasonable service but seemed nervous possibly harried and the place was not crowded and the patrons that were there appeared low-key. She also forgot my coffee which is a no-no on a Sunday morning after a late Saturday night.
