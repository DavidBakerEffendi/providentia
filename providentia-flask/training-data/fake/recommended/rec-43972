First thing I noticed as I walked in to The Anchor was the jukebox. It really gives the place an old-style, classic vibe. We came on a wednesday night, and while the place certainly wasn't packed, it was alive. Extensive beer selection and good food - buffalo wings here are heavenly. Tiffany the waitress is hot.
