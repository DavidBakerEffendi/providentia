The pizza was ok. My family and I went here before a show at the Montclair Theater and I was expected a bit more. I was hoping for really good Neapolitan pizza and I have definitely tasted better than this one. The atmosphere was really rushed although that might have just been because there were many people there most of them, like us, we're headed to the show. It's not terrible, but not as awesome as I hoped it would be.
