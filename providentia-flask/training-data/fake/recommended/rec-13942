Once I was passing by CSBC at 4.30 pm and there was no line... It was the new year's eve and the place was closed early. Thus to avoid a myriad of people waiting outside I called up my unemployed friend on Monday morning (ok, early afternoon) and offered to treat him to a meal there. It didn't take long to convince. Â  Yes, we got the table but the place was very busy. My companion got the country breakfast. Usually loquacious he seemed to talk only to the hash browns and buttermilk biscuit. I didn't really mind coz I was daydreaming while having my blueberry pancakes. Since all the synonyms of "delicious" are already used on this page I'll just confirm: the pancakes are great. In fact they were so good I couldn't let the repast be finished so soon and asked for take-out. Later that day I had my gf over but didn't mention the white box . Hospitality 101 - failed.
