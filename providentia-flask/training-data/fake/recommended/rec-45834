Have just moved from NYC and I am missing my Asian cuisine and the simple, well flavored and fresh foods  of Cambodia and Vietnam. I am glad this place is here - excellent food at reasonable prices, and THE source for any exotic ramen, sauces, or jellied candies you might need. Or sodas, they're great with wacky sodas. Service was a little shaky - it's not the nicest sit-down, and if you're a very high-expectations person when it comes to decor, cleanliness, room temperature, or odors... yeah, this isn't your kind of place. If you can get down with a meal in an open-market kind of setting, very luncheonette-style, and don't mind having to correct the waiter on your order (we had to do it once, he misunderstood that one member at the table was *terribly* allergic to shellfish, but the re-prepared the whole meal for her without hesitation) then you will probably love it. The food offerings are diverse - everything from Thai curries to Pho or congee - but everything we had was delicious. I ate the green papaya salad and meatball pho, and was thrilled.   Prices are OK, admittedly more than I was used to paying for Pho in NYC, but I think fair and worth it for what they give you in preparations. Salads were about $5, noodle dishes $8-10. The story is, the owner travels twice a week to Boston's Chinatown to stock up, so it's also the place for your kimchee ramen or snack-packs of seaweed.
