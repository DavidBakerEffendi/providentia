Northern Spy was an excellent spot and I'm happy to frequent a place that sources locally when they can.  I had the Pig's trotter roulade which was described to me as sort of "pork crabcake."  Doesn't sound great, but it was.  Enjoyed the panna cotta as well for dessert. A little loud and the tables are packed together, but that generally doesn't bother me. Good service too!
