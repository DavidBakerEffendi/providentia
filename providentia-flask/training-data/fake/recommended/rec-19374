OK, I don't usually post 5 stars for anything - especially restaurants, but something about this homey feeling diner with the cute fall decorations in the Logan Circle area of the city made be just go for it.  I was there for an early morning Sunday breakfast and the place was full.  We didn't have to wait and sat down right away.  The portions of the Barking Chihuahua was huge and I couldn't finish it all.  So the food was good -- actually better than the average diner.  But I have to say that what gives this 5 stars is the service.  So it's not Le Bec Fin or Zahav's or the Fork but for a diner, it's one of the absolute best I've been to.  We did have an issue with an exploding ketchup bottle but it was handled very quickly.
