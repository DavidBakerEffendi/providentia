Food was 4-starts.  The service was 2 at best.  Our entrees came out right after our appetizers and it was pretty clear that when they were brought back, they had just been sitting under the heat lamp for 20 minutes.  Seems like a place that has lots of promise - the food was good (apps for sure...entrees had promise) but the service sucked.  To add insult to injury, the waitress charged me for a $100 bottle of wine (the one we ordered was $60) and added another entree to our bill and then did absolutely nothing to apologize for her mistake.  Really want to like this place but there are too many other great spots in the neighborhood to make a return trip worth it.
