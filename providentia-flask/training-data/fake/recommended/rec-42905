After walking past this place a few times and each time being surprised to see a little wine bar tucked into this tiny store front I finally decided to check out.  Thank god I did.  This place has quickly become a favorite.   The ambiance alone is enough to make this a great spot (tiny and dim but warm and cozy-not crowded feelings despite the lack of space) but the food and wine list are also fantastic.  Every dish I have tried has been cooked perfectly-I have not been disappointed yet.  And there is always a few wines on the small chalk board wine menus that piques my interest. I would avoid this place on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday night because it does get crowded quickly but definitely worth the trip to check it out!
