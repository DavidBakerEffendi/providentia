I love this place for their LOCO TUESDAYS, which includes half-priced tapas plus strong and delicious happy hour drinks. Â  They are not at all skimpy with the alcohol, and their tapas are nicely portioned - four items easily satisfied two of us. Tapas I like: Shrimp taquitos Crab cakes w/ mango Jalapeno salsa and mixed greens Platano Relleno - crispy sweet plantain stuffed w/ slow roasted pork (it's coma-inducing) Mahi Mahi tacos Total for food: $26. Nice. Thanks for not hurting my wallet. I'll see you again real soon.
