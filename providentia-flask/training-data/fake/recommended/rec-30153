Wow. I wanted to find a delicious Italian place in the village, and this place took the cake. The restaurant is small, warm, inviting, and best of all the pasta was so delicious. I had the papardelle with sausage and my friend had the hanger steak. I think it would be a great first date spot but there were all types of diners there. Do not hesitate - go there for dinner today and stuff your face already!
