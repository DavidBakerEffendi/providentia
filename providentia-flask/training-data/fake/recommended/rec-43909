starting going here one saturday night about 5 months ago and loved it so have been back every saturday night since, in addition to some week nights. went there january 12th with my brother and actually started to think that they had sold the restaurant, the experience was so bad. for starters the waitress was very distracted. the hanger steak was good but where was that delicious tomatillo pepper salsa? there was maybe a teaspoon of it, and those delicious cowboyfries were super duper soggy. we waited forever for the meal, and even longer for the dessert and there were only three other people there. i am hoping that this was an off night for someone, i so loved this place, and now i am torn. i will return soon and i will be keeping my fingers crossed.... come on alice, i was was one of your biggest fans!!!! i told everybody about this place!!!!
