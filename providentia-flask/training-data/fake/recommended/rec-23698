The food here makes fried chicken look like health-food. The flavors themselves are nice, and incorporate a lot of subtlety, not just heat level. However, I was unpleasantly surprised to find that all of my food was literally swimming in oil. No sauces were used in the protein and dumpling dishes - just chili oil. The chili oil itself had a distinctly old vegetably undertone. The vegetables were also all smothered with gloops of oily sauces. I left feeling very greasy, and in need of a detox and some fresh flavors. Go to Chinatown and you'll find the good stuff (Four Rivers, anyone?)
