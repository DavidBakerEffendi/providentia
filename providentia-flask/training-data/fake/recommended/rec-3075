Came here with my aunt for a special occasion. Overall it was an amazing experience. Food was incredible and ambiance was great (really enjoyed the entrance!). Not much to say here other than its worth trying. Definitely not a place to bring kids and much more of a formal dinner. Crowd is also on the older side.
