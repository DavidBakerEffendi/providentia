Living in Hell's Kitchen, it's difficult finding places to eat in the hood that I don't get sick of, especially when I avoid Times Square at all costs, which leads me to venture to other neighborhoods due to limited choices rather than desire. But now, instead of having to trek to the East Village to eat at a Japanese izakaya, Hagi comes to the rescue! Yah, it's IN Times Square, but I can suck it up for Hagi. During the late hours most restaurants in Times Square are closed and the only people on the street are stray tourists and street vendors packing up for the night. Not Hagi! Walk down the stairs and you can hear the bustle of hurried waiters mixed with loud chatter of customers buzzed off their sake and beer. The main reason I come to Hagi is the food. I looove the fried chicken gizzards (the conservative eaters are like, eeeew but squeeze some lemon on it and you don't even KNOW); it's like popcorn chicken but chewier and more addicting. I'm big on red meat but I can't ignore the kara age, a sort of Japanese fried chicken, the best I've eaten in the city because it's chunky, garnished well, and comes out hot and crispy which separates it from other izakayas. And I have to give a HUGE shout out to the grilled yellowtail collar. For all you Asians out there missing some home cooked fish - don't deny yourself the privilege of dining on this fatty cut o'fishy. $12 Sapporo/Kirin pitchers and $20 bottles of wines (very limited selection) heeeell yes. The best part about this place is the cost compared to the quality and the environment. Unlike the spots on St. Marks, there's always a wide variety of diners ranging from a family of tourists to the lone Japanese businessman to groups in their 20's. And it's absolutely impossible to leave hungry. For $20 per person I'm stuffed every time, burping up a mix of beer and fish and chicken to Times Square's still and hushed night air.
