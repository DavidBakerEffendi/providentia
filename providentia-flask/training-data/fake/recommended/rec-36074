My first time here and I dined at the bar.   Started with a lychee mojito and roasted corn spring rolls.  Entree was a honey ginger pork chop. Mojito was perfect.  Roasted corn spring rolls were very good, although they were served "pre-dipped" in the dipping sauce. Honey ginger pork chop was full of flavor, but VERY thin and a bit tough.  Fresh broccoli and tasty fluffy jasmine rice came along for the ride on the plate Typical of NYC restaurants, the diners were packed in here elbow to elbow. Beauty of a chandelier as a centerpiece, oddly placed in a mirrored glass box. Overall, a good value for the low price paid in the Hell's Kitchen area.  I'll be back for a second try.
