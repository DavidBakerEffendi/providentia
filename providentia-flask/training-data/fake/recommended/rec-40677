Such a nice restaurant. Even thought it is in a hotel it does not have the hotel restaurant feel. There are a lot of characters to it. Â It has a homey yet trendy vibe to it. Normally I just go for drinks, but I know i missed out after my dinner last night. The food is absolutely delicious and our waiter cannot be more helpful. We got a plate of meat to start and I loved their olives. I got the clam spaghetti and that was good. But my friend got the cod flake pasta and it was extremely yummy. They were extremely helpful in our wine selection process. We sampled a bunch of different wines and after testing 6 different ones we settled on rose. It tied up the meal quite nicely. Following our meal we ordered pumkin custard for desert and they sent a complimentary pear cake (AMAZING). Normally i am not a desert person. When our coffee was delivered wrong and we got minty tea instead, we decided to keep it and they comp that as well. Amazing food, great service, nice wine, pretty setting. It will be hard to find a better restaurant. Will definitely go back!
