I order from Terri VERY regularly. When they opened in FiDi I felt as though the Messiah had come. Prior to that I rarely ever ordered out for lunch because there are not many GF vegan options in this area. I have been meaning to write a review because they're just fabulous and SUPER friendly, however I had not gotten around to it until today. Today I was compelled to write a review because the manager went the extra mile for me. I typically order the same two wraps and today they happened to completely screw it up. They are very quick and efficient, so one screw up after months of ordering is no big deal. The manager was super nice and apologetic and had the correct wrap sent to me within 10-15 minutes. She also included a GF cupcake on the house for the mixup...which I thought was very sweet. And boy was it DELICIOUS. Like WOW. Eating the other half as we speak...have to say I am impressed! Very moist for being GF...and the icing tastes like regular buttercream! I hope Terri stays just as consistently wonderful as they've been since they've opened!
