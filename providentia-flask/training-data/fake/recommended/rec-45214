Plain pizza slice was dry, over cooked and tasted like the dough was stored near an ammonia bottle. The specialty slices were expensive and had probably sat all afternoon. I will never go back there and neither should you. They are open late, their only plus. Romeos pizza or Anthony's coal brick oven would be much safer choices.
