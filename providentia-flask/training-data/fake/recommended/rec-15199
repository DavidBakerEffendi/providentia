"Whennnnn the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie thatsssss amoreeeee!" That explains the look on my boyfriend's face when our large Margherita Pizza came out. Never have I ever tasted the most perfect thin crust pizza. The bottom was crispy white still having a decent amount of tomato sauce on top. Amazing. As we walked in, we were asked if we wanted to be seated in the front or back. Either one worked for us, we were noobs. I'm glad we were brought into the back because we got a quick walk through the kitchen, I was like a kid in a candy store. This is a must eat in terms of food tourism. Make sure you bring enough paper, its cash only here.
