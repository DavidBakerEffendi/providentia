Big ups to the owners for braving the 'hood and throwin up a bougie lookin pizzeria up in here! My boyfriend and I came here after searching for an alternative to Grimaldi's or other highly rated Yelp pizza places because we didn't want to be waiting a long ass time for pizza and spending time to get there. Pleasantly enough, a stop away on the Shuttle from Prospect Park was this place. Got of the train, and mind you, parts of this neighborhood have really gentrified, but somethings about it are still hood as hell. Walking through from the subway to the restaurant, I was surprised when we finally stumbled upon it. Read rave reviews on the pizza with the artichoke and the meatball one. I'd say both are equally great. My boyfriend and I were full off of the 1 pizza since we ate half of each other's order. I'd say skip the nutella banana calzone and go straight for the ice cream. The calzone was way too "bready". Too much bread for that type of desert. I will say that their mint ice cream was the freshest I'd probably ever had in my life. No toothpaste / mouthwash tasting flavor here, only the taste of real fresh mint leaves! Amazed that this came from a restaurant and not an ice cream shop!
