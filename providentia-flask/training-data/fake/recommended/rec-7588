A friend of ours wanted to come here for dinner.  I was not thrilled because I don't really enjoy the food at Egans and I thought it would be more of the same.  I was pleasantly surprised, maybe because I set the bar low.  The appetizers were just average.  We ordered the shrimp dumplings which were decent but nothing special.  Also ordered a flat bread pizza with chicken, sausage and mushrooms which was good not great, and truffle french fries that were more like potato sticks.  The entrees were much better then apps.  I had the berkshire pork chop which was excellent.  Perfectly cooked! Also tried the short rib which was very good.  My wife had the filet which they cooked exactly they way she likes it.  Butterflied, well done, and dry!  You would be surprised most restaurants can't get it right.  Service was great.  No complaints.  We will be back!
