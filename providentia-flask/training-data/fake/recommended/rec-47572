Not a favorite of mine. The decor is fun and colorful but besides that I didn't enjoy anything else. The food portions are huge but I guess it should be for almost $20 a person. I was also sad that I couldn't order a great margarita, my waitress told me it was BYOB and I could walk to the liquor store down the street.
