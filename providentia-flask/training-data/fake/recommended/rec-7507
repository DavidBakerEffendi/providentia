My husband and I went to this restaurant on a Sunday evening. We didn't have reservations and had to wait 30 minutes for a table. This was no problem however, since it gave us the time to go to the liquor store to buy a bottle of wine (this place is a BYOB). We ordered two appetizers, the clams casino and a selection of oysters. The oysters were very good, and they came with a particularly good dill sauce. I would go again to this place for the oysters alone. We didn't really know what clams 'casino' were, but we were disappointed because they turned out to be covered with a pepper and bacon topping, which completely overpowered the delicate flavor of the clams. For entrees we ordered the suggested mulloway and salmon. The mulloway was cooked perfectly moist, but lacked flavor, and the salmon was a tad overcooked. Both of the fish lacked seasoning, though (in fact, they had no seasoning at all). The mashed sweet potato was so overly sweet it tasted more like apple sauce than anything like a potato. The creamed spinach was good enough. Would I come here again? Maybe, for the oysters. Maybe, because there doesn't seem to be anything better in Princeton. But overall, I feel this place is overpriced (we payed 100$ without tip). I don't expect fancy food, but if it's simple, it better gotta be good. And it wasn't that good. Pros: - BYOB. You can drink a good bottle of wine without having to pay too much.          - Oysters by the piece, accompanied by a good sauce.         - Friendly staff Cons: - Fish not always cooked to perfection (which I would expect for 35$), and being a seafood restaurant.          - Fish had no seasoning at all.          - Sweet potato mash overly sweet, almost like a dessert!            - Restaurant lacks charm, and is overpriced.            - Other reviewers have commented on how fresh the fish is here, but how      can it be fresh, if most of it comes from the other side of the world!?!?!?
