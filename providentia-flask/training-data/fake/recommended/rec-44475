the food was very very good, i would def eat there again, However, the service was weird. ..it was a laundry list of little things that bothered me. after my table already ordered, i over heard him offer the other table the daily specials when He initially didn't offer us any specials .  My friend and i decided to do the sun-thurs price fix for $22.50... he told us it can only be the salads as the 1st course but when my friend said she wanted the brushetta he then said oh the bruchettas too. .... mind you the food from dipping bread in olive oil to 1st and second course was very very good.... then he asked us if we want desert rather than remembering it comes with the special,  He also then offered us three choices and then i said thats all? because earlier at another table he offered ones he didnt offer us... He said for you we have tiramusi too but wasnt ehat i heard at the other table.... and then i said what i will get and my friend said what she will get and he said it only comes with one even though we both got the special pricefix. ...  note it doesnt have any stipulations or fine print on the menu.... so if i i was the only one getting the pricefix would i get a half desert!? ....  oh and one other thing that bothered me, he automatically started putting cracked pepper on our meals and didnt ask if we wanted it, and my friend hates pepper!!!!   ... it wasnt even busy on a monday night, so why so weird of a service..and he clearly made my dining experience less than par.
