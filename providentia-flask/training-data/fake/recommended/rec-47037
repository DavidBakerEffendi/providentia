This place is the bee's knees, a phrase I've never quite understood, but it seems fitting here. As a NYC girl, I have a deep-seated appreciation for brunch. As a visitor in Philly this weekend, my brunch-pectations were set low. It's rare to find a city so in tune with that magical weekend hangover-curing meal. Clearly, I had never stepped inside Sabrina's, because I'd have to venture so far as to say it may just be the best brunch I have ever had. That is minus the lack of alcoholic options (I suppose brunch is still brunch without a Bloody). I went with 3 friends, and luckily we all ordered different things. I had a bread pudding dish with asparagus and roasted peppers topped with tomato chutney. I was skeptical of the bread pudding, but the server's insistence on everyone's love of the dish rang true for me as well. A wonderful, savory alternative to a veggie omelet, it was healthy, fresh, and unique. It came with a delightful, perfectly-dressed side salad and a baked orange with cinnamon, the perfect cap to my perfect meal. I took bites of my friend's burger - cooked perfectly and served with irresistible parmesan fries as well as another friend's stuffed french toast, which I must say that if you prefer a sweet breakfast, this is the ultimate way to go. It was a mountain of heavenly goodness- sweet cream cheese, bananas, fluffy challah. I'm drooling at my desk just thinking about it.
