Just had a terrific meal at Lot 2.  Its a little out of the way, and I really hesitated writing this review because I just hope everyone stays away so that i'll be able to get a table. I had the pan roasted crispy chicken - perfect, tasted my dinner partner's burger - perfect.  There was great attention to detail from the pickles to my planters punch drink - out of this world good. We had the brussel sprout appetizer - terrific.  It wasn't so noisy that you couldn't talk and the service was fine.   We did have to wait 30 min for a table, and there was a bit of a wait for the food to come, but overall we were very satisfied and I will be back.
