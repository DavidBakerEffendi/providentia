It's a shame I did not even have an opportunity to even try the food. The hostess was extremely rude. As soon as we walked in she mad a face and said sarcastically "it's a wait!" She continued her phone conversation and did not even acknowledge us after that. We stood there waiting and I said we have a party of 5 and she looked up and said 2 hour wait. If she did not make the experience so horrible for the 5 minutes we were there, we would of put our name down and came back.
