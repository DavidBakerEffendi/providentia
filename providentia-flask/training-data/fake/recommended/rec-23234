Absolutely, hands down, best BYOB in the city. I've been going to Little Fish since it was in its old location, on the corner of 5th and Catherine, where there were about 8 tiny tables and an open kitchen with only enough room for two chef's. That was when I was 18, and I could already tell this was something special. Now in the new location and a few years later, the dining room has expanded slightly to about 12 tables, but the kitchen has stayed the same. Meaning the attention to detail is ever present. Every dish is a work of art you have no problem destroying to satisfy your lustful taste buds. The menu changes often, sometimes daily so that only the freshest catch is brought to your table. The standout dish from my most recent experience was by far the grilled octopus with corn bread crumble, pickled rhubarb and a smoky, almost BBQ romanesco. This dish literally is a sensory experience in and of itself. Every part of your tongue is kissed with flavorful goodness, that separately wows, but together astounds. The perfect date spot for someone special, you'll be making out by dessert.
