Poorly managed. Wait staff is good, but seems overwhelmed. We went for some apps before a concert...the room was less than half full, yet it was several minutes before we even saw a hostess/waitress and then another couple of minutes before we were seated. After 40 minutes the waitress apologized for the delay and said it would be another 10 minutes before our food would be out. Really?! The manager apologized and blamed the cook and too many room service orders. Honestly...room service doesn't trump patrons at tables! We left without getting our apps, without paying for drinks and with two breakfast comps. We actually got food for breakfast, but again they just aren't organized. It's a buffet with bacon and sausage but they have one cook preparing everyone's eggs. He was quick and good, but we heard him say to a coworker that he hadn't had a break in 4 hours and walked out. Suggestions: put plates where the line forms for the buffet (instead of the other side of the room), put out steamers of scrambled eggs and pancakes...save your cook for special orders and most important...hire a new manager who accepts responsibility for the service and doesn't blame the employees!
