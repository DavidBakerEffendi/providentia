I arrived at 6:15 PM on a Wednesday. There was a 20 minute wait that was closer to 30 minutes. By the time we got in at 6:45, the wait was over an hour. Plan accordingly! The okonomiyaki was Tokyo-style and way too heavy and doughy. It tasted very America - overdone and muddy-tasting. If you're after Hiroshima-style with layers of ingredients, look elsewhere. We didn't try anything else due to a lack of time. The menu looks pretty great. If it didn't have that crazy line, I might come back. Atmospherically, it reminded me of izakayas in Tokyo. Same menu system, same cramped quarters. However, it was a little dirtier. Overall, a resounding meh.
