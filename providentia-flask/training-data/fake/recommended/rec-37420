[3.5 STARS] The decor and ambience is quiet lovely though not authentic it has a warm sentiment once you enter this cozy establishment. But I'm not here to elaborate on the decor; let's talk food! I'm happy with the flavoring and the dishes are moderate enough to add desserts. Unlike some reviewers I've been to Bali and have had a feast each day I was there. Its unfair to say anything about pricing since exchange rates are different in both countries and I could get an amazing meal including drinks for $3 in Bali. Here in Selamat Pagi pricing is a tad pricy. Beef Rendang: succulent flavors (must order a side order of rice) Market Fish Curry: delicious: sweet and cool Desserts: Trio Van Leewan : tasty but not worth it Having enjoyed my dishes and feeling delighted to had come here, I must say there is something missing. There is no authentic feeling to the place, its just a place run by non-natives in a semi-hip area. No doubt the food was not horrific but sometimes you just want more originality. If you haven't been to or have tried original Balinese food, this is a nice alternative.
