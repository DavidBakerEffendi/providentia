"eh" would be the first word to come to mind...unfortunately! It is a bit expensive and the menu seems pretty disjointed (although maybe I was missing out on whatever theme there was supposed to be), which always makes it harder to figure out what menu item to pick. I had a burger (not memorable) and my dinner date had an African inspired lamb stew which tasted bland. Service was good, and the paintings beautiful. Not sure if I'd go there again!
