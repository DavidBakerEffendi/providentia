I wasn't prepared to like this restaurant because I think too many farm-to-table restaurants pass off poorly-cooked meals as better for your conscience and stomach (as with ABC Kitchen), so I was amazed at how much I enjoyed this meal and how unpretentious the staff was. They offer a broad menu for those who eat meat, fish or just vegetables, and it's always nice when you feel as if there are many other dishes on the menu that you'd like to order one day and not as if you've gotten the one or two items that sound at all appetizing. I recommend the cod, acorn squash, oyster plant and bread loaf, which came wonderfully fresh from the oven. (I was indifferent to the rutabaga.) Consider sharing the chilled pudding for dessert--even if you don't care for chocolate desserts (they tend to overwhelm me). You won't feel weighed down afterward, but pleasantly satisfied. And the staff is delightful, from the server, who was never rushed even though the restaurant was full but took her time to offer suggestions, to the man refilling water glasses to the owner, a very approachable guy. Great place to take a friend or have a date. (It isn't at all loud, so you needn't struggle to hear what is being said.) I only hope it remains in the neighborhood for many years to come. It's actually my new favorite restaurant in Hell's Kitchen (my previous favorite was Print, but this place gets the ambiance and staffing just right). Bravo!
