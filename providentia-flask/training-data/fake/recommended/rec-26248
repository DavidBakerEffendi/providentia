NO, just no. I am a bit disappointed in this place based on the reviews. The food: Grilled octopus salad and the Roasted Lemon Chicken, Potato, Garlic, Dill. The octopus was very charred to a point if seeming that it was burned while on the grill and the chicken's sauce was oily and lacked in flavor which made it unpleasant to eat. I love greek food and this was definitely not up to par with some of the nicer Greek restaurants in the city.
