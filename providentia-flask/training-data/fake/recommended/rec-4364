I tried out Fare for the first time when I had about 6 guests in town visiting me. I made reservations about 1 hr prior and was surprised and skeptical that they were able to accommodate a party of 8, while no other restaurant that I typically go to could not. I have to say that everything we ordered on the table was delicious. I ordered the muscles, which were huge and came with a great, tasty sauce. The chicken meatballs were amazing, juicy, and served with these potatoes and cheese that was incredible. Other things ordered at the table were -french onion soup (average) with some sort of cheese bread (which was amazing) -salads (average) -filet mignot special (DELICIOUS) Everything was cook well, with great flavor. Will definitely be coming here more often.
