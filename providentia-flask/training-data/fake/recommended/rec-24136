Love that we finally have a authentic Ramen place to go to! The spicy Ramen is amazing... You can choose the firmness of the noodles or softness.  Love that! You can also request less salt in the broths. Def would recommend this place.  I don't know how they make the egg in the noodle bowl but it's cooked perfect!
