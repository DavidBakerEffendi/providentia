A solid choice for a casual, fun dinner. Came here on a Wednesday night with a friend and had a cool seat on a bench with my back to the open window on West 4th.  This place is very small, and the waitress kept on bumping into people to get to our table. Got a pitcher of the white wine sangria.  Good, not great, but then again I haven't yet had great sangria. We had a good time deciding on an assortment of little plates to bring to the table.  They kept coming one after the other, which kept the meal entertaining. The chorizo with cannellini beans was the star of the meal, though it was quite salty. The empanadas and shrimp were also good.
