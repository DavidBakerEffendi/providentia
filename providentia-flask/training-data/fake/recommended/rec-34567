I found this place when I was searching for a b'fast joint. The reviews is what got me attracted. The restaurant is small and there was a wait to get seated on a Sunday morning. It is self seating and you occupy as and when a seat becomes available. The menu is small and neat. It's the pancake varieties, not a lot though, but different which occupies a whole side of the menu. Then you have the Omlet. I ordered a lot of food as I wanted to try different things. I got the veggie Omlet with a side of corn beef hash and a apple walnut pancake. You can actually get the pancakes in count of 1(small), 2(medium), 3(large) which I thought was good. The pancakes are made out of a wheat batter which was different and it was soft. I felt it to be too dry. The veggie Omlet that I ordered, I expected the veggies to be cooked inside the omlet. They were all raw and not even steamed or boiled. I did not like it at all. The corn beef was also not that great. Overall, not a big fan of Mo's Midtown. I would definitely recommend this place for the first timers.
