Simply the best pizza in the country, and worth the wait in line, Pepe's is a destination unto itself and yet it hasn't devolved into some touristy parody of its former glory or bought into its own hype, like some places I could name (Ben's Chili Bowl, Geno's Steaks). The pizza itself is outstanding, baked in a wood-fired brick oven to get the crust perfectly crispy.  The tomato sauce isn't too sweet or overloaded with oregano.  The cheese and toppings come out cooked to perfection, and each pie is drowning in olive oil.  I've had pizza in NYC and Italy, and have yet to find anything I consider higher quality or more "authentic." There's really no empirical way to describe why this pizza is so good, you'll just have to stop by and try it for yourself.  Pro tip: If the main restaurant is crowded, investigate The Spot, the tiny building in the parking lot on the left, it might be a shorter wait and it's the exact same pizza.
