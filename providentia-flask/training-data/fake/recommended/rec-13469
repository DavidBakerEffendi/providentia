My experience at LIC Market was so-so.  We had no problem getting a table, as it was raining and the place was not busy.  I ordered the split pea soup and a sandwich.  The soup was watery, but tasted alright...lots of bacon.  The sandwich was very ordinary.  The salad on the side came from a bag of mixed greens they must have gotten from cosco or something.  The salad had a few older brown parts that nobody bothered to pic out.  So I give it a two star for the food.  Plus I thought they charged a few bucks too much for each entree. The service was pleasant, but unnecessarily slow.   The place itself looked like it wanted to be in williamsburg, and was tastefully and hiply decorated.  However, the noise in the place was so loud I literally could not hear someone speaking 2 seats down. I may not return....reason I went was to find a replacement for the best LIC  restaurant ever (m wells)....but this was no replacement and my search continues....
