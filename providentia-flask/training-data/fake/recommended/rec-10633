I just left, I asked for a PLAIN bagel with cream cheese. The young girl who was helping me asked, 'do you want the PLAIN bagel toasted?' I open up the bag and what do I get? A salted onion bagel with cream cheese! Ever since they hired the young girl who shows up with last nights club make up on her face this place has gone down hill. Avoid during the summer - wait till the people who show up to work hungover are back at school.
