So wanted this to be the best burger I've ever had, but it just wasn't. Here's our hit and miss rundown: Hit: Truffle fries - delicious. Light crispy fries covered in truffle flavored cheese. What's not to love? Sauces - really good, but seriously, why do I have to ask for you to bring them? Just bring them. Staff - all very friendly, didn't freak out with kids, brought crayons and extra treats. They were awesome. Miss: The grind on the meat itself. This was a real disappointment. It was odd - some was relatively soft, other bits were so tough they were grisly. Felt like I was getting cartilage pieces ever bite or so (though I wasn't), which is not at all the image you want when eating a burger. The toppings on the burger: really unevenly placed, I think. It took until I hit the dead center of the truffle burger before I even tasted a hint of truffle. Tasted no mushroom from the original burger, and parts of it seemed dramatically underseasoned while others were seasoned just fine. Sweet potato fries: the fries themselves were great - the pile of brown sugar on top was awful. Completely ruined them for me. Kids burger: not sure what they did to that one, but I wanted to taste the meat on its own. It was livery and really rather disgusting. Perhaps ask them to cook it to medium (they didn't ask for a temp) to avoid turning your kids off of meat forever. Sorry to say this will not be our go to burger joint.
