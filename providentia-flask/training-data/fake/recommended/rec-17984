The food is amazing and so are the cocktails! This is not your traditional Mexican restaurant. They use a lot of unique flavors and ingredients. We ordered the yellowtail cerviche, barbacoa tacos and the rabbit enchilada. Everything was delicious, but my favorite dish was the barbacoa tacos. The meat was so tender and perfectly seasoned. The cocktail list is really innovative and fun, great cocktails and perfectly mixed! The service was very attentive but at the right pace. The atmosphere is really fun, and it's great for a date or a group of people. The food and drinks are highly innovative, unique and delicious. This is a place you don't want to miss!!
