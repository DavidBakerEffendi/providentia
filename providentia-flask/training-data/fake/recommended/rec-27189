The GOOD: Big space. I came here on a Friday night and there was no wait. I ended up sitting at the bar (which also had plenty of space) while waiting for a friend to meet me. Sheepsmilk Dumplings. YUM. A tad heavy for me, but still really delicious. Friendly bartender & fast service. The BAD: The pita & dips starter - was a bit lackluster. This is usually my favorite dish from Mediterranean cuisine and these just didn't hit the spot (not enough flavor and a bit too acidic).
