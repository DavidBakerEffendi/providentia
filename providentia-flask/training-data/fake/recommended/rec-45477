This restaurant is bare and stark from the front but pleasant/modern inside.  We dined in the wine cellar as we were a party of 9.  The staff was pleasant and efficient.  The food was far too ambitious for the kitchen and seasoning was either missing or too heavy handed, especially in the overly spicy clams with no other seasoning and the so called foie gras with sauces which overwhelmed the palate.  Snails in puff pastry tasted as if they had been dumped from the can, some bland sauce circling the plate far away from the escargots.  Wines are quite nice.
