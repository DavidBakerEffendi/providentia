Stop by on last Friday. The restaurant itself is very beautiful and cozy. Love the wood, tree and colorful lamps in the middle. We had Thai dumpling and Moo ping both are delicious. I had Pork chop and my friend had Neur Yang ( beef). I really like my pork. It's so tender and I like the lemongrass. My friend also like his beef as well. We definitely come back for try more dishes!!!
