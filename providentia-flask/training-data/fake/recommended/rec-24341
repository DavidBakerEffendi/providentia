Amazing deal. Amazing service. Amazing food. Don't judge a restaurant by its entrance... Kefi is on the second floor and their entrance on the street is tiny. The stairs going up 2nd floor is pretty sketchy too, leaving you wondering if you've stumbled upon the right place. But get ready to be impressed. I got the 3 course meal (only $14!). The curry chicken was great. We also got the coconut naan which was amazing. I can have probably 8 pieces of those just by myself next time. We've also got the soup appetizer and the desert Kheer. Their service is excellent - definitely the best I've seen at a place I've spent less than $20, and it's comparable to a $100 per person restaurant. It might also be the time I visited, a late Saturday afternoon when it was pretty empty so I got all the nice attention. It's close to central park so I recommend a visit after a nice walk in the park!
