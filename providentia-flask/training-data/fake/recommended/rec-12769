Okay if you are going to go to a creperie in NYC this place is hands down the best for savory crepes. Not only do they have interesting options but the way they make them is absolutely delicious. I just have never tasted a savory crepe this good. Plus, you get authentic French/Northern African wait-staff. -La Bergère (goat cheese, rosemary, figs, caramelized onions): very creamy, fresh and surprisingly very savory. The caramelized onions and figs give a nice sweet contrast but not overly sweet at all. In fact this is less sweet than the shrimp with curry. The rosemary really gives it a fantastic kick. LOVE IT!! -Shrimp Curry (small shrimp, curry, spinach, onions): It's quite sweet and not too heavy but creamy. The shrimp and spinach are fresh and plentiful.  I liked it a lot and certainly waaay more than I thought I would. FINAL VERDICT: if you are looking for a lazy afternoon lunch (service isn't fast), amazing crepes and adorable atmosphere, head on over to this gem in Williamsburg.
