Definitely a great place.  Nice vibe, good service.  And of course the food is delicious.  We were especially delighted with the fries.  The burgers were wonderful - juicy, cooked medium, toasty bread.  However, for my husband and I, JG Melons inches ahead just a little on this front.   We would probably vote for JG Melons in this burger/fries race, but if you live in the area, it's perfect go-to burger place.
