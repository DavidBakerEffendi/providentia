Brisket, lamb, shrimp, pork, beef, fish and chicken tacos were all great, as well as the platter with eggs, thin sliced steak, fries and rice. We hung out and kept on ordering as we talked and were comfortable taking our time. This was a great find and I will return when I am in Parsippany. Guy Fieri should stop in and check this place out for Diners, Drive Ins and Dives-He'd be a fan.
