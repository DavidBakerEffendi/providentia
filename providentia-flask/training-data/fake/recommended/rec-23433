Unfortunately I would like to give this bar 4 stars, but I can't because of the deplorable service. There were three bartenders there and they all seemed like they were having an awful day. I understand if one of them was in a mood but all three? Also, there is absolutely no reason to have three bartenders in a bar that size. The drinks are reasonably priced and there is a good selection of bourbons and whiskeys. The food could be better. I had the boudin balls and it was nothing like the boudin balls I have had in Louisiana. However, the strange pompous twist on them wasn't too bad. The atmosphere is relaxing. There are cozy tables if you want to sit with a date, or a very sleek bar if you want to sit alone. Now if only they could find friendlier bartenders.
