Great coffee, amazing food, and a very comfortable environment.  A small French bakery in the middle of West Hartford.  The croissants are extraordinary.  I love the sound of the accent in the back.  No matching tables, soft music in the background, it's wonderful. Note: Free wireless and thank you for having a super-clean bathroom. One of my new favorite places.  Nothing like it.  It is something to write home about...
