Why is the first time I'm coming to this place and having awesome Mac & cheese, some of the best cooked chicken (and semolina dumplings & pan gravy) and 72 hour short rib of beef (with a Cabernet wine sause) and side of loaded mashed potatos. For all of the comforts food we ordered there was still many options to try. Haven't been to too many places where I wanted to try so much, and on top of that there is a special dinner for everyday of the week. And the bonus is they carry Smithwicks beer. This is definitely a repeat place! Â The food is great and the decor is upscale without making you feel too out if place if you're not dressed up. This place has mass appeal and a bar if you just want to drink your after work hours away. Go here, or I'll personally be mad at you.
