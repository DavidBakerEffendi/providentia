The best thing about On Tap is the opportunity to sit outside on a nice day.  There are some glaring problems with the business though. 1- The service.  To call is slow would be painfully understating the problem.  Don't expect piping hot food or drinks while you wait...they just don't have a good system in place at all. 2- Management.  More than once I have left feeling like it is amateur hour over there.  I should never see a customer have their drink spilled by someone else and be told "sorry, we can't just give you another one".  I would never return if it happened to me. 3- Entertainment.  Some of the music they have there is pretty pedestrian.  Nothing that I would show up for...its usually just happening and could be much more focused and intentional.  They have a great space, but they don't use it well. Overall....I think On Tap would make for a great episode of Restaurant Makeover
