This highly underrated place is a hidden gem on Baltimore ave. We discovered it close to the holidays when no other restaurant was open and have been regular visitors ever since. 99% Of the time we order the schezwan style chicken. Were huge Han dynasty fans and we can never decide who makes this dish better. The portion is big and we usually just get one dish among two people. The wait staff may not seem super friendly at first-but they warmed up to us in a few weeks and now know exactly what we want!
