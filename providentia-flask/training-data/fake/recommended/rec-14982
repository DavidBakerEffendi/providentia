Khyber Pass has become a staple when I go out in Philly.  My girlfriend and I typically go there with friends essentially for the beer. Tonight, just her and myself went there for dinner.  I was pleasantly surpised. Such a casaul, diverse place yet some of the best cuisine in the city. The beer selecetion is incredible and the food there belongs on everyone's bucket list.  If you haven't been....what are you waiting for?!  The only thing I can think of that might improve the place is a Touch tunes. Otherwise, great beer, food, atmosphere and people. Anyone can go there and feel right at home.
