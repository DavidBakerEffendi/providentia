My husband and I have officially become "regulars" of this place. It is more Japanese fusion than anything else - the tempura is light and crisp, the fish is delicate, the flavors are mellow and the dishes expertly presented. We love that we can order small plates of different dishes and share. We love that we can bring our own drink and save some $$, or order some wine if we forgot. For those hankering for pure "Chinese" food, this place is not for you. For folks who appreciate really good sashimi and sushi (and I'm not talking about "purely fried/fake-o/neverbeentoarealsushibar garbage rolls), this is your spot. Fresh fish, expertly sliced and presented. Yum. We dined at the restaurant on Valentine's day and, as one reviewer noted, it was not up to its usual standards - the kitchen was obviously backed up and the wait staff was struggling. But these things can happen, especially at newer restaurants. I encourage folks to try it on a night that is not one of the busiest of the year! I have made an effort to be friendly and respectful to the staff and introduce myself to everyone. It's amazing how far a little kindness can go, online and in person. Peace.
