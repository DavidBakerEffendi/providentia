One of my favorite Chinatown spots. My Malaysian friends prefer this place and say it's as close to home as it gets for them. That says a lot for me. I've been coming here for years and they know me now. I don't even have to look at the menu. The pad thai is very different from the traditional here and worth checking out. I'd have to say my favorite is the Mee Siam. Get a side of their Roti Canai. Most of their dishes are top notch. The service is great. While most Chinatown restaurants have a wait for seating this place is sure to get you seated and comfortable. Great for those business lunches.
