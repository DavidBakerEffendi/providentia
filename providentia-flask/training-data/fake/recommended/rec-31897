There is NO WORDS to describe this place. Definitely BEST RAMEN PLACE I've ever been to. It was recommended by my cousin and I knew that I should try it out. You walk in and the place is filled with so much energy. They have couples tables and then the communal ones which are my absolute favorite. Everytime I go, I order their pork buns which are so yummy! Best part is their ramen. Akamaru Modern. Only 14 dollars and worth the wait. The broth is amazing and the noodles are so YUMS. I always get a second helping. Make sure you have a reservation or go a little earlier before lunchtime around 11. You'll be sure to grab an awesome seat and be greeted by all the chefs!!! Can't wait to go back.
