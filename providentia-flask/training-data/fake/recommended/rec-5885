i dine at banana leaf probably an unhealthy amount. last week we decided to try something new -- erawan -- and loved it! its just as inexpensive, byob, right around the corner, and the food is awesome! we tried the drunken noodles with beef, tom yum soup (the best!), pad prik king (a spicy string bean dish), and masaman chicken curry. everything was fabulous and although they somehow forgot about our reservation, we were seated quickly and the waitstaff was more attentive than expected. we will be back!
