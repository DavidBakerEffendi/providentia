A beautiful restaurant with great use of seasonal and local foods without pretension. During my last visit, I shared the Roasted Chicken for 2, which was probably the best chicken I've ever had. Moist meat, crisp skin, and tasted like a real chicken! The salads are also a real stand-out with farm-fresh veggies and unique and thoughtful flavor combinations. Get there early for a good seat (the tables are pretty tightly packed) and happy hour specials ($2 off drinks, $5 off wine bottles).
