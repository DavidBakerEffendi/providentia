I avoided coming here because in the past I had the worst pastrami and corned beef that looked like ham there was so much water in the meat.  I gave it another try because people I met kept raving about it.  Early afternoon on a Saturday the line to the back was curved to the door.  There were like 5 or 6 guys on the board and 1 at the register.  While we were waiting we were passed pieces of pastrami which were cured and smoked beautifully; richly colored, meaty, tender and juicy.  I went in there for a brisket sandwich and left with a pastrami also.  I will be back!  The guys behind the counter are friendly, humorous and aim to please.   Still not a fan of their corned beef, but their pastrami and brisket sandwiches are so delicious.
