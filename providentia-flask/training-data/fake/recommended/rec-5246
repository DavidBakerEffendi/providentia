If you want to spend $200+ dollars for 3 people, this is the incredibly overpriced place for you! The food is generally fine. They have no idea how to make gnocchi, and their mixed drinks and desserts suck. But it's a beautiful setting over the glass shop on the river. Not so great for vegetarians.
