I've been meaning to try a great Tapas Bar and Tia Pol had been recommended to me through a friend. But like most things, I found myself sitting here last night by accident. After finishing scene practice in The Highline Park (a great place to go to convince people you have a British accent), my scene partner had to use a bathroom and so we found ourselves walking by Tia Pol. Because it's not polite to use a bathroom without being a customer, I bought a round of drinks. Estrella from Spain and Allagash White were the beers of choice and both were pretty good. Estrella reminded me of a lighter Stella but still very refreshing. We were content to have a drink and go but then the bartender came over to our perch and gave us these small green peppers roasted and coated with olive oil and sea salt. I think the kitchen made an extra order and he gave this to us at no charge (so I left a nice tip), but man those peppers were good. Some were really hot, which I like, but it was nice to see that kind of service and has convinced me to go back. The place is a bit small and the wine bar is narrow, but it gives the place an intimate feeling and having eaten tapas in Spain, I may never be able to get that great chorizo again but would certainly come here to bring back memories.
