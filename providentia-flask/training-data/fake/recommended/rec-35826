AMAZING! I had a great, great time! I was a little upset about the wait for the reservation (1 month). But once I had the the bread basket it was like something else I cant even put into words how delicious it was. We ordered a couple of dishes - the SHORT RIB & BONE MARROW AGNOLOTTI which was one of THE BEST MEAL of my life! I mean its was DIVINE! A definitely must have! SPICED DUCK BREAST WOW!! Amazing as well, so tender, so smooth, so delicious a must have. Â  We also had the spaghetti which was delicious, its the noodles that makes the whole dish oh and the tomatoes. We didn't have any dessert since we were so satisfied with our meals. I m most definitely coming back to Scarpetta! By far on of my favorite Italian restaurant in NYC!
