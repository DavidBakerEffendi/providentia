STEER CLEAR OF THIS JOINT!  You really get what you pay for.  I recently went here after hearing how reasonable the falafel was priced.  In this recession, any reasonable sounding deal strikes my attention. After waiting in line freezing for around 10 minutes I finally was able to get my hands on their falafel sandwich.  How excited I was to take my first bite into chickpea and hummus goodness! I am addicted to hummus! After all, I have it every day so I have developed a distinct taste.  It all started to go downhill once I was next in the line. The guy at the counter was a total d-bag.  He was not friendly at all and just threw the sandwich at me hoping to get to the next sucker in line.  I brushed it off and preceded to chow down (and throw it right back up lol).  This sorry excuse for a falafel with hummus was a disgrace.  This was among the WORST falafel sandwiches I have ever had.  It includes only like 2-3 falafel balls, tahini, hummus, and some iceberg lettuce.  You would probably fare better going to one of those neighborhood street carts....AT MIDNIGHT.  It was that disappointing.  So many better places in the area then this, I have no clue why people would go here.  Walk a few blocks and the falafel gets exponentially better. If you want to throw away your money for some of the worst over-hyped falafel in the city then go here.  You truly get what you pay for!
