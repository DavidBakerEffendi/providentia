Perfect for dinner, not so great for brunch.  Cozy, intimate, and impeccably prepared food.  The price is right for what you get, and I particularly appreciate that if you're sharing items they will divide and plate the dish accordingly before bringing it out.  The service is always good, and if you don't have a reservation they usually keep seats for walk-ins (prepare to wait but it's worth it).
