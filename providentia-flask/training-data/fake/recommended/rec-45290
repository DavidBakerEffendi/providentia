This was our first meal on our recent NYC trip and we were starving after taking a morning nap after our red-eye flight. We found this spot and the hanging plants on the outside and wood interior made it quite inviting. It was a little on the crowded side for lunch but we got a table. Along with some beers we ordered the following: a Cuban sandwich, a salad, a pizza slice, and a few selections of cheese with bread. We figured they'd bring out the easier-to-prepare items first but we waited a LONG time and nothing came out. Other tables were getting their food and needless to say, we were agitated and hungry. Anyway, I finally spoke with one of the servers and miraculously, the food came out promptly. The server I talked to said they were busy but our server should have asked about bringing out the dishes in the appropriate order. I liked that he apologized for the error but we were left a bit underwhelmed with the food and still upset about the wait.
