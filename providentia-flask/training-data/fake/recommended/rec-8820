This place is CRAZY good.  Picture this, it was 2am and I was starving not having ate anything all day.  A local recommended this spot after jokingly saying all I wanted was sushi.  This place was beyond great.  Super clean, VERY friendly staff, AMAZING selection of food...truly something for everyone. It's super unassuming and easy to miss from the outside, so pay attention when passing by. The sushi was so fresh.  It was just what I needed at the time. Prices were average as well.  I would have paid more for what I received, especially the fact it was 2am.     Great place...certainly check it out...you won't be sorry.
