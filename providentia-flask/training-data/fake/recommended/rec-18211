I can't say enough about this place. Everything I have ever had was delicious - panang curry, egglplant/dill/sticky rice, Pad Kee Mow (so tasty that it took me a year to stop ordering it), red curry, yelloy curry, green curry- try it all, rice noodles, curries. Â It's not Thai, as some people claim, but Laotian, which is why many people don't recognize dishes on the menu, or certain flavor combination. I don't give 5 stars based on food, though. I love this place because it is a neighborhood joint, because you can eat outside in the summer, because it is a BYOB, because it is CHEAP for the amount of food you get, because when you're there you feel happy just knowing that everyone else is having as good a time as you are. It's not fancy, it's just fantastic. Also, there are so many vegetarian options, it's always a hard choice to decide between something new and something that I've had beofre and loved. Really, I could go here every day.
