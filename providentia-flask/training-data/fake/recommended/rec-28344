AMAZING! At first I skeptical about the 45 minute wait on a Tuesday at 6 pm. However, I'm really glad I stuck it out. This is the best ramen I've had in NYC. Way better than Ippudo or Momofuku Noodle Bar in my opinion. The staff was friendly and super quick. The place is a bit cramped, but in a good way. You really feel like you are stepping out of New York and into Japan. I had two bowls of the chicken ramen, I never usually eat that much, I just didn't want it to end!
