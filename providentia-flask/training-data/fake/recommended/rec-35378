$17 Dinner Set Includes: 1) Garden Potato Salad - Very good 2) Miso Soup - Not enough ingredients, just some carrots and onions 3) Aged Tofu - Awesome and weird! Like the slimy layer... 4) Some kind of veggies (yam?), it was okay 5) Katsu - got the Shrimp/Pork Katsu, and the Pork Katsu Egg Casserole.Crispy enough. Tasty! 6) Dessert - Red Bean/Green Tea Ice-cream with a slice of pumpkin pie. Doesn't taste heavy. Refreshing. $17, I will definitely come back!
