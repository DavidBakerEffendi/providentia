I'd been meaning to try this spot, but never got around to it since I live across the street from a pizza place (not even remotely comparable), and never seem to be in the mood for pizza. But I was so glad I did finally do Barboncino! Neopolitan pizza is my favorite style with ultra-fresh ingredients, and an old-world type method, so the inner gourmet foodie in me was full of glee - heehee! But I have to say that I was impressed with the light bodied, just delicious glasses of red wine I enjoyed while I was here! The margarita pizza was a simple, but fulfilling choice. The quality of the pie was more important than the toppings, although the one with the clam on it was very tempting. That will be my choice on my next occasion. Ambiance was loud and boisterious, but not obnoxious. I'd describe the decor as trendy, loft-industrial version of rustic. I think this place is great for groups of friends, and pre-gaming. I saw someone bring children here, which I can understand, since they can be as loud as they want, but the kids seemed completely confused and overwhelmed by the chaotic atmosphere, noise level/acoustical combo and cried frequently, looking around frightened and confused. I felt sorry for them. My waiter was genuinely good at his job, very gregarious in a non-stiff but not laissez-faire servicey kinda way, not to mention extremely adorable and flirtatious in a way that totally rubbed me right, haha. I actually wish he had asked for my number like I saw that he wanted to, but he was probably worried about being professional or something... Sigh, more guys need to learn how NOT to hesitate about closing the deal....sometimes that's the only reason that nice guys finish last. oh well. I'm sure I'll be back there......
