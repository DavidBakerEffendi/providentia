I can speak only to the brunch offerings, and be forewarned my preferred brunch is one with bottomless greyhounds and a well-executed benedict.  The food is indeed delish, but the atmosphere leaves something to be desired, particularly since it's not an especially cheap destination.  Chips with blue cheese fondue - get into it.
