I CANNOT even being to say how much I am infatuated with this place!  If you're debating, stop, and just go already I 100% guarantee you will not be disappointed.  The only people who would dine here and not love it are people who don't eat food...not sure if that's even possible, so yeah, it is absolute perfection.  Lemme break it down... Ambiance: Classic NYC intimate settings.  I kid you not, you walk in and if I recall correctly, there is only 4 tables.  Low lighting and easy music is going on in the background, and the mood is immediately set.  It's upscale, but it's not like drop your pants fancy.  You'll be comfortable in here in casual clothes, but you'll definitely feel like you're in the see and be seen crowd for the night. Service: Unrivaled.  It's the best way I can put it, I went 2 nights in a row and not once did my water glass reach any less than 3/4 of the way full.  The guys running the floor and kitchen are ON POINT!  You literally have to ask for nothing, and I adore how when each dish comes out the describe it even more in detail just to remind you about the bliss you're going to encounter shortly thereafter. Food: This stuff seriously needs to be illegal, food should not be allowed to be this perfect.  Hummus pizza, pork dumplings, pork buns, and the chocolate muffin are all TO DIE FOR!  I could've been hit by a car on the way out of there and it would have been a worthwhile life to have lived.  They make the most killer lychee proseco martini as well, it's absolutely phenomenal! Prices: Surprisingly not too bad, $7 cocktails, and the entrees (albeit tapas sized portions) cap out at $15 it's a great night out! Advice: Make a reservation.  Chances are if you show up on a Saturday night, if they're slammed enough they might not even put you on a wait and they may just not be able to seat you. Go now!
