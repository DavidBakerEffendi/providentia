Made a last-minute outdoor seating reservation for 8pm (really wanted to eat earlier, but that's all they had, and it was our fault for calling so late). It was 7pm, and the hostess called us, telling us that a couple moved inside because it was too cold, so there was a table available after all -- very impressed with that gesture! The service was very good, and the food was pretty good as well. The only thing I didn't like were the prices -- we felt like we overpaid like crazy for what we got (one house salad, two glasses of wine, and two seafood pasta dishes for $87 -- yikes!!).
