Thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant.  The food was absolutely amazing and the service was top notch.  This was my first time at an 'authentic' Lebanese restaurant but my host was Lebanese and he really enjoyed it as well.  I let him order because I had no idea what to try other than hummus.  He ordered hummus (really smooth and quite tasty... Small portion though);  babagonush (again - tasty but small portion); tabbouleh (delicious and fresh - decent sized portion); falafel (it was square... Weird looking but yummy tasting); Brussels sprouts (absolutely incredible - came with yogurt, grapes and walnuts... It was so good yet we couldn't finish it so I took it home and couldn't wait to eat it so I had it for breakfast the next day! Hahah) then he ordered a few other things I can't remember because I was stuffed but we enjoyed tons of delicious desserts - my favorite was the Ashta! You HAVE to order it!  The only thing I was confused about was they were playing American pop music instead of Arabic music. Other than that the meal transported me somewhere smack in the middle of Beirut! I will definitely be going back!!!
