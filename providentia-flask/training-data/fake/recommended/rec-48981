dropped in after a float up the street at Serene Dreams. Tacos, Sopes, and Hurraches are on point.  A+.  stick with these are you will enjoy yourself i got fancy and went for the nachos mi pueblito, not great but thats what i get for ordering tex mex.  I got a cemitas, which is a great sandwich, way better than the torta, but the bread wasnt what im used to.
