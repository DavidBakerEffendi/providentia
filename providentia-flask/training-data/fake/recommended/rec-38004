Room Service is a passable Thai restaurant, but it's overpriced, not surprising given its location (near the Theater District and other tourist hotspots). The food was a bit bland, not a great compliment when it comes to Thai food. But the decor was imaginative--I got a seat right near the chandelier every review has mentioned, and it's not as garish and tasteless as I expected. Overall, a good-looking restaurant that could improve its food a bit.
