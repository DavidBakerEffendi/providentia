My friend and I went for dinner on her birthday!  Everything was really great!  Everyone on the staff were attentive and very hospitable to both of us.  They recommened food and the choices were great!  Although, they had a really great deal on bottles of wine, we ended up having some really great cocktails.  We will be back!
