Sorry, but never again. I consider myself somewhat of a Mexican food connoisseur and was excited after I read the reviews. Now, my rating is only based on one experience but once was enough. I ordered delivery from here and it's definitely a plus that they're on grub hub and that you can pay with a credit card, but then the food is way lacking. I ordered the vegetarian nachos and vegetarian burrito (I'm not a vegetarian, but I'm pregnant and have had a weird meat aversion). I expect to have everything nachos or a burrito would have, just minus the meat. What I do not expect is a weird variety of veggies such as mushrooms, cooked red peppers, cooked green peppers, zucchini, and yellow squash. It reminded me of what Mexican food would be if it was crossed with Italian food (perhaps that explains all the use of mozzarella cheese?). This was not at all what I was expecting and it did nothing to satisfy my craving. So it's back to my tried and true favorite Mexican joint tonight (El Jarocho)!
