Definitely recommend this place!! The lobster bisque was very good and authentic. Unlike the generic taste you would expect, it is a little spicy. The pork Pâté was also delicious. For dessert, the selection of mini sweets would be a good choice if you are not sure which one to choose. I would however avoid oysters there. They weren't bad, but also weren't as good as their other dishes. People there were super nice! Decor is romantic, good for dates. ;) Enjoy!
