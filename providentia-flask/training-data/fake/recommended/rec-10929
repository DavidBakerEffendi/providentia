Was there yesterday - unknowingly stepped into the trap invited by some friends - what they say is true : food is insanely expensive and tasteless at best. Be warned. $98.00 for a crab (not even a big one). Close to 50 just for the legs (no claws ! ) We were a large party and had both crabs and legs... As mentioned previously, quality wise, it's on par with Red Lobster for bad seafood. Was still hungry, so ended up ordering a burger, medium rare. The only item on the menu that wasn't grossly overpriced. It arrived well done, no red to be seen, dry and chewy... Service wasn't that bad - I guess Yelp did have some influence - but all the rest was. Stay clear of this place, give your money to poeple who actually put pride in what they do, and care about the food they serve.
