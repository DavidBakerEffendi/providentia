I'm surprised this restaurant has such a low rating, i eat here pretty regularly and recommend their pizza to most other similar restaurants in the area.  The best part is they have many different varieties of pizza pre-cooked and ready to heat up if you don't feel like waiting around.   For Pizza i recommend the Ziti slice and the Vegetable. Also they have a good Cold Antipast
