So here is the thing, Pizza is awesome and one of my favorite food groups (right next to chocolate and fries). Unless someone really screws it up, any place that serves pie will automatically get 4 stars. What makes Grimaldi's special is the fact that they have fresh ingredients and stick to what makes a great pie. They start with a dough that is cooked so that it is crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Then they put a little homemade marinara on there, made with their own blend of tomatoes and spices. It was sweet and gave the pizza great flavor without overwhelming the other ingredients. Then they pile on the toppings: mozzarella, basil, roasted red peppers and spicy Italian sausage or whatever you choose to order. The pie comes out hot  after being in the coal burning oven for a few minutes.  The pizza is cheesy with the right amount of everything. The only sad thing about this experience is that there were 2 pieces that went uneaten. My tip is to get there before it opens as there will already be a line. I got there about 30 min early and was seated shortly after opening, sure beats the hour and a half wait that others experienced. Don't forget your cash: my meal with a small pizza, Snapple, beer, and cannoli cost around $25 plus tip. Don't put too much pressure on this place to be something its not or you will be disappointed. This joint is about good old fashioned NYC pizza with no bells and whistles. Unfasten your belt and get ready for a great meal.
