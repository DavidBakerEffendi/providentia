Finally got to check out Parker & Quinn last Wednesday after having it bookmarked since it opened a while ago! I was really happy with my meal and the service at P&Q. I was SO happy we made a reservation for 6:00pm because this is clearly a huge after work watering hole so the bar was packed and almost all the tables were full as well. Maybe it was partially because it is in the first level of the Refinery Hotel or perhaps the aforementioned after work crowds, but even as we were leaving the place was packed! I ordered the gorgonzola/proscuitto flatbread. It really should have been a starter so after I ate it and found myself still hungry I ordered a side of french fries....both were SO GOOD! it is very convenient for people who need to meet around Penn Station/Path Train - close to a lot of subway stations too!
