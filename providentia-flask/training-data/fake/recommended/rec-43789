Wow! I have always loved the Philly food scene but I would never have thought that I would find the best Jewish Deli sandwich ever there. This place blew Katz's on the LES out of the water! The corned beef was so succulent and moist but not fatty and the owner even gave us a taste of the pastrami...oyi. Amazing. The Matzah ball soup could cure anything that ails you. My only lament, I don't live in Philly, I live in NYC. Damn.
