I also tried them both and Pat's was clearly the better choice.  I think the Philly cheese-steak is overated myself.  I'm hung up on the cheese-wiz thing (they have great Amish cheese in PA; why not use it?).   The sandwich itself is too basic; my Texas palate craved more.  I need more condiment choices than ketchup.  I can get that at McDonalds.
