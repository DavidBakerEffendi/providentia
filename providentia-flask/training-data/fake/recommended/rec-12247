Great cocktails and atmosphere. I ordered a Pink Pickett Fence, normally I'm not a fan of gin but this blend of lemonade and spirits created a smooth and balanced flavor. Very dark interior with a taste of prohibition-era decor, went in June and it felt quite hot in the back half of the restaurant...if it would have been more comfortable I would have stayed longer and sampled more of the menu.
