One of the best times I have had with some of my Â Philadelphia friends!! It was so fitting, all of my male friends, it was truly a "Sausage Fest"! What a selection of meats to choose. What a great way to elegantly gorge like a poor man savagely seeking meat!! We had a great time and the staff was very pleasant. They truly have a presence here now and you can see their staff walking on their way to work all of the time. I am a fan of Fogo De Chao!
