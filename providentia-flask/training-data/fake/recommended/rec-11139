I've got to admit that the ambience of this place is superb.  It's not uppity like some Stephen Starr restaurants; it's actually got a chill vibe to it.  The crowd is young professionals, hipsters...anyone that just enjoys drinking.  There were no loud obnoxious..jersey shore wannabes there.  If you are looking for a new group hangout..come here, especially on a night where it's 75 degrees out.  My friends and I didn't bother grabbing food since we already ate at PYT, but there's really not that much selection at this place re: food.  In regards to beer, there's a good selection, but it's not as vast as I thought it would be.  I will be coming back again
