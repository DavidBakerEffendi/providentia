Been here a couple times now.  Both in the venue upstairs and the bar downstairs.  The bartenders all seem really friendly and helpful, with a decent selection of beers on tap.  No bottles.  I hear the food is really good, but I have yet to try it. There's a pool table downstairs that is a great way to meet and socialize with some of the bar patrons.  The people seem generally very cool.
