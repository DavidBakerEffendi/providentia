I came here last night with my boyfriend. Such a great experience!! The food was absolutely amazing! We had empanadas as an appetizer. AMAZING! I ordered the Caribbean shrimp fried rice and he had the shrimp with coconut lime sauce. We loved both dishes! Service is fantastic as well. We sat outside since it was a beautiful night, and they kept coming out to check on us. The place is BYOB so we brought our own bottle of wine, but they brought us out a wine bucket to chill our wine. Unexpected and very appreciated. They include the tip in the bill (18%) so that is also convenient. Will definitely be coming back soon!!
