Food alone would get 4.5 stars..the selection is immense. I loved the cashew chicken (c2). Â However, I have been there 5 times and all five times the service sucked! The waitresses often seem like they don't want to be there and forget that their job is to serve. If it weren't for the food, I wouldn't come back!
