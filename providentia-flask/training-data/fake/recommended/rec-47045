Our go to sushi place in the city - have tried other sushi restaurants but always end up coming back to fat salmon.  The highlights are their rolls, and, while their fish is excellent, they also have many veggie friendly options - in fact, my favorite roll is the old school (spicy mayo sauce is amazing!).  Overall, awesome place with friendly & efficient service.
