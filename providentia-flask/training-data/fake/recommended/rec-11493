When I had only a few hours in Philadelphia to eat as much good food as I could... especially things that I cannot get where I live... DiNic's was towards the top of my list.   The line was super long, but there were a couple of stools at the counter.  I took my young son, and the two of us had lunch like men.   I was there for one thing: the roast pork with provolone and rabe.  While I tried to convince my kid that he really wanted the pulled pork or the brisket, he had other idea.  What can I say, he knows what he likes.  Good for him. The young man got the sweet Italian sausage.  When it arrived, he asked why there were two sausages on his sandwich.  It's a 12" sandwich.  Each half is filled with its own dedicated plump and juicy pork sausage.   He barely managed to make it through a half. Despite the generous size of the sandwiches, mine was so absolutely delicious, I simply tore through it.  Where did it go?  I was only able to muster the strength for a few bites of the leftover sausage sandwich based on sheer force of will.  It too was outstanding.  Not that I would expect anything less.
