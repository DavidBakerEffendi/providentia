Mmm Penang!  In Princeton this is my go-to place for Thai good.  I've had the basil noodles, pad thai, and tried several of my friends' dishes while dining there - I've loved every dish I've tried.  And there are SO MANY choices - Chinese, Thai, and Malaysian.  And I've always left with enough leftovers for a second meal (bonus)!! I've never had to wait long and the service has always been prompt. This was a favorite of my boss's for group outings for celebrations.  He'd bring a few bottles of champagne/wine and we'd have a great meal at a great price.
