Best food I've had in NYC! I don't get out much, but I still think this food is objectively delicious. Shared gingerbread pancakes and huevos rancheros - ideal combo. Stuck with the Mexican theme and topped it off with a spiced apple margarita :) 50 minute wait on a Saturday around 11 a.m. but well worth it as the highline is across the street and they text when the table is ready.
