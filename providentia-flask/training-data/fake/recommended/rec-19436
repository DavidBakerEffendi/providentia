Great patio seating with umbrellas that actually guard you from the rain. Friendly and quick waitstaff, tasty beers for the typical Burlington price of $4-$5. I'd recommend the Beetlejuice: it's especially amusing when 3 people at your table order it and the waitress says Beetlejuice three times. Or maybe we were the only ones that found that funny...
