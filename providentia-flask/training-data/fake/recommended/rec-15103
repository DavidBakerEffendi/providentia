Visiting Philly, I'm obviously looking for that stable Philly cheesesteak. Sonny's had a pretty cheesesteak but it was pretty pricy. Plus there was awful service, extremely impersonal and dismissive. The place was also kind of dirty. I got the cheesesteak with mushrooms and provolone. I couldn't really taste the mushrooms but the bread, cheese, and meat were good. Â  When I'm back in Philly, I'd try somewhere else
