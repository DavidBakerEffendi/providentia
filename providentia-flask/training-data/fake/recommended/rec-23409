Been here a few times for lunch and the food was just okay. Portions are small, it's pricey and they are cheap with their ingredients. Seriously cheap! I ordered seafood fried rice and it was so small about a rice bowl and 1/8th ( barely see any seafood maybe 3 shrimps at most). Also their seafood soon doo boo had barely any seafood in it. They put 1 shrimp and 3 clams( and those were tiny) like come on now. I don't pay 10 bucks + for just tofu?!
