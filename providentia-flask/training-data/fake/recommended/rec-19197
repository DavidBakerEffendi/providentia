After a strong recommendation I knew I had to pay a visit while visiting the city. I swung by at 2pm, and the cafe was busy! Â Fortunately I was able to wrestle for a seat at the counter top. The staff was friendly and the food was delicious. I had the steak and eggs; the steak was quite tasty. And I also enjoyed the French toast, and by far the best French toast I've ever had!
