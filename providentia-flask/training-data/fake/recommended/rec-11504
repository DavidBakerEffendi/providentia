The only reason for the missing star is that the restaurant was horribly understaffed when we popped in.  I had the Biscuits w/ sausage gravy, and added the baked eggs (everything's better with an egg on it.) Beginning the meal with a little aggravation due to a long wait, I was quite happy after taking my first bite.  Each member of our party of four was happy with their food.  Two of us went back the next day.
