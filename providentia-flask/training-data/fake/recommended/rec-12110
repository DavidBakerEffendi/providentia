NOTHING LIKE IT IN PHILLY! FANTASTIC! The food is great, the prices wonderful and the owner amazing!  Where else can you show up on a busy Saturday night, missing two people in your party of six and have the owner say, don't worry I will seat you. Order, wait for them whatever you want!  Amazing a throw back to when customers mattered.  By the way NO one in our party had ever been to the restaurant.  There is no pretense, no rude hostess in a little black dress. The big boys in town should have a meal there once.  I am a loyal customer for life now.  The Gnocchi was amazing, the grilled Caesar salad also. It is loud but by 9:30pm it had really quieted down. BYOB to boot.  It would have been nice if they put the white wine in a bucket of ice, but this is nothing considering everything else. If your looking for Italian before or after a show around the corner on Broad street. Look no further, you have arrived.
