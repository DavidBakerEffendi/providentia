Very nice atmosphere and comfortable chairs. I had the sweet and sour chicken and a tuna roll to eat. The sweet and sour chicken was great and fresh! The tuna roll was tasty; however, it was just a little to warm. I like my sushi a bit cooler then this roll was. I will go back; however I'll skip the sushi.
