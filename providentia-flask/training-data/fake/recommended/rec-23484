2nd time here, this time with friends. We loved every single dish we had! The watermelon and beet salad, the Trout, Harvest Vegetables, Fried Chicken best ever, Mussels, and all the veggies sides, s'more dessert and butterscotch pudding.  Since you can clearly see all the reviews here are stellar, Just to add this:  NOT enough light to SEE what we were eating : all that time plating in the kitchen, is "lost", and not seeing your food is not an appetite creator, you know? like you want to see something and go "oh! this looks yummy!"  : no can do here.  And then the waitresses: they just don't seem friendly....they are super casual and obviously spend a lot of time dressing for the part. Ours had a ho hum so super cool overly casual demeanor. In the end she warmed up to us, but why does it have to be that way?? it was the only thing that spoiled our dinner.  You want to leave thinking that could NOT have been better, but kinda, its' like, yeah, we are cool and so is this place, and so?  Just that.  I live here. I'll be back with friends often.
