This bar is about 3 blocks from my home in South Philly and I'm so happy it's so close. I go there a few times a month and I'm constantly surprised by the different craft beers they have on tap and the different foods they've listed on the chalkboard. The ambiance in this place is great. It's very low lit and there are only a few tables creating a cozy feel. I know there's an upstairs but I've only stayed on the first floor either sitting at the bar or one of the high tops in the back. I left a tip to try the salt and pepper fries and I'm stickin' to it! No matter how full I am when I go I make it a point to get the crispy, shoestring fries served in a big ceramic bowl. I've had a few of their sandwiches in the past and my favorite has to be the Pittsburgh cheesesteak. The crowned jewel of this place is their selection of canned beers. If you make it there during happy hour you can enjoy your cans for half the price! I love bringing friends to this place when I'm in the mood for a low key, chill night and a few local brews.
