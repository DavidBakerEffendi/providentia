Love their food. I've eaten at their UWS location many times. The only reason I'm writing this review is to call out their terrible table service. We were obviously on a date and were in no rush. We got drinks and took our time. Every time the waiter returned he seemed more and more miffed at us taking so long to order. He did not smile or laugh when I made a light remark about it. Over the course of the meal he actually made me feel animosity toward him. I hated the experience, even as I loved the food and the company. At the end, the check was dropped before I asked for it. And it wasn't cheap. We just wanted to finish our overpriced wine before ordering coffee, but no such luck. He had decided we were done. I'd go there again but only with a big loud party. I'd never take a date there again. I go out of my way to make a lady feel comfortable and special, only to have a bitchy little queen ruin our night? I don't think so.
