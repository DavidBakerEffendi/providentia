had to wake up at 3 am 30 days before, but was able to score an 8:30 res on a Friday night. while that might seem ridiculous, so is the food! it definitely lives up to the hype, the food really was incredible. started out with the crab toast-i could have had 3 orders of that as my entire meal and been a VERY happy person. the small amount of lemon alioli on top went a long way. next got the pretzel coated fried calamari-this was probably the least fav of the meal and even with that said was pretty good. didn't taste any pretzel but mustard and spicy marinara dipping sauces were very tasty. then we split the roasted carrot and avocado salad with sunflower seeds-delicious, carrots were very tender and croutons tasted like ciabatta toasted in olive oil-awesome. for the last app we got the roasted beets with homemade yogurt-while i would never think the two go together, the combo was fantastic, really good dish. for the mains: i got the lobster-roasted to PERFECTION-the most unrubbery piece of lobster I've ever had, bf got the lamb shank and said it was also really good, but we were so stuffed from the apps-had to get both meals wrapped up to go after 2 bites. BUT still had to taste dessert, the banana chocolate chip icecream layered in between chocolate cake, floating in a creamy sauce with candied walnuts-so so so good! there is always room for dessert. overall a wonderful dining experience that WILL be revisited.
