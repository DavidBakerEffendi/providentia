Corner Bistro just did not QUITE live up to the hype for me. (Sorry Rachel F!) The burger was delicious, don't get me wrong, big, meaty, juicy, and the price was right. I would give 5 stars for the burger, no doubt, but there were other factors at play. 1.) Bad fries. Just bad. 2.) Kinda rude service. The bartender was nice, but the waiter did not give a WHAT about us. 3.) Really gross bathrooms. I know its a divey burger bar, but if there is food being served I expect a little better. Regardless of the 3 star review, I would totally come back to eat that burger and drink some $3 McSorley's light brews.
