Out of all the restaurants in the Time Square area, this is the best for people watching. Next time I go there, I will plant myself at the bar and watch people's faces as these massive plates of food arrive at their table. I ate at Carmine's during the lunch hour and was fortunately able to order off the lunch menu. The main pasta dishes were available for about half the size ( and price) as the dinner plate - which is still more than enough for two people. I had a very small party of 3, and we had more than our fill with an appetizer, two lunch sized entrees and a side of meatballs. The meatballs were so large and succulent. Easily the best part of the meal we got. The interesting thing about the place was you rarely keep your eyess on your own table. Every time a nearby party is served, your eyes immediately dash first to the food you wish you had also ordered and then to the faces of the diners. It is a mixture of awe, horror and then extreme terror. Horror coming when one realizes that he or she must find some way to finish the monstrosity. Extreme terror when he or she realizes that only the appetizer has arrived. The most amusing moment came when a party of two women began talking to their neighbors hoping to unload some of their food onto them. A great place to meet new friends! Thank goodness for doggy bags, Â I will be returning soon with a larger crowd and a hunger for fried calamari.
