They have a stocked bar for cocktails, which is not  common in vietnamese restaurants (most of us are lightweights). They've been mentioned in several magazines, which is apparent at the entrance, but probably just for being the one of two vietnamese restaurants in philly with the other one being directly across the street. Other than that, the've got nice napkins...? The service was average, and the vegetarian eggrolls were way below average. Veggie in this case means "no meat," and doesn't mean "vegetables." Go figure! It was a fried not yet golden brown roll, with vermicelli, a mushroom or two and pepper...everywhere. It was so peppery I couldn't taste much else. It was stronger than sriracha. The fish sauce was sugary, without a kick.  We have a term in Vietnamese, pronounced "Zuhh-Ehhhggccck!" That's what I told my mom about it. .
