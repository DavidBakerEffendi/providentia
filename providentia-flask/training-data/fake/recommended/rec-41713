I was very excited when this place first opened up in the neighborhood and I went often and loved it. The owner/manager was always super friendly and always tried to remember my name. In all, they had solid food and drink at a reasonable price and were always super friendly. My favorite items: the nachos (amazing), shrimp tacos, migas breakfast tacos on the weekends, and their delicious, strong and fresh margaritas (best I've had in the city). I always mixed the frozen and straight up into the perfect slushy-level marg. I moved out of the neighborhood and made a return trip only to find that they had raised the price on their margaritas and almost all of their tacos by a dollar. As much as I would love to keep going back, I can't afford to spend $10 on two tacos that, while are super delicious, aren't enough to fill me up for dinner. They are also always super busy (yay for them!) and the wait can sometimes be really long and they aren't as friendly as they used to be. I still indulge in their nachos and margs from time to time, but their tacos are too darn expensive.
