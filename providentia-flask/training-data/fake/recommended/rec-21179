Hands down the best noodle soup place in Chinatown. The beef noodle soup is my favorite and I have been getting it since I was in college! Price is as low as you can imagine. The only question I have is how sanitary the place is. I have never gotten sick from the food there, but it worries me a little bit sometimes.
