First of all, food is just incredible. Clearly very high quality, creative, diverse, and reasonable priced for the quality. Went with my whole family and everyone was really satisfied. We were even tempted into the brownie with ice cream at the end which was DELICIOUS and definitely had something a little different about it too... hazelnuts maybe? Very impressive beer/wine list as well. Had trouble deciding what to try and when with a Banana Bread Beer? Dude. So good. Second of all, atmosphere is classy enough but not pretentious, and the service was very friendly and professional. Hostesses, waitress, manager, etc. I know it's fairly new so I'm really happy they seem to be doing so well! Beautiful restaurant.
