I've been to Sud several times and highly recommend it. I have to follow a gluten free diet, but with 24 hours notice, the owner Guiseppe, prepared gluten free pasta for me. Tonight, I took in my own gluten free bread and they prepared crostini. I have never been able to eat crostini in a restaurant before, so it was a treat. The wait staff are friendly and extremely attentive. The food is great! I would love to see this place packed so that the owner gets the recognition he deserves.
