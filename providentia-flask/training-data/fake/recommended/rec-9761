Apparently this was the place to go. We were told to come here by a New Yorker. The place is really nice looking. We sat upstairs with a skylight above us. Our server was AWESOME!! He had such charm about him, and was also easy on the eyes. The food though, was awful. I got the steak and potatoes, I know that's not terribly exciting. But it's also something that should be hard to mess up. I have never had steak so greasy before. I didn't even know it was possible to make steak greasy. Half of the steak was well done (as I ordered, also I know not exciting) Â and the other half was still mooing! My potatoes were basically all but burnt. A completely over priced meal if you ask me. My tab for dinner and two glasses of wine(not fancy wine either) was almost 100 bucks.
