I don't know why it took me so long to come in here. I've walked passed it many times since this place opened. I was pleasantly surprised. They make their own sesame crusted pita bread, so fresh and warm when they sere it. I ordered the gyro plate which came with rice and salad. I also ordered the stuffed grape leaves. Everything was really good. I'll definitely be back to try their other dishes.
