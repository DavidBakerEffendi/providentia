Ok so, I've frequented Balthazar's sister location "Pastis" in Chelsea plenty of times so I felt I owed Balthazar the visit. I enjoyed my meal, pretty much what I expected of it, being so familiar with the Pastis experience. Similar decor but something about the inside of Pastis just feels so much more inviting, I think it might be the out of the way location as compared to Balthazar right on a bustling Spring St. First I ordered a lovely chilled glass of Lillet blanc to nudge my palate and prepare her for a wonderful rendezvous of French fare. Then I dove into a wonderful baked goat cheese tart with caramelized onions....very light, I thoroughly enjoyed that. There were plenty of entree selections, however I opted for a roasted lamb sandwich that caught my eye. Taste was spot on, Lamb was soft and well cooked. To go along with this tasty little sandwich I chose a nice glass of Fleurie Grans Fers '07. Holding up a glass of this ruby colored vin rouge to the sol du Manhattan while the lamb melted in my mouth completed my experience. Unfortunately I was pressed for time and had to leave without coffee (not like me at all), maybe I shouldn't have spent so much time across the street at Sur la table. Then I could have commented on coffee and dessert. I give you 3 stars Balthazar for my first visit. I vow to return until I find something on your menu that grabs my taste buds as does the scallops provencal at Pastis. Bon apetit!
