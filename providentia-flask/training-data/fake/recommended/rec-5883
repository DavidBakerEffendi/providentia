I have been in hear a few times and each time I laugh harder, drink more, and eat better food! Each bartender is great and brings there own charm and humor to the place. They each have a great knowledge of the beer they are carrying and are always willing to entertain! I went here because I had a random friday off from work and Stone brewery was having a lunch there. We had the beef brisket sandwich, each time I go here I get this sandwich and each time it gets better and better. tender brisket with an onion ring in the sandwich and some amazing sauce that I cant quite put my finger on. We also got the enchiladas which were cheesy and wonderful and had a fried egg on them which was different for me but added some different texture to the dish and was soooooo delicious. I love the relaxed atmosphere on this place and cant wait to go back again
