Took the family to a show on 50th Street on a day of pouring rain. We Yelped restaurants within 2-3 blocks of the theatre and this one was recommended by the Yelp Concierge. We made reservations in advance, but due to the bad wearther and our having an early dinner the restaurant was a little slow. This was no indication of how excellent the food was though. We had a great waiter who decided to really give us first class service because he only had our and one other table. All of his menu recommendations and portion hints were perfect as I had my three hungry sons with me looking for some good Italian food. I had the signature featured menu item Â of the squid ink pasta with seafood fra diavlo and it was outstanding. We ordered some family style appetizers and got a great assortment of hot and cold antipasto that we all enjoyed. My wife had a seafood risotto that she really enjoyed. They had some exotic beers on the menu and the itialian/belgian collaboration beer the waiter suggested was great with my seafood. Previous Yelps on this place definitely steered us correctly to this pleasant surprise.
