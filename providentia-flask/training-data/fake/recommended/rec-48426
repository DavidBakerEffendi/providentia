Luluc has only ever been good to me. I love the backyard, I love sitting in the front when the doors are open, I love getting take-out. I once had the cheese totellini with moushroom sauce five days in a row, and I looked forward to it every day. I might have it again today. Just thinking about it has given me a craving. Everything I've ever had at Luluc has been delicious, and I think I've tried damn near everything on the menu. The service is johnny-on-the-spot, the decor is charming, and I'm not sure what else there is to say. One of my favorite Smith Street spots, and a place that I recommend if anyone asks.
