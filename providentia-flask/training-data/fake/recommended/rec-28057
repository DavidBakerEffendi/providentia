Since it opened years back I've always wanted to try the bustling Greek restaurant located adjacent to my apartment complex. It always seemed like it was not to be with the dinner crowd I would see every night waiting to get a seat. One afternoon last week my girlfriend decided that we needed to go there for lunch. Thank goodness that I had the day off and to Taverna Kyclades we went. We were seated immediately and after the waiter took our order we destroyed two plates of hot olive bread dripping in olive oil. OMG. She ordered the salmon steak and I the grilled calamari with lemon potatoes. We cleaned our plates and loosened our belts as we were both full and content with our choices. I dont get many days off but the next time that I happen to be in the mood for Greek food, I'm going to Taverna Kyclades.
