I love Kafana and their food! I grow up on this food and now, being in the USA mostly and not having enough time to go to Serbia as much as I want, when I feel really nostalgic I like coming here. I am not such a meat lover, but I can't resist to have pljeskavica or cevapi from time to time. I also love burek and ajvar. The restaurant is small but soooo cute, the atmosphere is warm and friendly. I will give more stars when they import more Serbian drinks :)
