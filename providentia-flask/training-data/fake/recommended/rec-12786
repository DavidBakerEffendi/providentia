I came here on Friday night with some friends and didn't have to wait for more than five minutes. This is not where you go to have a romantic date or anything fancy- this is where you go for tasty hand pulled noodles, hence the name. Â  We got the duck noodle soup, the ox tail noodle soup and the pan fried duck noodles. With each dish we tried a different variety of noodle (regular hand pulled, wide hand pulled and knife cut). The knife cut were the most unique so I would recommend these. The broth of the ox tail soup was far superior to the duck noodle broth. It had that extra hearty flavor that makes you feel like you're in an Asian Campbell's soup commercial. We also tried the fried pork dumplings and the fujinese fish balls with pork filling. I was really impressed with the fish balls. They were really fresh and juicy. I couldn't get enough of them. The pork dumplings were mediocre, not really special. I'm excited to come back and try the rest of the menu!
