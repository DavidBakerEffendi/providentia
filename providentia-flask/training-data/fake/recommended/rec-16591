Delicious! I had the zucchini hummus pizza, pickled ginger scallops and the hazelnut chocolate caviar cupcake. All the dishes had interesting texture plays - the scallops were topped with some sort of dehydrated bean; the pizza had wasabi peas; and the cupcakes had these little chocolate balls of yumminess ("caviar"). (They were heavenly.) In terms of ambiance, the other reviews pretty much cover it. Small, communal sitting, but I went on a Sunday and there was no wait, and it wasn't too crowded! Highly recommnend. Yum!
