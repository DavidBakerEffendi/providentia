Possibly one of the best steak houses in the Tristate area you get what u pay for .the porterhouse doesn't need to be cut with a knife but a spoon Â the way it should be .all the foods great and they're always true to they're word.if your looking for a little romantic getaway take the ferry over to the island and stop here you won't be disappointed.
