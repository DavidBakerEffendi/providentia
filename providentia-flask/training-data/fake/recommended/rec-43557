Wo! What an awesome find ... This place had great atmosphere and had a beautiful fit out. We ordered the sangria ... So good and 5 dishes - the crudo scallops (amazing) the Brussel sprouts with chorizo, the grilled squid, the lamb balls and the ox tail peppers ... They were an absolute must have!! They were amazing!! We will be back to this little gem!!
