Came here tonight on a friend's recommendation and was really not disappointed. We shared the French Onion Dumplings, Philly cheesesteak egg rolls, Thai chicken lettuce wraps and mushroom flatbread. Everything was good, but the lettuce wraps were my least favorite. Overall, a fantastic meal and a good time was had by all.
