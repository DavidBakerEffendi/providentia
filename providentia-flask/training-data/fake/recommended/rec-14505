This place is the ultimate brunch spot - super delicious food, great staff, lots of celebrity spotting, and it's small so you aren't waiting too long for your food if you're hungry. BUT being small means that it's tough to get a table - if you plan to go on a Sunday, you can forget it if you get there after midday. My favourite is a one-two combo of the dippy eggs with challah soldiers and the grapefruit and yogurt - totally healthy, right? On my most recent visit, my dining companions went for the green eggs and the Jack's Breakfast, and both were completely satisfied.
