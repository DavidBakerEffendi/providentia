The wait will ruin your buzz, but the soup dumplings will make up for it by bursting inside your mouth with delicious juices. They also remind me of balls. The schweddy ones. (I'm sorry, Ben & Jerry's started it.) I am addicted to soup dumplings and I demand that they be eaten every time I come to NY. You know how Patti Stanger, from Millionaire Matchmaker, says you have to have your dating non-negotiables? Well, soup dumplings are a life non-negotiable. If someone asked, "Would you rather be obese and live next to a restaurant with delicious soup dumplings or be skinny and never be able to eat soup dumplings again," I would choose being obese. (Totally just lost my male audience.)
