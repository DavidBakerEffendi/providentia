Came here with my wife looking for some good Latin American food in Philly. Didn't disappoint!! Food was very well prepared... I had the Masitas de Cerdo and my wife had the La Robinita. Both DELICIOSO!! Our server was very nice and made sure we had an exceptional experience. Even the owner came out to greet us and checked up on us which I thought was great!! Highly recommend!!
