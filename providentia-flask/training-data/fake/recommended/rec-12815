the mac and cheese is worth all the talk i have to admit.the fried oreos is greatttt .I've had the meatloaf it was OK .the pulled pork tacos was also good.the one thing that's a Â blow is that they have a different special for different days. the raspberry lemonade was good the first time i had it the second time around it was way to sour for me.its served in a glass jar which i think is very cute.
