I was not sure whether to give this place 3 or 4 stars, 3.5 would probably be the best. First - it was crowded! And they really try to squeeze as many people in as they can. The table we were seated was TINY for two people, we really had a hard time balancing our drinks and food there, which made eating kind of uncomfortable. The atmosphere is nice though. Food in general was mediocre, especially as you can get the same food for a much lower price (i had the roasted pork and my bf some enchiladas). What was really, really good though was the corn. I can definitely recommend this! I will return to try their cuban sandwiches for which they are supposedly famous for, and then I can probably update my review to 4 stars ;)
