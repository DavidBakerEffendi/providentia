This is as good as it gets, when it comes to a real gourmand experience.   My mother and I went on my 34th birthday and had a brilliant experience. I unfortunately forgot what I ate, but that I simply had seem to be eating in heaven.  The food was that spectacular.   I suppose you could call it food coma, in a sense, without having to eat much but eat well.  The service was attentive without being cloying.   Highly recommended.  And for me, only for special occasions, as, in this case, quality has its value.
