Is this a "Dive Bar"?....Yes.  Is it in the 'Hood?.....Yes.  Did I have an enjoyable time with my family?......Yes At first glimspe, you might ride past, but when you go through the door, you're made to feel welcome. There's no obsence language allowed in this place.  Unusual but nice.  They have a kitchen on  the premises that sells some "off the hook" seafood.  Not what you would expect from a place like this. My only complaint is they don't sell Jameson.  I'm a Jameson drinker and had to settle for JD.  Oh well.  Not the worst thing I've had to compromise in life. If you give it a try, ask for Miss Mary.  Nicest Bartender I've ever met and she has a good "pour".
