Went there for brunch: 3 in my group got the frittatas, one the cheeseburger (maybe hamburger? I forgot what he really got), and I got the waffles. Not one complaint from anyone- Frittatas were light and not too dense; cheese/hamburger was a nice hunk of meat and cooked nicely; waffles were light with perfect whipped cream to fruit ratio. Also got the pickles- I am a sucker for homemade pickles and these did not disappoint AT ALL. Service was pretty good- refills made quickly and waitress was perfect mix of attentive but not overbearing. Definitely recommend!
