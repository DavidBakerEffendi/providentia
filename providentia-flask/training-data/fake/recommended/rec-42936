as others have mentioned, this place has a sexy, speakeasy vibe. i prefer to go weeknights when it's not insanely crowded. the specialty cocktails are lovely & the striking bartenders are friendly & helpful. i dig the kobayashi & am just nerd enough to appreciate the star trek reference. food-wise, this has become my favorite place for tartare. it's mixed table side to your desired degree of spiciness & it's delicious. have also enjoyed the unique marrow poppers & friends have enjoyed the orechiette. (i always get the tartare because i go when i'm craving it.) while the cocktails are on the spendy side- though typical for manhattan - i found the food to be reasonably priced as well as tasty. i usually have girl's nights here (the male scenery is quite picturesque) but i think this would be a fab place to bring out-of-towners too. (btw - the female scenery is nice too but i tend not to notice that as much!) when you go, remember there's no sign - just an awning with the address & a fortune teller sign. enjoy!
