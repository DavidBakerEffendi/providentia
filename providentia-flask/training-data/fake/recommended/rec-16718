I thought the place was a blast.  The food was delicious.  I am still thinking about the zucchini pizza and the hamburger sliders.  The pork buns were very good.  The paneer was yummy. Desert was amazing and chocolate.  I did not care for the duck and portobello.   You have to share a table which I thought was fun.  We were three and we met three lovely strangers.  I thought that chef JEHANGIR MEHTA was darling and his food was fabulous.  The seating is very close together so if you are afraid of being close to your neighbor, this is not your kind of place ...but I  thought it was fabulous and am looking  forward to my next visit!
