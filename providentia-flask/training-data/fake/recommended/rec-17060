I've been here 3x's & I must say the drinks were awesome!  The food was "meh"!!! I really wished that the food was better because the drinks were really tasty, lol. The service was okay. Our server did the bare minimum. If you're looking for a great drink hit them but you may be let down if you order a entrée.
