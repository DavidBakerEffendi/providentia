These guys get an upgrade for this visit. We went early afternoon to redeem an almost expired Groupon, memories of poor service and flat beer dancing in my head. We had no complaints about service this round because, lo and behold, there were no waitresses, it was the bartender that waited on us and the slugs you fellow yelpers have harped on extensively weren't around. Suzy should have the bartender train staff, he was good and the beer wasn't flat. Can't go wrong with the food, get the combo, you won't regret it.
