What a bright and cheery space! I went with a friend for lunch, and was pleasantly surprised. It was absolutely delightful, but I don't know if I would be able to wait an hour on the weekends and suffer huge crowds. I ordered the truffled fried eggs with asparagus and artichoke. It was delicious and, as far as brunch in New York goes, very healthy. The only thing was that my portions seemed a tad bit smaller than my friend's, but I guess that brings me back to the healthy part. All in all, ask the servers what they like, since they seem to know the menu pretty well. Truffled fried eggs were a hit.
