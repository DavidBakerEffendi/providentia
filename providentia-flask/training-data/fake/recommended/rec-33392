I went here for brunch on New Year's Day. The atmosphere is great and I had the feeling that the people working there really cared about the place and what they were doing with their food. The interior is lovely and cozy and I had a nice time with my friends. I'm giving them three stars instead of two because I felt like everything was well-intentioned, although in all honesty the sandwich I got was about as good as something I would have bought at a corner deli and not worth the $7.50 I paid for it. Also, they don't give free refills on coffee. Maybe I expect this in New York and I shouldn't, but it was a really, really small cup, and when you're hung over and badly in need of some joe, one little cup just isn't going to cut it. Also, I went with a party of four and were told we'd have a 20 minute wait, which turned into about an hour. I don't mind waiting, but I would have appreciated knowing in advance. In short: go here if you're looking for ambiance but won't be too bummed out with a less-than-spectacular meal.
