Definitely an above average japanese place but coming in with such high expectations based on the reviews, I was overall disappointed. My party ordered a lot. The yaki udon was very good- get it with the pork, very flavorful. The yaki tori was solid but nothing special. The squid teriyaki was quite good but again not amazing. The onigiri was not up to par with ones that I've had before. Way too much rice and the seaweed was stale and flavorless. The most disappointing dish was their signature dish- the mentai pasta. This tasted like a cheap pasta carbonara with spaghetti noodles. The noodles themselves were not tasty and the sauce was way too heavy but not flavorful. The seafood pancake had too much sauce. Overall not a bad meal for the price, but did not meet my expectations
