I'm well aware that this is my first review on yelp. That should NOT take away from the deliciousness that is Barrio Chino because this review has been a long time coming. -Be prepared to wait and try not to complain about it because you'll be giving them your phone number and they'll be calling you in an hour (at least). We generally end up at Top Hops around the corner to pass the time. -Strawberry. Vanilla. Margarita. Don't judge by the name. It's fresh super and not too sweet. -This is one of the few places I prefer steak over the majority of other things on the menu. Seriously, it's delicious in that melt-in-your-mouth kind of way. The place is definitely on the smaller size, but it's the lower east side. If you're looking to avoid that, you're probably hanging out in the wrong neighborhood. Overall, worth checking out.
