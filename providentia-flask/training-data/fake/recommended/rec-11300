I only care for Karaoke! I love Karaoke! I'm a hard-core Chinese Karaoke person - Cantonese & Mandarin - you name it I will sing it!! That's not to say I don't sing English songs as well, because I love Karaoke! And I love Yakitori for Karaoke! I've never eaten there before, but I'm sure the food is excellent as well!
