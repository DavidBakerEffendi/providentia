I love this place! Delicious food and wonderful ambiance. I've only been here for brunch (but after this experience I'm definitely coming back for dinner).   I was looking for a brunch place to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon. I didn't want a place that had a long wait,  was too crazy or too loud. Found this place on Yelp, and their brunch starts late (at noon) so I figure it wouldn't be too full or too loud since all the other brunch places were already open and bustling.   Their food was delicious, I had their empanadas which I loved! Plus, it was happy hour so drinks were cheap and their bottle of wines were 1/2 price. The service was decent - depending on who waits you.  One of the waitress kept forgetting parts of our orders.  Also note that they take cash only, so better hit the ATM before coming in. The place was pretty quiet with only two tables being occupied.  Most of the people who walked in during brunch were ex-pats and regulars since they all seem to know the owner and chatted a bit before picking a table to sit down. Very relaxing and intimate.  Perfect place for a chill afternoon and perfect for a lazy Sunday. =)
