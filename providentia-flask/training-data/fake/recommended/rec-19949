Sushi with a side of Hip Hop...  At least on the weekend evenings. Why am I loving on this spot right now?  Their sushi is good, atmosphere is young and semi trendy but most of all, they play a killer mix of hip hop on the weekend evenings during dinner.  It's not a quiet, tranquil restaurant for relaxing.  It's a young, fun and good place to get the night started.
