Been here a few times now.  The pho is delicious.  Large size is good and could actually go for the XL although if you're not super hungry the XL could be too much.  Had the spring rolls (thought the meat was a bit tasteless but that was during their grand opening and noticed many people ordering this item lately so perhaps it has changed); banh mi (very reasonably priced for what you get - good) & grilled pork chop on the bone (this was tasty although a bit pricey for what you get - not fatty which is a + in my book).  They also have non-Vietnamese cuisines from other parts of Southeast Asia which I am going to force myself to try but I haven't been able to pry myself away from the usual items I've mentioned so far because YUM...The owner is very friendly (assume he's the owner because he seems to run the place).
