It was ok.  We got a table by the kitchen.  It was really hot and really loud. They were throwing around pots and pans like some hells kitchen scene.  The banging was really annoying. The bruschetta was ok.  A little to heavy on the meat.  Nothing very refined.  Seemed a bit diner-esque.   The duck in cavatelli was average.  Good pasta, but the sauce was just a bland brown gravy.   My boyfriend had the scallops and they were really good. I thought the ambience was awful and the wait staff were a little curt.  I'll give them a break, because working in that heat and volume would drive me nuts.
