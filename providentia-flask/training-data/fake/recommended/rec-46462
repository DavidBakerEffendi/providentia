Come here hungry. EXTREMELY hungry. I ordered the beef brisket noodle soup, and my God, the bowl of noodles was enormous. I wasn't starving when I arrived here. After 15 minutes of eating, I could have sworn that more noodles magically appeared in my bowl. It just looked like I hadn't even touched the dish, but I had been slurping and chewing for at least 15 minutes, and I was STUFFED. The broth was very flavorful and the texture of the noodles was just perfect for me. There was a lot of cilantro floating around in my soup... I hate cilantro, so I just spooned them out. That being said, this place definitely does not skimp on any of the ingredients. There's plenty of noodles, beef, veg, and soup, and it's a steal for under $7!
