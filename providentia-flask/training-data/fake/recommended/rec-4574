Always good. So good in fact, we go here despite it being rather far from our house. CR has taken the space in our hearts previously occupied by Mikro, due to CRs ability to always have a great tap list, great prices, AVAILABLE SEATS, and quick ATTENTIVE service. The burger is never a mistake. It comes on an english muffin slathered with coleslaw and some sort of bacon jam surprise. The beef itself is moist and flavorful without being too heavy.
