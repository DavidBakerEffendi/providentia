JUMPIN' JUNIPER! A couple of friends and I decided to grab burgers for dinner.  I remembered walking past this place and we all looked on Yelp to see favorable ratings.  When he headed over around 8PM on a Friday night, there were only a couple of tables occupied.   Things that make you go hmm?  But, we sat down anyway and perused the menu with the hope that we hadn't been steered wrong.  We ordered the following: Crab Bisque - Pretty good.  I'm not really a soup person unless I'm freezing to death. Baked Macaroni & Cheese (special) - Creamy and topped with panko but a little under-seasoned. Burgers + Fries - I'm a sucker for a good burger and fries and Juniper ain't playing.  Regular, Sweet Potato, AND Spicy Fries.  ALL delicious!  Simple but delicious and well-prepared.  WIN! But the pièce de résistance was definitely the BBQ Rib Sandwich. Long, long ago in a galaxy far, far away... I ate a McRib sandwich.  In theory, it should be the greatest sandwich ever.  But, it was not and I never went near one again. Juniper created what should have been the additional bajillion dollars that McDonald's made on the McRib.  HOLY COW. Juicy, succulent boneless ribs with a slather of barbecue sauce that has a slight kick, topped with pickles on a brioche bun.  YUMMMMMMMSIES. The BYOB is just the cherry on top.  Woooo!  Our bill was like $54 for three people.
