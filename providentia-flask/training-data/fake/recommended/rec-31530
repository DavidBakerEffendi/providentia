A much-needed addition this side of Broad. Just had the Bronx Bomber: loaded with crisp, flavorful kraut, sweet red onions with just the right spice, brown mustard. The weiner itself had a satisfying "snap" due to the natural casing. The house-cut fries were awesome, with a nicely browned skin outside and fluffy potato inside. Even the dipping sauce was excellent. The service could not have been friendlier or faster. Can't wait to go back to try the other specialties, and a standard dog with nothing but yellow mustard. Also looking forward to the promised Philly dog, a throwback to my all-time favorite, Levi's. Thanks, Hot Diggity!
