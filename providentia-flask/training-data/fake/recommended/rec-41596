What a great addition to the neighborhood! This patch of South Street has a lot of great spots, but was sorely missing a bar that catered to the sports crowd. Founding Fathers just opened, but I've already found it to be a great spot to catch the game. The drinks are priced well, the food was tasty, and the place is just really nice looking. Looking forward to seeing it as it grows!
