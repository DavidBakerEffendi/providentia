The food at Osteria Morini is very good. I had an early dinner here last night. While the dishes were expertly prepared, the temperature of the food was lukewarm. I ordered the Polipo as an appetizer and the Cappelletti as my entree. The pasta was very good. Rich but not too heavy. The grilled octopus came with a great tasting wild red rice salad underneath. My fianc√© ordered the Torcia and the Branzino. The fish was moist and flavorful and It came with a side of tomato caponata. The seafood ragu on his pasta was delicious. He loved every bite of it. I ordered an Affogato for dessert. It was amazing. The last great Affogato I had was at Marea last year. I should be drinking more of these. Everything from the service to the cocktails to the ambiance was great. We will return.
