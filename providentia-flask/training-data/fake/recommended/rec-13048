This place is fantastic. Lovely interior, but the chairs are so uncomfortable that it actually makes me want to eat as fast as I can so I can leave! ... oh maybe they do that on purpose, because there is always a line of people waiting to get in! three words: SPICY BASIL NOODLES. do it. Dinner is pretty cheap, for a nice restaurant, great servers, great food and for it being NYC. For 1 appetizer and two plates the bill came out to $24. I don't know how that is even possible. Should I mention the fast service? If you are thinking of bringing a date here, probably would wait on that because the seating is quite odd. As are the tables, they set you apart more than you would like to be. Plus, the energy of the room is so lively (which is a good thing), but it gets loud.
