I love a place where the servers are knowledgeable about a somewhat eclectic menu and can help you make informed selections to please your palette. The ambiance is reminiscent of a cafe and b&b hybrid. We chose the elevated window seat and sitting storefront in a S. Philly restaurant was awesome. Had the cornmeal waffle with vegetarian chili and a macchiato. My companion enjoyed a turkey and smoked Gouda panning with a strawberry and arugula salad and dulce de leche iced coffee. Everything was fanDAMNtastic!! Travel a little, and you never what you might find ;-)
