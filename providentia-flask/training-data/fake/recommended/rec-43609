I agree with the other Yelpers on this place - I was searching in the neighborhood and found Chop Shop.  The food was VERY good but what was really outstanding for me was the service. It started out as I was trying to choose a drink -- I didn't want to go cocktail and the descriptions of the 3 choices of beer didn't sound appetizing so my server worked with me to find a wine.  He let me try a few different ones so I would really enjoy it.  He was super knowledgable, which I appreciated.  The only reason for 4 stars here is that pretty much all the wines were tasteless - I think a lot of Asian restaurants are just lacking in beer/wine menus but the server was helpful in helping me out. The server was also HONEST which I always appreciate.  My friend and I were choosing between 2 appetizers and 2 entrees and he helped us pick the right one based on spice level and what would go well together (we were sharing an appetizer and sharing an entree). We ended up with pork dumplings and pad thai -- yummy yummy.
