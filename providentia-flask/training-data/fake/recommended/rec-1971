Boyfriend and I finally made it here over the weekend. We were the only people in the joint at 2pm on a Saturday for most of our stay, though a few patrons did wander in near the end to grab a drink at the bar. I have to give ASB credit for putting down roots in this neighborhood and getting the ball rolling on its inevitable gentrification. The decor is unassuming and simple, but it works for the space. A lot of the original details of the building look like they were salvaged. The rotating drink menu is written on old chalkboards, which was a nice touch. They also have cider on draft, which was a redeeming quality for me. Unfortunately, I was not wowed by the food. I had the mushroom seitan cheesesteak, and the bread was so hard it crumbled whenever I tried to pick it up, creating a lava flow of metled cheese and fake meat. I ended up going at it with a fork. The flavor combination was off for me, it was too overloaded with black pepper and jalepeno, the mushrooms and seitan had the same texture, which was unfortunate. Boyfriend liked his pulled pork sandwich, and the fries we split were good, too. All in all I wouldn't make a special trip south of Washington to come back here, but I probably will since Boyfriend seemed more gung-ho about it.
