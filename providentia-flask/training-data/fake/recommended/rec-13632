This is so delicious!! My mouth is salivating right now at midnight, while I'm far far away from the cart. This is really great halal, so great that whenever I work an event (catering) at the Hilton hotel across the street, I must stop here before going home. I've actually made this a tradition :) I'll start by saying that yes, the lines are sometimes long, but they do go very quickly. Next I will say that the value you get is amazing for the quality of food AND the quantity! The meat is oh so good, I want it right now. Why must I live so far? Or write this review so late? My order changes depending on mood, from chicken, to lamb, to combination! The chicken is always juicy and fresh without being over cooked. The lamb is prefect, with it's fatty meat flavor and also never dry. The combination is the best of both, if you mind not having a huge portion of one all to yourself. This leads to the portions, they are so large that two people can share one and be fully content after (expect for your taste buds screaming out for more) And p.s.- the white sauce rocks my world ;-D while the red sauce is so hot that it burns my insides, slightly Â ~:-x
