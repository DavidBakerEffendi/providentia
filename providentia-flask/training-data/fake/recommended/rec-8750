Ambiance = 4. The seating arrangements make this restaruant feel a lightly cramped, especially for the UES, but this does lend itself to a cozy and unpretentious atmosphere (think, good option for date #2 or dinner with your parents).   Service = definite 5. Very attentive and polite servers who did not rush. Food however, is just a 3. The tomato/burrato dish the best part of the meal, but by no means outstanding. I also ordered the eggplant/ricotta dish and the pesto cavatelli, neither of which felt appropriately seasoned and therefore lacked any excitement.   If you come here with a date, stick to the wine and some of the simpler small plates and cheese selections. Other than the quality of the service, this was not a very memorable meal I probably won't be back, there are too many other better Italian options in NYC.
