I went to Barbuto and was happy with pretty much the entire experience. I had a reservation and didn't have to wait at all. The garage-style windows were open, allowing an al fresco dining experience, which was nice with the weather and because it probably lessened the noise level. The service was competent, efficient, but not over-bearing. The food was delicious. I had the saut√©ed calamari salad app, which was great with the potatoes, olives and fresh herbs. The calamari was perfectly cooked. If I had any complaint with this appetizer or Barbuto generally, it would be that the food bordered on being over salted. For my main, I had the monkfish, which was a generous portion and well prepared. I also tried my friends' meals. The jw roast chicken was sooo good. It had lots of seasonings (maybe fennel, among others) and was topped with a gremolata. The gnocchi was also good and the squash it came with was roasted to sweet, delicate perfection. The butterscotch pudding dessert with pumpkin brittle had a really luscious texture, but bordered on being to sweet. I would definitely return to Barbuto and recommend it.
