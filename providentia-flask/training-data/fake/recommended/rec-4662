I think this place has such high reviews because of the gluten-free options, but for those of us who are blessed (or cursed, depending on how you look at it) with the ability to eat gluten, I thought it was pretty average. So many of the pasta dishes were gluten free, that I decided to opt out of the pasta, and I had the hangar steak instead.  (They were also out of a bunch of the raviolis and a risotto as well, which limited the options.) It was pretty pricey, so I don't think I will be going back. We did bring in a cake and they provided us with a candle, so I added back another star for that.  (No cake cutting fee was incurred)
