One of the better new spots in Forest Hills! Its an incredibly welcoming wine bar and tapas place. The wine selection is really quite good; their choice of reds are really good. The food is always well done, and while the its not an expansive menu, that's what I really like about this place! Do what you do best, and do it consistently! The mac and cheese is awesome, as are the sandwiches and Sunday brunch has nice live music. The staff are awesome, really that's an important feature that many a place in the neighborhood forget. In short, stop missing out folks.
