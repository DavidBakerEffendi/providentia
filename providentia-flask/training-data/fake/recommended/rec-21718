Went on a saturday night for dinner given high Yelp and NYMag reviews. In a nutshell: service was slow and food, though inspired, was too complicated and many flavors got lost, to the point where I barely enjoyed any dish. Certainly not worth the money. Service Service at our table was slow (the waiter ignored our requests for water, and honey for my tea, until my tea was cold) because of the larger bday party table next to us. Appetizers: got the cornmeal crusted oysters and with red (tomato?) sauce, but flavor of oysters was overpowered by everything else in dish. The pan con chorizo was a nice take on the classic dish but did not wow me. Entrees: If the waiter had asked is how we were doing after our entrees were delivered, an hour after we ordered, I would have told him that my scallops were WAY too salty to enjoy, though at least they weren't overcooked (for which I would have given 2 stars). The duck, which 2 people ordered medium, per the waiter's recommendation, was bland and chewy and took unpleasantly long to swallow -- I spat mine out after a while. One person at our table of 4 enjoyed her roasted chicken dish.
