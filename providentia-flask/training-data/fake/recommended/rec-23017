Never take trips with friends that live by the Food Network. A two hour train ride, 30 minute walk to the location (a nice indoor food market). What was the name of that place again? Where will we find it? Oh... there it is. In the center of the building. Let's stand in line, here's the end.... nope, that's a corner. Keep walking... After 1.25 hours in line we ordered what EVERYONE has raved about both on Food Channel and here on yelp. OMG!!! angels singing, enlightmentment achieved, TOP SCORE for the worlds best sandwich.!! Sorry. I was expecting better and I got meh. Time invested was not worth the product. Nothing really bad to report only that I'm a sheep and should use my own mind more often.
