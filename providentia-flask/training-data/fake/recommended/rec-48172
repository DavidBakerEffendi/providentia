Terrible!  I ordered a 6 inch sub.  It took 20 minutes to get my sandwich.  The person that ordered right in front of me received their sandwich 10 minutes before me.   When I approached the counter to inquire where my sandwich was, the woman that took my order looked at me like I had two heads.  I asked where my sandiwhch was and why a person that had ordered 5 minutes after me had just received his sandwich.  The other person behind the counter said that he had received 3 orders for the same sandwich that I had ordered shortly after mine and decided to make them all at the same time because it was easier for him to do it that way.  So instead of making the sandwiches in the order received to minimize wait times, they prefer to make things in the easiest way possible to the employees. When the sandwich finally arrived it had more mayo on it than meat.  All I could taste was garlic mayo.  It clearly had been made quickly since it was being made with other customer sandwiches simultaneously. I would avoid this shop at all costs.  There are so many better sandwich shops in the area and these other shops actually value the customers' time.
