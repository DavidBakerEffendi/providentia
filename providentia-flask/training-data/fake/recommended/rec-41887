I give this place 5 stars for the weekday and 1 star for the weekend. If you are a fan of spray tan, popped collars, polo shirts, sunglasses at night and the abrasive personalities that those things bring along, then the weekends are going to be awesome for you. Otherwise hit this place up during the week. The atmosphere is great and the beers are good, the crowd that spans a 15 yard line out the door on the weekend is awful. A friend who works at Johnny Brenda's, across the street, refers to those nights as "Bro-verflow"...
