Excellent service - they sat us without a reservation in 10 min on a weeknight. the host was polite and the waiter was perfectly attentive Excellent food - Delicious skate dish with delectable (non kosher, no veg friendly sides), Good (a bit too over sauced) tuna dish Would definitely go back again. Laid back vibe (although the music was a bit loud and trendy for my liking) and nicely decorated
