LOVE THIS PLACE!!! I came here last night with a few girlfriends and it was amazing!! The wait was not long, since I got there early.  But, by the time we left at around 7:00pm, the line went past the door.  The ambience of the restaurant is catchy and very relaxing.  Here's what we ordered: 1) Magic Hat #9 (alcoholic beverage): very light and refreshing.  I certainly enjoyed this lager as it was not too bitter, but it had just the right amount of flavor! 2) Fried Pickles: quite good, but surprisingly, the pickles were not too pickle-y or sour.  I wished it was bit more tart in flavor. 3) Sweet Potato Fries: So good.  They brush the top with some cinnamon and sugar, so it give them an extra sweetness which paired nicely with the sauces. 4) Truffle Burger: SO GOOD!!! I just had so much flavor with every bite and it was right on target.  The flavor was outstanding, the truffle cheese was spot-on, and the patty itself was juicy and delicious! 5) Earth Burger: My friend loved it!! 6) Slash Burger: special burger of the day.  My friend enjoyed this burger so much.  It had avocados, shitake mushrooms, parmesan crisps, etc. Overall, this place is worth the money and time.  It's one that I'll keep coming back for just to try out each burger they have.  The service was super friendly and quick.  This place definitely is a MUST-TRY!!
