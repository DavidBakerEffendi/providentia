Church Street, in downtown Burlington, is a closed street redeveloped for entertainment and dining. Borders, Starbuck's Ben & Jerries, and independent bars and restaurants are typical.  The area is very close to the university of Vermont so you can expect a college age crowd, and fairly low prices. Menu items were typically $10 - $20.00 for everything from hamburgers to steaks. I will not comment on the nightlife as I was there early, and am 60 years old. However to the folks that complained, you should probably stay away from Church street if you are looking for something more sophisticated I can only say that when you mix college kids and beer the results have not changed since I was in college. My wife and I had very good, if not excellent service. While it got a little noisy as the place filled. That was to be expected. I thought the décor was at least "authentic looking" and not over done. The food, corned beef and cabbage, was excellent. Far exceeding my expectations. I would like to add that it was unseasonable warm and humid in Vermont while we were there and this was one of the few places that had air conditioning. While I would not say that Ri Ra is as good as it gets I would go there again, and have no problem recommending the place.
