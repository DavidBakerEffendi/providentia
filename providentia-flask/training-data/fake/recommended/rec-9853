The food is awesome! Who knew that a plate of pickles as an appetizer could be soooo interesting? As a flexitarian, I try sometimes to have an all veggie day. This is easy at Rye since they always have enticing vegetarian options. The mushroom lasagna is delicious. We came on New Year's Eve and had a great meal with beautiful wine and nice drinks. The entree was so large that both of us ended up taking the leftovers home. The next day when looked at our food we saw how beautful it looked and this is one of the reasons for the missing star. The place is so dark that it is hard to fully appreciate how well the food is presented. Not only that, I always have to read the menu to the hubby because the place is so dark. Other than that, the decor and the ambience is great.
