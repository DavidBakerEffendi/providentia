Food was a 4 and service was a 2.  Took 25 minutes to get waters at the bar.  They are friendly but overwhelmed.  Truffle burger was very good but came medium at best, not medium rate as ordered.  Fried pickles were decent and onion rings just ok.  The burger is worth going back if you can avoid a wait.  One trick is to eat at the bar.
