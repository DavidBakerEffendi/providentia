The food is not so bad here and comparable to many other pizza places but my wife and I stopped coming here because one of the owners has a terribly unpleasant attitude.The one owner with the black hair,along with his wife are nice,but the other guy(his cousin)is bitter and seems a bit shady if you ask me.It's almost as if he secretly despises americans.
