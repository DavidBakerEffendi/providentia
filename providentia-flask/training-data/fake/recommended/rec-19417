One of the best places I've ever found for a REALLY GREAT BREAKFAST!  Six friends were in Philly on Sunday morning to attend the Van Gogh exhibit at the Art Museum.  Decided to try Sabrina's since it was close to the museum & had good reviews on Yelp.  I'll add my "thumbs up" to the reviews.....food is great; service is great & prices won't leave you with a hole in your wallet.  Our group had lox & onion omelets; stuffed french toast; "eggs over"; & a cheese omelet.  Everything was fresh & tasty...coffee was great.....server was very attentive.  We arrived at 9:30 & were seated almost immediately......when we left around 10:45 there was a wait, so plan accordingly if you're on a schedule.  We didn't get a chance to try any of the lunch or dinner offerings, but if they're anything like breakfast, then Sabrina's can't be beat.
