Exceptional cheeses.  Great eco wine list.  Incredibly knowledgable wait staff (how do they memorize all the facts about each cheese?!  I'm astonished.) But the food was not so impressive.  My fiance and I ordered a few different entrees with friends, just to get a taste of the menu.  None of us were at all impressed.  Nothing special about the food here, folks. Bottom line: go here for cheese, a little wine, then head to another restaurant for the entrees.  The focus of Talula's Garden is CHEESE.  and only cheese.
