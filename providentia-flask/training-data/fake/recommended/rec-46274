This review may be more diffucult to write then i thought it would be. Reason being is that the entire experience was so utterly forgettable  I do remember paying 30+ $ for 5 little scallops( that may have very well been skate fin)  Money not really being the issue as much as the bland and uncreative way in which the were prepared and presented.  My steak,my 56$ steak. Again money not being the issue. It was aged! And dry. Very dry. We did sit outside and it was lovely. And sitting outside on a beautiful july evening is certainly a beautiful way to enjoy an evening As long as your not spending it here   Bars cute . Drink  get drunk and leave Please leave
