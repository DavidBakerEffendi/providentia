Oh Morning Glory how I love thee...... 2 years ago, I lived across the street from this diner.  Waking up on Saturday mornings, I'd wander across the street and sign in my name.  Then walk to the CVS on South Street grab a paper and head back to the diner and then...wait.  For them to call my name of course.  But the wait is always worth it. Morning glory is an interesting, cramped little diner.  The coffee is served piping hot in camping mugs.  And the specials are always good.  Some of my most favorite meals there include:  the mexican eggs benedict (chorizo and poblano hollandaise sauce!), big breakfast pizza (focaccio and cheese and potatoes oh my), pecan waffles with fluffy peach butter, the monte cristo sandwich, oh and of course monkey french toast (fried bananas!).  I could go on and on.   Now that I'm in Virginia, I miss the diner more than ever.  On my weekends I try to imitate the meals I once had there by cooking it up myself.  The brunch scene is not so great here.  But oh, it just isn't the same.   When I visit Philly...I will also visit the Morning Glory diner for sure.
