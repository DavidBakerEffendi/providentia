i've been here a few times, and i'll come back for a few reasons.  the food has consistently exceeded my expectations, the drink menu has a very nice selection of sake, and Hibachi is always fun for a crowd! but this over-zealous bussing of tables needs to stop. the service, however, is hit or miss. sometimes i come, and everything is great. the server is nice, makes recommendations (this is how i found the joys of unfiltered sake), allows us to take our time with the meal, and i really enjoy myself. other times, and not when things are busy, around 5:30 on a wednesday evening, everything was very rushed. our waitress checked in with us every two minutes to take our order, even though menus were still open at the table. she rudely reached over my plate to take another dish from the table, that we were not even finished with.  my friends plate was cleared from under her chopsticks, before her last bite of sushi got to her mouth. that kind of militant bussing of table really turns me off to a place. the times i've been for hibachi everything has been wonderful. the hibachi cowboys always put on a nice show, and the sake flows like water. the food is always great, and i've never been rushed through a meal with the hibachi setting.
