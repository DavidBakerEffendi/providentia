Himalaya Cafe is great - cheap, healthy, delicious.  I usually get take-out, but there are a couple tables (rather uncomfortable looking, to be honest), and also a little front area with some low comfy chairs.  It's doesn't make ergonomic-dining sense, but it's where I like to sit when I dine in. My favorite dishes are the sha momo (beef dumplings) and the chasha shamdey (chicken curry), both of which are addictive-good.  I agree at some level with reviews below that the food can be bland, but not if you order appropriately, and the chili-chutney they serve with all of the entrees is spicy & good enough to make most everything delicious.   A fair warning, however: the bocha (salt, butter and milk tea) is straight horrible.  According to my friend who lived in northern Indian for a year, it's great if you want to get the salt & fat content that your body needs to operate at that temperature, but to my Western tastebuds it's pretty atrocious.  (But for $1.25, good for a dare).
