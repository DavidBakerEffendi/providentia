Wholly unimpressed with the hostess and reservation staff. Â For such a trendy and expensive spot, they have amateurs running the hostess stand. I made a reservation weeks in advance for thanksgiving. We not only had trouble confirming the reservation but also encountered odd behavior and service upon arrival. Once we were seated we had great service and a fairly delicious meal. The food was definitely edging on trendy modern cuisine. I had prosciutto wrapped pirogues, salmon, and a fruit tart available on the $49 prefixed menu. Was the meal worth the $49? No. But the food was very good and the trendy southern chic decor didn't hurt.
