The first stop on my 2011 Resolution to drink every cup of coffee on TONY's 51 Best Cups of Coffee in New York. Cup Suggestion: The Cappucino. The shop itself is quite comfortable. Upon first entrance, you are struck but how insanely quiet the place is, even with 6 or 7 other people sitting in the small room. However, you are sucked in by the aura of silence and you find yourself easily lowering your voice to match those of your fellow coffee drinkers. The baristo speaks to you in a low hush, spouting out italian words. Â Your cup is ready, and he gestures the cost of your coffee with his fingers to avoid unnecessary speech. The room is all wood, with one exposed brick wall, and most of the wall space on one side is filled in with bookshelves upon bookshelves of old books. The ceilings are high, but this does not increase the difficulty of keeping your voice level to a minimum. It sort of has that all too hip Speakeasy feel to it, though rolled into a coffee shop it's a bit enchanting. The cappucino itself was good. The foam was amazing. Creamy and sweet, I almost traded my drink in for a full cup of foam. The coffee was alright, a bit too stark of flavor to compete with the richness of the foam. The two did not really fit well together, but were nice taken upon their own accord. This is not a place to go for a lively chat with friends. This is a place to go for a relaxing, quiet, by yourself escape from the rain or snow. Visit Milk and Roses for a solitary escape cup.
