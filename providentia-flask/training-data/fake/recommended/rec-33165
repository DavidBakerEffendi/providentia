Went for lunch, mouth watering for grilled sardines.  Unfortunately they didn't have it that day, so it was grilled calamari and lemon potatoes.  My friend had the fried fillet of sole with the potatoes. As people have commented:  large proportions and, frankly, I'm no longer a fan of more food than I can comfortably eat - even if very reasonably priced, as these dishes were. All okay if not exceptional, but then "exceptional" happens very rarely, so if Kyclades were in my neighborhood, I would probably visit occasionally. However, no dessert at lunch - (which I can live without) - and no coffee/espresso served. That's something I have never encountered before.  After a filling meal, an espresso helps cut through the lingering flavors and tops off the meal.  That's a sufficient reason for me not to revisit at lunchtime.  Have no idea if they don't serve coffee in the evenings but, frankly, not sufficiently blown away to go out of my way to try.  Service was fine.
