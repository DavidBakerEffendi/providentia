Needed lunch for the fam during a late lunch time. Tween couldn't believe we brought her to a bar, but we lived the warmth of the wood burning stove, and the food was amazing! We'd all go back! Fish tacos were divine (fit sweet potato fries as a side - yum!), pork nachos which were delish, and a flavorful chicken caesar salad. Worth every penny!
