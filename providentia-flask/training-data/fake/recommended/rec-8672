Took my mom here for a birthday brunch and it was perfect. The selection of food was wonderful, and it comes with a mimosa! The seating was a little tight, but it was OK. I have yet to try this place for other occassions besides brunch. Can't wait to experience more of this place. Just wish it wasn't so far :-\
