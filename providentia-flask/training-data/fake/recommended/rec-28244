I like Sanfords, its like the hip diner with cool lights and ambiance inside of Astoria. Always had decent service here and its open 24/7 another big plus. Food is above average for sure, cobb salad is a real standout as well as sanfords wrap. They try a little harder than your typical diner to have more trendy and healthy options but dont go overboard, I really like that the sandwiches all come with tortilla chips and amazingly tasty dip. Ive had pretty bad service in here (it was busy) and ok service in here, I want to say they should work on it but the place is really popular and not big enough so I can understand why the servers struggle sometimes. Its a little bit overpriced but not crazy, my only issue is that due to its popularity it can often mean a 60 minute+ wait for delivery and waiting outside for a table. Its really not good enough or interesting enough in my opinion to wait to go into Sanfords but def this is a quality joint.
