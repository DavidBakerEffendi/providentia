Whether I come for brunch on Sundays, an early weeknight dinner with my toddler or a date night with the husband, I consistently Love, Love, LOVE this place.  I think I've sampled almost everything on their menu (including the kids' menu) and have not been disappointed yet.  The duck meatloaf, cheeseburger, fried chicken & waffles, almonds covered in maple syrup & bacon, and pecan pie sundae are all incredible (not that I recommend ordering them all in one sitting!). Doug and his staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome (even if you have a kid in tow--can't say the same for a certain restaurant up the street, hint, hint PRIME MEATS).  I live in the neighborhood but it's worth the trek if you're coming from elsewhere.
