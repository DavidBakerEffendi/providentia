This place proves one of my city living theories: that hipsters and customer service are like oil and water. They do not mix. I had breakfast here today. You order at the counter, which is fair enough. But then it gets weird. They bring the food to you, without utensils. Then you need to get up and fetch the utensils yourself. This doesn't make any sense at all. If you're going to bring me my oatmeal, could you not bring me a spoon with it because you're passing by the hutch anyways, instead of making me get up to bring it myself? Or tell me when I order to pick them up myself? Or tell me when you see me at the hutch putting sugar in my coffee? I spoke to the waiter about this, and his reply was "Well, that's the way it's always been..." Which essentially means "I don't give a damn that it's stupid, I can't be bothered to fix it." Seriously, is it too much work to bring me a spoon if you're going to bring me my food? Ridiculous. The food was decent though - the latte was huge, and delicious. The oatmeal was well made and presented, with plenty of fruit on top. And their sandwiches are really good too. But I definitely won't be returning because of the crappy service.
