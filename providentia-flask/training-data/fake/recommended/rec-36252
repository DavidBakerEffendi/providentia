Traveled from the left coast and it was SO worth it... a very cool, old soupy restaurant that serves one of the best classic steak frites around. The ginormous beautiful long bar was amazing... I could have stayed for days. The bar staff was very accommodating and fun to hang with for our lunch. We walked there after shopping and witnessed an awesome post lunch happy hour with some suits (ordered a tower of oysters and martinis around)... this place made our trip. Loved it and can't wait to go back.
