My better half and I went Super Bowl Sunday afternoon on an Urban Daddy deal the manager cutely described as a 3-2-1 deal. Meaning: pick 3 tapas, 2 signature cocktails, and 1 pizza. I chose the kickin' olive martini, and it was delish! Loved the touch of tabasco. We had roasted beets, roasted brussels sprouts and calamari for tapas, we enjoyed all of them. The strips of calamari were extremely tender, and arrived piping hot. The mushroom pizza was fab, with a thin crust, finely chopped portobellos and just the right amount of cheese. We shared two desserts, the pear strudel with cinnamon gelato and the zeppole with cream filling. Loved 'em both. We enjoyed our entire experience, from the warm, relaxing ambiance to the friendly staff and yummy food. Well done Sotto 13! We'll be back!
