This place is fancy without over doing it, generally plays enjoyable music if you're in the mood for top 40 guilty pleasures and they have a decent happy hour with standard draft beers (good beer list, but they only select 3 for happy hour) and amazing cocktails where 2 are always $6 at happy hour. That happy hour prosecco is also quite delicious. Great food too judging from the sliders, wings and fries I saw other people with. My friend ordered a grilled brussel sprout dish that came with melted bacon and cheese, looked good and the bacon I sampled was pleasantly crispy and she liked her brussel sprouts (blech!). The bartenders on staff were fun and snarky...I feel as if the one that served my friends and I was named Danielle and she was absolute peach with a great hand for mixing our Pomegranate White Cranberry Cosmopolitans (I normally don't go so girly, but it was the chosen $6 cocktail of the night along with the "Kiss and Tell" which was a mix of champagne and raspberry puree - delicious I'm sure, but hardly the strength required for an end-of-the-week Friday happy hour). I could see this place being perfect to begin a date and then go elsewhere...although it seemed as if even for a Friday around 5:30pm, reservations would be required as there were about 2 or 3 vacant tables that all had "reserved" placecards on them. Ugh. Still a great place to enjoy a happy hour in the Colombus Circle/Hells Kitchen area if you're looking for something nicer than your average Irish Pub or wannabe Mexican cantina (although I like pubs, but it's nice to switch it up sometimes).
