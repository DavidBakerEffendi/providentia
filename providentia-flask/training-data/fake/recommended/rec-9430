[Pros] 1. Inexpensive (each empanada is the size of your fist and no more than $2) 2. Many varieties of the breading and filling offered 3. Hot and made to order! 4. The cafe also offers ice cream (I didn't get to try though) 5. Friendly workers [Cons] 1. The cafe is tiny D: (only two tables) 2. Long wait if you didn't call in advance to pick up 50 empanadas and only ordered two with a cup of coffee (Parking: in the residential area! Avoid going btwn 11am and 1pm on fridays when there's no parking allowed on most streets)
