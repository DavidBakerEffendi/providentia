My boss took us on a "restaurant tour of NYC" - we started with Tavola and we all agreed (5 restaurants later) that it was the best one of the evening. Wood fired pizzas (that come out super quick), good beer, good service, and a really nice setting. Try to sit in one of the "booths" in the window (if you don't mind sun in the afternoon). I will definitely be back next time we're in New York!
