We came to this place because my bf really wanted to try it and of course it didn't take long to convince me.   They have a sauce for everyones taste bud.  We tried the roasted garlic one, which was a bit too garlicky for me. I think next time I will just go for the free sauce option.  We didn't realize they had free sauce options until we studied the menu more closely AFTER ordering our fries. haha I am a big fries lover but these fries did not make my heart skip more than once. Maybe I am just more of a skinny fries lover. 3 stars from me.
