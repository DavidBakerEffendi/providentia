I've been BANNED!  Oh no! Here's how it happened: I've only been to Lift a couple of times. On one occasion my friend had the French toast, which was pretty good, but I had the huevos rancheros, which was cold when it reached the table.  I asked for Tabasco but was told there is none. More tellingly, from the look I got, you might have thought I had advocated the clubbing of baby seals!  Apparently, at Cafe Lift, mere customers are not permitted to tinker with the Chef's creations! I don't think I ever saw a member of the staff smile.  Or even hint at a smile.  To my eye the countenances of the staff are more reminiscent of a concentration camp than anything else.  Because it's hip!  And Industrial!  And we wear black!  And smiling is so 2006! Still, it's around the corner, so I went a few weeks ago in seach of a late breakfast.  After I sat down with a friend a person who I think is the owner came over and told me (in front of my companion) that Lift wouldn't be serving me any more and that I wasn't welcome next door at Prohibition Taproom either - because I complain about the food and the quality of the service. You know those signs that say "If you like the food, tell a friend.  If you don't, tell us!"  They don't have that sign at Cafe Lift.   In fact, the owner knew who I was from visits to the Taproom next door, but he had never before engaged me in converation.  Rather than ask why I have always been disappointed by the place, he informed me that "everyone else loves it here."  In our first and only encounter he chose to embarrass me in front of my companion by making me persona-non-fed. But in their defense, if you want food served THEIR way by sullen people who are hipper than you, Cafe Lift is a great choice!
