The food was lovely but there were very few options without dairy and unfortunately very little effort was made to make a person with allergies feel welcome. The waitress did ask the kitchen but came back with only two options and never checked if the bread served had dairy. Overall the pasta was delicious (a bit too much sauce for my taste) but if you have any gluten or dairy allergies there are very FEW options and the kitchen seemed fairly unwilling to be accommodating.
