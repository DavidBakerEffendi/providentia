Classic and consistent. No frills and quick service. My friend had just picked me up from the Amtrak and I was hangry. She suggested we stop by a diner near her place and it did not disappoint. I had the pleasure of meeting Patricia herself as she served me up an omelette with some home fries. Like everyone notes, the prices are very reasonable. My egg white (+$2) omelet with slice of toast and home fries was ~$9- probably the most expensive thing on the whole menu. The diner has a very mom and pop slow paced feel to it. Also surprisingly empty-- then again it was Tuesday morning during prime class time. My only gripe about the place is that I wish the portion sizes were a little bigger. Also, coffee is now $1.50.
