We tried Genos and Pats at the same time. And Geno is not even close. It is needlessly overly greasy and their cut and quality Â of meat is more skimpy and less tasty. It is overall nowhere near as tasty as Pats. Now I understand why they need a huge Neon sign to attract business. Not only that, but the owners are a bunch of racists and fear mongers. There are signs on the window that say "This is America, speak English", and there is also a poster that shows a police officer killed by -El Shabab hazul whatever, some Arabic sounding name is boldly displayed. I understand supporting cops killed in action but why the need to prominently display the killer's obviously Muslim-sounding name. To me, the reason was obvious, especially in conjunction with the other sign. So not only does their cheese-steak suck. But their morals do as well. I'll pass.
