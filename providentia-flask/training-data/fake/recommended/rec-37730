I come here pretty regularly both buck-a-shuck on Mondays and late nights. If you're an oyster in UCity, Monday buck a shucks are definitely a great deal! I usually order 20....can't reallyyy tell the difference, but they all taste interesting and their selection is usually varied. Appetizers are usually very meh, or kinda gross to eat. I've gotten most of their $5 apps during happy hours, and they are all usually really greasy and unpleasant to eat. I have gotten their clam chowder once before though off their regular menu, and that was fine! $5 fishbowls are very weak, and taste like juice...which is fine but it is more of a powdered juice. Their happy hour drinks are also very meh-- I feel like their house wine is boxed...
