Nice intimate place. The bread comes out nice and hot, Service was good, no complaints. Food came out hot and fresh, taste great too! This is a good spot for Wifey, not so much a first date more like a 4th date. Overall I give it for stars due to the fact its quaint, and the food and service is up to par.
