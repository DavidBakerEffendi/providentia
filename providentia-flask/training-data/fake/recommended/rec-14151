In the summer of 2004, I lived in New Haven for three months during which I had the pleasure of trying Modern Apizza on several occasions.  This is simply the best pizza money can buy.  I think I can easily finish a large pie by myself....its that good.  I've tried the other "big two" and Modern in my humble opinion is better.... and better than anything you can find in NYC.  If you are ever near this joint, you have no excuse not to try it.
