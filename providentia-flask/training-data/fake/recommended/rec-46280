The atmosphere was nice, but every time I came here, it started to feel a bit dirty.  Coupled with the deep couches not conducive to laptop workin' and some odd conversations I've overheard (I'm pretty sure one oddly paired couple was debating going into the bathroom together on some kind of weird first date?), I haven't been back.  The lattes were tasty, and the food was sufficient, but there's something kind of off about it, and I can't put my finger on it.  I feel bad writing this, especially since the staff was more than lovely.
