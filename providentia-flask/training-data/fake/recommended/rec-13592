I can see why my fellow Elites have given 4 or 5 stars. What better way than to spend an anniversary celebration at Dover?  First, I think the SERVICE is FANTASTIC!  Knowledgeable in recommending dishes including wine selection on their menu.  You can tell Dover has trained their staff well to make sure they've tried the food and drinks themselves in order to provide recommendations to their diners. Second, although I have never been, this place is the same owner as Battersby. Third, the menu changes regularly depending where they can get fresh ingredients. Here's an opinion on my recent experience on 8/5. - Complimentary BREAD - oh man, we had two servings and loved the homemade white bean dip with olive tapenade - Oysters - so fresh and so clean.  I've never had BROILED OYSTERS with ramp butter and I'm glad I did. Packed with so much flavor all in one bite - smokey, bacon bits and ever so lightly heated in the oven for a couple of seconds to give it a warmth plump texture - Heirloom Tomato - creamiest BURRATA, garden-picked basil and herb dressing - RABBIT Tartine - it was their appetizer special of the day and in pate form. three letters, O.M.G. - LOBSTER (half order) - cooked to perfection, a MUST. Now, I don't know if it's because we drank 2 bottles of wine or I was full from the bread and appetizers but the reason why I gave it 4 vs. 5 stars is because the third course missed the mark for me.  We got the... - Wild Stripped Bass - I think the creamy sauce clouded the simplicity of the fish - Lamb Ribs - pretty good but a tad bit salty however, the eggplant was meaty, seasoned and cook al dente. This is another spot that will be hard to get a reservation soon to come.  I would definitely come back here again.
