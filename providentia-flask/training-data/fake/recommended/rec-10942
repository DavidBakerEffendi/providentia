The GF and I strolled in here on a saturday for a late lunch per the recommendation of her friend.  I was very pleasantly surprised.   The place has a comfortable yet extremely tacky vibe which i thought was fun and reminded me of some of the places I used to frequent back home.   Started with the rattlesnake bites.  WHOA.  Delicious.  Pepper stuffed with shrimp wrapped in bacon, and damn was the pepper hot.  I have been training to handle heat my whole life and I am not happy without a good sweat during a meal.  I got it on this one.  Definitely not the lightest of dishes but delicious none the less. Burger was good but not great.  Needed seasoning in my opinion.  The pulled pork sandwich was really good though.  I would get it again.   Service was great.  Very friendly.   Since I don't live in NYC anymore and only have a couple meal each weekend I visit, i don't know if I will be back.  But if i lived locally i would be a regular.
