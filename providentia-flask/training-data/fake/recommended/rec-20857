Best place for me and my Vietnamese friend so far.   The food is authentic.   Banh xeo and canh chua are the best in my opinions.   We always orderd these dishses whenever we go there.    Pho is mediocre although bun mang vit is pretty good.   Love this place and the staff there is all family members so it is very friendly.
