I've never been to this place on a weekend, so I can't speak to the volume that seems to be occurring. Go on a weekday and experience the following: -A frittata the size of your face and light as a cloud, filled with luxurious melted cheese and fresh vegetables -Buttery potatoes dusted with rosemary and pepper -A buttermilk biscuit whose outer layer shatters delicately when bitten, yielding to a fluffy, tangy interior that begs for a pat of butter and a smear of peach jam -A pleasant, friendly and prompt server -Utter bliss
