Not overly impressed with the food here, but they do have a great beer selection. I have been here twice, each time for a special beer event. The crowd is pretty annoying-mostly pushy college kids, and I have found the bartenders to be a bit aloof. Cool outdoor seating area with fire pits is fun on a cold night.
