I saw a flyer for organic burgers at Kean University of all places, so one evening when the hankering for a burger got pretty strong, I drove on over. The outside of the restaurant was a bit unassuming and not very brightly lit. My GPS said that I had arrived at the address: a Baptist church. However, it was right across the street on the corner. Inside, the restaurant had several tables as well as counter seats. I decided on the IMO style burger for under 7 bucks: an organic burger Patty on a whole wheat bun, cheddar cheese, mayo, lettuce, tomato, and caramelized onions. (Fries included on the side) I made small talk with the guy making my order- he was very friendly and made my waiting experience more enjoyable (because let's be honest, here, waiting hungrily for food is not that great). On the 15 minute drive home I tried not to focus on the food sitting next to me...it smelled so good and I couldn't wait to get home and eat ASAP! When I pulled the burger and fries out, they were nicely wrapped up in paper. The size of the burger seemed a little small, so I got a tad bit nervous. But after ONE bite, the drive and wait was all worth it. Although the size did appear small, it is a very chunky burger. I was completely full by the end (score!). It was unbelievably good- the meat, the cheese and mayo- everything combined made this worth every cent and every moment driving there and back. Can't wait to go back!
