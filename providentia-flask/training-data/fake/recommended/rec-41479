I can't be too mean so I'll give them 1 star for  effort.  My boyfriend & I decided to order delivery for my last night in NY.  And we're so disappointed. This place is seriously an embarrassment to my culture.  Dishes ordered: -Papaya Salad: Bland, no flavor what so ever. -Tom Yum Soup: They definitely avoided key ingredients. There was some weird ground shrimp that looked chewed up and thrown on top of the noodles. -Pad Thai: Not as flavorful as it should be but was the most flavorful out of all the dishes we ordered. -Beef Noodle Soup: Didn't even touch it. -Pineapple Fried Rice: Why is there deli sliced ham in it?! End note: Why are there raving reviews? The Yelp community has lead us astray on this one...are these real reviews?
