Disclaimer: this is an unbiased review, even though my mother is friends with the owners.  I just thought I'd throw that out there.  I don't play favorites; I've even given negative reviews to places right next to my home, which always carries the potential of making my daily walk quite awkward! Having a Filipino mother, I know a thing or two about Filipino cuisine.  To tell you something of Grill 21's reputation, I have several Filipino friends who only visit New York sporadically, and when I begin to talk about Filipino restaurants in Manhattan, they all say, "oh, you're talking about Grill 21.  I've been there!"  The fact that native Filipinos are going here should tell you something.   The last time I was at Grill 21, I went with a large group, so we had a chance to order a variety of different things.  My favorites were the chicken adobo and kare kare.  I have to say that I prefer my mother's adobo (who WOULDN'T say that?), but Grill 21 was a close second (a close second to homemade is a very big compliment in my opinion).  The kare kare was also very good. A friend of mine, who is a huge foodie, came with us because he wanted to experience Filipino cuisine for the first time.  He was quite impressed.  I wanted him to try balut, but they didn't have any; this was the only thing about which I could be slightly disappointed (finding balut is rare in any case, I think). Overall, if you like Filipino food, or are willing to expand your palette, you really can't go wrong here.
