I have decreed that when I visit my friends in NYC every summer, we will always return to Extra Virgin.  The food was great, and filling, so I was not forced to eat some shitty fast-food on my bus trip back to Boston.  The wait was long, but nothing ludicrous.  I really couldn't complain, because the wait allowed me to take some time to stroll through the gorgeous West Village.   My one gripe is that the space is very small, but I also had a huge duffel bag with me, so I guess that's not really their problem.  Oh, and I also felt like I stuck out like a sore thumb because I wasn't a skinny, perfectly coiffed gazillionaire, but I'm used to feeling like that in most of Manhattan. Also, about a week or so after I ate here I saw a paparazzi photo of Whitney Port eating here.  Normally that would make me think this place wasn't for me, but damn it, even "celebrities" appreciate a good brunch.
