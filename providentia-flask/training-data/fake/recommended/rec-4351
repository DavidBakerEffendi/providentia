I had dinner here last night with two friends, and was really happy i went. The decor inside is warm and cozy, but also very sophisticated. The only reason I gave this place 4 stars and not 5 is because the service was very slow. I started with wine and ended up getting the halibut as an entree. It was spectacular and had just enough spice to it. My friends got the kale (also very good, hint of mustard), salmon carpaccio, hamachi, and octopus Â - they really liked it. All in all a great dinner, minus the bad service.
