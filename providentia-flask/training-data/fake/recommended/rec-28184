Ruby's is a small cafe with barely enough seating for 20. Expect to be seated next to other people at picnic tables. Not an ideal setting for a first date or a romantic evening, but perfect for a casual brunch with my boyfriend. The Bronte Burger lived up to all the hype. I have been craving the Bronte Burger ever since my last visit. I prefer the burger without the famous chill sauce, and with avocado. Â  Hint: Try calling ahead to get on the list...there is literally no where to wait inside. *Cash only
