Let me be very clear, if you go to Zavino and don't get the Stache pizza, your life will never be complete. Awards you may earn, a family you may cultivate, but I swear, if you do not take the opportunity to eat this pizza, you will ever be missing a key component to the joy of life. Such was my love for Zavino! Conceptual yet delicious (I don't think I had ever enjoyed wheat crust pizza before) Zavino gets 5 stars for acing my own 5 qualifiers for restaurants. Service, concept, food quality, ambiance and price. The service was perfect, Midwest friendliness in an East Coast atmosphere. (and super adorable hostess , I had my eye on you, blondie) Staff knew their shit and wrangled a packed space with ease. Concept is totally my style. Fresh, trendy ingredients served in a classic way that retains great flavor with a bomb wine selection to compliment. For ambiance we've got a cozy space with a relaxed but stylish design which is right up my ally. Price assessment is perfect for the location, food and service! Honestly, even if the rest of the experience had been less than stellar, I would still come back for the Stache pizza, it's just that amazing!
