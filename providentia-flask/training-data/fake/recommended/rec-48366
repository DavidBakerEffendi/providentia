I went here for dinner. The drink I got was good, though maybe a couple dollars overpriced. I enjoyed my entree, a goat cheese arugula pizza. Unfortunately my dinner partner really wasn't impressed by her burger and I have to admit her fries (I stole one) were pretty bland.  It's hard to mess up fries.  The service was friendly but quite slow, and it took a long time to get our food. Overall, it was ok and I might come back, but wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again. I did like the decor and general atmosphere though - it's a cute place.
