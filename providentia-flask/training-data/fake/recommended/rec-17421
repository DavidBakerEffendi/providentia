I was a regular when this place was El Bandidos. The atmosphere was fun, and the people were great. The food was awesome! Authentic Mexican food. The place is now under new management, and the happy hour scene is not as lively or late nights during the week. Yet the food is still good and they still make killer sangrias and margaritas. The sangrias are the strongest I have had other than my own. The salsa is delicious, and the guac is pretty good. I always get enchiladas dishes, and I never had better anywhere else.  The shrimp dinners are scrumptious. My only wish is that more people come check this place out so they don't go out of business.  I also miss the cameras they had at the bar so you could see your car in the parking lot. Other than that try it out!!!!!!!!
