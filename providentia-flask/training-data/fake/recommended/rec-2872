We arrived on time for our reservation and were immediately lead to a cozy booth in the back.  I like the trees that are painted on the walls and the grey/red color scheme, but the restaurant is too brightly lit.  They should lower the lights a bit so it feels more intimate. I started out with the octopus small plate.  The texture was perfect: tender and moist, not rubbery at all.  My friends got the same appetizer and theirs came with the olives that are listed as part of the dish.  Sadly, the olives were absent on my plate. I went with the Farmhouse flatbread for my main course.  It was certainly tasty and I like the salty bacon/sweet apple combo, but it was nothing mindblowing. The wine list is extensive, as is the beer list (all bottles, no draft).  I started out with the Really Clean Martini and it was delish.  It went down super smooth, but I could tell by the way I was feeling that it had plenty of alcohol in it.   Our server was attentive and he was really knowledgeable when helping my friend pick out a wine that went with her entree, but also had the characteristics she likes in a wine. Not a bad spot, but I wouldn't make it a point to leave my neighborhood just to come here in the future.
