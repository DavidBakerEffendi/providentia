3 stars really. A bit cramped. Nice atmosphere though. Very homely. Food was good but nothing mind blowing. Actually a bit expensive for what it is. I got an omelet with bacon, tomato, and brie. Very fluffy and light. House potatoes were pretty good too. Just nothing special. Had a taste of the salmon wrapped poached eggs... also good, but something that I'd be able to make at home as well. Both were accompanied by a Bellini and a mimosa... nothing too crazy there. Maybe I didn't choose the foods they're known for, but I wouldn't come back...
