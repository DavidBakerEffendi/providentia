Kafana is really delicious, from the bread and red pepper spread to the wine (I had a yummy red from Macedonia) to the hearty entrees. I had the Corbast pasulj sa dimljenim rebarcima -- or bean stew with smoked baby back ribs -- and it was flavorful and delish, and a reasonable portion. The restaurant is also in a charming, lovely little spot along Avenue C and service is great.
