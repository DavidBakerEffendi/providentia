I really wanted to like Mood Cafe, but unfortunately I didn't have an amazing experience. In fact, I only ate a few spoonfuls of the chaat before I left. I would love it if Mood could expand their menu. I don't drink lassis, so I decided to just try the chicken tikki chaat. I didn't really get the explanation that chaat is a mixture of a bunch of different flavors, but when I checked out their online menu, I was skeptical if I could find anything for me. IF YOU'RE PICKY, BEWARE. Chaats are actually just a bunch of different things put together. I couldn't deal with all the conflicting tastes and textures. I only wish there were another option for those of us who don't like chaat. I'm giving him 3 stars anyway since apparently I seem to be one of the few who don't like lassi or chaat, oops. Also, I was a little put off by how they make everything in the kitchen. I see them microwaving the meats right behind the cashier, which I find a little weird. The chicken was in tiny bits to the point where I couldn't even find it in the chaat. The meal wasn't even cheap enough to merit this, in my opinion. The place is tiny. I came on a warm day, but it was drizzling, and a few groups of people were hogging the seating inside, talking and laughing and having a grand ole time while a few of us had to sit at wet tables outside. Try to get it to-go if you can! And I didn't really get a nice chat with Hasan, like the rest of you are saying! Maybe he was having an off day, but not too sure I'll come back to find out. A nice hole in the wall, but make sure you like lassis or chaat before checking it out! Maybe it was my fault for mindlessly checking out the best-rated Philly restaurants on Yelp... but isn't that the point?
