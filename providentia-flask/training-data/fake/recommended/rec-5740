It's 11am Sunday morning and I am just waking up from the karaoke party we had last night -- sure sign of a good time! Sam and Sean were so helpful in reserving our room at the last minute, and lowering the hourly rate to fit our party size. I really appreciated their customer service. Up the stairs in the private karaoke room, we had access to the full bar and restaurant. I recommend the Pear Saketini and Chicken Teriyaki. The Shrimp Tempura was also a party favorite. The prices were definitely reasonable for the quality and amount of food you get. I had a fantastic time at Fuji Mountain!! It's a perfect place to celebrate a birthday or just to hang out.
