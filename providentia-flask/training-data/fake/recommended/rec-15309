I want to give 3 stars because they forgot to bring me my wine until I asked 3 times, but the food is good enough that I need to bump it to 4. The corn rolls (spring rolls) are probably the best I've ever had. Granted, I may be saying this because I was starving when I ate them, but honestly I was floored. They were perfectly flaky and salty and crunchy and they came standing in a cup of sweet tangy sauce. It was deep-fried perfection. For my entree, I got the green curry. It was delicious. They told it was "very spicy," which is was most definitely not. But it had a wonderful mixture of flavors and textures and came with just enough rice to fill me up to happiness. The atmosphere is trendy and gaudy, like so many of the Thai places in Manhattan, but it doesn't come off as pretentious or obnoxious. I'd happily return.
