moljacete de pollo! huge - you could share this - it's a lava bowl filled with chicken chunks in a really tasty sauce with tortillas on the side.  Chips and salsa and queso fundido are a great way to start the meal - washed down with one of their finely crafted cocktails of course.  Service always makes you feel like they are really happy you came in.  Tequilas is not cheap, but it's high quality food with a friendly vibe.
