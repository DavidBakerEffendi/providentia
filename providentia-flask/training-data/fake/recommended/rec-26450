I used to come here to pick up a quick to-go breakfast before working on a group project with a friend who lived in the apartment complex across the street.  Adorable place with just about everything -- sandwiches, salads, coffee to keep us working!, other drinks, THE MOST AMAZING DELAWARE BAKED OATMEAL (inspired me to learn how to make it too but I just can't recreate it the way they do), and friendly service with a sense of humor.  I still smile when I think of the cute sign on the bathroom *("please knock -- the lock ain't so good").
