drink - spicy/chili margarita: awesome.  the spicy sweet combination is always a hit in my book appetizers - nachos: i love it when they layer the nachos, so every chip has something on it.  Not to mention the homemade chips and ingredients put these nachos over the top dinner - fish tacos: just. amazing.  flaky, lightly fried fish with this delicious red cabbage slaw paired with some cucumber mint and chipotle sauce on the side.  oh man.  just do it.
