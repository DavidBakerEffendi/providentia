I have never been more disappointed with a restaurant. I have eaten at this restaurant countless times in SIX years,  and I've always believed that the husband of this husband-wife owner pair was an arrogant jerk, but today he proved it. The service was slow AS USUAL, the main course was only ok as the beef was slightly overcooked, BUT THE TRES LECHES.......UNPALATABLE!!! When this was brought to his attention,  he refused to take it off the bill and told my table that we "just had no taste." How unbelievable!!!! I will never go back to this establishment again so long as this so called chocolate alchemist is still there. To insult me over $3 shows how classless this man is. Do not go to Sazon if you value customer service because it does NOT exist there.
