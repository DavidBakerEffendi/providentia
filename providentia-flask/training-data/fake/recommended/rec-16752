A very disappointing experience at a place I once frequent: On 10 17 2014 me & my brother Bobby met up at Algarve's Restaurant in Elizabeth after work.We ordered sangria & our meal.After receiving our food & eating, Bobby noticed something in his spinach which happened to be a bug.He then asked me to validate what he pretty much already knew & I confirmed that indeed it was a bug.We then brought it to the owner's & manager's attention. They down played it saying"it's only a bug".Upon adding insult to injury they absolutely refused to comp our bill as a result of.When we responded that we were very unhappy with their actions the manager inform us that he couldn't absolve us from the bill totally only 25% which sounded ludicrous.So after expressing to him how insulted & disappointed we were at a establishment where we spend a lot of $$$ weekly. We decided to exit the premises vowing never to eat there again, so then the Owner/Manager says to us you'll be back in a very condescending way...The bottom line is,we know that 2 customers won't really make a difference when it comes to their profits.....BUT MAYBE JUST MAYBE WE CAN COLLECTIVELY..... A lot of us eat at this restaurant but if they are not going to do right by us when called upon.....WHY SHOULD WE!
