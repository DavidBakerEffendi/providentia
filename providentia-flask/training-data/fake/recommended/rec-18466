Totally enjoyed our dinner here ( which I didn't expect being the in theater district!) . Excellent service, all of our meals were delicious. The fish ribs are very good...a unique cut of fish from a very large Mediterranean fish. The salads were delicious and a generous size. Very nice atmosphere also - casual /friendly. Coffee and dessert was excellent and we also loved the tea ( which is rare!). A real theater district find.
