Stumbled upon this place on Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn last week when I was jonesing for Italian food. If thery hadn't put a sandwich board out front with their specials on it, I'd have never known it was open, nor a restaurant. Unfortunately - or maybe fortunately - NO ONE was there nor walked in during the hour I was present, which was 5:30-6:30pm on a Thursday night. The service was excellent, and the food was really solid. I had the tagliatele pasta with ham, peas & a light cream sauce, and it was great. The asparagus with cheese side dish was OK, maybe a little boring or out of season, I don't know. Chocolate mouse for dessert was totally solid. Though they had a great wine list, I was super psyched that the beer list was also quite good - Smuttynose IPA is what I had, but they had some german stuff, Smuttynose Robust Porter and others. Good on ya, PT. Hope you get some customers this Thursday night. Totally worth a visit.
