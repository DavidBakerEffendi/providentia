Took the family to the Peruvian Independence Day Celebration this Sunday. Got there just in time. The place was crowded 1/2 hour after we arrived. The most striking thing about Vista Alegre is the ambiance. It is extremely friendly and accomodating. And they have a nice patio. The food was excellent and the menu extensive. The owner brought my father-in-law and me each a Peruvian soccer shirt and baseball cap. My wife is from Lima, Peru and I am the tag-along Gringo. I can tell you, this place rocks!! This is our new go-to place for Peruvian food.
