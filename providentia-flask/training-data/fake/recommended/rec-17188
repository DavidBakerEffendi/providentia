Quite good halal meats, fresh and reallyyyyy tasty. But will definitely hit your stomach bad next day for bathroom trip...which means there is a lot of msg and unfresh meat going around with them. 5/5 for taste, 2/5 for freshness I would say. But it is definitely the cheapest full meal you get in the city and good late night food.
