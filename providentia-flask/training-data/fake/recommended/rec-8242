"Want to go to Room Service?" said my work friend. "What's that?" I said. "It's a Thai place." I was intrigued by the NAME. As I walked into the place, it certainly feels that you are not here to eat Thai food. Thai food under the chandeliers? A new concept, and I am open to anything. I give them props for its impressive decor that has nothing to do with Thai culture. The colors are of mix of grays, and, silver, and a view of a hanging, giant chandelier that's enclosed in glass. We were there for lunch and the lunch menu has lots of options. To my surprise, the waitress was dressed to the nines and full make-up. She took our order quickly and left. Now this is the part where it feels like you are in your hotel room, waiting for your food to show up, and sayin "where room's service?" Waiting for our lunch took too long! The place was not even full and I saw the tables that were seated after us were getting their food first. I said to my friend, did she forget our order?! I was starving! You know the feeling right before you turned into the Hulk. Also, you get an appetizer that part of your lunch order. How long does it take to cook two pieces of dumplings and tofu?! We ordered pad thai and fried rice as our entrees. Those dishes should come out of the kitchen quickly as those are your staple dishes. Finally, we received our food and the appetizers that come with your entree. I disagree that the appetizers come with your entree at the same time. It should come out first before the entree. Â The food was very good but not as impressive as the decor. Prices are reasonable and the fun atmosphere are the reasons that I would consider in coming back here again. Room Service needs to work on the "Service".
