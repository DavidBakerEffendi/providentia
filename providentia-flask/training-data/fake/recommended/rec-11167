As my tip states, this is overpriced, hipster, Mexican food. Don't think there could be such a thing? Well, my friend, there is. Now, I'm all for kitsch and tongue-in-cheek tackiness, but the food better stand up to the American-picker-esque junk and prison art on the walls and Quentin Tarantino style soundtrack. The menu here is limited but does have some tacos, enchiladas, and specials. I paid $10 for guacamole and chips and would bet that the guacamole came out of a large tub of the pre-made stuff. The chips were overfried and hard. The other menu items didn't impress either. The pork tacos were small, and more like pork sliders as I think the diameter of the corn tortilla was about 2 inches. The chunks of meat were tender, but were seasoned very strangely and reminded me of cinnamon. This is another "Ã  la carte restaurant" and so your bill ends up being very pricey. Mr. J got the chicken enchiladas; however, they did not come with rice or beans. Each one of those items will cost you approximately 4 dollars. I was not impressed and the menu was very underwhelming. Mexican is not that difficult to prepare, but somehow they can't seem to get it.
