I've been living in the Ironbound for such a long time and cannot believe it I've missed this place! Best pizza in town( small eggplant with ricotta cheese and extra anchovies$9.75) oh my! No saggy dough, baked to perfection and topped evenly. Bruschetta($4.94) fresher than Beyonc√©! Well seasoned with garlicky tangy flavor, fresh baguette toasted to point. Mozzarella Caprese($8.95) awesome portion; topped with romain crispy lettuce and a made to order dressing. Customer service was patience as it was my first time ordering,delivery was on time and pie was not cold. My currently favorite place in town(among Mi Pequeno Mexico). Try the difference!
