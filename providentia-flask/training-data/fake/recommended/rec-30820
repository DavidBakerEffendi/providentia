So this is one of my favorite places in all of NYC. Interesting, tasty food served out of a window in Bedstuy, Brooklyn. I typically get the small grits with soft egg, pesto, a seasonal veggie, and some poultry-based item. The bottom line: go when you have the chance. Since I always rate on a relative scale (i.e., is this place good based on others like it? (not based on a five-star restaurant)), this should have gotten five stars. The problem is the creators behind the menu have been systematically eliminating some of the best food I have ever eaten. The spicy chicken meatball is NOW GONE! Originally they told me this was because they replaced it with the chicken sausage, which was not as good but is now ALSO GONE! Both eliminated from the menu for inexplicable reasons, the only reasonable of which would be they just didn't sell. But if that is the case, the world is now a worse off place without these delectable items. Even if the chicken sausage disappeared, the spicy chicken meatball was literally one of my favorite things on earth. Whether in grits or on their exceptional sandwich, I would eat this every week. I would proudly parade my out-of-town friends to partake in it's delight. But now it's gone. If only this was a good forum for drumming up support to get these back on the menu.
