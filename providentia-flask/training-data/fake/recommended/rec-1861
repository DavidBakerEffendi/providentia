Being from Philly and trying tons of different cheesesteaks from various places, I don't know why this place always has a long line.  I usually only come here when I have out of town guests who have never eaten a real Philly cheesesteak and only know about Genos and Pats.   I usually go with the traditional, whiz-with (cheesewhiz and onions).  The meat has no flavor, but the bread is good.  For the price you pay, you get a pretty small sandwich.  I can pay half the price and get a cheesesteak from another place that is twice as big.  The fries are greasy and soggy.   Overall, this place is over-rated.
