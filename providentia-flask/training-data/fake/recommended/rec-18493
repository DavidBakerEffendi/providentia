The burrito's rice was so hard it almost broke my teeth.  I went on a Saturday, so maybe just avoid buying burritos that day. I also felt worried about eating the chipotle mayo and other sauces as it was not refrigerated.  I felt the burrito really was overpriced.  Everything was far from what I know and love as taquitos y burritos en México.  The guys working there were nice enough, and I they may well be Mexican, but I doubt they designed the recipes as they did not really taste Mexican at all.
