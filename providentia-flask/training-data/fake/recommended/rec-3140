The best stir fried noodles we have had! The noodle was so chewy and delicious. I suspect you can eat the noodles without anything on it! It was cooked well and tasty. The noodle soup was ok. It could have been better. The broth needed more taste amd the noodle may have been overcooked a bit. But overall it was still OK. I had their dumplings before and it was good! Went well with their delicious chilly oil which was very tasty and just hot enough but not too hot to burn your taste buds, in fact I felt it enhanced the taste of anything I put it on. Favorite!!!
