Great chinese place just off South Street. They have a separate vegetarian menu that is pretty extensive. While eating in doesn't look all that appealing, the waiter is actually charming and attentive. The food is always good. I think their scallion pancakes are my new favorite food. If you order take out be prepared for fortune cookie madness! Sooo many fortune cookies.
