AVOID this place like the plague. The portions are huge, but they really can't cook chicken properly. They make good rubber chicken. The sausage is overcooked as well. Eggplant Rollatini? Eggplant mess. The service is terrible and they take too long to make the food.  I hear the pizza is good, but it looks pretty nasty.  Id rather eat in my kitchen sink. South Orange is pretty awful for italian food, and this place is the worst of them all. Go to Star Tavern for thin style pizza in orange, or Arturos in Maplewood for the best tasting pizza.
