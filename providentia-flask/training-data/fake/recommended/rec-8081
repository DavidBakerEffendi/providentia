Italian BYOBs in Philly always seem to just miss the mark on being amazing.   All of the food here was good (we ordered a lot of it!), but nothing really made me say wow.  I had the pears for my app and they were yummy but I think there was just too much of it.  They could have done something a little more interesting I think.  The fried mozzarella was also really good, definitely a comfort food.  I had the chicken with prosciutto, mozzarella, basil etc and the chicken was juicy and crispy, I just wish there had been a little more prosciutto.  We got the chocolate cake for dessert and it was one of the highlights.  So moist and warm and gooey :)  YUM.   The service was good but the wait was a bit much.
