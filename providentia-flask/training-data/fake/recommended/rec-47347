With its low ceilings and bamboo-heavy Japanese decor, this restaurant manages to be intimate in a good way, leaving you free to enjoy your soba or your conversation with few distractions.  It is quiet but not romantic, making it good for a casual date, meeting a friend, or dinner out with family (we saw one with a 10-year-old child). The main attractions are hot noodle soup and cold noodle salad, with either udon or soba.   Also, there is a variety of uniquely Japanese appetizers and desserts availble that will make you think "wow, I've never seen this menu item before." They do not accept reservations, so on weekends, try to get there before 6pm or risk waiting in line until a table opens up. Get a clear soup, such as Noodle Soup with Duck and Scallions.  Don't make the mistake I did and get the noodle soup with curry chicken, unless you know exactly what it is (a large bowl of spicy, thick, and creamy curry that I found unappetizing). The service compared favorably with "noodle shops" in the area.  We were handed hot towels for our hands, and our soup bowls were arranged on stylish wooden trays in a specific orientation, with chopsticks on the left and napkin on the right. All in all, a classier alternative to Setagaya, Menkui-Tei, and the like.
