Went opening night and I must say it was already kicking in high gear! Perfect location Union off 4th Avenue.  Bye Bye Harlem HELLLLLOOOOOO BKLYN!   We had the sweetheart for 2 (which is really for 4), a full rack of ribs with 4 sides. The meat was smoked perfectly and probably the best mac n cheese this side of the Dixie line!!!!
