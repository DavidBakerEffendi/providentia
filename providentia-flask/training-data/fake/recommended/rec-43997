I loved going here. The food was absolutely delicious and the service was courteous. I came here with a bunch of friends for my birthday and they were very nice about accommodating a reservation size change and giving us plates, etc., for the birthday cake we brought. They even offered to wash the dish the cake was in for us! I'll be back again for sure.
