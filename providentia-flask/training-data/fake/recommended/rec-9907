Wonderful! Arrived at the bar next door, Von, for happy hour around 6 on Friday.  Drafts were $3 and served with a smile.  Headed into the restaurant around 7:15, and our party of 2 was seated immediately, even though the restaurant was packed.  We had the gnocchi frito with cheese and chicken liver appetizers, then the frutti di mare and gnocchi pomodoro for our entrees.  Everything was delicious (full disclosure: I didn't have the chicken liver, but my gentleman loved it), and portion sizes were perfect .  Our total bill came to something like $45 and included a drink or two - more than reasonable.  It was a little loud, and the space is small, but if you're with good company, you probably wont notice either.  Bianca's - we'll be back!
