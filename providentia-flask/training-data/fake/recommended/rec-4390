My boyfriend and I went to Peaches on a Wednesday night for my birthday. No wait and they even let us pick which table we wanted. We ordered a bottle of wine but was delivered only 1 glass. When we explained the mistake our waiter apologized and let us keep the glass on the house and brought our bottle. I thought all their sides looked amazing so was happy to see they offered a 'Three-Side Combo' option on the menu for $11 (certain sides cost more). I went with the garlic broccoli, macaroni and cheese, and cheese grits. My boyfriend ordered the flounder and a side of asparagus. Everything rocked and tasted exactly like I wanted it to. The asparagus was the best I've had. My favorite part of Peaches is the lighting. I actually knew nothing about the restaurant, just drove by it one night and thought it looked warm and inviting. It was exactly that. The music selection was also on point!! Go here!
