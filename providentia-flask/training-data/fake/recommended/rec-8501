Service was horrendous from the time we entered until the time we left. I have to admit the food was great. Dan Dan noodles were exceptional! I would like to think this would bring me back in the future but I think we may make the drive to University City or Manayunk. We entered the restaurant and there was no one at the hostess stand. We waited for ten minutes until someone came to take our names. We were finally attended to and about to get seated when they realized the table was dirty. We have our order taken and fifteen minutes pass and our waiter forgot our drinks. We had to remind him. He brought our meal out and forgot that we had placed an order for an appetizer. During all of this I see an employee approach another table and ask the guests if they were finished. She took their plate and cleaned it off onto the plate they were still eating. I usually can look past poor service but this was pretty bad. It's as if they were trying to screw up. Not to mention as we looked out the window the delivery men were smoking cigarettes and right after were handed the food to take out on delivery. The place was just a mess. Employees need to be more professional and more aware of their guests.
