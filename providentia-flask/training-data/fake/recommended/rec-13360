I met two friends here on a Thursday night for cheap drinks and even cheaper hamburgers. I didn't know anything about it, other than it is right next to  Li Lac Chocolates, one of my favorite places of all time. I'm on the fence about this place, but want to like it more than dislike it. It was dark, and we were there right at 6, so we were able to get a table, but after that the place filled up really fast. By the time we left I could barely pull my chair out without knocking over three guys in corduroys. Anyway, the food was really great, and they had a wide selection of beers, which I enjoyed as well. I deducted a star for how crowded it was, and a star for the slow service, I often had to go up to the bar and order the beers myself, which I absolutely hate doing when we already have a server, but he would disappear for 45 minutes. I think its a good place if  you want a cheap burger with a cheap beer after work. I don't think I would make this my regular hangout, but would go back, if I needed a good meeting spot in the neighborhood.
