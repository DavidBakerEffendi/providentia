I want to really like this place, and I like it but not for the food. Every time I let time lapse and go for some dinner and drinks I get disappointed. Great atmosphere in the summer with an outdoor bar and patio for which to enjoy a warm breeze and the characters of new haven, but the food for me falls short. I ordered a chicken burrito filled with choAxica (sp?) cheese, grilled veggies, avocado and mole and it was bland and had more the taste of charred veggies than anything else. Yucca fries were good and sprinkled with a chipotle seasoning. Prior to the main entree we had the table side guacamole.  which we ordered as medium intensity- it was HOT! So Much so that it killed my taste buds which is maybe in part why I didn't enjoy my meal. Whoever it was made it-not table side but came back with it and literally there were 1/4in pieces of jalapeño in it. Now I'm not into the display of people making guac, I think it's a bit ridiculous, but if you're going to ask $14 for it, make it tableside or better yet, just offer it out of the kitchen for less cost. Even my husband who loves hot stuff said it was mucho caliente for medium. I got a glass of their white sangria which was overpowered by grapefruit and lime- just not my thing. My husband got the shredded bison tacos and I found it to be very gamey and I usually like bison. Oh well, I'm sure the place will again lure us back for more in due time with its atmospheric charms but for now I won't be making plans for soon.
