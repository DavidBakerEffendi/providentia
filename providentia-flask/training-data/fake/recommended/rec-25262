Went there Friday, maybe 8 other patrons in the entire place. Waitress and to some extent the bartender were pretty aloof. Took forever to get their attention. Waitress asked if my friend needed change after he paid $50 for $17 burger. Then took 15-20 mins to get that change. Just overall poor form almost like they're doing me a favor for being a customer. Not very welcoming for a place that doesn't have really have anything going for it while also having relatively pricey drinks and food. Last year it was called Tiny Fork which didn't stay in business long and also had awful service + bartender. Waiting for the 3rd edition to return, because the space does have potential
