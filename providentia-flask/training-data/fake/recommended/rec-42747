We came here on a Friday night and the entire restaurant was reserved by other parties, but they still managed to seat us immediately even though we didn't have a reservation. The atmosphere was very cool and classy. We ordered the ribeye with potatoes au gratin, kale, and the asparagus salad. For dessert we had the butterscotch cheesecake and the poached apples. Everything was FANTASTIC and served beautifully. I would highly recommend this establishment.
