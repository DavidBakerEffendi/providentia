We ordered at the counter and took our food to the table. So I can't comment on the service. The environment is very casual and laid back. The man at the counter was nice and friendly. We had pizza slices - the white spinach, chicken Alfredo and meat lovers. Not the greatest pizza, but definitely well portioned and tasty. I'll go back there when a pizza craving hits
