The space is to die for. Quaint and small with lovely charm. They did a great job at making you feel like you were perhaps really in Paris and no longer in NYC. There is even a tiny patio with a handful of tables. SUPER cute! The menu is small and simple, which is in their favor. The food was fine, but for the cost, it doesn't measure up. The waffle in the picture below is no bigger than 4" x 3" and it was $15. That is hard to stomach, especially since it is not the best waffle I have ever had. If it had been epic, I might have dismissed the $15. The salmon and egg toast was quite good, but overly salty, which I mentioned briefly to the waitress. That is something small that I am sure be fixed with a slight adjustment (likely just a one-off dish that morning).Â  Overall, the experience was lovely, but we can get better bang for our buck, even in the West Village.
