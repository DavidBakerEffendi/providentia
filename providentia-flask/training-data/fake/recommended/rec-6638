Worth the wait, which if you're going to check out, on a weekend, will surely involve one...Still, nice if you're waiting to have complimentary drip coffee available while you wait...Nice touch. Service is punctual and polite. Menu is pretty basic with not a lot of varieties but there are listed specials on a chalkboard which all looked appetizing. Food was terrific and perfect proportions...Juices were fresh squeezed and terrific...Wasn't my personal selection but the pesto egg sandwich is a must have, IMHO. Home fries are memorable
