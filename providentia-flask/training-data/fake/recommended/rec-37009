How many times can you visit a restaurant in one week? Well, in my case it was twice in 5 days...and that says a lot!! Our first experience was soooooo good we couldn't skip out on tasting all their other dishes a second time...you must try all their pastas!! Our favorite one is the crab spaghetti...like at Marea their pastas are cooked to perfection!! It's never under or over cooked...the other pasta worth tasting is the trofie nero...the lobster poached in butter and the duck were the best on the menu...and for you SFians who cant get foie gras anymore....they are still serving it here!! I got my fixing!!! Â  can't wait for my next trip to NYC....Oh and there is a really nice guy called Alex!! He took really good care of us!! Thanks Alex!!!
