This is my favorite West Philly restaurant, hands down. I usually order the pad thai or the pad kee mao (both with tofu); the latter in particular is excellent. Sometimes, I order an appetizer, too; I've tried the fresh spring rolls, the steamed dumplings, the grilled vegetables with peanut sauce, and the tofu satay, and would recommend all but the dumplings, which were edible but uninspired. The food is always fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented, the service is friendly and competent, and you never have to wait too long to get your meal. It's BYO--so bring a bottle (or two) of wine to enhance the experience.
