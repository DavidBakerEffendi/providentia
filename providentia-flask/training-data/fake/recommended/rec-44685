The Service: Come here if you want French service. Not Parisian service, but TRUE French service! Our waiter (whoever was working on 7/18/14) was amazing! I think his name was Greg? Probably not. In any case, we walked into a fairly empty place Friday evening and were provided with undivided attention. Within 20 minutes every table (all ~10 of them) were filled up, and he somehow continued providing us with Â undivided attention; we were impressed to say the least. It was our first time having flambees and everything he recommended was delightful. In any case, we stumbled upon this place via Yelping French food and will most definitely be returning to use the Yelp coupon and for some more flambees. The food: I think in order to enjoy these, it may be a bit of an acquired taste. In any case, please don't refer to it as "french pizzas". We never had flambees before but they were DELICIOUS. We were 2 ppl and split 2 savory flambees. Then we split 1 dessert and were completely full by the end of the night. The location: There's construction going around 2nd ave until ~2059. So be on the lookout for the sign if you're in the area.
