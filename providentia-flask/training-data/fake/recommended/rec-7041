If you are looking for legit Southern home-cooking, you've hit the jackpot here. I'm sure this place will make Adam Platts NY "Where to Eat" list within the first year they will be open. You know it's real Southern food when you don't have to add suger to your tea or salt to your grits. We ordered about 7 dishes and I was tempted to lick my plate. This place is incredible.
