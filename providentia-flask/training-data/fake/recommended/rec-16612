Expensive for kati rolls, which is the only reason I'd say four stars instead of five.  We usually order the unda chicken roll; have ordered the plain chicken before, and the egg makes a big difference!  The spicing is better on the chicken than on the beef and the shami rolls.   The decor inside the restaurant is fun, with vintage Bollywood posters on the walls.  Overall, a good place for a quick meal.
