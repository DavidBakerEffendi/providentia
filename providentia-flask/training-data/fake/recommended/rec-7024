The second we entered and were greeted we knew we made the right choice. We felt so home the whole time. Besides the amazing staff, the food was mind blowing. We both had kick started brunch which has changed my opinion of breakfast forever. The eggs were exactly as I asked for (same for my friend), the bacon was crispy and tasty making us to want so much more. And the biscuits, omg the biscuits... They are made of love and bring continuous smile to your face. We will definitely return! Also loved the design and atmosphere of the place. Can't wait to visit again! Hugs John and everyone!
