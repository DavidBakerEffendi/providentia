I was debating between 3.5 and 4 stars and then remembered that yelp doesn't allow half stars (sigh). The cocktails and service at Illili is very good and on point. Â We shared the labne and hummus dips--very good and flavorful, their pita that came with it was also just as good. For lunch we both got the grilled chicken salad--it was good but just very small and not a ton of chicken. For $15 or $17 it Was kind of a rip off for what we got, although again it did taste pretty good and the dressing was nice and light. If I come back I would try an entree as that's probably a better option.
