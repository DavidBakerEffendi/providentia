Mirabelle's is fabulous except that it is so popular there may be a wait to get a seat at the  most popular times. My brother is a lawyer in New York and his dream is to retire to Vermont and get an office above Mirabelle's so  he can eat breakfast there every day. Every thing is top notch quality - the pastries and the meals - I have never, ever had a bad experience here. Treat yourself!
