Came here all the way from Baltimore to get a taste of this.  Needless to say, I walked out very pleased.  Ordered the basic miso ramen with the soft boiled egg and an order of pork buns.  The egg was much better than most other ramen joints although the pork was a little fattier than I was used to.  Not really a complaint, just an observation. The sauce on the pork buns was heavenly as well. I brought my aunt who's about 62 and she was surprisingly happy with the atmosphere even though it was pretty upbeat.  Never thought she'd like eating lunch while listening to Britney & Beyonce.
