Went to American Sardine Bar last night at 6:30. Sat outside. White picnic tables are so low that at 5'9" my legs did not fit under the table. They were out of the Dogfish Festina Peche I had gone there looking for. I ordered the short rip sandwhich with provolone and arugula. Instead, I received a sliced roast beef sandwhich with provolone and spinach. The lettuce choice is negligble, but last time I checked short ribs were not slices of roast beef from the local ACME. Also ordered the grilled asparagus with pickled egg. The eggs were basically minced, so I could not get them on my fork or even remotely taste them. The fries and aioli is pretty delish, but I definetly will not be returning.
