3.5 stars.  Food was decent for the price although nothing spectacular.  Staff seemed a bit overwhelmed because we were brought the wrong orders and mistaken for another table.  Waitress was nice but seemed a bit in attentive.  Hostess had bit of an attitude but did her job. This place was very loud for an early Thursday evening.  Was hard to have a conversation at times I felt.  The original burger was good and fries were fine.
