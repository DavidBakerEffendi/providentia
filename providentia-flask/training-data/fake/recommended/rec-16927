Stopped in for a quick up of coffee with my mom. We both ordered French vanilla coffees, decently priced. Cozy, quiet, and intimate coffee shop for a quick cup of coffee or for studying. Saw a celebrity in there too! I recommended Trend to my brother who just moved to the area, a nice change from a typical dunkin donuts or starbucks.
