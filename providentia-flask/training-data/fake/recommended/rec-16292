I like to come here occasionally to grab a coffee or beer. It's a cute little neighborhood spot. I've never tried the food here (I'm vegan and that have zero vegan items on the menu- everything is cheesy and/or meaty), so my review is based solely on the drinks and atmosphere of the place. They have a huge beer & cider list, and the coffee is pretty tasty. Nice place to hang out on a cold, snowy day.
