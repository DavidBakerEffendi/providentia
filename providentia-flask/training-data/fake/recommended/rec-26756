Had to check this place out from reading all the great reviews.  Ordered the aromatic platter (beef tendons, pig ears, sliced beef) for appetizer.....gosh it was good!  I had the beef brisket with shaved noodle soup...the broth was out of this world!  Very tasty and filling.  Plus the price was super cheap.  I look forward to my next visit!
