That Irish bartender makes one hell of a drink. I came here with some friends for a birthday as we were looking for a speakeasy-esque bar but didn't want to venture to Rittenhouse. The ambiance was perfect- the music was jazzy, the lighting was low, the bartenders were dressed in shirts and ties and there was plenty of seating at the bar. After a first round of beer we switched over to a concoction of gin, cucumber and basil that the bartender called a "saint rick". Now I'm not normally a gin drinker but hooooly craaaaap these things were good. Definitely recommend this place, especially if you aren't into the dress codes and wait lists that some other bars have.
