Excellent food.  Third visit this year after literally stumbling upon this place after leaving in disgust a popular pizza place around the corner (watching two teenage employees text and chat without acknowledging new customers coming in the door).  We were a bit skeptical on the first visit because there was only one other party at 6pm dining.  Those fears were allayed with the delivery of the bbq chicken pizza, which is now my kids favorite.  Buffalo wings excellent (I'm picky); crispy and not over cooked.  Meatballs, chicken pesto pizza, excellent.  Very cozy inside.  Two person staff (I believe the owners - cook and sever) very friendly and attentive.  Although we have only been in there with two or three others tables at the same time (I don't understand why), I keep thinking if the place were to fill up, how could they handle it?  While eating, we could hear the owners(?) conversing and laughing with each other, which added to the already pleasant experience.  Limited, but nice wine list.  Limited but adequate beer list.  Pleasant and calming atmosphere.  We will definitely be giving this place our business going forward.
