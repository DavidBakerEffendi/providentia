Locals of the Polish and Spanish speaking varieties hang out here among the hipsters such as myself. Or maybe it's the other way around. The coffee is good, cheap, and served by decent folks who will pleasantly greet you. it is by no means a freelancer paradise, the pursuit of which leads me to drink coffee and when I'd rather have tea, but it has a low-key vibe, a piano front and center and flowers on all the tables. Milk and Roses is, well, charming. Sometimes I forget that not every coffee shop is meant for people like me to have a temporary office environment.
