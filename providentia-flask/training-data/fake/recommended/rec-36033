Amazing space in a dismal location, next to Bellevue Hospital. Can't help feeling that you're walking into someplace clinical, hospital -y when walking into the building. But five steps into the restaurant and it is a really impressive place, with high ceilings and views of the river. Cocktails 4 stars. They have a good bartender here and mixed drinks are tasty. Food 2-3 stars. 3 stars for presentation and 2 for actual taste.  Had the chicken and waffles,and trout cake. Food was pretty on the  plate but the chicken was dry and cold. Very bland. Must have been sitting for hours. Same thing with the trout cake. Burger was nothing special, diner quality. I expected more form a Tom Colicchio restaurant. We'll come back here for drinks and the view, but not for the food.
