The oxtail is excellent BUT!! The girls that serve you provide THE RUDEST service I have ever had in my life.It is the most frustrating thing in the world because I really like the food, but there are times when I don't have the patience to deal with their attitudes. The guy that serves you is very professional and courteous, but he is rarely at the front counter.
