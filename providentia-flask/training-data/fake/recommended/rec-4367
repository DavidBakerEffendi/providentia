A classic burger spot in the West Village. I came here during the daytime on Columbus Day to avoid the line at night. It was a good decision -- the place was pretty open, and I took a seat right at the bar. The bartender came over to me immediately and was pleasant. I ordered the Bistro Burger, a cheeseburger w/ bacon, lettuce, tomato and onion. It was very good. I asked for it medium, and they cooked it perfectly. It was also only $6.75. I also got a glass of McSorley's Dark for $2.50. After tax and tip, I spent a whopping $12. Great deal. Come back often if you're craving a burger.
