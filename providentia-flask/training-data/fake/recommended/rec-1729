Is it really difficult to have good ramen in the City? (I mean SF, not NY.) Apparently, it is. Why we can't have placed like Ippudo is beyond me. Ramen the way it's supposed to be. At least, the way my taste buds say it's supposed to be. +Shiromaru Hakata Classic: a white tonkotsu broth with Ippudo's signature dashi (miso stock), thin noodles, chashu (pork loin), sesame kikurage mushrooms, menma (bamboo), red pickled ginger, and scallions. Absolutely delicious! If you're contemplating an appetizer before your meal, DO NOT miss the hirata buns. We opted for the pork. Two pieces of steamed buns with pork, eringi mushrooms, spicy sauce, and mayo. So tasty! (Great shot from Tiffany C.: yelp.com/biz_photos/ippuâ€¦) On a cold, rainy day, we still had to wait a good 30 minutes for a seat, but that was totally fine as we had a pint or two at the bar by the door. Great food, decent prices, and solid service.
