Delicious food and potent margaritas. I recommend starting with the guacamole because as you sit there and wait for your food you'll notice everyone around you has it and you'll crave it even after dessert. The jalapeno margarita is just wicked and not for those who want a little heat cause it packs more of a fire. I particularly enjoyed the grapefruit margarita and the camarones ceviche. YUM! A can't miss unless you are trying to arrange a group outing. Forget it the reservation system is awash and the seats fill up quickly. Just arrive earlier than you would normally dine.
