I went to Ilili on a Friday night with a friend. I arrived a bit early and the staff asked if I would like to wait in the lounge area. The lounge area is wonderful, I would say this is a great place to grab some drinks, sit back and relax for hours while having some appetizers. However, I was here for the dinner and so I had to leave the lounge area. My friend and I were seated in a small tight space and it was not all that comfortable. There were plenty of other open tables where we would have been more comfortable, however, we suspected that because we were younger (but still dressed very nicely), we were placed in a more tight location. Our waiter took a while to come to us, so the service wasn't exactly on par. This wasn't exactly the busiest of times, we had arrived at dinner at around 6 and the restaurant wasn't even half packed, so we did expect a little better service. There were times we could not even find our waiter, he just simply disappeared from sight. The food we ordered was good however, and so it redeemed the restaurant. The Phoenician fries were delicious and I was glad we took the recommendation of our waiter. Unfortunately, the beers we wished to try (Israeli) were out, as well as the other type of unique beer they offered. This was disappointing, as it was Friday night and I would have expected them to be fully stocked in preparation for the weekend. Overall, the ambiance of the place was good. The service was mediocre. The food was delicious. The price for the whole meal was not too terrible, though I'm not sure if I could make it a regular dining experience.
