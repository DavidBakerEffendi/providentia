Loved everything about our dinner here.  The chicken liver rigatoni is outstanding.  The lemon sorbetto was hands down the best I have ever had and my husband stole it from me.  He can't wait to go back for that.  I can't wait to go back to try out some of the pizzas other people were enjoying.  Looked delicious!!
