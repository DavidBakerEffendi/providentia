I've experience better....when it comes to customer service.  Lucky for us, Yelp offered 10% off the bill.  Otherwise, we were seated, were not offered glasses of water, and when we ordered the pitcher of margarita (their signature) we could hardly taste the tequila.  We weren't told any specials or explained the menu.  We were left to our own devices.  The food was okay and the portions a good size.  We think it might be hit or miss because the table next to us seemed to get better service (waters and a detailed explanation of the menu).  The location is close to the train station which makes Senorita's a good option for commuters.  Unfortunately, there is no outside seating.
