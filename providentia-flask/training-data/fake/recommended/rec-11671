We read the mixed reviews about this place and still decided to give it a try. We went yesterday for an early dinner and ------ we LOVED it. I'm not sure what happened earlier to deserve the lower ratings, but our waitress was incredibly nice and welcoming, and made sure we enjoyed the meal. And what a meal it was. The pickled eggs were heavenly. The sticky pork dumplings - made to look like cinnamon buns - were deliciously whimsical. Had the lamb afterwards and it was well put together and tasty to boot. The cocktails were clever and they delivered. The dessert - baked Alaska - delivered too. The atmosphere is, in a way, very Brooklynish. We really enjoyed it. We will come back and hopefully we'll get the same level of service and food that we had the first time.
