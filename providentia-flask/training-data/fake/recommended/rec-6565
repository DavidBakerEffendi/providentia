Had dinner at Pylos and almost loved it, but wish I had splurged somewhere else.  Wine list errs on the overpriced side - ended up being pushed towards a Greek wine that wasn't ready for drinking yet - tasted like alcoholic grape juice.  Food was largely great - loved the saganaki and the lamb entree.  However, rude, unfriendly server turned us off from coming back.  He actually rolled his eye at us when we asked for a few more minutes to choose from the menu.   I would go back, order only appetizers to share and stick with the simpler wines. One thing to mention - this place is great for groups of three as they have benches set up to allow 3 people to sit around a smaller table, rather than forcing 1 person to sit solo at an adjacent table.
