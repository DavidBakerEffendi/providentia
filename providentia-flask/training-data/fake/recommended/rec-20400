I had the scallops, my friend had the fried chicken. Both were delish! Also got the side of cauliflower, and started with the bacon maple almonds. Both were great as well. I really wanted to try the desserts b/c they sounded great, but was too full to do so. I definitely will be back again. Only downside was the hour and a half wait. The hostess took our number and called us when our table was ready. Thankfully it was just an hour and we went to a nearby bar. It was beyond well worth the wait.
