This place is great! I love going here in the winter and huddling up near the fire with a big old beer and some sausages. Everything is really cheap, the staff are usually pretty nice, but I would not go here on a Friday or Saturday. They have fun games like Jenga and free Foosball, it's always a good time going here. On weeknights it's not too loud or crowded, fun.
