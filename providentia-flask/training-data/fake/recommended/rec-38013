Excellent sushi, very affordable, and great service!! Sushi California is a real treat! I try to go at least once a week. They have a great lunch special, and they welcome BYOB. It's a small place but they're less than a month away from doubling in size. I can't say enough about how nice the waitresses and chefs are. Highly recommended!
