Anyway back to BXL, we walk in to this charming Belgian bar around 5:30pm - and this is for all my single ladies out there - it was packed with men! Not a single female was in there except for us. You might want to mark this place down on your "must go" list ladies :). We checked out the extensive beer menu filled with Belgian brews in bottles and a decent list of them on tap too. And all of the ones on tap were very reasonably priced. Back in my non-beer-drinking days, I discovered Lindeman's Framboise in a bar in Belgium when I was traveling around Europe with some friends from college. Later in life whenever I would order it, my husband would say it did not count as beer because it was way too fruity. He's right it is deliciously fruity! I saw my old fave on the draft menu, but decided to be adventurous and try something different. I went for the Hoegaarden, which I think I had tried before, but couldn't really remember. It was a good pick! It was light and refreshing, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. To read the rest of my review, check out my blog - City Lights and Tasty Bites citylightsandtastybites.â€¦
