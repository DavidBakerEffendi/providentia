If my associates had only asked me a recommendation for dinner here in Burlington! I would have recommended Trattoria Delia - quaint Italian feel, yumm food, good vibe. Pulcinella's is no Trattoria Delia ... The food was decent. The ambiance lacking. The service very good. My upset tummy after - unpleasant.
