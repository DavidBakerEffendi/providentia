This place is great, they have a large variety of foods, breakfast, lunch dinner, snacks, and more. They recently re-did their menu and everything is still as good as it was, and even better. I ordered an old favorite of mine, the cheesesteak sandwich. I had the option of getting it on ciabatta bread, wow, the sandwich was huge!! It took up the whole plate along with a healthy serving of fries. I keep coming back to this diner because it's close by and it's delicious, everything I have had from here has been good. Their pricing is pretty well, not as cheap as some other places, but the quality of food and the good service make up for it.
