Reminds me of my grandmother's kitchen, perfect eggs, bacon, home fries, and pancakes. The people(family?) who work behind the counter have this tiny space and tiny grill to work with, yet they shovel out the best breakfast food in no time at all, it's as impressive as it is delicious. It's always a shame when I have 5 friends come in town because they only have a bar seating area and I refuse to offend the regulars that are as devoted as I am by having 6 obnoxiously hungry people come in and take over the bar. I bring myself and no more than 3 others due to the lack of space. Do yourself a favor and give this greasy spoon a go!
