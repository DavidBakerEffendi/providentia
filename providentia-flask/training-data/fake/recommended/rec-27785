My husband and I have been going to Cafe Matisse for about 7 years and we try and go 3-6 times a year as this is one of our favorite restaurants!  There is just no where else we have had such amazing and delicious food.  The combination of flavors and the eclectic menu is just to die for.  Some of our favorite dishes are the crab cakes, whenever they do a shortrib dish it puts me in a food coma its so delicious!!!  Everything that we have eaten, and we have eaten there very often has been over the top amazing!  Its also nice to know the staff and how personable they are and ALL so attentive and knowledgeable.  We love them all and we love the atmosphere and food of course!  The atmosphere is very intimate and a great dining experience.
