Came here for my birthday and loved the rustic chic feel of the restaurant. The grilled octopus pizza is delicious though I was disappointed when I found out I couldn't split the pizza in half and try two different toppings. Food was great but for the price, I felt like there were other equally pricey but even more tasty places. Overall a great experience and a great fancy date place, but not a restaurant that on the top of my list.
