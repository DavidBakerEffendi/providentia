My coworkers and I were so excited to try this place out because the reviews looked good and we were starving. 1. We were told it would be 5 minutes to get a table after being ignored for 10 minutes. There were 3 two-tops and 1 four-top tables open. Then, we waited for 40 minutes, not 5 to be re-acknowledged. After being re-acknowledged, we were seated after 10 minutes. 2. I swear we were skipped twice as they do not take names for a waiting list. This one group of 5 said they came 1 hour prior to us but didn't give a name and as soon as they arrived back, they were sat immediately. They were friends with the host. Where was the waiting list???? 3. After sitting, we were then told cash only. Why the hell wouldn't you disclaim that when greeting is for a table first? Or at least have a sign? We were so upset and disappointed in their service and attitude. 4. It's BYOB. I wish I could speak on their food but if their food is anything like their service and host, I bet it's awful. Unfortunately, I wanted to give this place no stars but you have to at least give one even though they are unworthy of one. Advice for the host working 8/13: Firstly, greet your customers and tell them you'll be right with them. Don't ignore people no matter how busy you are. Secondly, let your customers know it's cash only. Lastly, make and take a name for the waiting list.
