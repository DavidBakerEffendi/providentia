MEH says it all....... I'm a new resident in Sunnyside and love to eat, so when I saw the glowing reviews for Quaint (and the raves for the Eggs Benedict), I knew I had to try it out. The bf and I went for Sunday brunch, and although the ambiance was, well "Quaint", I was really disappointed with the food. I ordered the Eggs Florentine and he had the Eggs Benedict, and the waitress asked us if we wanted any sides. We both said no and she looked at us kind of funny, like there was something we weren't clued in on. When we received our plates I figured out why - the dishes DON'T COME WITH SIDES!!!!! Both the Eggs Benedict and Eggs Florentine were mouthfuls of buttery goodness, but the portions were pretty damn small and the "side dish" was a small side salad. Maybe the spoiled American in me has no idea on proper portion control, but when I go out for brunch I EXPECT my brunch to come with at least ONE side (salad does not count for us carnivores) and toast. Overall, it was cute but I am not coming back. I would rather navigate to the Bronx for Bruckner Bar and Grill's brunch than go back to this spot.
