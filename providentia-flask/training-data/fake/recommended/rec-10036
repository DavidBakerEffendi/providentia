Why...haven't I been introduced to Peruvian chicken earlier!? I discovered it this past summer and it is heavenly. The world is just a better place. I went here with my friends for my birthday and I loved it. I always recommend this place to anyone who asks where they should eat. Â  Service is great, sangria is the bomb (best I've ever tasted!!!) and most importantly food is A+. Since everything is served family style, I usually get multiple orders of the Matador combo. And also multiple orders of sangria jars.
