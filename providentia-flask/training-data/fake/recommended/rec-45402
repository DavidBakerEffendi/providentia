Went back to give the place another try. We were told to expect a wait of about an hour, so we wandered off to have a drink nearby and await a phone call. It was nearly two hours before we were finally seated (with much apologizing from the host - who was just as charming as on our previous visit.) We took our seat and ordered some wine and a meat and cheese plate as we began to peruse the substantially expanded menu. The meat and cheese plate arrived and was much improved from our previous visit altho it took a good 20+ minutes to come out. The balance of our meal was ordered and arrived in a similarly slow fashion but always with a big smile and frequent check-ins. The portions of all the plates were much better and we left feeling satisfied. The mains were over salted but were well cooked and nicely presented. So in conclusion - staff is as pleasant as you could ever wish for but the kitchen still seems wobbly. Food is slow to come out and inconsistent in it's quality. It's been a couple of months since our last visit and things are definitely improving. Keep it up! I will continue to root for them and their charming little spot.
