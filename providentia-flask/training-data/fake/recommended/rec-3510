I think its safe to say that Rye is my new favorite restaurant. I think the food and service are both top notch. Im glad i dont live nearby. I love this place!! I can go on and on about how much I love coming here for dinner.  The scotch egg, smoked salmon or sturgeon, ribs, bacon mac n cheese are all awesome.  Scallops and pork belly entree is my personal favorite.  The short rib entree and the duck are also both fantastic. One time they had a lamb shank special and it was unreal.  The banana split, donuts and crem brulee are great following dinner if you are not too stuffed. We recently celebrated a friends birthday at Rye and we ate like kings. The old fashions are also delicious. I can go on and on.Shevawn the owner/manager is fantastic. If you dont like Rye, I dont like you!!!
