The best thing about the Princetonian Diner they have an extensive menu, this place is the Walmart of diners (in a good way) - there's something for everyone.  The food was adequate and the portions generous. The waitress service was also very friendly and attentive.   We went on a weekday after the breakfast crowd left, however the guy who runs the place chose to seat a couple with a crying toddler right next to us just as our food arrived. I mean, the place was nearly empty and he had to seat them in the very booth next to us?  Needless to say this annoyed us, and we couldn't even carry on a conversation in a normal tone the rest of our meal. I'm sure this is an isolated incident, but I hope the guy in charge reads this review and keeps that in mind when he's seating guests.   My advice is if you go here, request to be seated in the main dining room (to the left). You're less likely to experience screaming children in the main room.
