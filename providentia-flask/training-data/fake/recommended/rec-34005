Love, love, loved the drinks! The owner/bartender was very, very, nice and I hope that this business continues to grow. The servers left something to be desired(maybe it was because they thought they were done taking tables, but the manager told them to serve us???) The rude "you need to order soon, because the kitchen thought we were closing" aside, the pickle juice back cocktails were an interesting and amazing find! The food was so-so, but perhaps because the "kitchen thought they were closing. I'll come back for the drinks!
