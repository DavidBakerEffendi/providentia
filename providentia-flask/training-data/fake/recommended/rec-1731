I was excited to try this place, given the reviews. What I found reminded me of mass eatery, such as I tried in Japan, where volume counts and people come and go frequently. I ordered the Clam Noodle Bowl.  I was shocked at the size of the bowl, the broth, the noodles, and the number of clams.  I couldn't even come close to finishing.  I sometimes consider Pho Super Bowl in Chino, California to be my go-to place for noodles and their regular size is smaller than this one. Unfortunately, the taste wasn't there.  Like so many VietNamese places (and I know that this is Chinese) I've tried, the broth is mostly without any flavour.  There were humongous portions of everything, the noodles seemed fresh, and the clams were very good, but it was a let-down for me.  Afterwards, I felt I should have gone back to Penang restaurant because, like the state in Malaysia, their food is great. I really wish I could have enjoyed Nan Zhou restaurant.
