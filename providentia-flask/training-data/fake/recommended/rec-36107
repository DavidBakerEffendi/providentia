This place is an absolute hidden gem! Well...actually not really, because of their HUGE ASS line down the street! Ha! There are tons and tons of halal carts in the city but this one is claimed to be the best. And boy, it was. It is near the theater district, so as we were heading over to a Broadway show, we made a pit stop here. It's cheap, fast, and the food comes right off their grill, still scorching hot when you get it in your hands. Their sauces are also DELISH! I remembered I put way too much spice on mine, but I still scarfed it down. The Halal Guys were also passing out nice eco-friendly tote bags with their logo on it to everyone afterwards. I am so sad they don't have any of this on the west coast!
