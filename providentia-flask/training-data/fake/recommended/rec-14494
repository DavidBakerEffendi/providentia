Omg..... cheap, fast, and ..... awesome. This place fits the criteria for the perfect fast food. Food = great Quantity = plentiful Service = They're super cool Price = Super cheap ($6) I get the mixed w/ rice and extra white sauce. Always get the extra white sauce... lol.. super good. FYI. They have three locations. The other location is on the same St, but just one avenue to the left (53rd and 7th). I don't know where the third location was.
