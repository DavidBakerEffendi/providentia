This is our second time eating at Pacifico. Our first experience was sort of a celebration which quickly turned into an overly pretentious experience created by a waiter that questioned my knowledge of ingredients. Good way to start buddy, then it quickly moved into his overly snooty attitude towards my girlfriend and correcting her when she ordered "sparkling water". Very high class personality from a New Haven local. The food arrived and 5 or 6 drinks later I could care less about him. I had a steak dish that was dressed with some sort of salsa. I liked the idea but the execution and flavors were missing a little. The second time was two nights ago. This time we had a much more comfortable laid back wait staff. We started with Guacamole that was fresh and made at our table, just like home, then I had the empanadas which resembled a frozen dinner warmed up. Again the idea for good food is there but the execution misses. My main course was a fish dish that was very fresh and of good quality. However the seasoning was very bland and boring. I like the creative spirit of the menu, a well taught kitchen staff is needed in order to hit the flavors. Keep trying!! For now I will stay downstairs with the bar tenders for great drinks and good company!
