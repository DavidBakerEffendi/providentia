After many visits to Adriana's in the last few months, I have become a huge fan. I am Italian and consider myself a food snob- this place knows what's up! The food is really good and the atmosphere is pleasant. I feel like the waiter was trying to turn the table over pretty quick last time but hey, it was Valentine's Day.
