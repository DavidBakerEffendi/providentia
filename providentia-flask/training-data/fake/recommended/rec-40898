Ducks Eatery may be in soft opening mode, but this place is a phenomenal idea of creative food fusion that is going to be a great hit.   Fabulously made cocktails, great appetizers, and delicious shared plates.  Pickles and jerky are very tasty appetizers to try.  Chicken wings and ribs are both amazingly delicious.  Brisket night is phenomenal.  Menu continues to change/vary depending on the week, with interesting and new creations/specials every week to try. Awesome vibe, music and decor in the restaurant, and outdoor seating on a gorgeous East Village block - makes for a fun, relaxing and hip New York City dining experience.
