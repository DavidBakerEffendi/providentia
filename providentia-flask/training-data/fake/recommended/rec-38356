Had dinner here tonight.  We just jumped into the first nice looking restuarant we saw due to the shitty weather this evening. The atmosphere is really nice I think .. had 'mood' lighting and little cozy booths.  We were sat down right away and the staff are friendly. I had the  Cheese Tortillini comes with button mushrooms, basil, red peppers, and tomatoes.  I liked it but the portion was quite big so I didn't finish it all. Dad has the Crispy Tuna with thai peanut sauce and noodles (he enjoyed it - however the noodles were cold). Mom had the classic fish and chips, which she also enjoyed. I would have liked to have stayed for more drinks but we just wanted to get out of there and get home. I would definetely go here again and I didn't find it that pricey... Im surprised people are complaing about prices.. compaired to other places I've been to this place is cheap esp when the food is good. Give it a try Canadians if you're ever in Burlington Vermont! (easy to get to ..just on the pedestrian walkway)
