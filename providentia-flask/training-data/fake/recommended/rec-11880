I don't often write reviews and normally I do so to seriously compliment a restaurant but I came here after reading the incredible reviews by Yelpers with a friend from out of town and to say we were disappointed was an understatement. We started with an appetizer which was delicious. Heirloom tomatoes, crusty bread and a little bit of oil made for a great start. I was impressed with how fresh the food was, our server was marginally pompous, but I can get over it. However, when our pasta came I was mortified to say that I had brought someone from out of town no less, to this place. I ordered a spagetti with red sauce. The pasta was not made in house, but I love red sauce (a really good one) and it was one of the few they had. I made a point to say that I was a red sauce snob and the guy said it was delicious....What I received was a bowl of pasta with a bolognese that was SO greasy that it left literally puddles of grease in my bowl. It was absolutely inedible. My friend ordered a truffle oil ravioli which was just too rich, but by no means as horrendous as what was sitting in front of me. Needless to say, I will be sticking with all of the amazing little Italian places in Brooklyn. Completely overpriced and way too hyped. One of the most disappointing meals I have had in a long time in NYC.
