I swear the sun shines some days just to make me go to Habana Outpost. It's a great place to sit outside, people watch, drink margs and enjoy the Fort Greene neighborhood. The food and drinks are pretty yummy.  And I appreciate they have a "drink & corn only" line.  The lines do get a bit long, so that's a bummer.  As well as searching for a table. I always feel like such a nerd when I'm wandering around checking people out and searching for an open spot. But once we settle down, it's great to just chill.   The sustainable design really makes for a unique place. They have some of my favorite bathrooms in the city.
