This spot has a ton of reviews and I'm not sure I have much new ground to cover.  We love Simon Pearce and have always had a wonderful time- I do agree that lunch is a better value, but dinner is also very nice.   It's definitely worth it to plan ahead and make a reservation to sit near the window, or wait the extra time it takes to get one of those tables.  We've always had attentive, friendly service here, too.  I once ordered one of the specials and really didn't like it, and even though I didn't say anything or complain, the waitress brought it up when she saw my full plate, and then removed the item from our bill, which we didn't even ask for. Also, we recently registered at Simon Pearce for our wedding, and if you do your registry with them, they will give you a little "minimoon" that includes a dinner at the restaurant and a night in the local inn.  Way to class it up like whoa, Simon Pearce! One final note:  If the walnut and raspberry macaroon is on the dessert menu when you are there, ORDER IT!  it's the best most yummy wonderful thing ever :)
