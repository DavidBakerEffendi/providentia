Went on a Sunday evening for dinner.   We got a great seat in the corner with windows surrounding us.   The service was attentive, helpful yet not overbearing.  Plus, the restaurant was very flexible and understanding of their patrons' needs -that's always a PLUS, and it's a quality that's hard to come by, even at the most prestigious of establishments. All our dishes were delicious.   Pan roasted chicken was absolutely, bone sucking great.  It was cooked to perfection, crispy on the outside and moise on the inside.  It was laid on a creamy fontina fondue with well-seasoned broccoli.  I cleaned the plate off. My friend got the skate wing - YUMMY.  The natural juices from the heirloom tomato does the dish WONDERS. Another buddy got the arctic char.  You could tell that the piece of fish was so fresh and NOT frozen.   The best part about this place is that the main meat of the entree is NEVER overpowered by sauces or its sides.  The garnish, really, is just a GARNISH. My suggestion is to skip the appetizers and get the sides instead.  Their cauliflower, broccoli and sweet corn (I think only served during summertime) sides are SOOOO good.  We were tempted to order more if we could ignore our overly stuffed bellies.   Can't wait to go back!
