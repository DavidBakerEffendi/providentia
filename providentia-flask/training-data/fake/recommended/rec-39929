Alright, let me start off by saying I was impressed with the crowd and ambience. The menu is very big and accommodating. The beer selection is great, as it should be. I was particularly impressed with the Norwegian Wood. A chocolate lager? With cinnamon? It was a shot in the dark but the description said "dessert in a glass" and I couldn't agree more. As far as service went, I don't have a single good thing to say. (Sharisol) was my server, and I could tell that she had a great personality, but did not know a single thing about service. Nothing went smoothly, and as I sit here waiting for her to grab the check it's been almost 20 minutes. Hopefully I will have an enjoyable dinner next time around because the food and beer were great.
