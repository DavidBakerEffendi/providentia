You want good greek in manhattan? This is the spot. Always fresh, good quality ingredients and impeccable combinations. Try the Greek Salad, Braised octopus, fish of the day.. and dont forget to ask for extra lemon. You can tell by the flavors that the olive oil, balsamic, capers, cheeses... Everything is delicious and compliment each other so well. I asked the waitress for a good wine recommendation and we had a great time.
