We ate lunch at Soul de Cuba New Haven 03182014.  I've eaten Cuban food all of my life and my wife (from Puerto Rico) and I have eaten at countless numbers of Cuban restaurants, mostly in south Florida.  Near home there are no Cuban restaurants so to treat ourselves to a Cuban meal, which we hadn't had in a good while, we did a little trip down to Soul de Cuba, our first meal there.  It's a small place and we paid to park on the street nearly in front of the restaurant - very low fee.  The menu is very complete - we selected two of our favorites - the Picadillo and Palomilla steak, two of the most traditional Cuban selections.  Each plate came with black beans and rice and sweet fried plantains - in our book all a must for a real Cuban meal. Overall, we'd have to rate the food as ok in comparison to the other Cuban restaurants where we've eaten and to our own preparation of Cuban food.  That doesn't mean that it wasn't a good meal - we devoured everything, and it was a tasty meal.  But we felt it was a notch below what we usually have in FL.  The Picadillo I like and prepare has some tomato sauce - this appeared to have none.  And it did have capers, which I would rather not have.  Otherwise it was pretty well seasoned and it was tasty.  The black beans were ok.  Rice properly cooked.  The Palomilla steak was a notch below average - it could have had more seasoning, and most places in FL will serve it with some chopped onion and parsley for a little extra kick (which also works well for the black beans).  None came on our plate.  The sweet fried plantains were top notch. One thing missing was any Cuban bread.  That is a shame but as far as I know real Cuban bread doesn't exist outside of south FL - apparently a well kept secret recipe.  The pricing at Soul de Cuba was somewhat high - for our two plates about $10 more than what we are used to in FL.  We probably will not return, but we had a pretty good meal.
