i'll start by saying this: i absolutely abhor the fact that they refuse to use a normal system like any other establishment! this is why i have only ever been to B2 twice. the counter operates like a bar. you may stand there feeling ignored while people who came in after you are being served. there isn't even a sign like "order here". it isnt a BAR, it's a coffee shop. there are a thousand other coffee shops in this city that have figured out how to serve their customers fairly and efficiently and there is really no reason to go reinventing the wheel when it comes to giving people drinks and sandwiches. that being said, i like the green onion cream cheese. I know i could totally make it at home, but i dont. I like that they give you a ton of it, too. i like to really heap it on there. i also like the big tables, but i dislike that they are often occupied by one person who is spread out with their laptop and work stuff while my friends and i sidle into cramped corners. More small tables would seat more people. i really dislike that it is cash only. i tend to avoid cash only establishments. there have been many a mildly hungover morning that i start my trek thiking i'll hit up B2 but end up at dunkin donuts to avoid the cash hassle.
