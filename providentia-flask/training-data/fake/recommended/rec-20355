traif (noun) \ TRAF \ 1) Â a needlessly long monologue about how a menu works which actually requires no explanation (Example: "Why did she give us such a traif? I'm not an idiot, I can select food for myself.") (verb) \ TRAF \ 2) to be patronized when not ordering as much food as the waitress would like you to order (Example: "Oh my god. Were we just traifed because we ordered 9 plates instead of 12? Girl's gonna get her 20% regardless. I guess those few dollars mean a lot to her.") 3) to ask the same exact question, I mean *verbatim*, of your customers four times regardless of the stage of the meal (Example: "She kept traifing, 'How is everything so far?' but it was pretty clear she couldn't care less since we'd disappointed her with our sensible appetites (see #2).' " 4) to hope that the service was an isolated incident and not a consistently self-righteous, pushy, and gluttonous attitude that the management of a restaurant condones, or worse, encourages because one would maybe like to return there one day because the food was, by and large, very tasty (Example: "I'm traifful that better experiences await me there. Because damn, those scallops...")
