Wow. The once-popular Princetonian is now a depressing shadow of its former self. The restaurant inside looks poorly maintained and less than ideal cleanliness, and I was shocked by the low standards of the bland food. The waitstaff was chatting loudly in full view of the few patrons, and our own waitress was eating her own breakfast in between serving ours. I will not be returning here again.
