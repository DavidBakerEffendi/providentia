great price, friendly staff, and environmentally conscious business.  the food is quite basic, but it is consistently delicious.  i usually order the spicy beef bento box.   best part (for me) is that they deliver to the mantua area, which for some reason, so many university city businesses refuse to do.  i am ordering in tonight!
