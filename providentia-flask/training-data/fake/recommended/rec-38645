Don't listen to what anyone else says here.  The guacamole will CHANGE YOUR LIFE.  Not listed in the menu is an option to get a guacamole sampler, where you choose three of your favorites.  For $22, you get 3 good sized helpings of any of their amazing guacamoles.  Enough to feed four people, it's definitely a good price. The drinks are delicious and will definitely get you going. This is definitely a place I frequent as often as I can.  Sure, it's not as cheaply priced as the Cantina on Passyunk that all of these reviewers seem to have a hard-on for, but I've definitely never had a bad time, a bad drink, or a bad meal at El Vez.
