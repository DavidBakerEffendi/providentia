My wife and I spent last night (and a few too many dollars) at Pure.  Upon arriving, we inquired about one of the many empty tables in the bar area and were informed they were all reserved.  Two hours later, most remained vacant.  We each took a seat at the bar which had plenty of seating available.  Pure had a good selection of beers on tap at reasonable prices. Unfortunately, the food left much to be desired.  We discovered this from the get go with our appetizers.  The Yellowtail Jalapeno ($14) was bland and difficult to eat.  We ordered two different types of oysters -  Kumamotos and Bluepoints.  The Kumamotos were overpriced at $4 a piece, and some weren't properly shucked.  What really turned me off was when they arrived and were already topped with mignonette and cocktail sauce, respectively.  Call me picky but I like to make up my own oysters. Most disappointing was the Triple Tartare (Tuna, Salmon and Yellowtail), which was was barely edible; we had two bites and set it aside. For our entrees, my wife ordered a selection of sashimi and a spicy tuna roll that was uninspiring.  My 8 oz. fillet ($32) was properly prepared but came out cold. It wouldn't surprise me to learn the french fries were frozen.  I was also disappointed that it was served with green beans when I was initially told to expect asparagus. Simply stated, I would be surprised to see Pure around a year from now.
