This place is so fantastic!  Beware - it's cash only, and also there is usually a wait.  We went on a Thursday around dinner time, and because our whole party was not there yet, we weren't able to get seated.  They don't take reservations, but they were nice enough to let us know when the next table for our party would be availabile while we were across the street grabbing a beer. The garlic/chili sauce is SO good.  Everyone needs to get like plates of that stuff to use.  Both the shrimp and pork bun are very tasty in their own way, and if they weren't $5 a pop, I could probably eat 20 of them for dinner.  Their ramen was very tasty as well.  I got the pork bone ramen special, and it was so fantastic!  Great place, good vibe, delicious ramen.  Keep in mind that this place also serves beer.  However, not the best spot to just grab a beer, since the line is so long, and you don't want to be THAT table.
