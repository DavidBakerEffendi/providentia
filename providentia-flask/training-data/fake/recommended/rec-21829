For Lent I decided to give up "red meat," then along came our visit to Corner Bistro. And what better way to be sacrilegious than to drown oneself in an good old fashion cheeseburger. They are typically cooked to medium and come with the standard vegetables and fixings. The burgers were sizeable, making them a bit difficult to handle. But the meat was juicy and well-cooked. Corner Bistro's approach to burgers is minimalistic. They do not use rubs or seasonings, but what you will get is the pure unadulterated taste of beef. I appreciate that they dont top the burger with sauces, and only provide ketchup, mustard, salt & pepper at the table. Still, I would not go so far as to say that this is the "Best Burger in New York City," as I have tasted better.
