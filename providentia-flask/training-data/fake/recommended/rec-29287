Hands down, the food that comes out of that kitchen is always great. The menu has great variety and has a strong selection of veg-friendly dishes. Beer selection is always good and refreshed too. The wait staff is just weird. I've been here 15 to 20 times, and it is predictably a strange experience. I get that I may not look like a hipster, but I have cash in my pocket and am hungry, so please don't be pretentious if I didn't roll in on my bike. I keep going here, though, because the food is so good. If there was a Cantina next door, I would prefer the friendlier atmosphere there.
