First trip here and it was delicious! Small cozy restaurant with a nice patio out front.  We started with edamame which was steamed perfectly.  We ordered the drunken noodles with chicken- spicy but so enjoyable and the Shrimp loves scallop- scallops cooked perfectly with a delicious sauce.  Both plates were clean by the time we were finished it was too good.  Our waitress was not very good but the manager came to check on us and was very attentive to us. I will definitely be back soon!
