Came once again and had a great dinner at fogo. The one thing I didn't understand was that the main waiter clearly asked my friend and I if we wanted the dinner to be pork and alcohol free, which we did, and non stop the waiters offered pork selection after pork selection. The staff were very friendly and knowledgable about the cuts of meat as usual.
