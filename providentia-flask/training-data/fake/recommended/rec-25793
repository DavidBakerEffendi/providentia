What a terrible place, full of douche bags. It's 90 degrees in there in the middle of winter, after 20 mins I had no choice but to strip down to my tank top or pass out from the heat. Apparently this is a beer bar with a dress code because I was quickly told I had to put my shirt back on because a tank top wasn't enough, or leave. I chose to leave despite that I had just ordered a $14 beer. I guess they don't like my money. Too bad, I have the right mind to tell them where they can shove it.
