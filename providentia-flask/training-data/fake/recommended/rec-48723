This place is the best! I just finished eating dinner there with my boyfriend and we loved it, the service was amazing, the cocktail list was awesome! A cocktail named 'the first kiss' I thought was very tasty. I had a mango something drink first and I thought it was a little sweet. The chicken saute is the best ever and the steamed dumplings are also amazing. The basil duck was probably my favorite thing we had tonight, it was the perfect kind of spicy and my boyfriend and myself normally do not ever have thai food. Thats because in the past we have paid too much for thai food we have not liked but this is a game changer! Plus the prices are unheard of for a nice dinner out in nyc. I say anything under a 100$ with great service, great ambiance, with multiple drinks and two appetizers and two entree's is a super deal. We will absolutely be going back to up thai again soon!
