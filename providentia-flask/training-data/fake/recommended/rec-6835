Seriously great food here served by very nice and informative wait staff (owners?) who obviously take pride in everything they do - from mixing the perfect Martini to keeping the water glasses filled with infused water. Had no trouble getting in on Tuesday night and the music was fun and not too loud. Shared two outstanding starters - a squash puree with amazing grilled radicchio and a cabbage dish whose complexity rolled out from first bite to finish. The two pastas of the day were more exciting and inventive than anything we had in Rome last week. Off the beaten trail for us, but plan to make it out there again soon.
