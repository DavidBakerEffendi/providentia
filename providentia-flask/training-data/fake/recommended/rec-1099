If you're into great food and want to buy great local, farm-fresh produce, meat, and eggs, this is the place. It's literally the best place to buy food in the city. There are great places to eat (bakery, amish bakery, chocolate shops, sandwhich places, italian places, middle eastern, sushi, etc) Fair Trade Food Stand sells fresh off the farm produce, meat, etc. If you live near the terminal and shop at the supermarket, shame on you.
