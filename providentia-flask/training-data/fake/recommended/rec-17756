The best bagels in Lower Bucks County are located just around the corner from the Yardley (SEPTA R3) train station. This store's offerings are much more squishy/doughy than most other bagels. If you want a harder, drier bagel, this is not the place for you. But i find these bagels have the best mouthfeel and gluten-y goodness among the many others I have tasted. The egg and blueberry bagels are perfect. Their breakfast sandwiches are a hit in my family and the mini bagels in the basket at the front counter are popular among kids. I especially like the weird mix among the customers: the soccer moms and dads standing behind the retirees standing behind the 20-something slackers who have been partying all night standing behind the 11 year old who was sent to the shop with a $5 bill. The only downsides: Expect long lines out the door and no parking at 8-9am on a Saturday during the soccer and baseball seasons. And the small tubs of cream cheese are overpriced.
