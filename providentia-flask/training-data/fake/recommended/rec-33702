You can definitely tell this is a tourist place. From the location to the crowd when you walk in. My friend was from out of town and this was where her friends wanted to meet (I always like trying something if I haven't been there). Funny thing is I had never heard of this place even when I lived here before. Luckily we had a reservation and didn't have to wait long for our table. While we were waiting I took a look around and saw these monster dishes, no way even two people could finish one. We had five people, split one appetizer of calamari, split pasta with shrimp, and one tiramisu. We were stuffed and we couldn't finish the dessert. I felt totally gross afterwards. I really wouldn't come here more than once. Unless you want to entertain a midwest tourist. It's worse than a buffet nightmare. The portions are ridiculous!
