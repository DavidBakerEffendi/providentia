For an enchanting evening! Had reservations for a booth for two at 8PM, our table was ready, my wife could sit facing the window so as the snow started the romantic setting became perfect. The Rosemary olives on the table when you arrive are high quality and delicious. The French bread with creamy butter is also terrific and plenty of it. We had the duck terrine as an appetizer and the duck entr√©e and shared both which gave us room for a little dessert. The wine recommendation by the waiter was also perfect, a French wine of course. This place is definitely a keeper.
