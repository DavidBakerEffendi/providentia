I really want to love this place. And in some ways I do. I love the staff. I love the relaxed, cool vibe of the place. I love the menu. And then the food comes and....ick. A customer in line with me highly recommended the veggie burger, which both my friend and I ordered. It was like a very large, uncooked lump of veggie dip on a delicious piece of bread. The fries, too, were pretty blah. The consistency of the burger was just so mushy, so shapeless, it was hard to even consider it as a burger, per se. But like I said, I WANT to like this place and so I will probably go back.
