I feel badly that this review will be negative but lucky for Pizza City their pizzeria is always packed with customers. Tonight my husband ordered two calzones and a order of mussels. Very simple in my opinion. However when he got the food home my calzone was really burnt at the bottom and the mussels we were going to share were God awful! Â If you are going to have frozen, disgusting mussels just take them off the menu-wouldn't that be easier? We won't be returning.
