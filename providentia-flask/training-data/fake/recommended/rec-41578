The food is consistently colorful and delicious. The staff are friendly and helpful when choosing options. The crispy ranch sandwich lives up to it's hype and is surely one of the best (if not "thee best") vegan chicken sandwich I've had. Prices are steep but on a day when you're craving fresh vegetarian fast food this is the place to go.
