My first 5 star review. Ohhh how I miss this amazing NY street meal now that I'm on the other coast. Yes, the lines suck, there are usually like 15 people waiting at 6:45pm for them to open up at 7. But guys, this is seriously worth it! I am a little embarassed to admit that I have taken the subway from Astor Place just to visit the cart... but it's just SO good and no other Halal cart compares! Get the combo platter and really really load up the white sauce. I am all about the hot sauce so I rock that out too (and yes, their red stuff is HOTTT, almost as hote as Mamoun's). The best thing to do is starve yourself for several hours to prepare for this feast - or go for a drunken late night snack so you don't worry about how much you're eating. And it's super cheap, which is a bonus. Also fun to check out if you're out in mid-town with out of towners who wanted to check out the Times Square hoopla.
