Every time I'm in NYC we would come here for brunch.  It's a small place, but the food is excellent.  It's also kid-friendly which is a plus in my book.  We always get the chicken stew (and it comes with some awesome crispy fries), the waffles and maybe some mac & cheese or an omelet.  The coffee is also good, as well as the different number of belgian beers.  The kids get to read/look at the comis and some are in French to keep them entertained.  There is usually a wait, but the service is quick and attentive.  It's a great neighborhood place.
