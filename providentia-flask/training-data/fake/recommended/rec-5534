Olde City is near the Hyatt Regency at Penn's Landing, so this place was convenient to grab some sushi during my business trip.   Since I'm a visitor to Philadelphia, I wanted to try their signature Square Sushi.  I also ordered some Salmon Sashimi, and the American Dream Roll.   The square sushi was innovative and I hoped the plum sauce would captivate me but it didn't really.  I actually like their American Dream roll which had baked scallop, white fish and shrimp.  The sweet and saltiness combined with a kick of the spicy mayo was tasty.  The salmon sashimi was kind of thin than what I expected.   Overall, it was a nice place to try.
