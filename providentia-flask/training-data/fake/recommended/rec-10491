Went here for a late lunch on a Friday afternoon. I will definitely return if I am in the neighborhood. Its a small little place and there was a line, but it moved quickly and the seat turn over seems to be frequent. My boyfriend got a very large steak burrito while I opted for two tacos, one grilled chicken and one pork. I think I made the better choice and the pork was definitely the best of the three meat options. Add some guac and you are all set. Dos Toros offers the right amount of food at a good price and I would highly recommend it, especially the tacos.
