ilili is rustic Lebanese cuisine prepared and served in a refined manner. Some say ilili is a 'fusion' restaurant but whatever label you bestow upon them I say ilili's offerings are delicious. My last visit occurred during restaurant week. Ordinarily I hate dining out during restaurant week. But my friend and I arrived late enough to miss the crowds and we ordered from the main menu by unceremoniously refusing the deal of the week menu. So here's our order and what I thought: - Hommus - Very good but heavy on the tahini - Watercress Salad - Yummilishous - Moujadara - see watercress salad - Black Iron Shrimp - Arrived cool but otherwise yummy too - Lamb Chops - prepared to perfection We skipped dessert and coffee and just polished off a bottle of very good Lebanese wine. The price-point was high for an unknown Lebanese vineyard but what do I know? Can't wait to return.
