I took a group of foodies there for dinner this evening and we had a fabulous time! The atmosphere was beautiful though it was a little too warm. We even got to sit at the chef's table! Our server Virginia took very good care of us, was very knowledgeable about the food and made excellent recommendations!  The food was amazing especially the scallops and calamari. The cocktails were interesting and delicious.  Brian, the manager, wowed us with a pyrotechnic grande finale when one of us ordered the flaming chai and was thoughtful enough to divide among each of us to try. I would definitely recommend Tashan and look forward to returning! I would definitely get the chef tasting menu next time!
