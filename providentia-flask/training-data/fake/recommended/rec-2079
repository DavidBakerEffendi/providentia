My now fiancee and I went on a road trip last spring and I have been super busy I never yelped about our adventures. None the less this was the best time we had in Philly, mind you we only had a day to see the whole city. So we arrived around noon and ventured out and did some sightseeing. Then we returned to our hotel, checked in and decided it was time to start drinking. On the recommendation of fellow yelpers we gave this place a try. It is down a back alley and in the middle of no where. We walked in and it was packed. The people where so friendly. There was a group of people who where singing and it was so much fun. We had a seafood platter and buffalo wings. The seafood platter was above average but the buffalo wings where amazing! The beer was like $8 a pitcher and we had at least two and stumbled back to our hotel as happy as could be.
