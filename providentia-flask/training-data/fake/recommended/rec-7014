The owners are always there and treat every customer like family. The food is very fresh, the store actually closes twice a week so the staff can work on making fresh jams and biscuit mix from scratch. It would be tough to order something you didnt enjoy here, and the food options are simple enough to not bother recommending something specific. As far as the drinks, im a fan of the mint infused lemonade, but if that sounds too sugary, the mint tea is pretty great as well.
