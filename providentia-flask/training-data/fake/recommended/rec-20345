The pizzas are pretty good- not great - but good. Love the building and the decor. Went at prime time on a Saturday night and even though they were busy we still got seated right away. The service was friendly (unlike Franny's!!!) but they send the starter and pizzas at the same time. Not really enough space on the table and not quite sure what to start with first. Will certainly go back, but hopefully they will have better communication/coordination between the back and front of the house.
