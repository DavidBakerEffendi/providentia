You want to eat healthier, but you're having trouble giving up meat? This place is perfect for you! The soy protein products that they have are the most 'meat like' that I have had. I am not a vegetarian, I love meat. However, the food here is extremely filling and satisfying even for the most fickle of meat loving skeptics. The staff is always pleasant. I have yet to find something on the menu that I haven't enjoyed.
