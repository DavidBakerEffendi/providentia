I would definitely come back to this place... and will recommend it for friends... i was at S&F on 4/29.  My wife and I were just happened to be in the LIC area and went on Yelp to search for food.  and we found this place and didnt regret eatin there... that nite, we had a lot of diff stuff due to the size of the dish(prices were rite too) and we love all of the dishes... we had the lobster salad, seared scallops, oxtail terrine, pork taco and the gnocchi... my personal favorite was the oxtail... the gnocchi was on the heavy side... pork taco was interested... i had all 3 of them since my wife was full at the end... even thou my wife said she was full... she still had room for dessert as always...  we shared the lychee panna cotta with yuzu sorbet... we like it... the sorbet was so refreshing.. and the panna cotta was pretty good... There are many things that i would love to try next time... Oh the bacon fat pop corn... it's tasty...
