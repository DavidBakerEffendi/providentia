Atmosphere: Williamsburg cool with the air of Japanese mannerisms Food: Yummy Price: Affordable. Cash only. Portions: Standard Udon bowl Wait time: Varies. But typically it's crowded and there is a wait. This is probably in my top five in Williamsburg. The wait sometimes turns me away, but the food is always solid and hits the spot. I mainly go for: Kinoko Tsukejil Udon (mushrooms) and the Black Sesame Ice Cream (which is AMAZING) to close, but all the Udon is good, just depends what you're in the mood for :].
