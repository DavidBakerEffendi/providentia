Something about NJ restaurants. Its never consistent. The first visit is great and every visit there after is so so. Stamna seems to buck that trend for me. Whether it is the gyro platter for lunch or grilled whole fish for dinner. It keeps me coming back. The taste and aroma remind me of my honeymoon in Santorini. The best lamb, zucchini pies, and greek cuisine in Essex County.
