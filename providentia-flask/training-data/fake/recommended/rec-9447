Came for a happy hour which was perfectly fine. The drinks are delicious. I had one too many "From Beirut with Passion" (mint basil cilantro infused vodka with passion fruit.) Soo good and dangerous as it sneaks up on you. I tried my friend's Phoenician Lemonade which was also great (if a bit sweet) The decor and ambiance is beautiful - modern, upscale and classy without being pretentious. The dining area is separate from the bar and lounge area. We sat at the bar and didn't interact much with the bartender except for ordering the drinks so not much to say but he did his job. We only ordered two apps - the lebne came in a tall shot glass with a few sticks of cucumber and carrot. it was OK, the yogurt was nice and thick but could have used more seasoning. The crudite were a bit too watery. The cheeserolls with kashkavel were good - like small fried cheesy spring rolls. They also have a private room upstairs overlooking the bar and lounge that looks like it would be great for a group gathering. I would definitely come back again for dinner to try more dishes.
