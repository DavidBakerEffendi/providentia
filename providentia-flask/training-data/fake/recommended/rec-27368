Update: Been back a bunch and still, the Bronte burger NEVER disappoints. SO GOOD. -- OH DELICIOUSNESS, NICE TO MEET YOU. Friend intro'd us to this place a few weeks ago and raved about the burger. Ordered it and it lived up to the hype (for once). YUM. Also shared some pasta and that was delish too. Tiny spot that I'm sure gets crowded (though we were seated right away on a Thursday night). I lovedddd it!
