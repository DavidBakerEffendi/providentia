I finally tried this place and it was AWESOME. I got delivery to my work, took about 20 minutes! The lunch deal is amazing. I had Pad Thai, 2 spring rolls, and a fresh salad for 6.95. Unbeatable. Plus, everything tastes fresh and the containers were nice and clean! I can't wait to go back! Delicious!!!!!!
