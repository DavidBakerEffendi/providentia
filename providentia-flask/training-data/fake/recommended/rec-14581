Ofrenda has a really solid happy hour and one of the best Mexican brunches I've had in the city! It's a little pricey but margaritas are $6 during happy hour and beers are $4. The margaritas are very strong and high quality. I ordered nachos during happy hour once and those were delicious and around $7. Last weekend I had the pleasure of discovering their brunch! Almost every place I called in was booked and unable to accommodate my last minute brunch plans but Ofrenda had plenty of space. The service was great and the food was absolutely delicious. I ordered the chilaquiles and they were really fantastic. The portions were quite large, everyone I was brunching with had a difficult time finishing all the food! I had the sangria to drink which was both delicious and a very pretty, well-made drink. My friends ordered the hibiscus mimosas and liked those as well. The space is very nice-- plenty of tables, nicely decorated, and everything is clean. The staff were all great and I love the atmosphere here. During the summer, they open the large front windows and place tables almost outside. The only downside is that the brunch drinks are pretty pricey. There are no brunch drink discounts and no all-you-can-drink specials. Drinks on the brunch menu seemed to vary from $8-$11 so we only bought one each. The food was amazing but I would have liked to have a few more brunch cocktails without spending so much. It's a good choice if you want to splurge and don't want a brunch place that's super crowded!
