In short, bufad is bangin. It's also bougie af but overall it's worth it. After living in Napoli I had pretty much given up hope that any pizzeria in Philly would come close to real pizza but I have to say, it's worth the $12. I decided to try it after I read that the owner was Calabrese (puru io sugnu calabbrisi!) and I'm glad I did. As much as I love our food in South Philly, our pizza is too americanized. I'm glad I found a place that makes it the authentic way and it's not run by some snot nosed Anglos who travel around the mezzogiorno and think they know our food better than we do. I've been in twice and had the mortadell pizza, the sicilian olive & artichoke, the margherita, and the pesto and finocchio pizza. The bill was painful (lbr, it's overpriced) but given the neighborhood (the next victim of gentrification and neoliberal "urban renewal") and the quality of the dough, whatever, I'll deal with it. I only wish there was more space in there, and really wish fritti misti were offered as antipasti (tho I wanna try that burrata whenever I'm lest broke!) To the Pasquarellos: if yall ever want to open up a friggitoria and further exploit yuppie foodies w/ frittate di maccheroni and polpett e' mulignan hmu. (also lol at the guy who says it's not ~adventurous~ enough. lmao yr a trip, bye boy)
