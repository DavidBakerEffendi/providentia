food was ok, nothing exceptional.  we had the vanilla bean french toast, benedict johnny, egg white omelet, and steak and eggs.  too expensive for what it is.  restaurant is nice.  high ceilings.  comfy (as long as you don't get the table right by the front/bar where people will be bumping into your chair).  not worth a 2 hour wait.  make sure to make a reservation.  go on sunday - you get a free cocktail.
