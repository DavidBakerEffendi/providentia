Saraghina never fails to amaze us! The pizzas are fabulous, yes all of them, so good! We've also been for brunch and the options were just as delicious, fresh, and filling. They have yummy bread for eating with their oils and will provide as much as you ask for usually, their wine list is extensive, and their desserts are hands down delicious! During warmer days their outside seating area is delightful.
