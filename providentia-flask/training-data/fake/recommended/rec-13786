I've been a fan of Momofuku Noodle Bar since they opened, as they have "appeased" the vegetarians with Ginger Scallion Noodles and Shiitake Pork Bun for a while now. Momofuku Ssäm does not follow suit, and I was pretty disappointed with their offerring. It was a little humiliating to have the waitress tell me "well, you can eat the pickles and some bread." I'm aware of David Chang's meat-centric style, having even bought the cookbook at one point, so I wasn't expecting much on the meat-free spectrum. One dish would have sufficed. Even a side dish. There were several dishes that seemed vegetarian friendly, with generally one  seafood-based ingredient, but they didn't offer to adjust the dish. So I had a nice bottle of Bruce Cost's Ginger Ale while my friends tried several dishes. They liked the pork buns and a scallop dish best, and didn't like the sea urchin/tapioca/whipped tofu.
