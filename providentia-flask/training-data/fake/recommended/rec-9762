my friends threw a surprise birthday party for me here and i gotta say this is one of the nicest looking restaurants ive seen in a while. the place is dimly lit and the bathroom sink is real cool ahahah. the decor is sick. we ordered sangria and the matador combo. the sangria was super yummy and as for the matador combo, i didnt speak once during the meal. devoured it. absolutely loved the avocado salad. i love peruvian food
