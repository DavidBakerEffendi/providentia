Fresh, authentic, flavorful Korean fare. Fast service. Attentive waitstaff. The server took the time to answer our questions and explain the 14! side dishes that came with our meal. The portions are very generous. The bibimbap was awesome. The dish, served in a hot stone pot, stayed piping hot. The beef was tender and perfectly seasoned. The chili sauce was a nice accent to the dish. The vegetable kimchee was a standout and the server gave me extra to took home. Hubby and I will definitely be returning soon.
