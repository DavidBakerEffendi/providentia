The food is good. But you need to extra careful with the level of spice. Apparently their medium spicy was spicy enough to numb our tongues. The food was so spicy it was hard to tell if the dan dan noodles were good or not. I would give it another shot once they move to new location and see if without the extra spicy if the good has any flavor. My spicy tolerance is high but this Chinese food was Thai spicy.
