Nestled in the industrial/working class section of East Newark this is a great little find. All the traditional Portuguese dishes with great sangria. We sat in the bar area so it's tight and lively. You look out at the small parking lot to see the incredible take-out business they have but the main dining room is quieter. The bar area has a constantly ringing phone which isn't answered and must be connected to someone taking those take-out orders; you have to overlook that. Lots of locals and out of towners. We'd go back.
