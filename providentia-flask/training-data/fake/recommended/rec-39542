I so love the food!  BUT last night was what really pushed me to review.  I get there with a friend 30 min before the kitchen closes and HUSSAIN, yep I am mentioning your name, accomadated us immediately.  PLUS it was BYOB which is a PLUS PLUS PLUS.  I got the chicken shawarma (a little spicy, full of cumin and cinnamon and other yummy spices) platter w/ babaganoush and the mujadarah (very heavy since it is a grain but very nutty because of the lentils) .  I am from indian decent so the spices are pretty similar I LOVED it. For those of you who are complaining of the blandness of the food, STOP and think for just a moment......THINKING.....THINKING... well most of the customers are american/caucasians (and way older)  and they usually like to salt there own food RIGHT! yes RIGHT so please just shhsss and stop complaining... the neighborhood is full of caucasians. OK back to the great description.  So we stayed after closing while they cleaned the kitchen and Hussain was just amazing in telling us to stay.  My friend and I finished our bottle of wine (Merlot Hob Nob, which is so yum) and was given baklava on the house.   So now about the baklava.  I once had a horrible experience w/ this dessert BUT last night it was just so great!  They bring it out warm and NOT drenched in honey, just enough.  The flavor was amazing not too sweet, a little salty which I shockly loved and of course ROSE WATER! I :::heart::: rose water.  BTW try their rice pudding which also has rose water.   I so want to go to Wafa's like right now and I was just there yesterday.... PS they will start serving wine in about a mth.  Hope they get something special for the wine selections.
