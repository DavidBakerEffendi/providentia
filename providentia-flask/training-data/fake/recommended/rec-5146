The food was really good- fatty brisket very flavorful and the ribs- soooo good.  Smoked the way they should be with a real texas dry rub.   Lean, fall off the bone, tender- you don't feel gross after eating them like some places around here.  They actually reminded me exactly of the ribs I get when visiting the in-laws in texas.  Mac & cheese and slaw were good, collards were very vinegar-y but still good.  Sadly they were out of the green-bean casserole, which was disappointing (it was also only 6:00 at night and not yet full when we ordered).  Our server was super friendly and checked on us a lot, but the kitchen or someone forgot our mac & cheese and we had to ask for it.  It's a cute spot and had nice out-door seating, I would absolutely go back.  Maybe a little expensive for bbq, but not terrible.
