This place is delish!  Seriously, as Greg G said in an earlier review, it looks like a hole in the wall, but once you go inside, it is adorable.  It has a very homey feel.  The wait staff is really nice and helpful (ask for Nolan he's great- my friends have been here twice and are obsessed with him).  Have the Sangria!  The white and the regular are both amazing!  The combos are good, there were six or so of us there and we all did combos and loved them.  I had a Chicken Tostada (not my favorite thing but not bad), Cheese Enchilada and bean burrito.  The latter two were delicious and the sauces were outstanding.  All in all, a really nice experience, and a great place for Mexican food!
