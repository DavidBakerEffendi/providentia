Ok I must be in the minority here but I think the food at White Dog is gross.  My boyfriend and I went for lunch.  I had the steak salad and he had the veggie burger - and neither of us liked our food.  The lettuce in the steak salad had wilted and the meat was way overcooked.  Not to mention the fact that my food had NO TASTE.  I was really disappointed considering it's supposed to be a University City staple.   However, the ambiance is great.  I love the rooms and the cozy feel.  Unfortunately, the food needs a LOT of work.
