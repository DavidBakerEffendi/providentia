This place is rad & I would definitely recommend it. 1 star for: A diverse menu. It's small (which is typical for restaurants in The Burg) but it has something for everyone (i.e. vegetarian, seafood, poultry & steak). 1 star for: Affordable prices. This part of Williamsburg is filled with actual working class young professionals (opposed to the north side of unemployed blogger trust funders) so a good value is important. We had 2 appetizers & 2 main courses and it wasn't over $40. The dish sizes are legit & you can tell that each one is made by someone that loves good/authentic food. 1 star for: BYOB. This saves you so much money. I'm a big fan. 1 star for: Cozy atmosphere with a timeless interior. The only reason why it didn't get 5 stars is because the wait staff seemed very inexperienced. They were extremely nice but lacked confidence. I know that over time, this issue will naturally get corrected as this place gets busier. One piece of advice that I would give Testo is to market itself to the surrounding neighborhood. Get grassroots & put your menu in doors around the area or host a block party of some type. Someone wouldn't even known that they existed if they didn't walk by it. Â Also, pay the extra expense & spring for a decent menu. Most people judge a restaurant by their menu itself. The Word doc menu looks ghetto & does not do this place justice. Overall, we will be back for sure.
