Wishing Well is the bar around the corner, and I love it for that. I have been coming here since they opened, and just ate here for the first time last night. The burger I had was amazing! And I'm a fry fan, they were really good too. They have a good beer & wine list, and the waitstaff and owner (who is there all the time) are super nice and friendly. We always go there to watch the Phillies games, and this is a great bar for sports. Sure.. the music is a little cheesy, but what do you expect? I like that I can just go here, chill out, and not deal with some of the other nearby neighborhood bars :)
