This small popular cafe serves decent food at reasonable prices. They also have a nice bar and a good wine list, both by the bottle and by the glass. I had the Penne Pecorino, which is penne past with sea scallops, shrimp, plum tomatoes, spinach, roasted garlic, and pecorino romano cheese in a white wine sauce. It was tasty and worth the price. My wife and daughter shared a seasonal special of pumpkin gnocchi with roasted wild boar. I sampled it and liked it but they thought the boar overpowered the pumpkin gnocchi. The restaurant is one of several owned by the Momo family which also has bakeries, so the bread here is excellent.
