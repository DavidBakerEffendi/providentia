I have been living in the west haven/orange area for about a 6 months now, and I'm relieved to say that thanks to my fellow yelpers, I've now found my go-to Chinese food spot. Ever since moving from New Haven, I have been striking out with Chinese restaurants in the area. I decided to expand my search out into the boston post road when I was in that area and hungry for takeout. The reviews for Shanghai Gourmet were stellar, and after trying their food, there's no surprise why. I ordered the General tsaos with pork fried rice and boneless spare ribs. My food was prepared quickly and it was reassuring to know it would be fresh. Moreover, the staff could not have been friendlier. I even forgot my soda in the cooler on the way out and the woman at the register came running out to flag me down. The fried rice was some of the best I've had in a while. The general tsaos was juicy and tasted like real chicken, which is always a plus, and the ribs had a nice grilled char that you don't see often (my preference). The egg rolls were phenomenal and the food coma was real. Shanghai Gourmet was a very nice find, and I owe it to the thorough and honest reviews of the previous yelpers. According to their menu, they deliver, so I'm looking forward to seeing if they'll make the 10 minute drive to West Haven. That being said, if they didn't deliver it would be worth the drive for takeout. Between the reasonable prices and the excellent quality of the food, Shanghai Gourmet has locked themselves in as my second favorite Chinese spot in the state.
