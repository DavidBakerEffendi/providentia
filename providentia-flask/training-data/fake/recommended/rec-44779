5 stars all the way...best romantic date night restaurant in the city.  Theresa was very accommodating in getting us a table for 2 last minute.  I loved every dish we had...the wine was paired perfectly...it was the best date...highly recommend this venue for a warm cozy romantic drinks/dinner...save this place for someone special!!
