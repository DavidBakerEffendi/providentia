GF and I stopped here for a bite for dinner. Waitress was friendly and informative and the food came out fast once we ordered. This is about all that made it 3 stars. I ordered the matzoh ball soup to start and it wasn't the best I've ever had. Very salty. For dinner I opted for the baked Mac and cheese appetizer for my entree and that also left much to be desired. It came out hot and bubbly but the taste just seemed.. Off. GF got the turkey club with avocado mayo. Nothing special - she said it pretty much tasted like a Turkey BLT and couldn't even taste the avocado. Prices were fair for the city but we probably wouldn't be back for dinner - maybe it's just more of a breakfast/lunch place.
