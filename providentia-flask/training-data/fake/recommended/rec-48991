I picked uo dinner to go for the first time tonight. Â I ordered the pastor tacos and since it was taco Tuesday they were 5 for $5. Overall they were pretty tasty. Like other reviewers have suggested the salsa is no joke. I made the mistake of taking a huge bite of salsa Roja and my mouth has not been the same. The mild salsa is definitely do able. Looking forward to trying other things on the menu.
