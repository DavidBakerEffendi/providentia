I came in for dinner on a Friday night and got the buffalo chicken sandwich and fries. The meal was really good and I was all-around satisfied. Unfortunately, on Sunday night I ordered the exact same meal. The sandwich was significantly smaller, came on not-as-good bread, and they forgot the side of blue cheese (or ranch? I wasn't sure). As an extra little treat, I found a sharp piece of metal in my fries.
