Okay, it's not everyday you see a five star review for a restaurant that actually has more than a few reviews so I had to check it out, right? First, this place is very reasonably priced. I'm not a vegan myself but I've been to my share of vegan restaurants and know that even the take-out places skew a little pricier. Anyway, I got a roll, two singles and a bottled water (pretty filling, I thought) for under $12. It was DELICIOUS! And again, not vegan. Not vegetarian. Growing up I used to tell my mother that anything she cooked wasn't really a meal unless it had meat in it. But I didn't feel like I was missing out on anything. The staff was really friendly and helpful too. So when it comes to giving this a star rating, part of me wanted to be a little contrary and say that the seating was too small (three tables) and say four stars but that's really not fair. For the price, the quality and the service, the seating was more or less of little consequence. So, you win this time, Beyond Sushi.
