This modern Japanese restaurant was jammed pack on a saturday night.  Nevertheless, it was easy to get a seat at the bar.  The staff was top rate - friendly, accommodating and quick.  A 20 inch television makes bar seating enjoyable.  The back room was spacious and inviting with a large canvass hanging from the back wall.  One complaint is the space between the bar seats and the tables behind the bar.  The staff bumped into the bar patrons a couple times (lightly).  This was far from a serious disturbance.  My roll was Tasty.  Maybe it could have used a little bit more spicy tuna but when the rest of the experience was so enjoyable, who really cares.  Check this place out!
