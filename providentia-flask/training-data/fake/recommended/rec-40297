I REALLY wanted to like this place; I haven't had good falafel since I left New Jersey about three months ago and I'm a falafel addict.  I seriously am in LOVE with whoever came up with mashing up chick peas, seasoning it, and frying it.  I had an interview in Burlington and was excited that there were a few places that made falafel (I live in Springfield, no chance of a falafel joint around me).  Ravenous after my never-ending interview, I walked to Ahli Baba's about 3:30 for lunch.  I know one guy rated it as the worst falafel he'd ever eaten (I was hoping Ahli Baba had had an off day when he came in or we had different tastes when it came to falafel), I wouldn't rate it as the WORST, but it does come in second behind the falafel I tried at a mall food-court (I was so excited to see falafel on the menu after not having it for three months, that I ordered it without asking myself if I really wanted falafel from a mall food-court...) I liked the open-air, small restaurant as soon as I walked in and the guy behind the counter was nice and helpful.  I paid $9 for my falafel wrap and side of pakora (they were out of samosas).  I noticed first that the falafel wasn't golfball sized or shaped, not that they have to be uniform, but these were more like falafel blobs.  As I bit into it and realized how soft and mushy it was inside, I realized the falafel probably wasn't firm prior to frying it, hence the blobs.  The outside of the falafel, though, was hard and way too crunchy, like it was burnt.  I didn't know you could burn fried foods, but you can and it doesn't taste good.  So the outside way too hard, the inside way too soft.  Then, the tzatziki was completely bland and flavorless, too....Strike three, you sorely disappointed me, Ahli Baba :-( Oh and it was SO salty, 6 hours after lunch, my mouth still feels like the Sahara...I guess strike 4
