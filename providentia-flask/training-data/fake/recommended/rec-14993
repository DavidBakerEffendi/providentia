After watching an episode of Man vs. Food and seeing the famous Roast Pork and Broccoli Rabb sandwich, we decided to bookmark it and head down to Reading Terminal for lunch. When we got there the line wasn't too bad, but there was one. I'm glad we did, because it was one of the best sandwiches I ever had. Roast Pork on a soft bagette with sauteed broccoli rabb on top and just the flavor of the juices from the meat. That's it and it was absolutely perfect. yelp.com/biz_photos/IWHdâ€¦ I really can't get over how good this was and we split one huge footlong sandwich, so it goes to show you that you don't have to pay top dollar to get the top sandwich.
