I just want to say thank you to Goodfellas and their staff who always treat me like a star when I visit. They are very attentive, remember a name and face and make your personal experience one to remember. Recently I called them on Thanksgiving Day to see if my family and I (16 people) could come in the next 15 minutes because another restaurant (1 block down) had kept us waiting for over 50 minutes to seat us with a reservation that I had booked back in October. Without hesitation they had us come right over and set up the table for us within 10 minutes including complimentary bruschetta. The staff was awesome and the meal was delicious. Special thanks to Franco,Bruno and Mychal. They are awesome.
