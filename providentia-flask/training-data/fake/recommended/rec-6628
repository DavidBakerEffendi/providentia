The food was amazing. We waited (no joke) for 1.5 hours. We went at 6:30 (which is super early by NY standards) and didn't get seated until 8pm. I drank sake at the bar while waiting. We got the cucumbers (one of the most delicious things I've ever had!), grilled shishito peppers, chicken kara-age, shrimp buns (only ok), pork buns (WTH! the best pork buns EVER!) and we each had a bowl of ramen. I got the classic. It was good. A bit rich for me, but I know that this is how it's done traditionally. And although I was getting a little bit grumpy, it was worth the wait. The food was good. Too bad I felt like such a piggie walking out of that place...I waddled out.
