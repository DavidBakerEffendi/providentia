I suppose the first thing one would notice, is that the entire interior of the restaurant has been redecorated. Its new appearance is upscale, fresh, and bright. The staff is attentive, but never intrusive. The selection of sushi, although adequate, was very nicely made and of only the freshest ingredients. I should be fair, to note that we went at lunch, and not at dinner time, when the selection of sushi would have been more varied. The soups were all well made, and none of them were thickened or gloppy. At every type of cuisine, I apply a go to dish. This test, is always a good indicator of the quality of food. My go to dish at an Asian buffet is fried calamari. At Ichiban, the fried calamari was exceptional! The inside was tender and moist, and the outside was a thin flour Â coating which was neither over spiced nor oversalted. It was very refreshing to go to an Asian buffet, where the fried calamari was not done up in a thick batter or a thick layer of bread crumbs. What I also found exciting, on the buffet table was something called hibachi beef. These cubes of tender marinated beef were offered with peppers and onions all of which were absolutely fresh. I recommend it highly. This was a real surprise, given that the restaurant opened about 2 or 3 weeks late. It was definitely worth the wait!
