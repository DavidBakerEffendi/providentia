The place is extremely welcoming and the time spent there approaches solid 5 stars, however the price/quality relation is overall average. I understand demand-based pricing but $70+ dinner is very pricey under any circumstances, even if the food would have made my brain twice as big and would've been served by naked Donald Trump...Either way, this is the closest review to five starts I've ever written, if your pocket can afford the place. Great for dates, too.
