I just love this place. Usually go for their brunches, but this time we went for a regular breakfast, since it wasn't as crowded. The brioche french toast was the best and great eggs Benedict. Try the cappuccino instead of the regular coffee. Grab a fresh bread on the way out and walk the streets, MoMA store is right across the street for some very nice gifts.
