The best pizza in the Princeton area. Not only are the slices absolutely delicious, they are rather large and cheaper than other joints in the area (Nassau St). 3 specialty slices were $10.50, while over $11 at any other place. You're not saving a whole lot but it goes a long way if you love pizza the way I do. They have quite a few specialty slices sitting out - go for the white with ricotta. To die for. The best I've had in quite some time. They have a lot of room to sit down and eat
