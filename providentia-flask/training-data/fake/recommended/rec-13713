The best Breakfast Ever!!! My brother and I went to Clinton St. Baking Company for my birthday on an early Wednesday morning and it was packed! I waitied about 45 mins for a table of 2! which sucked but it really didnt bother me cause well if u want to have great food in NYC you will have to wait!!! I had the Brioche French Toast which cames with Caramelized Bananas, roasted pecans and maple butter! Mmmm I am not much of a nut fan so I had my french toast without them. They were GREAT!!! the banana were so good warm with a sweet caramel over the toast. the french toast were so Deliciou! My brother Country Breakfast with eggs, ham steak, hash browns, and biscuit and let me tell u that was some piece of steak ham huge!!! The eggs were great and hash browns. the biscuit was warm and what u should expect of a hearty breakfast. I will definitely be goin back!!!
