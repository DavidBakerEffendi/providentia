GREAT CASUAL FRENCH RESTAURANT. A friend of mine is a big fan of this restaurant and I'd heard a lot about it from her, I asked my husband to arrange the mother's day brunch there. Very casual, friendly ambiance. We brought our 2 daughters, 12 and 9, and had no issues.  There were other families with babies and younger kids also. I ordered pancakes with poppy seeds, which were delicious.  Light, airy texture, not too sweet (this is very important to me), and very tasty. My husband and daughters are heavy eaters - they ordered steaks and egg benedict, and they were equally satisfied.  The girls happily completed the meal with 3-scoop chocolate ice cream. The waiter was very attentive, and we were never left with empty water glasses. My friend says that their french toast is great, too.  So the next time I'll try that. Oh, and the next door is a balloon store, that carries many fun stuff.  You may as well want to check it out:) Highly recommended.
