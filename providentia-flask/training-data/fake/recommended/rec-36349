I am usually not a huge fan of Bibimbap because they are all the same, but this one is different.  The veggie was indeed very very fresh and for once I enjoyed my Bibimbap so much I wanted another one.  If I'm rating solely on the BBB, I'd give 5 stars. The service is very friendly and nice.  The price is great too.  So what took 1 star away?  The Japchae.  It's oh so very oily.  I ordered take out. By the time I walked back to the office (5 min walk), I saw oil all over the bottom of the bag and I couldn't figure out why.  After I finished the BBB and took out the Japchae, ah hah!!  As I poured the Japchae in the BBB container, I saw oil pouring along with it and still a ton left in the tiny original container.  I couldn't stand it and slid a paper towel under the noodle.  The entire sheet was soaking and there was still more oil around...
