Came here for a late afternoon beer and snack. Sat at the bar. Service was a bit spotty, but they were changing shifts. The fantastic beer selection and food made up for it. We got some hill farmstead on tap and shared a veggie burger. The veggie burger was so flavorful and it was honestly one of the best burgers I've had (and I'm not a vegetarian). Fries were crispy and perfectly seasoned. Would definitely frequent this place if we lived closer!
