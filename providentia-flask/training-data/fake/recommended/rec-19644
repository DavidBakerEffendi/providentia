We happened into Sabor Unido accidentally and could not have been more lucky. Friendly service and authentic deliciously prepared cuisine. The steak picana and the garlic shrimp were amazingly good and flavorful. The side dishes all delicious and authentic. This was the best and most true Brazilian food you can find north of the Equator. We highly recommend this friendly family owned restaurant. Not only that the prices cannot be beat!! Highly recommend!!!
