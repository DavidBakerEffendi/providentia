I have a  great time every time I come here.  Downstairs is great for  chilling with a few beers  between friends (love the color-changing lights embedded in the tables, ditto for the pool tables) and upstairs has one of the most kickass setups for shows in Philly.   Every show I've seen here has been pretty epic. The bartenders are friendly and attentive.  The beer selection is pretty good, and the food is excellent.  Try the eggplant sandwich!
