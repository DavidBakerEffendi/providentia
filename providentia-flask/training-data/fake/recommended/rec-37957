I really wanted a florentine bagel, it is baked with cheese and spinach in the middle, but they didn't have it. So I settled for the sourdough. It disappointed, I wanted to taste the sourness. As for customer service, I think they were overwhelmed. It is move in day at the university, so I think today is the first day they have been open this semester. My iced chai tea was the first one that my server has ever made, it could use less of the flavoring, but is still fairly good. With a few weeks under their belt, I think they would be pretty good.
