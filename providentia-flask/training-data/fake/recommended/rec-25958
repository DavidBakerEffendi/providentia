This place is awesome, great food, great ambience, and great service.  The food is delicious and authentic, went today for dinner and I am definitely going back.  Andrew who I think is the manager of the place is absolutely amazing, he made us feel welcomed and grateful for walking into the place.  Definitely recommend anyone and everyone to check this place out.
