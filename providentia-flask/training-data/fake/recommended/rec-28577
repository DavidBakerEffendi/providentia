I don't even know where to begin. I don't live anywhere near Hu Kitchen but I somehow manage to get there several times a week. Delicious organic food, great prices and super friendly staff. One of my favorite places in NY. Favorites: the Rosenberg smoothie (maca, kale, banana, blueberries, almond butter), the moroccan chicken, butternut squash soup, the list goes on... Hoping Hu opens other locations around the city soon :)
