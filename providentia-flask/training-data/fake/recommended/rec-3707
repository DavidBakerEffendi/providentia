The Roast Pork sandwich is as good as advertised! I got it with provolone and broccoli rob on it. Spectacular. The line was wrapped around the corner...a solid 45 min wait at least...but a local guy was sitting on a bar stool and said the best thing to do is not wait on the line at all and just try to scoop up a couple of bar stools if you don't mind eating right there. GREAT TIP.
