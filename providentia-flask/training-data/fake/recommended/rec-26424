Super busy and packed on weekends. Yummy real Korean food. Caters mostly to a Korean crowd, which makes sense since it's in the absolute heart of Koreatown. I happened to work on this block, which is how I discovered it! Handmade dumplings and the delicious curry soondubu are my favorites, have yet to try the samgyupsal. Great appetizers, but watch out for the fish bones if you aren't used to tackling a whole fish, head included. They also have very chunky large kimchi and I tend to like the chopped up smaller pieces, but that's a matter of taste. No desserts, but the block has multiple options for post-prandial sweets (Pinkberry and two French-Korean bakeries). Fun and tasty spot for lunch - I recommend also checking out some of the other lovely places on 32nd between 5th and Broadway if you happen to eat at BCD Tofu House!
