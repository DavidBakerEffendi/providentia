So if you agree that service plays into your experience this is why I only am giving El Vez 4 stars.   Went in to cho down after work on Friday(For those of you who dont know choing down is getting nachos after work with co workers or bros)  For more info check out chosb4hos,wordpress.com.  We were promptly sat as we had a reservation.  We were only ordering Nachos and Margaritas!  Delicious, like out of this world loveeeeed the Nachos!  And the Margs were good also.  We were not given chips and salsa like every other table.  This really grinded my gears.  Was it because we did not order entrees?  I mean a $30 pitcher of margs does not constitute some complimentary chips and salsa?!  Our sever really didn't have the time of day for us and I dont believe it was because he was busy, I believe it was because we did not order entrees.  I get it dude you work off of tips.  We are going to tip 20 % and we are not gonna sit at you table all night long.  Its 5 p.m. bro you have plenty of time to wait more tables and make more money.  I am here for some nachos and Margs, i know what I want and I place my order upon greet.  Get over it. Sooo overall I just had some service issues, everything else was fab!  The atmosphere, a bit loud but not too loud for me.  I would recommend trying this place for sure and I would definitely go back for an entree in the future!  Maybe even sit outside when the weather is nice!
