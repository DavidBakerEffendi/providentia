After a busy day of playing tourist at Coney Island my parents and I wanted to head out for dinner at a nice Italian establishment in Little Italy.  Luckily our family friend lives in Lower Manhattan and suggested going to Rubirosa.  He also called to make a reservation, which was helpful because the restaurant is quaint in a good way. We sat down and ordered a bottle of wine one of the cheapest ones on the menu but was good.  Afterwards we got a pizza to share for the table.  The pizza was very good an up-scale version of New York style.  After our pizza we were ready to order our entrees.   I decided upon the potato gnocchi which is one of my go to meals at higher end establishments because it is so good!  My dad settled for the rigatoni and our friend decided on the black and white tagliatelle.  The gnocchi was really good, I finished the whole thing.  The portion was also a decent size.   Afterwards we shared two deserts for the table which were good one being the seasonal cobler. I enjoyed the food and atmosphere at Rubirosa the only thing is I wish they would have been playing some Andrea Bochelli or someone similar playing throughout the restaurant.
