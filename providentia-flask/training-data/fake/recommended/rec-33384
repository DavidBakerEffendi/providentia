Found this place by accident once again. Was supposed to go somewhere else but that the wait was 2 hrs so my friend and I decided to leave. We drove around for a bit and found Piccoli Trattoria. Just wanted to sa the food was delicious... That calamari salad is to die for! There's not much to say only that it's a must try! The food tasted like authentic Italian food (not that I've ever been to Italy :-/) Loved it and will be bringing all my friends. I went on a friday evening and it was packed so you like your space try going during the weekday.
