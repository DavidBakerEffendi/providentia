It does not suck! In fact nothing about this place sucks! From the the food, the GM Wilson, to the staff, it even Â has great cocktails & sangria, nothing sucks! In fact everything is great, amazing prices & its open 24hrs. The best diner in NYC for sure, Latin style. The only thing that might suck about this place, is if you have to wait for a seat because it is too busy, because it does not suck!
