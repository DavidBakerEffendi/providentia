Easy going local sammich joint. And by sammich I actually mean panini. Grilled, crispy, melty, yum. Â  I've had several flavor mixes of panini's in different price ranges and they're usually good with the guts of the sandwich....however, popped in this afternoon on my day off and there wasn't much for substance within the crisp shell. Kinda on the super thin side. When there is a single slice of meat on your sandwich, you know it's cheap, but come on!? One slice? Bummer. Generally, a good go-to place for ease, convenience & a soft smile from the staff.
