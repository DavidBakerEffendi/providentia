We almost passed this place up since you have to go down a flight of stairs to reach the real entrance.  The place is small and very busy, but they try to accommodate parties of all sizes as best they can.  On the night I visited, they crammed 13 people into a space meant for 8, so we got real cozy with the people in the neighboring tables.  It can get a little hot and stuffy down there, but it has a great atmosphere for a group of friends.  If there are a lot of you, try to go early.
