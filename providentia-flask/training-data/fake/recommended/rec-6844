This place is so great: the serviceis delightful, the ambiance is dreamy. But neither of those things compare to how good the food is. The artichoke stew makes my heart sing! It is quite evident that the quality and freshness of the food trumps the other major players in the neighborhood. The time to go is now, before it gets too crowded with long waits.
