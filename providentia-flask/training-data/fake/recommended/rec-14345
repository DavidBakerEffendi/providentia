This place hits the spot. This is my 2nd time eating here and I had to make sure I came back to scarf down this amazing dish. I ordered the combination plate with lamb and chicken. The orange thin rice is soft and goes perfectly with the meat. The white sauce I drench over everything and take it easy on the hot sauce. If you put too much hot sauce, you may regret it. This is a MUST eat place whenever I visit New York. It gets a ton of great reviews for a reason. If you come late you probably won't have to wait in any line. I love the halal guys cart. Recommendation: Combination platter.
