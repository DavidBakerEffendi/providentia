Great food, lovely ambiance. The most memorable dishes for me was the duck breast, the rhubarb sauce was such a great compliment.  The burrata with sea salt was also amazing.  I only have great things to say about the other dishes we tried as well.  The only downside is that it is so far West - but that is a lazy New Yorker's point of view. =) I would troop it back to this spot for sure and also check out their roof top lounge.
