This was my first visit to this place and I am glad it has already re-opened. I see that they made improvements... good for them... Now... my food order was the honey dipped fried chicken.  I would recommend this dish for people with a sweet tooth. I actually liked the tenderness of the chicken, but the honey was a bit too much for me. I think I would go with good old standard friend chicken next time. I ordered the mac and cheese plus the yams and they were GREAT!  I loved the yams.  The corn bread was good too.   The place could benefit from a spruce up.... but other than that I would return. Food: 4.5 Service: 5 Ambiance: 3.5 (this place has potential and make the experience for the customer a little more grand) Cost: 4 Overall: 4
