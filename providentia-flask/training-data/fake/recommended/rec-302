I think the best part of this place is the atmosphere -it is dark and swanky- with a Huge glittering gold chandelier in the middle of the room. Also it can be fun to host birthday parties here because the place is decorated so elegantly. However the food falls short,-- the curry is a bit watered down, the noodles (pad se ew, room service pad thai) is way too sweet for my palate, and the summer roll was very plain. The service is pretty good though and the food comes really quickly so 3 stars.
