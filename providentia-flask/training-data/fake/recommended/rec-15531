Went here with my girlfriend and had a really nice experience. The hosts are friendly and good humored. The dining room is very loud so I was glad they sat us in the back room which has an open roof and stucco walls. The ambiance and lighting are great and you it feels like you are in a Tuscan garden. We had a flat foccacia which was split in half and filled with creamy robiola cheese and black truffle. Very good and full of umami from the truffles. The grilled calamari with frisee, arugala and yellow and red grape tomatoes was fabulous. They somehow had a very light breading but were cooked on the grill Â to perfection. The super fresh salad was the perfect compliment. I had the tagliatelle with veal ragu. The sauce was good but I felt the pasta could have been cooked a bit more. She had the sea scallops wrapped in prosciutto. Delicious if not a tad overdone. That could have been from the dish being so piping hot. Overall, a great place for a date or a romantic dinner. Sit in the back garden if you can.
