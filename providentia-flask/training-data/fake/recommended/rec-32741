Love love love this adorable place! The crepes are to die for! My favorite is the mixed berry sweet cream cheese. They're the perfect size, well priced and always delicious! The coffee is great as well! You feel like you step into a Parisian bakery when you walk into la petite france! I will be coming back here regularly and am so glad I live 5 minutes from this gem!
