I'm confused how this place has such phenomenal reviews. The staff is great, and the ambience is cute - but the food is bland and nothing exciting. The cornbread with bacon and jalape√±os was okay, but I've had better cornbread in a diner. The marrow bones honestly was flavorless. The $76 Rib Eye meal for two was not as much food as you should have gotten for such a price. The potatoes were good, but the cauliflower was dry and the rib eye had so much toppings you couldn't taste the steak, and it just was so bland. Top that off with 3 beers and for a bill of $120 for only 2 people and no dessert - way over priced boring bland food. Won't be going there again!
