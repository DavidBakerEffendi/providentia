I've been shopping here since I moved to New Haven 3 months ago and was always impressed with how friendly and helpful the staff was. I shopped there recently and was overcharged $300 for $30 groceries. This caused my bank account to overdraft but the cashier was completely unsympathetic or apologetic. They "refunded" me the difference but the next day, I still hadn't been refunded. When I went back to speak to a manager, it turned out the cashier WAS the manager and she was equally rude to me as the day before. I won't be shopping there again. Luckily there's a few corner markets on the same street.
