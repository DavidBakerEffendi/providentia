I was so excited to try an authentic Philly cheesesteak and spent the entire ride from the airport thinking about a sandwich overflowing with meat, peppers, onions and cheese "wiz," but I was disappointed when it turned out to be more roll than anything else. Very skimpy on the filling, I barely needed a napkin. I was also put off by the "this is America, please order in English" sign in their window. I only speak English, but would expect more hospitality and less blatant hostility from a Â  place so dependent on visits from tourists from all over. If I had noticed the sign before I ordered, I would've taken my business across the street to Pat's.
