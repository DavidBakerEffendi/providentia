I met some friends here, to watch the Brazil-Camaroon World Cup game.  They had the game on several screens and a good time was had by all. The pizza was delicious, the mixed drinks were excellent, and the staff was friendly and attentive.  I will be back, for the welcoming atmosphere, and great  pizza, even when there is no special event to view.
