Normally, I'd give Artichoke something higher than a 1 star review, but after a recent really bad experience there, I can't.   Late last Saturday night, my friends and I stopped for a slice of pizza there.  Big line, as always.  There was also a lot of unpleasant drama with some douche-bag skipping line and then some girl and guy trying to convince him of what a horrible person he was for doing that (he was directly behind me and didn't budge as far as I could tell).  I'm too old to stand in line with a bunch of drunk idiots, but, we committed to getting a slice ... so, finally, when we get up there, my friend orders 3 slices for us to make it easier for the workers.  Almost immediately, he gives us our margarita slices in a box. In a mad dash to get the f*ck out of there, we rushed away.  We headed for the train before opening the box - lo and behold, we realized that the Artichoke workers hadn't bothered to warm our slices. Seriously, they were ice cold.   If it wasn't for all the drunk idiots and long line, I would have returned and demanded my money back.  I don't care how busy a place is, there is absolutely NO excuse to serve people who have been waiting in line that long cold pizza. They really should be embarrassed for such poor service. I will never return to this overhyped dump. Honestly, the pizza isn't all that anyway. The artichoke slices are so rich they make you sick.
