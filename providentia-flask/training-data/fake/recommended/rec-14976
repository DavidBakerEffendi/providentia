Was here for dinner with a friend and we had a great time. Nice, small, vibrant place,where you can see the kitchen at work,from virtually any seat. Its a BYO so keeps the price down to an extent. However, you get what you pay for. Large portions of delicious italian. Our appetizers were delicious and perfect for sharing. Followed by our Entrees that were filling and enough to bring home. The service was very attentive and made sure we were taken care of. Not a bad thing to say. Will definitely be back and would recommend this place to anyone looking for fine italian in the city.
