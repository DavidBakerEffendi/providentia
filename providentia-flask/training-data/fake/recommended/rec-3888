NiNi's has just remodeled so it now serves food beyond French with a decent wine list.  This means there are plenty of delicious options but probably not BYO anymore.  They do have some decent $6 & $8/glass wine options and plenty of wines by the bottle at decent prices.  Food is a little steep for small plates but good.  I had a bacon salad.  My friend enjoyed the Caesar Salad.  The special rissotto with shrimp and asparagus was good but overcooked (rice didn't have a hint of crunchiness).  It was SUPER quiet for a Thursday night.  We were one of only two parties the entire evening.  The decor is nice and I'd figure this place would be hopping.  Definitely worth a visit though it pays to know your wines since the server isn't really up on their wine list yet.
