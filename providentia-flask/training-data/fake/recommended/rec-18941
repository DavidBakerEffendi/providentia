Food was AMAZING. I had the Fish Ceviche (so bright & delicious) and the Pescado Â a lo Macho (wow, seriously, wow). I knock off a star for several reasons: the server was short and snippy which was a buzz kill. I get the whole romantic dark vibe but the whole place seemed pitch dark except for the illumination from the candles. Kinda ridiculous, felt like I was in a cave at times.
