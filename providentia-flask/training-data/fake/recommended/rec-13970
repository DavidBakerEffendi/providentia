Was expecting overhyped, overpriced and overrated. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised. Probably the best balls you will ever eat! A few tips: 0. Expect a wait (we waited an hour- good area to walk around though). 1. Mark your orders on the menu using the handy markers set on the side 2. Order a carafe of Sangria (plenty for one, modest for two) 3. Naked Balls are probably the best way to go. Spicy Pork and Mushroom gravy= winning combo (super moist and flavorful)! Chicken and Parmesan cream comes a close second. 4. Convulse with happiness. Perhaps cry for a bit (in happiness, of course). 5. Cool down with the Caramel Ice Cream (the Ice Cream Cookie Sandwich sounds good in theory but the ice cream hardens the cookie quickly) The best ball experience ever!
