The food was very good and right on point. I had to wait a little extra than most chinese restaurants but it's because they have such a high demand so that's not really a complaint, it shows they are just overwhelemed by their success. Although it's chinese, it doesn't taste like the typical chinese food restaurant, it's not greasy and it's right on point.
