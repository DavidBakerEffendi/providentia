I had a great time here. It is right up my alley. Local Williamsburg kids enjoying a Tuesday night. The food is really creative and fun and not to mention it was very good. I wish I would have ordered what my friend did...the fried clams. They were delish! The server was really friendly and I just really like the "small country kitchen" feel to it with a little Brooklyn thrown in. I will totally go back!
