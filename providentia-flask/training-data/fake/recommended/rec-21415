Decent (and much needed) wood-fired pizza in an otherwise desolate food wasteland. We tried the antipasti dish of the day and were very happy with the sampling of items--marinated olives, butternut squash, beets, roasted cauliflower, and potato and leek frittata. For our pies, we ordered the margherita and mushroom--although we ate the margherita and sausage, since the hasty waiter switched our order, but we really didn't mind since we were deciding earlier between the sausage and mushroom anyway. The pies were fresh, doughy, unique, and satisfying, but also quite forgettable. Wait staff was attentive and friendly. Decor was cool. They seem to have a very vegan-friendly menu for those who subscribe to that kind of lifestyle. We went during their soft opening so the place should be getting better day by day, and will make a fine addition to the Spring Garden Street corridor. Mangia!
