After a late movie, L and I needed to find a place that was still open, I remembered how popular this halal cart was. The line was really long and L really didn't wanna wait, but I managed to convince him. It really wasn't worth the wait. We shared the chicken and gyro combo. The meat, alone, was not very flavorful. The portions are great though, enough for 2. The red sauce was the best part. Extremely hot, so painful...but in a good way. The white sauce is creamy, yet bland. I've had better halal in my own neighborhood. Maybe I have to be drunk to enjoy it... Â Oh well, at least it was only $6.
