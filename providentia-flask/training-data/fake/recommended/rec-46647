So the 20th Street Falafel Nazi cart guy has been missing for the past few weeks so I had to find an alternative for this craving! I decided to try Mamas out and it was pretty good. I'm not a vegetarian, but the food was solid. For someone who loves meat, this was surprisingly shocking that it was good enough for me to come back a few times. i've ordered the large falafel sandwich and lankes. Very good combo!
