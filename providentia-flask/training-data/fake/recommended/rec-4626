Overall, I think I would have given a 3.5 if I could have.  I had a ribs dinner that was pretty good.  The ribs were nice and tender, but the sauce was just grease.  The potato salad was very good, although I had a couple of large pieces of potato that were not completely cooked.  But the greens were good.  Not great, but good. The cake was a box mix, which is actually pretty common at soul food restaurants in Connecticut.   Always disappointing, yet not surprising. Also the customer service was pretty crappy - the woman who put my food into the styrofoam containers was way more into the television show than being remotely helpful.  But sometimes you get what you pay for and the food was fairly inexpensive.
