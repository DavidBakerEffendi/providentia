I used to really dig this place when it first opened for business but Peaches HotHouse may have just lost me as a customer after what I experienced today. Cold food, loose, lumpy grits and scatterbrained waitresses who didn't take our orders until almost 20 minutes after we were seated. The lipstick stains on our drinking glasses were a HUGE 'minus.' Peaches HotHouse needs to worry less about crowd control & more about good service. This restaurant is smaller than most of the apartments in The Stuy. How hard can it be to run it properly?
