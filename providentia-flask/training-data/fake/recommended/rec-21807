Lovely and colorful space with postcards and knickknacks filling every available space, apart from the windows.  The food was less interesting than the decor.  Everything was good but nothing special.  I'd give a half star extra for a very good nicoise salad, but the rest of the food was three stars.  I got the assiette de pates (pate plate) which had potted duck meat and a couple of different kinds of pate.  Nothing really jumped out at me as being especially delicious.  My dining companion got an unremarkable veggie crepe and my beer wasn't very cold.   The price of $45 (before tip) seemed a bit high for a salad, two entrees, a beer and a coke.  So overall "meh". Go here if you are standing in front of it, you want crepes and don't want to be bothered looking elsewhere.
