I came in here for a drink and wasn't even hungry, when I saw they I had Corvina a lo Macho, a traditional Peruvian dish that for some reasons most Peruvian restaurants don't carry, I had to eat there.  I would give them five stars for this dish alone, but the service and ambiance were great.  the hostess even volunteered to turn down the music a bit after we said requested a table in the back because of the noise.  Highly recommend it.  Please try the Corvina a lo macho!
