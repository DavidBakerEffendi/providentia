This restaurant completely and totally transcends any sort of earthly culinary experience. Seriously. Came for Easter Brunch, and let me tell you...brunch will never again be the same. I have never in my life been able to sit through a 6 course tasting and say I loved every bit- until now! Have had way more expensive tasting that couldn't even touch Bouley. Not to mention the interior is equally as mystical. Bouley is wonderland on earth!
