The best chicken I've ever had. We came here for our anniversary and got the Market Menu and wine pairings. Points for letting me have white instead of red (allergies) and  extra extra points for letting us come in and sit down half an hour before they open for dinner. Our waitress brought us water and a space heater and it was warm, beautiful and romantic. Good times! We also came here with friends for brunch. Equally delicious and very filling, but I think I'll stick with coming here for dinner.  It's not them- it's me, I'm really just not a big brunch person. So when I drop 20 bucks on a meal (so worth it), I really prefer it be for dinner.
