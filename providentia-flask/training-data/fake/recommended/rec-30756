I'm disappointed. Nice atmosphere, and much anticipation waiting for this spot to open. Unfortunately, the $17 Porgy was a letdown. Small portion, definitely needed a side to accompany the tiny fish on my plate - That, and it was a really unattractive cut of meat with a bloody vein at it's center. Then, there was the schnitzel. I mean, gravy or a nice jam would be the appropriate accompaniment, but instead - you get the 'claw.' I'm all for a bit of theatre with my dinner - but not when it replaces basic attention to dinner flavor detail. I don't like to hate, but this was not a great experience. That said, the service was AWESOME and so was the wine. I think there is still hope...but the kinks need attention.
