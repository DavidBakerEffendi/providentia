For the restaurant section, the food has been consistently good each time I've visited. However, I always think about how expensive everything is. While the food is good, I feel as if I could get the same type of food elsewhere for a lesser price. The same goes for their confectionary section - the chocolates are good, but just too expensive. It's a family run business, and I'm happy they have loyal customers. For me, this will have to remain a place for special occasions.
