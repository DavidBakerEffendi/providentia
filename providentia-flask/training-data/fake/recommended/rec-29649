We wanted an old fashioned Italian meal.  This was great. Grandson of the founder joe served us and he couldn't have been better.  I had the spaghetti in white clam sauce. They took the clams out of the shell for me.  All the taste but none of the work!!  My husband had the veal rollatini.  Very tasty. Don't add salt.  Had it with Marsala sauce.   Nephew had the meatballs and he raved. I am a Caesar salad snob and this was one of the best.  Tasted the anchovy but not overpowering.    Awesome fun time.
