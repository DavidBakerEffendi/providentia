Great food! Great atmosphere! First off the place looks so small from the outside, but step through the walkway and you'll find a not so hidden treasure. Very reasonable prices and not too late portions of flavorful food make this a must dine in or outside. The only downside is that the instruments are nearly deafening inside when they sing for someone's birthday.
