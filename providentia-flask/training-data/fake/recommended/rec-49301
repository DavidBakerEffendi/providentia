I was very pleasantly surprised by this restaurant, and definitely will be coming back in the future. The restaurant has a very quaint feel, and I loved the decor; everything seemed bright and clean, and the hand written menu on blackboards added a nice touch to the experience. Some might complain that they don't understand the menu at times because it's written in another language, but the staff was happy to translate when I asked. Service overall was great and very fast; some might not like the large paper numbers they give you to locate your orders, but I didn't really mind them, since it lets them get your food to you quickly. I ordered a small coffee, a side of potatoes, a side of ham, and their egg, avocado, tomato, and horseradish aioli sandwich. My friend opted for a mushroom omelette, which came with a small side salad and a side of potatoes. Overall, the food was fantastic. The coffee was probably better than most of the coffees that I'd had in New Haven; the flavor was strong and bold. Both my friend and I enjoyed the fact that the potatoes were not deep fried but still had a nice kick to them. My ham seemed to be just regular lunch meat ham, but that was okay with me since I only got the ham in order to insert some more protein into my meal. The star of the show for me, though, was the sandwich. The roll was crispy on the outside and perfectly soft on the inside. The creaminess of the avocado was slightly cut by the tomato, and overall the sandwich was rich and luxurious. I would have liked a little more horseradish flavor; unfortunately the aioli at times tasted just like mayo. However, at $4.75 per sandwich, I definitely see myself returning (and they have multiple varieties!).
