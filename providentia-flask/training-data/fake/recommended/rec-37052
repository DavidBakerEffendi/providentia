This is what I'm talkin about right here! This jawn got the best cheesesteak I've had in Philly. Better than all that South Philly stuff. Conveniently close to Broad St. right off Germantown and Erie, you can't miss it. It's plenty of parking in the back. The steak isn't overwhelmed by cheese. It's just perfect, the way it's cut. Put some fried onions, mayo and ketchup on that jawn and you're in the game. Grab you a brewski (OE, Colt 45, whatever you want because the selectionfor about $2-3 and sit down at the bar next door. It's definitely a hood spot and not the most organized but that's not a bad thing. Max's is the place to go!
