When I went to get a burger I was starving. Looked at reviews and figured I could not go wrong. Too bad that was not the case, I got in and waited 5 min to order because there was no one at the register. Once I ordered I had to wait 10 min for a burger and fries. Overall, the truffle burger was way over done and dry, way too done for a medium burger which had no pink. The fries were greasy and did not have any flavor. I have had some great food in Philly, this was not one of them.
