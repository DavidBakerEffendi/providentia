So far so good! The first time I came to this cafe I got a few items to take home with me. Those included the brussels sprouts, sweet potato mash, and asian slaw. While the slaw was a bit spicy for me, I really enjoyed everything else I purchased. I came back the next day and got a bowl with sweet potato mash and the thai chicken on top and fell in love. Everything I have tried thus far is right up my ally - healthy, clean, and mostly gluten-free.
