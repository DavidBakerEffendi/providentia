i've been here a few times for lunch as it is right down the street from where i work... decent selection of meats and sandwich items and the quality of those items is very good, however, they throw the sandwich together so fast and in a way that the folded meats push out any lettuce and tomato, etc. out of the sandwich... and since when does "with everything" not include oil and vinegar?
