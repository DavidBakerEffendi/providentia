I would give this 5 stars if the service had been better, but the food was great! The tacos have their own twist, and are very good even though they are made next to hamburgers and other fare. The food is reasonably priced, the ambiance casual and comfortable, and the servers nice, just very slow. The night we were there, it was not busy, but the staff was standing around talking, and not taking care of customers. Hey, it happens. If you're in the neighborhood, stop by and enjoy!
