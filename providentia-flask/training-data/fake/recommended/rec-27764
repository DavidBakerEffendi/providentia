This is another place that my family and I have been coming to for many years. This deli is an old fashioned Mom and Pop deli owned by two couples. It is a little out of the way for us, but ALWAYS, worth the trip! From the moment you walk in the door you can smell the flavors from all the food they are preparing. It reminds me of a New York deli I went to growing up. They cook their own meats, as well as macaroni and cheese and many other delicious specials daily. They also have many salads that they make right there. Our family's favorites are the Cole Slaw, Macaroni Salad, and the Potato Salads. TRULY DELICIOUS!!!
