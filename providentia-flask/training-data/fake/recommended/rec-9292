Came here for dinner with two girlfriends, and absentmindedly forgot to make reservations. They are able to seat for walk-ins for a table for two, but more than that number you are sent to the bar. That was fine for us -- a little cramped because of all the drinkware they had on the end of the bar, but the service by the bartenders made up for it. Food is great if you like pio pio! Their ceviche mixto is one of my favorites and we had the matador combo. Their chicken is always on point! :) To the bartender who made me those two delicious Piscorinhas a few days ago, I thank you for making my day so much better.
