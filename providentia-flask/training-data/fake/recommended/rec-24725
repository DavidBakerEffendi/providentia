Stopped in here for a quick coffee. This place is so cool and quaint inside. Total coffee addict hangout. I'm far from a coffee snob but I came in early one morning looked over the menu quick and decided on the vanilla snuggle. It was a vanilla latte with cinnamon, whipped cream and a little marshmallow on top! Just enough coffee and sweetness for me.
