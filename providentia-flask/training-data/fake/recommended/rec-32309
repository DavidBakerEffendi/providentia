I'm not sure that I've ever had a better sandwich.  We don't go here enough!  Interesting and flavorful.  Everyone we know loves them.  The cooks are a real treat, too.  Every time we go there, they are entertaining us with stories, or ribbing us in some way.  It's a lot of fun to watch them cook, and even more fun to eat their amazing works of mouth-art!
