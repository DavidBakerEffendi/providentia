I eat here several times a week and the lunch is an amazing bargain. It's $9 for soup or salad and appetizer and a very large entree. The food is some of the best thai I've ever had, however I ordered take out here two weeks ago and the gentleman sent me home with the wrong entree. My wife and I have always ordered the exact same items, however this gentleman insisted that I ordered a different item that I've never had and tried to charge me to correct the order. After nearly 5 minutes of arguing, he finally agreed to take care of the issue, but for a place I regularly dine at, I expect better customer service.
