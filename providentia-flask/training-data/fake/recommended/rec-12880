Came for dinner and service was on point. For appetizers we had jalapeno hummus and chankleesh (feta cheese onion tomato mix). Their pita is amazinggggg so light warm and fluffy! The hummus was pretty good, but wasn't too crazy for the chankleesh. I had the bass for my entree and my friend --the chicken. I cant attest to the chicken but my fish was cooked well and the zucchini was flavorful. Finally for dessert I had a cappucino with their pistachio financier (2 pieces good to share). I would definitely get their cappuccino again. Dessert wasn't too sweet. You can taste the banana in their ice cream (made in house I believe), but the tahini fluff didnt do much for me. I think you're better off with just the ice cream. I deducted a star because its pretty pricey for what it is in terms of food. Atmosphere is a bit nosy but decor very modern and nice. I did appreciate that they never give the check unless u request for it. This is good place to catch up with a friend. I would come again.
