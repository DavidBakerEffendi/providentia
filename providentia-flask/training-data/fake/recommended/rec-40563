After a 1h15m wait for a group of 8, I was elated to be seated. But after the appetizer order, it was at least 20 minutes before the waitress returned to take our orders, and about another half hour before we got the food. Fortunately, the salmon I had was up to par. Not the most rich of flavours, but enough for the starving stomach I after over two hours. Dessert was splendid, though. Highly recommend the banana bread pudding.
