This place is AMAZING! Ordering the lunch special feels like stealing. You get a huge, dinner sized portion for your main course, an appetizer and a salad. All for $6.95, does that even make sense?!? And everything tasted delicious! Also, if you're looking for SHOCKINGLY FAST DELIVERY, this is your place! I placed my order on Seamless and exactly 15 minutes later, I had my food. It was magical! I highly recommend Absolute Thai!
