Went to Catfish for the first time today and really enjoyed it. I ordered the catfish poboy. That sandwich was AWESOME! The seasoning was right, the bread was nice and crispy, the cole slaw was a bonus! Oh and lets not forget those sweet potatoes! By far the best. Â The drinks were not only good but the prices couldn't have been better. The atmospher was just what I expected a neighborhood spot to be: chilled, relaxed, no one in a rush, great prices, and good food n drinks. The wait staff was attentive and friendly. Cant wait to go back!
