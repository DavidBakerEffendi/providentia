I'm going to be scientific about this review. Here's what each element is worth: Food - 50% Atmosphere - 40% Service - 10% FOOD- 3 stars.  It was solid.  Some was stand out. We ordered: - Brussel sprouts - nice flavor, but not caramelized enough. Not enough char on top. - Onion Rings - large size, not greasy, good coating.  However, I would expect the same out of good bar food. - Kale - boring.  It needed more flavor, and I usually love kale.   - Grilled chicken stuffed with crab over mashed potatoes.  Excellent, stand out dish. It was very well prepared. The mashed potatoes were some of the best I have ever tasted.  Super garlicky and creamy, and it was all swimming in this lemon butter sauce.  Took all the healthy right out of it, but man was it good.  We started dipping the kale in the butter sauce :) Personally, I probably would have selected something else with more robust flavor, but for what it was, this dish was flawlessly executed.   ATMOSPHERE - 5 stars It was just the right size, not too big , not too small.  Very cute space.  I loved the decor, and the black leather seating.  Good bar to tables ratio.  GREAT 80s music playing.  This place deserved the special outfit I selected for my trip into williamsburg.   SERVICE - 4 stars Our waitress seemed like she was new (taking drink glasses while we still had a little left, not offering drinks when we sat down), but she was perfectly pleasant and everything came out right, etc.  The bartender was super nice and gave Brian V a taste of some special kind of whiskey.   Ok, so as a weighted average this comes out to 3.9 stars, which I will round to 4.
