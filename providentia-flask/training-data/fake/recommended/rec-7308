Awesome food, but what made me write in was the awesome service.   I'm out to dinner with 4 friends, and 3 of us were cool with family style, but two of us had eating restrictions, so ordered their own thing.  Plates and plates heaping with delicious food come out, and we are chowing down.   After awhile, I notice one of my friends who ordered solo hasn't gotten her dish yet, but they are starting to clean out the kitchen for the night.  I point out the issue to the waiter, and he takes care of it, no problem. Should we have been on top of order more quickly (if only to get some food in our hungry friend)?  Could they have pointed out the order wasn't on the original ticket, that they had cleaned the kitchen for the night, that they couldn't make the dish, that they wanted us to pay and get out so they could go home after a long night?  Yes to all of those things.   But they were polite, got delicious food in my by-then-starving friend, and let us hang around while the closed and cleaned everything else so my friend could finish. Two takeaways - my friend should speak up sooner, and Pig & Khao treats people right.  Much appreciated, will be back.
