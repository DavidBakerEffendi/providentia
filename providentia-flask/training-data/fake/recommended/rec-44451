Just opened on 10/31/14. Great selection of fresh food. Typical Chinese buffet offerings on par with Flaming Grill in East Rutherford but better. I went Saturday night and they served lobster and roast duck. Everything tasted delicious and nothing was greasy. Yummy grilled salmon, grilled portobello mushrooms, and BBQ spare ribs at the Hibachi station. Service was attentive and courteous. The place was bright and clean. Can't beat the price $11.99 for dinner.
