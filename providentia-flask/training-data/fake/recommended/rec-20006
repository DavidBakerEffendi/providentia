My favorite Staten Island restaurant by far...don't bother with the entrees - although delicious - the tapas are the way to go. Always get the mushroom flautas...they changed my life. I swore I didn't like mushrooms before trying these 5 years ago and now - mushrooms are one of my culinary staples. I don't know what I was thinking. Quesadillas are great if you're looking for something a bit more familiar - relleno de gambas, also a must - it's shrimp wrapped in a fried plantain. Come on. The lobster enchiladas, sashimi and Mordidas de Puerco are all favorites. We usually split 5 plates which leaves my husband satiated and me with left overs. You could split 3 (with a few martinis) and be happily fed and "watered". It's loud and busy on the weekends...if you show up at 8:30 on a Friday night, you're going to have a wait ahead of you - but it's worth it if you've got the time (and they only take reservations for 6 or more). Great atmosphere, great food. Highly recommended. Not wheelchair accessible ... just a tip.
