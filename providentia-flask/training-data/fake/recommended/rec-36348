What can I say about this place other than YEAH. The food is so good. Have now been here upwards of 6 times, as my mother insists on going every time she flies out to visit. What I like about this place is that the prices are reasonable enough so that you feel like you're enjoying a nice meal, but you never spend much more than you meant to! Highly recommend the hummus/baba ganoush platter, as well as the rabbit pasta. To top it all off, this place is always bustling and joyous, and there are plenty of tables upstairs and downstairs, so that as long as you made a reservation, you never wait more than a couple mins.
