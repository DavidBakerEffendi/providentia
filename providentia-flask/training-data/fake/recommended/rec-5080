I have been on the search for New York City's best burger for years now. Umami burger is definitely in my top ten. Their meat is high-quality, flavorful, seasoned to perfection. You know you're at a good burger place when their standard is cooking the burger "medium." You have to request well-done or rare. It can get a tad expensive when you add sides to your burger main course. Burgers do not come with anything. You have to pay extra for fries or a salad or any other side dish you would like to add. There is a good selection of beers on tap. It's fun to eat at the bar if you want to watch a sports game since they have 3 large flat screen TVs. It's packed on a Friday or Saturday night, so call ahead or expect a wait.
