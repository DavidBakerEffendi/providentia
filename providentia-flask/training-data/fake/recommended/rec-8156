My sister declared this her favorite restaurant in Phila, so I offered to take her here for dinner last night.  However, it should be noted that they dp not take credit cards (that was all I had on me) and so my sister took me out do dinner instead.  (A wonderful trick to pull if you are going with someone who is obligated to love you no matter what.)  But even though she had to pay, our dinner (apps to entrees to dessert to yum iced tea) was under 40 bucks.  Pretty awesome. I'm a relative noob when it comes to Thai food and have never had Laotian, so I usually stick with shrimp pad thai.  So I've had my share of shrimp pad thai.  And this ranks up there with the best I've ever had.  Yum yum yum.  Sis got the red curry and it was like a sweet, spicy soup with lots of veg and chicken in it.  The spring rolls we split for an app were so tasty, light and fresh.  I tried the thai iced tea and I was scared it would be too sweet, but it was pretty close to a perfect compliment to my meal.  I ordered the rice pudding for dessert, expecting normal rice pudding, but it came in 4 little warm cups and was anything but normal, but decidedly delicious.  We were stuffed to the brim with delicious dinner.  (No sense in leaving too little to take home on your plate, of course.) As for the service, it was above average.  Our waters were refilled, the food came out quickly, but it did take a while to flag down the waitress for the check.  Not a big deal at all, just us being in a hurry to get out the door to answer the call of nature ;)   So go here.  It's a cheap, delicious, cozy restaurant.
