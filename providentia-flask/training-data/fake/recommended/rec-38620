When you are pregnant and craving beans, avocados, and eggs. Go to Palo Santo. Get Huevos Banados (ask them to scramble your eggs, so that you don't remember halfway through that you can't have them and have to cut-out the yolk for your husband). I am seriously saying this is one of my top 3 breakfasts of all time. I suspect the sauce had crack in it. We also ordered the side of potato hash, which was also incredible. I'm only docking a star because it took a long (long) time to get our food and we were only 1 of 3 tables in the place. The space is adorable and unique, to boot.
