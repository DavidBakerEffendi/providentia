I seem to be giving every restaurant four stars lately, which I suppose discredits my opinion, but I swear, I have been really lucky with yummy, enjoyable finds lately! Just tried Cafe Cluny with a friend for lunch. I had the Butternut Squash Ravioli...small but definitely satiated my level of hunger at the time. They offer free newspapers so my friend and I picked up a copy of the New York Times and took a stab at the FRIDAY crossword puzzle. Tough stuff...we enlisted the help of the waiter. He called over his waiter friend who called over the hostess and we caused a bit of a stir. Cozy, quiet, a big wooden beetle hanging from the ceiling.
