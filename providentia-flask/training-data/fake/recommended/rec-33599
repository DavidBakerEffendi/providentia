Iron Chef is always a great experience. Everything on the menu is delicious. Their fish is always fresh, and they have new specials every week. My recommendation is have your waitress pick everything for you. Their staff will ask you the kinds of fish you like and really try to understand your pallet. I guarantee they will find exactly what you like. I only deal with Allison who is a waitress at Iron Chef. She is remarkable, and the friendliest person. If I tell her I'm in the mood for Tuna, she will not bring me out a regular plain tuna roll. What I would see on my plate would be something that looks amazing and tastes amazing. What I love here: Seafood soup or Spicy lobster soup. The Roti roll, and the hardrock roll. Always a five star experience.
