What I liked/loved- Pylos has good service and good food. The waiters and other service staff is kind & pleasant. I am assuming that it is a popular hotel on Yelp. Thats how we found this place. Yelpers please vote other restaurants too! What I did not like - The pots on the roof as for the ambience. They are too many pots out there. Location of the  place.  The idea that it is across a funeral home is personally not thrilling for me to go for Fine Dining.( I guess, its Newyork and noone really cares about where it is located :=) )
