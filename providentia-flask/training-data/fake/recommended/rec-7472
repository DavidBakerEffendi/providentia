Anthony Bourdain would love this place. I had both Kangaroo and Venison in one meal (eff you, PETA!). I think it's a winner. And the ambiance is adorable. And yes, they have little cute hotel-esque soaps for the taking in the unisex bathrooms. Have yet to try the soaps, but cute touch. Has a nice-looking bar in the restaurant but is kinda awkward with the people at the bar bumping into the people seated. If people are having a seated meal, I feel like they shouldn't have to deal with drunk 20-somethings that are 4 deep in expensive cocktails... Food reviews! Bread Basket: You get a choice of something plain looking, an apricot... something bun, or lemon focaccia. I got the focaccia and it was so crumbly and good. Yum. Kangaroo: Tastes like Beef. Was totally not as gamey as I expected. Served medium-rare on greens and a falafel. Yum. Venison: Was cooked also medium rare and perfectly with herby chimichurri sauce on top. Came on this potato galette (I think in the menu it was a "dumpling") that was a cross between a latke and a huge pillowy gnocchi. Yum. I Recommend. Hokey Pokey Ice Cream: WHAT were those delicious crunchy things in this ice cream???? Toffee? Caramel bits? So good. Comes served with a decent sized ginger snap cookie on the side. The passionfruit caramel sauce was delicious, too. The service was pretty good. Not amazing, but definitely friendly and a good pace. Waters were filled, empty plates did not linger, etc. And free sparkling wine at the end of the meal! Thanks, Public!
