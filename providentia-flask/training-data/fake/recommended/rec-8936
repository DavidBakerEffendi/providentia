Someone told me about this place so I went to check it out. When I got there they weren't opening for another 10mins but the guy was nice enough to let me wait inside until they were ready. Â I wanted pineapple fried rice and while its not on the menu they accommodated me even more and made it. Overall the food wasn't bad. It did it's job and was satisfying but I have had better. I gave this place 3 stars for food but it has 5 star service.
