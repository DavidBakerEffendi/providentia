I have been to Royale twice now.   I can say with confidence that it serves one of the BEST burgers around.  And, there is NO messing around in ordering the Bacon Royale.  They cook it to your exact specifications (in my case, medium rare), the bacon is deliciously crispy, the cheese sublime.  Onion?  Check.   For a burger complimenting beverage, I highly recommend the Pork Slap IPA.  Aside from the amazing graphic of two fat pigs slappin bellies on the can, it rocks a nice middle-of-the-road bitterness, and was on special last Wednesday night.   To cap it all off, it's really nice to sit in the backyard area of the joint.  Service is pretty quick back there, and sometimes, when the moon is full, this really friendly mob mentality takes over with the other diners there, and its fun to get into it (playfully, of course) with other tables.   A definite 5-star experience for that midweek dinner fix.  GO THERE!
