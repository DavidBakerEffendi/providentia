This place is great! Went for a visit after a Broadway show with the girls and it was perfect. The crowd/atmosphere was posh and the food was divine!  Its located in a cute area within SoHo and perfect to end a day of shopping.  It can be a little pricey - especially if you're going to order some Wine but it is worth the dollar! The chef even sent over a churros dish on the house, I am definitely coming back. My only critique would be that there aren't enough vegetarian items on the menu - so I am restristed on who I can bring.
