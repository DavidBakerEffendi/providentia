The Meatball Shop is one of those amazing little places in New York City that is a must try. They don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait for a seat and eye those getting ready to leave so you can swoop in for a grab. The Main dish is called Naked Balls, which consists of four huge meatballs of either beef, spicy pork, chicken, or vegetable, with your choice of 5 different sauces. You can add the Family Jewels to any order: eggs. And you can get the balls naked, smashed on a toasted brioche bun, or as a hero on a II Forno baguette. Everything But The Kitchen Sink Salad: 3 balls and sauce served over a chef's selection of greenmarket veggies and salad - is an excellent mix at $9! I wanted to try the homemade ice cream, but I was too full of balls! Cool Informational Tip: Their website lists the names of the farms they get each product from.
