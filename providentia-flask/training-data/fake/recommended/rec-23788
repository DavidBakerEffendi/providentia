I love T&N! There is no shortage of places with similar menus in the area, but the food served at T&N makes them stand out from the rest. I haven't had anything from there that I didn't enjoy thoroughly. Their creamed chipped beef is excellent. My husband is addicted to the omelette-stuffed pancake. The turkey in their turkey club sandwish isn't slimey and gross at all! I had almost given up on turkey clubs altogether before discovering this! The guys who deliver the food are always so friendly and outgoing, too. It is such a nice touch. My only tiny, petty complaint is that they use Miracle Whip, but I just order sammies without it and add my own mayo. I'm sure there are lots of people who are thrilled they use Miracle Whip. I am so happy to have found this gem.
