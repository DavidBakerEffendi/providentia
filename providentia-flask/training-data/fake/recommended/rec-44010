pros...open late, and has lots of seating around the store.  this is the real deal here, and as i was told, this is the original cheese steak place.  the cheese steaks are good when eaten right there and then.  the cheese fries are to kill for, for when they are hot and fresh they have an intoxicating smell of cheese and french fries.  such a lovely combination.  the sandwiches here have changed a bit from the last time i was here way back in 2003.  but still a great place to try cheese steaks in their original form, and order in a particular way. cons...well from what i remember the meat was a bit tougher, and you got a smaller portion of it as well.  the bread has also changed a bit as well.  but hey that was way back in 2003.
