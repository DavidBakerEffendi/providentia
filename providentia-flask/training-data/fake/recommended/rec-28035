This place was great!  I am so excited I got to taste a kangaroo burger.  Staff was phenomenal and so patient answering all our questions.  I loved all the recommendations and am looking forward to bringing more friends to try this place.  Next time I'll be saving room for dessert. Thank you Thirsty Koala!
