Affordable, convenient, and total garbage.  The lo mein is basically a box of spaghetti, they always got something in my order wrong, most of the other dishes look and taste suspiciously similar to one another.  There are a couple fantastic places for takeout on this block; New Park #1 should be avoided if anything else nearby is open.  There are also a number of options for much better Chinese food at the same price if you're willing to walk down Sisson- those places also deliver.  Bad.  It's bad.  Also, this place is solidly in Parkville- if you're in Frog Hollow, it's bit of a shlep.  Delivery will still be pretty quick, though.
