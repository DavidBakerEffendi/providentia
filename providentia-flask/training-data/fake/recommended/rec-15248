Awesome dog portraits all over the walls! This place is probably a great spot to grab a drink, but unfortunately I only got the food for take out. We arrived to Philly at about 11pm and were on the hunt for some grub before checking into the hotel. After trying a couple of places, we stumbled upon Good Dog. I thought it was going to be an all night hot dog joint, but was surprised when we walked in and it was more of a dive bar, with a food menu. We ordered two burgers. Their burgers came with bleu cheese in the middle and had I read that I would of probably got something else. As I bit into the burger, the first bite was ok...a little tasteless to be honest. They need some more seasoning. Then the second bite exploded the pocket of bleu cheese. No me gusta. I scooped the rest out and finished off the burger as is. Considering it was so late, I was starving and it got the job done, I guess it was decent. The fries come in a huge serving and are mixed with regular and sweet potato. They come with a sauce on the side which once again...tasted like nothing. Althought it solved my midnight hunger, I can't say I was truly happy with the product - especially at that price point.
