La follia is very close to my apt and has become to my go-to place for a relaxing brunch with minimal wait time and impromptu dinners. The quality is very good for a neighborhood restaurant and is extremely well priced. For brunch my fav choice is the truffled polenta eggs and mushroom omelette with sides of bacon, always cooked to perfection never soggy. Bloody Marys are only $6.00!! For dinner, I always start with their crostinis. They are all good but I especially like the eggplant one. For entrees, I usually go for their pastas and they are all so good with the Vongole being my fav.i am extremely thankful I have you just down the street!!
