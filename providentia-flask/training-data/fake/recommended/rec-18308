Wow! I loved this place. The setting is lovely and the food was outstanding. We went for brunch and I had a delicious sweet corn soup followed by seared scallops on a bed of farro with tender garden vegetables in a light and flavorful vinaigrette. Â The service was professional and courteous. I am already planning to go back again for dinner before the summer is over.
