The most disappointing brunch I have ever had in NYC. It is over-priced for the experience you are getting.  It is crowded, they sit you on top of each other. Hostesses were rude and arrogant. Food is good, however one person at our table found string in their food and manager's response was, "it happens sometimes....".  Not at a highly regarded restaurant it should never happen or if it does have better customer service to address the situation.  This felt more like a tourist trap than fine dining in NYC.
