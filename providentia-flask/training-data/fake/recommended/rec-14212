Came here for dinner tonight based on a friend's recommendation. We didn't have a reservation and were asked to wait by the bar.   glancing over the patrons inside, I noticed that everyone was in their mid 50s+.  A few were probably in the mid 30s-40s range.  Most were older patrons. After about 15-20min, we were seated outside by the entrance near the outside menu display.  Avoid this table if you can unless you are okay with: 1.  People standing over your table gawking at your food then at the menu then at the food then at the menu again. 2.  Chain smokers standing within arms reach to blow cancer down on you and your food.  Always keep a water balloon with you if this situation ever happens to you! 3.  Hear everyone leaving the restaurant and jabbering about their meals and anything else that comes to mind after a meal. I ordered the lamb chop and my gf ordered the pasta special.  I think she got a better deal than I did!  I really enjoyed her raviolis.  I liked my lamb chop too!  Medium rare - came out right and was very tender.  But the ravioli won me over.   The no-limit pasta refill was fantastic!  Keep 'em coming!  We skipped dessert and coffee.  Feeling stuffed was an understatement after our meal.   Our bill came out to be sub 60's which is a great deal in my mind.
