YES, thank you John for hooking it up!! we had a UYE (thank you Dorie!) here and it was a blast!  started around 6:30, about 15 quiet people trying to make small talk with each other until BOOM, WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?  BYOB + SAKE HAPPENED!!  i think we (finally) left around 10, after about 6? bottles of wine and numerous sake shots (complementary by John!).  by the end of the night, we had almost completely taken over the restaurant with obnoxious sake-shot rage, it was great and i will be back!   the food was pretty typical sushi, nothing to write home about and no disappointments.  the spyder roll was good, so was the fire roll (crunchy jalepeno on top!), spicy tuna rolls were good, edamame is complementary with check-in!  BYOB rules: wine only, first bottle is free, additional bottles are $10/each
