This place is called "Sabrina's Cafe and Spencer's Too". My friends and I were in Philly and found this place at random for breakfast on a Saturday late morning, and boy it exceeded all our expectations!  We waited for about 10 minutes before we got seated in this busy establishment, and were soon greeted by the friendly, attentive waiting staff. Among us there is a Honduran, an Iowan and a Malaysian. We are pretty picky on food, so we were quite skeptical when the waiter recommended the stuffed Challah French toast and Huevos Rancheros. We ordered one of each, plus a lox and onion omelet. The food came cooked to order, in large portions, beautifully presented, and tasted delicious. The Inch-thick (probably 2-inch thick!) Challah French Toast stuffed with banana crème fraîche was served over the perfect dose of maple syrup, topped with fresh slices of banana and lightly dusted with sugar. Each bite is an explosion of flavors in my mouth. I can see how is this the most desirable menu item at the place. I usually imagine Huevos Rancheros to come with old chilli and soggy tortillas, but the one I had here just became the best I ever have. The tortillas were crispy, the chilli was not overpowered by pepper/spices, and I could taste the freshness of the beans and tomatoes. The fried eggs on top are beautiful done on a clean griddle (without the awful burnt stuff at the bottom as one usually finds in NJ diners). The lox and onion omelet is equally delicious. it's technically an "egg-roll" with multiple layers of lox and onions! My friend thought the lox is a little salty, but that's because he thought lox is some kind of sausage meat that tastes like salmon! Overall, we had a pleasant, amazing brunch experience at Sabrina's. I would certainly return if I'm in Philly again, perhaps this time to the other branch on Christian St!
