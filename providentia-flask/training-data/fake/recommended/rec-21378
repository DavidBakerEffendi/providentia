Ok so I reviewed this place a month or so ago and I need to update my review. The first one I did, I was upset because they couldn't simply remove the grain portion of my meal from my meal to make it edible for me. Yesterday, on our day off from our diet, my boyfriend and I went back (even though we vowed not to return). They did renovations recently and added an entire extra seating section which is good and was needed but moreover our waitress was AWESOME, Hillary- thanks! And the food was out of this world; as per usual. The drinks were awesome and the fact that we went during happy hour didn't suck either. The service was fast and like I said- food aaaahmazing. I lived in Guadalajara for a semester and was able to experience true Mexican cuisine and even this tasted better. The margaritas were amazing and if you like guava, try the martini that has the guava in it (shoot can't remember the name). I had chicken enchiladas (i know it's a gringo choice but their slight mole enchilada sauce or whatever it is is out of this world) and my boyfriend had tacos: my fav was al pastor but he enjoys them all! Â I recently went to Fairmounts La Calaca Feliz and although their decor was awesome and whatnot, the food came nowhere close. I need to take back my shotty review and swallow my pride and apologize. This place is amazing!
