This was my go to pub when I lived nearby. Considering my frequent patronage I must include 5 flattering points. 1.Relinquishes the screens for important soccer matches 2. Great beer selection and delicious eats 3. Parents friendly (in the afternoon) 4. Had electricity during the Halloween storm when I did not (and extra electric sockets to boot!) 5. Beautiful interior, especially compared to alternatives nearby Conclusion: This is by far the best pub in Montclair, and is definitely worth a visit.
