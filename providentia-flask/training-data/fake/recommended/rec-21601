This is going to be a short, but to the point review. I had the privilege of going to PYT on a beautiful day, so me and some friends were able to get a seat outside in the Piazza. It was also during the week Tommy Up, owner, was giving out free PYT burgers! In addition, I got a milkshake and their onion rings. All in all, the burger was pretty good (a little dry though), but the shake and onion rings were BOSS. Best I've ever had. The place itself is pretty nice. There's a back room with a DJ. They host events there some nights, but I have yet to attend one. If you've ever been to the Piazza, you know the type of crowd there. Fashionable, fixie riders, skaters. I'm down with that. And the waitresses are pretty cute. So if you are the trendy person looking for something, let's say different, try out PYT.
