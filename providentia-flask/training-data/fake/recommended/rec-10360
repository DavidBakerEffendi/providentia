I've always been a huge proponent of this place but tonight the service was unacceptable. I had to close out my tab at the bar so I could get my card to pay for dinner. The tab was $14. Bartender asked if I had cash. When I said no he looked at me and said 'well you better get some then!' Never have I been treated so rudely.
