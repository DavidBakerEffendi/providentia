This place is pretty cool! There's all types of fancy hot dogs you can order, sort of reminds me of Pink's Hot Dog in West Hollywood, except the choices available are more well put together. You can tell they put a lot of thoughts, test and trials, for their choice of ingredients to use, correlating to their choice of name. I ordered the Big Kahuna, Philly Surf & Turf, & Windy city.  My favorite was Philly's Surf & Turf, the addition of fish cakes really adds to the palate. Personally not huge fan of dogs, but this place definitely makes me want some. They also have giant fries accompanied with variety of sauces (25 cents each) which reminds me of Prommes Frites of NYC, except with more choices. I didn't get a chance to try it this time, but I definitely will go back to try it. The seating area is pretty comfortable. Surrounded by posters of different sorts of hot dog corresponding to their names, it makes you wonder if it was past products. I started thinking what would I use as ingredients to make a Bostonian dog, it was  definitely a lot harder than I thought. Perhaps they should have a suggestion box for me to secretly fulfill my dreams as a chief. I'm not good at cooking, but I am great with brainstorming.
