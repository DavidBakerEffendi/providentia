Very good comfort food. I had the turkey leg which was plentiful and delicious. The fried pickles were delicious, and I would definitely go back to just have those. My mixed drink (something that had sage in the title) was pretty strong. Some cons: We were told it was a 40 minute wait, and the hostess said she would call, but they never did. When we went to check in, she claimed she called which was not true. Luckily they had a table available, but if they hadn't I would've been a bit ticked. It was very busy (a friday night), and a bit cramped. The service was acceptable.
