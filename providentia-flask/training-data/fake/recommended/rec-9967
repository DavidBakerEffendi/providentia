Nyonya is the last true Southeast Asian fusion restaurant I've been to and it did not disappoint. The food, the curries particularly were mouth-watering and fantastic. The first thing that hits you about the place is the smell. That smell! I wish my apt smelled like that everyday, they should bottle the aroma and sell it as incense. I also enjoyed a crab dish which was grandly presented and heartily shared among myself and friends. Nyonya's decor is dark with flickering candles and bustling tables. Loved it. Verdict: This is a reliable place for Malaysian and Singaporean food. Perfect for a date, girls' night, work dinner, or just chilling with a group of friends.
