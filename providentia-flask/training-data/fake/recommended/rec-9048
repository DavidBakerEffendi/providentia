Beautiful place. And certainly just as popular as you would expect. Three of us had dinner at the bar. Bartender/server was great. As were the cocktails. Was surprisingly a little underwhelmed by the food. For all the rave reviews, maybe I had too high expectations. The good stuff: - Ricotta crostini (great, but I feel like I've had similarly as good, if not better elsewhere) - Blue crab crostini (great, but just because the blue crab was so delicious) - Lamb sliders (great, but the lamb meatballs at landmarc i had just recently were much better) - Brussel sprouts - Potatoes OK - Pork chop. They cut it in half before it came to the table. I always find this odd. Â Of course it would dry out a tad. - Orrecchiette - not exciting - Ravioli - expected much better
