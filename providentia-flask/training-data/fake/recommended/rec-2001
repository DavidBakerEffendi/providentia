The first bite of gooey whiz wonderfulness is something which cannot be described, it must be experienced.  Odds are if you are looking at the review you are wondering which is better, Pat's or Geno's.  Honestly ... your best bet is to bring a friend and each of you get a steak from one of the locations and you split them. For my money I think Pat's wins on the "initial taste" barometer.  It hits you just right and makes you crave a 2nd and 3rd bite.  That being said, I think Geno's sits in the stomach better and is a better "total experience".
