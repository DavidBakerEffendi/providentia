First of all, the taste was so generic I felt like I could have gotten a better cheesesteak at a Wawa gas station. Secondly they were so incredibly racist, and their signs were so offensive to me (I'm white too, so seriously...) I almost wanted to leave immediately, but I stayed for the hype because I was in Philly, after all. The dudes cursed at my friends and I and we were all pretty pissed by the time we left. Ended up going to Pat's because at least their service was friendly and a lot less offensive. Seriously, just pass this one up. It's not worth your time.
