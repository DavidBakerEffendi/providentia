My wife treated me to brunch here for my 40th birthday which included some surprise guests from college. I really enjoyed this quaint spot. The restaurant is very warm and inviting, so are the staff. It has a rustic ambiance that I will never tire of, no matter what anyone says. I will contest that the framed picture on the wall near the entrance to the kitchen does move...and the guy does have an increasing amount of pie on his face. You'll see if you go there. Everything we ordered was delicious. Such a good brunch menu. The smoked salmon and pork belly benedict were faves of the table. The complimentary assortment of baked goods and small parfaits are a great way to start ... along with a Beery Bloody. The mini-sticky buns are the star. The Beery Bloody is a beer-based take on Bloody Mary, and is part of their $26 brunch offering. Great value for what you get. You can also add oysters as a starter for an additional $6. All the staff are extremely friendly and welcoming giving this place a neighborhood, "Come back and see us again" vibe that I love. Service was perfect from start to finish. We will definitely be back for brunch, and I can't wait to try them out for dinner.
