After careful consideration, I rate this the best pizza experience ever (not only New Haven). Great ambiance (you're in a micro brewery for crying out loud), Â decent home brew and standard bar offerings, great salad (often overlooked, but a must-have), and last but not the least, easily a top-5 pizza in New Haven (which automatically translates to among the best pizza in the country). You have to know when to arrive there in order to avoid long waits. That's testament, however, to what a great place it is. They do take reservations for large parties (10+, I believe) Quirk - the mashed potato pizza is not intuitive, but actually really splendid. I would indulge only when visiting with a group, in order to share a slice or two. I wouldn't rate it higher than the red sauce plain Margherita. Disclaimer - I am partial to a thin crust and crisp pizza.
