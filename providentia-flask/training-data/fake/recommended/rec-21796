We got a few pre-drinking bites here on a Friday night. They had great music on the bar laptop, friendly bartender, juicy chicken and apple sausage with equally tasty sauces and beers, chill fellow diners/drinkers, and gnomes on their liquor shelves (any place with gnomes automatically goes on my hit list). I could have used a little more sauerkraut as a side and we were slightly disappointed to see the sausages were not made in-house (we saw the "chef" walking to the grill with a few packages of store-bought sausages). Nonetheless, we had a great meal here, complete with a free corn on the cob and a little chocolate cupcake that the bartender had kindly given to me for free (they were celebrating an employee's birthday that afternoon and had made some snack food in batches).
