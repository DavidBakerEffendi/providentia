Went for Sunday brunch.  My server Jesse was helpful and attentive without being overbearing.  Got crab cake with spinach and fresh fruit.  Jesse warned that the crab cake was small.  I'm not a fan of oversized portions and found it to be the exact right size.  The fruit had been cut that morning.  The bloody mary is the only drink you'll need because it's strong.  I'll be back next week.
