We drove the 1/2 to visit this diner and only because of the rave review from Guy at the Food Network.   We were shocked at how dirty the place was.  Only sits 8 at a counter and we arrived at 1pm on a Saturday afternoon. The place is SO tiny that you have to go outside to take off your jacket. We did not stay.
