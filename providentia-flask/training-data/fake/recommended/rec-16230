perilla was delicious!  i am easily unimpressed when shelling out a lot of money for a nice dinner, but i felt very satisfied that my money was well spent after this one!  we got the duck meatballs, spaghetti squash, pork belly and risotto for appetizers.  I had the steak for my entree which i actually split w/ my friend and i was stuffed after the meal was over.  I also appreciated the waiter not rolling his eyes at us when we said we were splitting an entree.  The service was amazing and we spotted Harold several times throughout our meal.  I would definitely go back.
