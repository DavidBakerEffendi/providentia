Honestly, they've kind of gone down in quality since they became famous and featured in time out ny and other various media.  The lines are ridiculously long and that corner of the street it's always hard to tell who the real halal guys are and who the non real ones are? Also, I actually have had the big apple halal guys and it was the same.  I don't understand why one cart has a line down the block and then there's this shady shifty cart 10 feet away that's empty.  I only give it 4 stars because im so pro putting my own sauce without any judgement and without having to say...more..more..more..ok you know what, I know that seems like too much but just keep squeezing....=/ Also, know when the guys are around because there are imposter carts there in the morning and afternoon.
