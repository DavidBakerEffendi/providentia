this place is a good fall back place. a place you end up because you can't think of anywhere else to go. the staff are always nice, the drinks are good and the food is tasty enough. the portion sizes are very generous, and i think it always tastes decent. it won't make you blissful, but hits the spot when you want a comforting burrito. i do really dig their wooden serving platters, is that weird? but their chips & salsa are very nice, though not sure why they aren't free, isn't that standard for tex-mex places? oh well. i hate the bathroom at the tip top floor, it always makes me feel out of shape. but they can't change that. but it is a hike, so hold it in son. my suggestion is don't forget this place when you are in the center of town and out of suggestions. you won't be unhappy.
