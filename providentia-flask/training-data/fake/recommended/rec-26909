We made reservations for Thanksgiving dinner here. A very pleasant experience. Needless to say, the place was packed. They were offering a prix fixe dinner, and our plates came out speedily - not necessarily a plus for us, but necessary for the numbers of folks they were serving. Service was very, very friendly and personal, which, given the crowds, was quite a feat. I particularly liked the carrot ginger soup. The rest of the meal wasn't out of the ordinary - except insofar as it was a pretty traditional Thanksgiving meal in a French bistro.
