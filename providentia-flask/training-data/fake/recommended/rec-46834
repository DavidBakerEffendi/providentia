Went there the other night and they treated you as if you were the only guests there!  The staff was super nice and accomodating.  We ordered the burrata as the appetizer (really good)!  I ordered the chorizo burger which was good but really salty.  The waitress asked me how it was and I told her it was too salty so the owner came over and offered to have it re-made.  So my date's burger didn't get cold, they put it under the heat lamp to keep it warm.  When our dishes came back, they added fresh french fries on his plate as well!  Super great service, food was really good too!  I would definitely come back.
