I usually don't write reviews right away unless it's something exceptionally good or bad. Our experience at FDR was so good that I couldn't resist. FDR was one of the best dining experiences I've had so far in Philadelphia. Definitely the best new restaurant in town (at least to my knowledge) and I should know since eating out is my full time job. The restaurant is located in what used to be Meme on the corner of 22nd and Spruce. Beautiful decor. I loved the subway tiles, the lamps and the counter top. The open faced kitchen facing the small and intimate dining room was a great touch. The music was perfect. I want their playlist. Our server was nice and attentive. And the best part: the food was great! The Chef really knows what he's doing. Every single dish we had was perfect. My favorites had to be the roasted beets for starters and the stuffed skate and beef cheeks. I was dining with 3 others who also really enjoyed their experience. For dessert we tried all four on the menu. All were good, although the carrot cake served with vanilla ice cream and the chocolate cake really hit the spot. I've been dreaming of this place since last night and can't wait to go back. I can't understand why anyone would have any negative reviews. it's definitely Â a small intimate venue and no place for a toddler nor large groups. Really intimate place great for dates and one on ones!
