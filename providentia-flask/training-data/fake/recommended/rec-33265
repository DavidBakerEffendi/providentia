Great Thai food! I recommend the half chicken with rice and mango. Incredible. When they say spicy, they mean it. Watch out. The kitchen is open and you can see the chefs making everything if you sit on that side of the restaurant. Everything tastes fresh, and there are a lot of vegetarian options. On a Friday and Saturday night, don't expect to hear much of what your dining companion is saying. The DJ is incredibly loud, so just sit back and use hand gestures if you need to communicate!
