I first had umami at googa mooga in prospect park, it was THE BEST burger I've ever had! I don't know why it took me so long to finally go to there restaurant. I went tonight, it's a very nice sit down restaurant style place, I ordered the truffle burger (medium) with truffle cheese fries and onions rings. The burger was so much better than the first time I had it, and also a lot more juicier, it had the right amount of truffle seasoning, not too over powering, the truffle fries where also extremely good, onion rings were huge. The waitress was nice, fast, and attentive. Overall it was better than I expected, after having a umami burger you will never want another burger again from anywhere else. I seriously don't know how they manage to make such a juicy delicious burger! Way to go! Welcome to New York! I will be a regular costumer!
