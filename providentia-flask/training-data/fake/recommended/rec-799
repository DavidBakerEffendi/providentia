These people think its funny to have horrible attitudes.  Not the Philadelphia spirit.  Funny that they demand you speak English, since they are all decendants of a bunch of immigrant Italians running the place.  Their cheese steaks belong in Times Square, not South Philly.  We got yelled at because we parked (on the public street) and then went to Pats across the street.  These people are not what Philadelphia is about.  This is also the same place where fans think its funny to beat up visiting sports team fans.  I just want a steak, I'm not here to earn street cred!
