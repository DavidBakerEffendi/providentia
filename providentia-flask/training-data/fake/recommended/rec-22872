Great Lunch Options for $9-12 -Lunch salad: They use springs greens instead of just boring chopped romaine -Veg Spring Roll: Super flaky crunchy crust with the yummy sweet sauce -Massaman Curry: Delicious! Flavors are nicely balanced with hints of ginger and even licorice! But..... I really really really wanted to give them four stars. In the culinary desert of the UES, I was happy to find a thai place that had delicious and fresh food, cute/trendy ambiance and great lunch options. But I'm really not a fan of attitude. If I say my thank you's and please's and am polite with you, I kind of expect there not to be a problem- ESPECIALLY if you are the server! So I placed an order of mango sticky rice 'to go' at the end of my meal with the waitress. I guess there was a mix up and the dessert came out as an 'eat in' dish. Ok that's totally fine, let's just wrap it to go. When I kindly pointed out that the dessert was 'to go' the dude who brought it out gave me the most exasperated sigh of annoyance, rolled his eyes ALL THE WAY TO THE BACK OF HIS HEAD, and grabbed the plate to saunter unhappily back to the kitchen. Maybe he was having a bad day?
