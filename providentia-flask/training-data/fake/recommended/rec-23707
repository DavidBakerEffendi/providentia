The food at Good Dog is fine, however, the service is severely lacking to the point where I can only give it 2/5. When Good Dog is crowded, you are sent upstairs to wait for a table. If you are with only one other person, you will have to wait for longer because they like to fill up the downstair booths with the largest parties, pretty much saying that they could care less about your patronage because you will not make as much money for them as a larger group. This is fine, they are a business after all, but at the end of the day it's a frekkin' bar with decent food, that's it! Not worth the wait. The decent food is the second reason why Good Dog gets such a poor review. Â The owners seem to have grown an extra large head from their Food Network appearance, thinking their food is a step above the other gastropub type places. In reality, it's no better than Nodding Head, 1518, or any other similar place surrounding it. The menu has worsened over the past couple years, and several delicious items have been removed(including the brie sandwich, my favorite) and replaced with stuff that just isn't that interesting. The burger is good, but no better than the Royal Tavern or Nodding Head.
