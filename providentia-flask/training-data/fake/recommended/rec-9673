Hands down my favorite sandwich place in Astoria. Always reliable, always delicious. I look forward to their soups every winter - the tomato bisque is killer (ps they always serve it on Saturdays). I love their creative specials (I had a mac 'n' cheese with chicken sandwich once that was amazeballs). The pesto bread they serve with soups is good enough to eat on its own as a meal. Plus their servers are always cheerful. Major bonus.
