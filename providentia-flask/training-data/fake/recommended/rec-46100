Four of us went looking for a decent meal on Saturday,and we found an excellent one at the Mill on the River. The food was impeccable and the service attentive.Wine list was quite extensive, with quite a few gems. The wine we selected complemented Â our meal perfectly. Server indicated that the prices on the wine list would be raised within the week. Apparently they had been underpriced for years.
