My husband and I have been coming here every week since they opened. Not only is everyone super nice, but the food is solid! They just started brunch and I'm really excited to try a lot of the new items. We're serious about our BBQ so we're really happy they opened in our neighborhood. In response to some reviews below, they took a little time to find out how much food they needed and to get the staff running, which is why some people fielded those complaints, but it is by no means on a regular basis. They run very well and they have catered to our every need.
