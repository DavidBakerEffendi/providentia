Visited for lunch.  We had a few entrees.  The radiatore pasta, short ribs, grilled shrimp and corned beef sandwich.  Overall everything was good but not outstanding.  Corned beef was probably the best.  Portions were enough for one meal.  Disappointed there weren't any lunch specials considering the prices.  Views of the river were nice.  Service was good however the place was empty.   Moshulu is a nice choice for a unique restaurant atmosphere.  Food ... eh.
