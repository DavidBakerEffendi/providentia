Sorry, but this is definitely not a 4 star restaurant.  My if it were a club it would be deserving of 4 stars, but the food isn't that great. This place is all about ambiance, and you pay extra for that.  The drinks were a little pricey, and the food wasn't as good as people make it out to be.  If you want sichuan, there are other places in the are that are great.  If you want trendy, with upbeat music and a cool atmosphere to hang out in, then this is your place.
