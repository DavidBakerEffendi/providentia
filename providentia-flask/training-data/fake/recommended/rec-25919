I used to live right around the corner from Piccolo Angolo, and man do I miss it. As far as traditional, low-key Italian goes, I don't think any restaurant in the West Village is its equal. It's a good idea to have reservations, and even then there's a chance you'll wait for a spot in the cozy, but unspectacular dining room. Once you're seated by owner and all purpose traffic director Renato, you'll be outfitted with free garlic bread -- an auspicious start to your meal. The wine list is fine, but its highlight is probably a quaffable house red that comes in cheap carafes. A lot of wine flows at Piccolo Angolo, so go early if you want a sedate meal. The antipasti are straightforward favorites that come in generous servings. The same goes for the salads. But the kitchen hits its stride when the entrees roll out. The flagship dish is the amazing lobster cannelloni with vodka sauce. Nice chunks of lobster come wrapped in perfectly al dente cannelloni and smothered in rich, zesty vodka sauce. Â You'll see your reflection in the plate when you're done. An array of other pastas are all strong as well. The rich linguini vongole is a dish that sometimes gets to one cheat on the lobster. Enormous portions of spinach and pine nut lasagne tempt. Occasional specials, like sweet potato, pumpkin, and fig ravioli in a decadent nut sauce also receive high marks. Meat dishes at adjoining tables have looked good, but I have to admit I've never made it past the pasta portion of the menu. Desserts are usually superfluous, but when called to go the extra yard, it's the cheesecake over the tiramasu in the battle of the bulge. Just thinking about Piccolo Angolo is making me hungry... maybe I should move back.
