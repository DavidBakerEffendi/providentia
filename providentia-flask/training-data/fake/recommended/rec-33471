We had a positive dining experience at Scarpetta's. The service was very pleasant, accommodating and informative. It was my b-day celebration and we were headed to the Joyce theater. We wanted to choose a well reviewed restaurant in the area for dinner, and we opted for Scarpetta. Although we enjoyed our food....which was plentiful and flavorful, but given the prices, we weren't blown out of the water. It was good to very good, but in my opinion, not great. Our meal: Creamy Polenta fricassee of truffled mushrooms ($15)- I thought this was the most impressive dish Spaghetti tomato & basil ($24)- Very good, but $24 for a plate of pasta? Moist-Roasted Capretto rapini, pancetta & potatoes ($28)- Never had goat before, and it was very tasty! Roasted Sirloin potato gatto, chanterelles & braised oxtail sauce ($36)- Well done sirloin with a rich oxtail sauce. We were too full for dessert, but the espresso and coffee were nicely brewed, and came with a complimentary tray of Italian cookies and biscotti. I'd certainly recommend Scarpetta. We found the service to be great and the ambience appealing. It wouldn't be my first pick, but it was definitely worth a try.
