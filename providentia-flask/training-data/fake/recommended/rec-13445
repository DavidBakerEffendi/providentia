The pizza was like a mix between a gourmet thin crust and a regular slice... Chalk another one up for Staten Island, this was some really good pizza! With crazy names like "MOR" (meatball, onion and ricotta) and the "Garbage Pie" (sausage, mushrooms, meatballs, onion and pepperoni), I was a little skeptical, but both pies were awesome! We also had the margarita pie and the buffalo wings which were also very tasty, but I was a little dissatisfied with the calamari, it was bland and the breading wasn't that great. As for ambiance, this place had it in droves.. Alot of people eating and enjoying themselves, the way a good pizzeria should be! Staten Island surprises Â me sometimes...This was one of them!
