What a gem! The waitresses were as sweet as pie! When mom is in the kitchen of a restaurant using grandmother's recipes you can't miss. Â We had green curry with brown rice and chicken, udon noodles with pork, and pineapple fried rice. My favorite part was figuring out how spicy to make everything with the waitress. We decided on 5 out of 10 because she didn't want to hurt us, but next time bring on a 10. TOM YUM soup is a must have.
