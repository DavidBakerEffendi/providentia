Four stars certainly on food and service.  It was everything i have been reading about and more.... Amazing stuffed artichoke.. awesome linguine with clam sauce... all perfect...service attentive and at a good pace.  What bothers me so much (thus the 4 instead of 5 stars) ...why can't a place as successful and well known as this, close up for 1 or 2 days, put a fresh coat of paint on the walls and maybe replace the 2x4 wood chair rail with something more decorative? Maybe replace a few of the spaghetti sauce covered receptacles on the walls?   Come on..you can get this done for 2-3 grand and at least look a bit more classy. sponge painting went out 22 years ago, prob when they applied it.    Also, i went home, made some clarified butter and roasted some garlic.  I am hoping it will bring some of my cooking up to par with them!..
