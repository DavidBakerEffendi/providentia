Fairly decent pizza and basic Italian dishes in this pizzeria located on a strip mall on RT46 next to babies r us. they have a good amount of tables without waiter services. You order your food and sit down to eat it. If it's a big order or takes too long they'll bring it to you. Â  Place is clean and staff is friendly. Prices are also good and they take credit cards.
