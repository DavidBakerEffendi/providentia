So this place is probably my new favorite place to go and it is located in Fishtown of all places.  This place is a breath of fresh air. Open, outdoor beer garden equipped with everything you need for a nice evening of chilling with your friends.  Tons of free jenga games which do get harder the more liters you pound.   We dropped in on a gorgeous Friday right when they opened at 4 so we were able to procure a nice spot and enjoy the scenery.  The selection of German beers is pretty solid and they range from Bitburger to Hofbrau to Palaner. They had some local Yards brews on tap as well, but when in a beer garden, do what the Germans would do and pound some German Brews!  The food here is ok; nothing special in my opinion but perfect for munching on when you hit your fill and need that snack to keep you going. It's a good setup for food, just head over to the window, order the grub and then take a number to your seat and they will bring it to you. I will definitely be returning here because the ambiance and the setup is unbeatable.
