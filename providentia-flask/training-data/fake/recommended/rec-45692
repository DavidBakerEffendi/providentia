To Jeffrey O- that's really harsh on Bayonne!  Actually there was a great sushi place that recently got shut down that everyone loved! And FYI - there used to be a restaurant in the same spot that Volcano was at that had a popular sushi bar in it that was successful.  I've yet to visit Volcano because of the location.  Not a fan of what Broadway has become.  Anyway- thanks for laugh;)
