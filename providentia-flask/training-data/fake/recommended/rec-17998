Very sad to report that the inattentive service on my past two visits brings my previous reviews down to only three stars.  While the food remains very good (we went for Sunday brunch today), the service has become a problem.  Waiter never put in the order for coffee with dessert--finally coffee is brought as we're paying the bill.  Needed to remind waiter to bring things.  The restaurant was 3/4 empty today, and there was no excuse for the lack of attention.   On our prior visit a few months ago, while our waiter was very friendly, we could never find him to pour our bottle of wine. It's a shame that lack of attention in the service department will hurt this otherwise fine restaurant.
