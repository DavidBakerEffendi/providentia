We had lunch at Becco last December on a weekend trip to NYC.  Being fans of Lydia Bastianach, we had to check out one of her restaurants, and the food did not disappoint.  The portions were very generous.  The Lasagna Bolognese was so big I could barely eat it all.  My fiancee got the all-you-can-eat pasta special they were running at the time: 3 different pasta dishes that the waiters would come around with and ask if you wanted more.  Everything was great, cooked perfectly al dente.  No complaints on the service either. The only reason I couldn't give Becco 5 stars was because of where they seated us.  They had set up a makeshift "room" with 2 extra tables that was essentially outside.  Being December, we were freezing throughout the meal, even while wearing our winter coats.  We didn't understand why they would even bother to make this extra space for only 2 small tables.  They had to know anyone who sat there would be uncomfortable.  If we had sat in the dining room, it would've been a perfect meal.
