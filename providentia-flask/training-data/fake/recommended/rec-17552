This is my number one ramen spot!  I've returned a few times here with different groups and I've enjoyed each experience. Sometimes the wait is long and its a bit crowded, but its definitely worth it.  If you're craving for an ample serving of real ramen with tasty broth, and sake... this is definitely the place to go.  Trendy motif, great ambiance and very efficient service.  You can also order more ramen to add to your leftover soup... pretty awesome if you can't get enough of the dish.  Itadakimasu!
