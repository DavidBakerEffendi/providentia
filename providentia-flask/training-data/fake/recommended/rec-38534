(vegan) Cheese steak used to be excellent, but inconsistency is creeping in. The soy cheese is flavorless at times, and the 'meat' can be pretty dry as of late. When it's good, its the best in the city, it's just doesn't meet that mark often anymore... I agree with some of the negative assessments of the staff's performance, definitely the worst service of any vegan/vedgie place in the city. The one cook will stop cooking to chat up friends, on an already super long wait.
