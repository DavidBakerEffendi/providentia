Jack..the ass! My girlfriend and I had both been here before and liked it, so we thought we'd stop in for a quick bite on our way to a show. We figured 45 min. would be enough time to order a drink and an entree, especially since there were only a few tables occupied (we were there around 6:30pm on a summer Friday.) We were wrong! Got our wine and then we waited...and waited...while our waiter disappeared behind the bar to mix drinks, the chef came out to chat with the table next to ours, and the rest of the waitstaff (and some of the kitchen staff) stood around in the back of the restaurant chatting. No one came by to check on our table, even as (the few) other tables got their entrees, then their desserts. Finally, I went to find our waiter, still behind the bar. He sent another waiter to check with the kitchen. Waiter #2 reported back to him, not to us, so I had to get up again and ask him for the scoop. His response? "If you're in a hurry, I guess you'd better go, because your order got lost." Lost? With maybe 6 tables occupied in the whole place? Hard to believe they could be so sloppy and unconcerned. The bar manager, who overheard the waiter's comment, did run out after us to apologize and offer us complimentary drinks in the future, but at this point, we're pretty sure that Jack doesn't know jack about decent service.
