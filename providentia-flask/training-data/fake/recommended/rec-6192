I came without a reservation and was lucky to find a table for two. I ordered a cocktail from the daily spacials and it took forever two arrive. While I was on the second dish, I could see our drinks from afar and the waitress completely lost in the scene. Grr. For service, this place gets a 3. However, we ordered the pork belly buns (Amazing!), the lamb dumplings (Good but spicy) and the Red Curry Beef fried rice, sticky, a little spicy and Delish!! Â Food gets a 4. I would come back for the food. It its very good! As far as drinks, at an Asian restaurant (unless it's high-end), go for the safe bet- Sake or Beer.
