Great Italian-focused restaurant & bar on one of the prettiest blocks in the West Village. We arrived for happy hour last night which included house wines for $6.50/glass and passed appetizers. I was impressed with the wine selection seeing as 'house' normally means table merlot, or worse, 'red' - a blend of who knows what and usually pretty bad. They offered two whites and Chianti and a Piccini for the reds. The passed apps were a nice addition & they even put in the effort to create some dairy free options for me and my friend. Once the bar filled up, we sat down to dinner in the backroom which had a huge skylight and the moon reflected through. Nice touch. Service was spot-on, the food was very good. We'll definitely be back. The restaurant has only been open for a year so it'll be interesting to see how they do.
