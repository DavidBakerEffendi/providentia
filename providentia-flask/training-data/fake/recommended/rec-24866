Food is a 4.5. Atmosphere is a 4.5. Service is a 2.  3 at best.   We went for an early dinner on a Saturday (we have a 10 month old son so all dinners are senior citizen time).  The place was 2/3 full with several tables and booths open.  The hostess tells us it'll be a 20 minute wait and can they find as at the bar.... uh duhhhh yeah we'll be at the bar watching our 10-month old son doing tequila shots off some young waitress. 3 minutes later we were seated.  Food was fantastic.  Guacomole was great.  Margaritas were great.  I had the surf and turf tacos (good) and my wife had some incredible soup.   Just a word to the management.... people with kids aren't freaks.  If your wait staff was a little friendlier then this would have added an extra star or two to this review.
