Four stars for the very friendly and attentive server. Two stars for my food at lunch.  I ordered the veggie wrap.  Now a good wrap is tightly packed, and the tortilla secured and tucked in well.  This wrap was rather loose and immediately fell apart.  In addition, it was overdressed with balsamic, so that's all I tasted. My friends' dishes of veggie burgers and tuna melt were well received however. Cute cozy space on the inside.
