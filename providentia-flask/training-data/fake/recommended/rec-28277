Tizzzzyizzzzzyiiiiight. Loved it. A true muddafooking gem. Japones soul food with carribean decor and reggae music...am i pulling your chain? nah, mon, i no pull your chain. There's flag on the ceiling that says smthg about japanese soul food. I was delighted by this place well before dipping into the food. That being said, the food is quite satisfying. I had the tonkatsu (fried pork) and a fried chicken appetizer. It was taaasty, as was the sauce. Sizeable mugs of Sapporo for $5, glass for $3 and another, i believe japanese, beer on offer. They also have Japanese wines (say wha??)--red and white--and a good-sized sake list. This is definitely an eatery i wish to introduce many a friend to, but only those friends on the A list. Do yoself a service and get acquainted with the Ichibantei. You've earned it.
