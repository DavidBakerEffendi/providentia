This review is NOT about the upstairs restaurant/bottled beer area, so if you're looking for that, skip it. It IS about the downstairs area, where there is cheap beer on tap ($4 and $5 pints) and a cheap, fun, hand built miniature golf course. You get one round for $5, kids get in for $4. We took the Ikea ferry over, intending to spend the day wandering and then making some purchases before heading home, but after hearing a few people mention a crab place, we decided to take a quick detour and follow them to see if the place was any good. We weren't looking for a sit down meal, but the view was amazing so we hung around to get a drink before leaving, when we noticed that they had a full miniature golf course set up. And they let you drink from your plastic pint glasses while playing! Lots of people were here with their kids, and a bunch of other people were using the course to distract themselves while they waited to be seated for dinner (the wait was an hour and a half) . Downstairs, the only food available is some cold seafood appetizers - oysters, spicy shrimp, shrimp cocktail, clam Anyway, I'm sure all the reviews about the service are perfectly valid, but $20 for an 18-hole game of miniature golf and two cold beers was a perfect way to spend a summer afternoon and one I highly recommend.
