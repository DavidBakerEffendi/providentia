You really can't beat this place. The food is great, the portions are gigantic, and the bill is tiny. It does lose a star because of the wait. Okay so you have to wait and there have been many times that we have opted to go elsewhere because there is a great Japanese place on the other side of route 1 that hardly anyone knows about so there is never a wait. However, there is an incredibly long wait because it is so good. Even their drinks are enormous, which means I don't have to harass the wait staff for five refills. Definitely yes on the frozen sangria. Go early, eat anything on the menu and go home happy.
