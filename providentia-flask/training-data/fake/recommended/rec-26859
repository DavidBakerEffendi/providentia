I have been going to Bistro Les Amis for more than 15 years and my visit this past Saturday was another is a series of wonderful experiences.  Roy and Said are always so welcoming.    Taking the waiter's recommendation, we ordered the Chateau D'Arvigny 2010 Haut-Medoc and it was a perfect complex wine at a moderate price.  I had the lamb chops, perfectly cooked rare, and a delicious side of sauteed spinach.  My dining companions shared a large beet and arugula salad which was big enough for three, and each got the steak frite.  One ordered her steak medium rare and the other ordered well done, and they were both got what they asked for.  For dessert we shared the apple tartin and the chocolate cake and both were delicious.   The atmosphere is perfect for a romantic  evening, or an evening with friends when you don't want to have to shout over loud music or a din of voices.T atmosphere is perfect for a romantic  evening, or an evening with friends when you don't want to have to shout over loud music or a din of voices.  I have been there on first dates, for anniversary meals, with large groups and with just a couple of friends and I've never been disappointed.  This place is a gem.
