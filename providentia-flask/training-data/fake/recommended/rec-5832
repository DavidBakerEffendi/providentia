Food was good. I had gone with a big group but we had ordered a lot. Rkaykat Bil Jibneh(Cheese Rolls) Lamb Kebab Phoenician Fries with garlic whip yogurt thing Labne Warm eggplant Black Iron Shrimp Falafel The lamb kebabs were awesome. They were cooked perfectly. The eggplant was really good too. I wish I could remember what the yogurt thing was called, but that was good too. Cheese rolls were just okay, nothing special. However, falafel was a big winner with my vegetarian friends. It was perfect for our group of 7 or so. We also had gotten this chocolate thing for dessert and it was SO rich.. that you couldn't eat the whole thing.
