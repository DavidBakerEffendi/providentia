Food was ok service was horrible. They messed up another customers order so the employees gave the customer a free chicken roll... Sounds nice but problem was they gave him the chicken roll I ordered! Then informed me that it was the last one! So I got a sausage roll instead which was decent in taste but was no way close to making up the horrible service.
