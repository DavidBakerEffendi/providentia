I am officially hooked on the Pork Sliders!!! The spot is nice and cozy and prices seem reasonable. However, the service although very nice couldn't keep our tabs in order or sometimes forgot a few orders, but in the end we got what we ordered just took a while. I don't understand the whole lighting in the bathroom. One room had red lighting and the other green and no mirrors, so not sure what's going on there. Music was pretty mixed, but got better into the night. It is a must to return if only for the pork sliders!!
