"The burger that caught the attention of everybody passing by."  And yes, it was that good.   I can't say anything about the interior since we sat outside, and we went on a quiet Monday so our servers were attentive to our needs.  What I can talk about is the food.  My roommate and I started out with a bowl of sweet potato fries to share.  The fries were very salty (which is how I like them) and she seemed to like the aioli that came with them.  Next came out her cheese plate and my burger with a side of their southern caesar salad.  The salad was really good, I would order that on it's own as my meal next time. The slightly sweet cornbread croutons were a nice change from the typical garlic croutons and the dressing was perfectly creamy.   Then there was my burger.  The sweetness of the onion marmalade, the smokiness of the bacon, the softness of the fresh roll, it was amazing.  It looked so good that several people walking by eyed it up and one guy actually shouted "that's a good looking burger" as he passed by.  I ended up only eating half of it and taking the other half home and it heated up pretty well two days later. I took off a star because my burger was overcooked.  It might not be a huge deal to some people, but I ask for my burger medium because I like it medium.  When I cut my burger open, it was well done, which made it VERY well done when reheated.   All in all, it was a great meal for a decent price and I'll be going back.
