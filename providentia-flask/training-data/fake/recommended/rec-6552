WOW. Amazing. I love it.  So, so good. I was just in Manhattan for 5 nights and ate at 8 different restaurants, Pylos was my favorite by far.  I was there on Sunday night and it was pretty full but there was no wait.  The service was prompt, professional and extremely friendly.  You can sit at this huge granite counter if you like for a fun experience.  We had 4 delicious appetizers: the Octopus, three cheeses, stuffed red pepper and three dipping sauces.  I recommend all of them. The pita is fresh and moist.   The chocolate mouse was rich and creamy. I wish I lived in Manhattan so I could go there all the time.  The prices were very reasonable.  Definitely go there before it becomes the next big hot spot, it will be written up in a magazine soon if it hasn't already. Can't wait to go back!
