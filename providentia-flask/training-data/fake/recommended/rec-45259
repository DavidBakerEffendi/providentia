This place is great!! The drinks are awesome. I'm both sad that it's just outside where most Penn students go (because they don't get even more business and money from that demographic), but also glad because it makes Green Line Powelton even easier for me to enjoy! (selfish, I know...) Green Line Powelton - there are so many reasons to love you!! Drinks = A+ Service = A++ Price = A (you pay a fair price for what you get!) My only wish - that they would take credit cards! p.s. - They also sell yummy Route 11 chips!
