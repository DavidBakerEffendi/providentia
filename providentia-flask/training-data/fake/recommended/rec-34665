Love me some kati Roll. This place never disappoints and this is my favorite location as well. The inside is nothing to write home about but if you get a seat even better. The food is great. My favorite are the achar Paneer and the chicken unda roll. If you ask them to make it spicy, they defintiely do. Good price and good food..win win!
