Was in Philly during a vacation so wife and I decided to try the famous Pat's and Genos and put them up against each other.   We got one sandwich from each shop (catty corner from each other).   We came here at the off hour of around 3PM on a weekday so they weren't busy at all and should have had time to make our cheese steaks properly. Verdict:  Meh. Meat: Dry and tough Bread: Not bad Cheese: Provolone wasn't even melted Toppings: Obviously canned mushrooms. We've had better in San Diego. Cut and paste this from my Genos review because they were interchangeable as far as we were concerned.
