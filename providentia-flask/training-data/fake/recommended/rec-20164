I've passed by this place constantly and never went in because it was always so empty and dead. Usually Thursday and Friday at 6pm when I meet my husband at the F train. Maybe it is early but they do have happy hour. Anyway, I was craving oysters and decided to stop by and have some only to find out they only have $1 oysters from Mon-Thurs. ok, not a prob. We still need to eat dinner. So I ordered the mussels and my husband had the gnocchi. He liked his dish but it was small enough to be an appetizer. Yes, I get that's how Europeans eat but we're not Europeans. My mussels were beyond disappointing and border lined disgusting. Half of them were closed which means they're dead, which means it's not fresh! Way too little broth and WAY too much sand and grit. I seriously thought I cracked a molar half way through dinner. The bread was stale and the slab of butter was really cold. I use to work in the corporate office for LES HALLES so I know the French likes to use this really expensive block of butter. Unfortunately, Olivier's does not. The service wasn't bad. But the guy who waited on us was slightly off putting when we didn't order the seafood tower or the 24oz steak. (he might have been the owner because he greeted several guests that appears to be regulars) Â considering how bad my mussels were, I'm glad I didn't get the raw stuff. Maybe their brunch tastes better because they have 4 star reviews so someone must really like their food. So far, I'm not a fan.
