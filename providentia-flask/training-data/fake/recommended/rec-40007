During a recent trip to Philly, we made every night our own personal bar crawl. National Mechanics was early in night two, and it didn't disappoint. I was intrigued first by the outside--the appearance of the place is glamorous and unique. The atmosphere inside doesn't disappoint. Dimly lit, fantastic level of music, and well decorated. They have happy hour every day which definitely rates them highly in my book. A decent selection of beers that are very reasonably priced, and the bartenders are friendly and helpful. But let's just stop there. Because I know you're thinking to yourself, "Okay, fine. This sounds like a lot of bars in Philly. Why should I go *here*?" It's very simple. Only two words. You still listening? Frito. Pie. Yeah, that's what I said. Fritos. With chili. And cheese. They're so committed they let you keep the Frito bag. I had so many other bars to go to the rest of the trip, but each night I started the decision with, "Can we go get Frito Pie?"
