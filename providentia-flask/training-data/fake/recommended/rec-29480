It's difficult for me to remove emotion from eating, but I understand that for some people eating is nothing to get excited about.  In the case of Dalessandro's, not getting excited probably means that you're emotionally callous.  I wouldn't want to be friends with you because I expect some sort of connection on an emotional level in my friendships.
