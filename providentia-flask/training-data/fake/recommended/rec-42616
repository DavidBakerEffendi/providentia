Stopped in after a crazy youth lock in for a 3:30 AM meal and was pleasantly surprised to get a fantastic spinach omelet with feta cheese and peppers and onions. The veggies inside were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of crunch. The feta was great quality and the side dishes were perfect. As far as diners go this one is five star!
