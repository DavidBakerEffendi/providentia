This is probably not the best way to get men to come here, but I have to say, this place is adorable. The decor is rustic french, and there is lovely little seating outside on the street. It's a perfect place to come to on a sunny day to meet up with a friend or significant other. Bring your smile and wear a sundress (or for men, your light linen button down), and you won't go wrong. I come here a lot and always try something new. Each and everyone of their crepes is amazing. There eggs are good, though not quite in the French tradition. And FYI - this place gets crowded quickly. It took us 30 minutes to get seated, so come with a pre-brunch snack and coffee and be prepared to wait.
