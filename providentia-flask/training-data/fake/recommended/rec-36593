40 minutes of wait time outside was a small price to pay for the best Japanese ramen I've had in my entire life. Yes, folks, Ippudo does live up to the hype as the reigning king of ramen establishments in Manhattan. I came with 2 friends, and we ordered family style, so I was able to try the special ramen, the traditional tonkotsu ramen, and the modernized tonkatsu ramen. We also ordered a pork belly appetizer to start. Â The appetizer was innovative but tasty, the broth was divine, the egg was a perfect combination of cooked and uncooked, and the tonkatsu was nice and fatty - just the way I like it. The space itself is very cool, too, and surprisingly upscale for a ramen restaurant. I'm already looking forward to my next trip to New York so that I can try all of the other types of ramen and menu items. My new (or perhaps not so new) motto: Will travel for food!
