I had an enjoyable lunch here yesterday, and smiles all around :) I made my sammie order half sized which was a generous portion and great value for the quality!  The fried chicken and kimchee is unique and perfect level of spice.  During my time there, a stream of regulars came in, a good thing to see for being a new restaurant.  Service was excellent too! I couldn't have asked for more, I will be back!
