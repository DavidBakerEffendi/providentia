Are people kidding me. How are you all giving them 5 stars, apparently great food is something that you all haven't experienced on a regular basis.  I am not talking about going on vacation and tasting food in another country for a week or a month, I mean a lifetime.  Back to the review. The waitress did not do much but sit behind the bar while my party was waiting for our order to be taken.  She continued to do the same as we wanted to order dessert.  customer service is key.   The steak was alright but the rice/beans had no flavor.  The sweet maduros were burnt .  The bottom of the seabass was inedible because it was burnt and hard.  Seasbass should never be burnt and hard. The Tres Leches was better that Havana Alma de Cuba but the cream was not so great.   I love food and I love to cook.  I would never serve someone something I would not eat. I will never go back there.
