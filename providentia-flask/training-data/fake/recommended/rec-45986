I've been coming here for years and I have yet to be totally displeased. I think that they have gone downhill slightly since we first started going I would say 8 or 9 years ago but the food and service is still good. If you've been there for that long, you'd know that everybody that works there treats you like family. The service is almost always great and they always very nice and courteous. The food is good. It's not terrific, but it's good enough. Even if it's not the best food out there, at least it's consistent. I don't think I'll ever stop coming here. Great restaurant!
