love it! yummy food, good drinks, cute place. the desserts are bomb. i had the best dessert ever here -- it was something hazelnutty, chocolately, and caramely. my mouth waters thinking about it. also, if you need a place to go for brunch, it's really affordable here with a wide selection. and it doesn't get very crowded. lots of egg dishes as well as non-egg dishes for the vegans out there.
