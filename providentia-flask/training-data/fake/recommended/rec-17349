Cuban Petes it is a very loud and entertaining place to eat. The cuban food is very good, plus priced rightly. Be Reminded that is BYOB (a thing that you only find in NJ) however across the street there is a liquor store with plenty of booze to bring in. The only issue is that it is very loud and since it is cheap, it is a prime place for bdays which brings the waiters with a drum and make as much loud as possible. That is ok with one bday but 4 or 5 is the norm. However, I think the place is great for good low key food/date. I recommend it.
