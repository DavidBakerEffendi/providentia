I just found my new favorite place in Burlington.  Went for dinner with my girlfriend and we absolutely loved it.  The atmosphere in the restaurant was great.  The space is small and they don't try to over fill the space with too many tables like a lot of places do.    Our server was great, he helped me decide on my main course and picked both of our desserts and he was spot on.   The beer options were very limited, but the wine list seemed very long.  For a starter we got the surf and turf spring rolls which were great.  The Lobster one was incredible and the potato and short rib ones were not bad.  For dinner we got the Pan Seared Duck Breast and the Chicken with Waffles.  Both of these were incredible.  I have only had Duck a few times so not much to compare it to but I would recommend it to anyone.  The chicken and waffles was also amazing.  The bacon and sage waffle with the chicken and gravy was just perfect together.   Then the best part of the night was the dessert.  We had the blood orange semifreddo and the chocolate caramel tart.  These were both excellent and I would go back just for dessert. I cant wait to go back to church and main.  It will be hard to order something different the next time but the entire menu looked so great and our food was so good  I would be surprised if anything on the menu was not good.
