Had my anniversary here and Marc Forgione and staff made it the most memorable. They personalized a menu, gave a complimentary glass of champagne, and our server, Miriam made everything even better. The food was fantastic, my husband had the duck and I had the porkchop. They had really good portions! Both of which was amazing. In addition, the presentation of the food made the night an experience. We will definitely come back as everything on the menu sounds appealing. Thank you Marc Forgione and Miriam.
