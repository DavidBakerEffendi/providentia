The shrimp, lobster, and salmon bisque was fantastic.  I really wanted to give this place 5 stars, but by 12:30, they were completely out of the my first 2 choices on the menu.  One of my favorite things about this place is that with the meal, they give you bread AND fruit.  If you get a sandwich with that, then you have a pretty well balanced meal (assuming you get a healthy soup). Yes, I know the line is out the door and around the corner (even on a rainy day), but its worth it.  Good food, pretty quick given the line length.  This is definitely a go there regularly place.  Just get there early or they'll be out of your soup.
