Had dinner here tonight I've been going here for a couple of year and I was gone for a couple of months on vacation and I was sad that they changed hand aka "under new management" but I turned out everything is still the same maybe a little bit better. The new owners are renovating the restaurant I haven't tried the pizza yet but the cheese streaks are better then what the used to be but they were lacking on cheese. I hope the pizza is still good. Would recommend.
