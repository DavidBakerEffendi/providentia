3.5 stars I came here with my girlfriends looking to dine on some delicious Italian food curtesy of what the Yelp reviews for this place told me. It was a cold winter night and I had a long walk from the train station. By the time I got here, I was shivering and couldn't wait to get inside and warm up. During the summer, there is outdoor seating which I presume would be really nice because this area of Manhattan is really nice and chill. However in the winter, they pack everyone into the tiny restaurant. It isn't insanely small but they cram too many tables in for what the space is. Good luck getting to the bathroom if you're in the corner or far away from it. Anyway I digress, let's talk about the insanely amazing food! Omg! I had been drooling for the Ravioli in pink sauce since I saw the reviews and pictures for it here on Yelp. When I got it, it was just as good as I imagined it to be. My only issue is that it is a small portion size. They could've added at least one or two more pieces of ravioli for the price. Nonetheless it was amazing. The staff is very nice and accommodating but I honestly didn't like the vibe of the customers. A little snooty in my opinion. May have been just that night and not typical. They give you bread and olive oil while you wait, and I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio which complimented the food I ordered. It gets very crowded in here but despite that, I'm glad we were able to be seated almost immediately and did not have to wait. I recommend coming here if you enjoy Italian food. I hope to come back eventually :)
