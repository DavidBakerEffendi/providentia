The burgers are good, but very overrated.  I enjoyed the free peanuts while waiting. And the wait was long.  I liked the fries, but wish they had a smaller size.  I really don't need a jumbo sized fries for about $3.  This dining room and restroom were immaculate.  I can't remember the last time I said that.  And they play good music.
