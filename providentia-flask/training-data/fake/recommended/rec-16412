I patronize Kobeyaki frequently for lunch as it's around the corner from my office.  I can only comment on lunch, and really only on one menu item: the rice bowls.  I usually order the brown rice bowl with teriyaki grilled vegetables and crispy tofu because it's a healthy and delicious option.  The rice bowls are so good that I haven't tried their sushi, rolls or burgers.  It's a bit pricey for lunch, but the restaurant is almost always packed at lunch time.  They do offer dinner and have a selection of sake, wine and beer as well.
