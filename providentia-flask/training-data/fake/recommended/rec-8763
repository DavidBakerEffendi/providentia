Not sure if most of yall sushi lovers realized, Yasuda's sushi tend to lend toward the SMALLER size compared to other high end sushi restaurants. I wouldn't mind paying top $$$$ for sushi, but the chefs needs to be more reasonable in giving their patrons a bigger cut of fish. Fuck, i'm paying $5 for a piece of sushi that's not even as long as my baby cousin's dick?! Fuck outta here.... I would rather go to 15 east for sushi. 2 pieces of Yasuda's are equivalent to1 piece of 15 east. BIG DIFFERENCE. Yasuda's rice is a bit more vinegary, which I don't mind. Everything is good from the decor to the service to the freshness of the fish. There is this one person who answers the phone and he is quite rude... Don't appreciate that. The bill for TWO would run you about $160 each after tips and tax, NO DRINKS INVOLVED.
