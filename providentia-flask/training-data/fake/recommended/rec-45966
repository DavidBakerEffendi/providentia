This is a great sushi restaurant! We came in with a buy one meal, get one half off coupon, which they happily honored. The service was very friendly. The restaurant was very clean. We both ordered Mai Tais, which were very refreshing. For dinner, we had the crazy tuna roll... It was very fresh and delicious! I highly recommend this place!:-)
