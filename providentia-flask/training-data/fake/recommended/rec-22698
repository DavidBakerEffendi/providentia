This place was really good for the price until I saw two bugs casually going across the condiments on the Mongolian grill. I tried explaining what I saw to the server but she smiled and giggled, not knowing what on earth I was trying to say to her. Needless to say that was enough to ruin my appetite and not go there again. If sanitation and cleanliness don't bother you, I'd recommend it, because they did have a good selection of sushi rolls.
