Fun atmosphere, chill vibe with good tunes in the background.  Better yet, the food was quite tasty! Bite into soem grilled mexican corn with cheese shavings on top. mmmm... The wagyu brisket bbq  was oh so tender and the sauce had some bite! I LOVE the margaritas ... ASK for a couple extra dashes of cayenne pepper.  The vibe of this joint is "spice is nice!"
