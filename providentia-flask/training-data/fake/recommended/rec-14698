I only come here to drink soju and orange juice while I'm waiting for friends to show for dinner at Kunjip.   One bottle of Chum-Churum soju and two small cans of Bon Bon for around $10. Sometimes I get a little sidedish like cucumber or anchovies... Not enough to keep me from getting a buzz on. Casual seating in front and back of store. Fridges and cafeteria style help-yourself style. Atmosphere lost in translation...  This is actually what I would aspire to if it was my place.
