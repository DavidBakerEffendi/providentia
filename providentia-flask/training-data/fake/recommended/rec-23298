First of all we've been to this restaurant 4 times before this!  Everything was fantastic, the food, the service, except tonight, on our fifth experience.  Our first course, the arugula and fennel salad with a blood orange vinaigrette and raw almonds was fantastic!  The blood orange vinaigrette added a much needed acid against the fennel and the raw almonds added a nice nutty flavor.  The second course was an ahi tuna ceviche in a garlic jalapeño purée with shallots and cilantro to garnish.  The third course was delicious with a seared scallop in potato soup with blackened leeks and a radish to garnish.  Unfortunately our third course, the cobia, was considerably undercooked and could not even be cut with a knife unless I was sawing against the fish.  Cobia is a white fish that should be able to be cut with a fork!  When I addressed the waitress she quickly told me our chefs cook it medium as it should be cooked and that once all the other customers, about 20 were served their dishes, our fish could be finished!  We were thrown back by this comment.  As both myself and some of my family member have been waitresses, chefs and dish washers you were always taught that the customer is always right.  The customer service was completely disregarded.  We were made to feel like we were in the wrong when the fish was completely raw.  For the shear fact that the service is 50% of the experience at a restaurant this was completely unfortunate.  I have a list of about 20 other highly recommended restaurants in philadelphia, a food city trailing NY, I will not ever make my 6th visit to this restaurant.  If the waitresses were only trained to know that their tip is coming from the customer and that they are always right, even though they are sometimes wrong, as I know coming from the industry, we would have returned at a later date.  Now they have lost a slew of future customers only because the wait staff did not know how to handle a customer.
