I've been to Hot Diggity twice: once the week it opened, and today, to bring my friends.  I like hot dogs, but I'm a vegetarian; which is why I'm a fan of this place - they have 2 dog options: meat and non-meat.  Then you get to choose from 10 different regional styles of condiment "packages" to add to your dog.  The first time, I had the Fiesta (guacamole, lettuce, tomato, topped with sour cream) - yummm.  Today, I had the Windy City (pickle, relish, onions, and mustard) - again yummm.  I've always been a fan of the Chicago-style dog, however, so this was no surprise.   They also sell hand-cut fries (which I find are a tad bit overly salted) that you can purchase additional dips for, like Peppercorn Ranch, Rosemary Aioli, or Chimichurri Sauce.  The ranch was decent, but the rosemary aioli was a bit bland, and the chimichurri sauce was not true chimichurri sauce, but more like a chimichurri sauce + salt and mayo - lime.  I am not mad about the dips, though - after all, they were only 25 cents each, and I like trying things.  I just won't buy the same ones anymore. I like this place to come back again and again to keep trying all the different varieties.  Next on my list: the Bronx (with sauerkraut!!!) and the Saigon Fusion (with pickled carrots and cucs!!!).   If only I had a faster metabolism, I would've tried them all already.
