This place is a short drive from my office. It's inside a gym. I can't say it's the best food I've had, but it certainly is a nice option relative to the choices in the nearby foodcourt. Honestly this area is so sparsely populated with affordable lunch options it should at least be considered in the top 3 options around. As silly as that sounds... Word of warning though, the vegetarian sandwiches leave a lot to be desired. The meat options are decent though.
