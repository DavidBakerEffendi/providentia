Off-menu cheesy tots:  $5, delicious. The burgers and wait have been covered thoroughly in other reviews, and knowing the fervency of review-scanning that takes place, wanted to make sure the cheesy tots got their due. One note about the wait -- we were told 20 minutes.  There seemed to be open tables, so rather than wander around the neighborhood, we stayed in the waiting area.  The hostess saw us -- and perhaps saw us seeing the empty tables -- and after about 5 minutes we were seated.
