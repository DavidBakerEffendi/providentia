I've never had Texas BBQ before, but Percy Street Barbecue made me a believer. My husband and I both ordered their BBQ chicken. It was tender and juicy and full of flavor. Perfect! Their mac & cheese is up there with the best I've ever had. It had the perfect mixture of texture and taste. I had to give half of my serving to my husband to keep from eating it all! My husband was very impressed with the sauerkraut and collard greens, heartily devouring both sides. Percy Street serves up decent portion sizes, not too little but not too much. It was just right. We found the prices to be very reasonable as well. As we were leaving, stuffed and happy, we noticed the crowd at the door waiting for a table. When we arrived earlier that evening, the place was nearly empty. We thought that was strange for an early Sunday evening. But in less than an hour, every table was filled and people were clamoring to get in. It's no wonder why. We will be back!
