This restaurant has earned it's high rate and not just because of the charming rustic decor. The price is right and the food is delicious. My husband and I decided to try something new and for our anniversary decided to try Puerto, although not the most romantic place, the food and tasteful decor transported us back to our second honeymoon which we spent in Puerto Rico. The food was authentic and the service was excellent. You can be sure that we will be back to enjoy some good homemade spanish comfort food. It has a family owned feel which I like. My husband had the half chicken and I tried the pernil bother were well done. Go for happy hour for an even better deal.
