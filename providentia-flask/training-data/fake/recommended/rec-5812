Wow, I was shocked at how bad this place was. After reading great reviews and hearing good things, my girls and I decided to try it out. We had a reservation since we were a large party and it was before 6:30pm. We ordered come cured meats and cheeses for appetizers and I wasn't impressed. I'm a huge fan of cheeses and I usually like most of the ones I try, however none of the 5 we ordered were that wonderful. The goat's milk cheese looked like fungus and tasted like feet (don't order it). The cured meats were pretty good. I ordered the shrimp and lobster pasta, thinking it would be pasta with shrimp and lobster. It wasn't. Bad menu description! It was large ravioli type pasta with pieces of lobster and shrimp inside with some sort of cheese. The buttery sauce was good, but the actually inside tasted sour as if the cheese had gone bad (I don't think it did, but that was the taste). My friend got the same thing and agreed. A fellow diner ordered the gnocci ragu and said it was flavorless and had to add A LOT of salt. I tried the risotto from another friend who ordered the scallops and I wasn't a fan, although she seemed happy. We were there for about 2 hours and the place only had 2 other tables when we left (8:30pm but it was a Wednesday). Overall, I know there are way better italian places in the city and I would not recommend this one, it's not worth the wait, especially since they don't take reservations!
