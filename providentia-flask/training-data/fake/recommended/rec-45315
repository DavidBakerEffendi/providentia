Duck breast was top-notch and cooked perfectly--seared crispy fat on the outside, nice and medium rare on the inside. Very rich and flavorful. Get it! Steak tartare needs a minor adjustment--there was a sweet flavor in there...perhaps a sweet tomato gave it a ketchupy taste. Comes with fries that are vaguely reminiscent of McDonalds, but I actually mean that in a good way. I normally think house cocktails are a scam--usually a way for a resto to achieve some scale, but there's a reason the classics exist. Howe'er, in this case, they're quite solid, and reasonably priced. Kronenbourg is a nice simple lager, good and crisp on a hot night. Boston Bibb salad was good but slightly overdressed. Escargot were excellent. Atmosphere is pretty good--admittedly, the clientele are biased to stuffy white Brooklyn Heights people, but the music is good, and many of the other touches give it a decidedly authentic feel.
