I had high hopes for this place, but now a month after my one and only visit I am utterly disappointed by this place, or better yet, their owner and manager. I went there with friends, one of which is a Newark resident, so I trust him.  My burger was tasty and the sangria hit the spot.  But it all went downhill when the bill arrived.  We had a Groupon, which was obviously in a foreign language, since it took three people to figure out how to subtract the discount and split the balance among our cards.  My card was charged, not once, not twice, but three times and yet I was not told about these errors. I noticed the mistakes the next day along with the overdraft fee I incurred due to their mistakeS and was left with .13 to my name!  I called them immediately to fix their error and yet it's been over a month and still have yet to receive a sincere apology, my $21 back, or anything else but the worst customer service since then. I will never go to this establishment again nor will I ever give it anything but bad reviews.  If I were in their shoes, I would have 1 - alerted the table to the 3 charges they made to the card, 2 - had the customers leave with a gift certificate or free drink ticket or something as retribution for their mistake, 3 - taken care of the $21 mistake immediately. If you go there, good luck and only pay in CASH!
