I don't know if I'm ordering the wrong things or if I just have different expectations for a hot dog than many others, but I have been very disappointed on multiple trips to Hot Diggity. I think my issue is that there is just too much going on. When I want a hot dog I'd like to be able to taste the actual hot dog itself. At Hot Diggity, I feel like the sausage disappears within the oversized bun and mounds of condiments. Both the Seattle Grunge and the Big Kahuna left me wondering where my hot dog was, and even the Bronx Bomber, which I thought would avoid this issue, was mostly condiments and bun. The wealth of condiments tends to create a muddled flavor. There is so much on every dog that it is hard to know what the garlic cream cheese or pineapple salsa actually taste like. As for the eating experience, the buns are not made to hold up to the amount of wet condiments being placed upon them and tend to get soggy and fall apart. This makes it almost impossible to eat the hot dog without a knife and fork, which would be fine if the result was delicious, but since it isn't it's merely annoying. The fries are pretty good, which is important. There are 12 dipping sauces, and the ones I tried were ok, neither great nor terrible. The restaurant is kept clean and the service is professional, if not overly friendly. The prices are a little high, but not outrageously so. If I liked the food better I don't think I'd have a problem with the price. However, I've alway left Hot Diggity feeling like I could have spent my money more wisely elsewhere.
