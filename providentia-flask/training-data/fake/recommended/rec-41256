Great dining experience! We ordered the rice porridge and the fish balls to start. The fish balls were pretty standard but I was not expecting anything crazy here. The porridge was really fantastic. I enjoyed it much more than any congee I had ever had. The Bicol Express was wonderful. Big piece of pork in a nice and spicy coconut milk kind of curry sauce. The heat on this dish is perfect but if you need more burn there are some peppers on the side. We also got a kind of rice, prawn, mango fish dish, dont remember the name but it was also really tasty and interesting. The service was really top notch. We sat at the bar and though it got a bit crowded at some points the servers are super attentive and helpful. They explain each dish in detail and make it an interesting and pleasurable dining experience.
