4.5. I've been to this place many times because I used to live around the corner. I always got the pad sew eu with tofu which is great & the veggie spring roll & curry puffs are both great starters. This place is reasonably priced & my boyfriend developed a love for Thai food after he went here! The only problem is that they are always busy :/ & the place is tiny! So get there for an early lunch or early dinner & you should be fine. I totally recommend this place, but not for big groups of people.
