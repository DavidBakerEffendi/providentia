Went here for late lunch with my mom...we sat outside as it was a nice day, and boy is service great. Multiple people came to ask if we were ok and needed anything, it didn't get annoying and they never rushed us but they were very efficient. We got the shrimp summer roll, the peanut sauce was tasty and it was very fresh with large shrimp. Next was shredded chicken breast and asian slaw salad, pretty decent nothing to spectacular..kind of bland. Last, we got spicy drunken noodles. They were delicious, the table next to us ordered it so I got food envy and needed to have it. Overall, I would say this was a great value for lunch and they bring the food out very quickly so if in a time crunch then you won't be running late due to eating here.
