Yummy food, I have been twice now and the second time was even better,  haven't eaten any other Indian food so don't have others to compare to so, but it was very good. Last time I had the lamb korma and my hubby had the chicken tikka. Both where very good and we shared some cheese naan.  Def going to try other places to compare to but for now I def recommend.
