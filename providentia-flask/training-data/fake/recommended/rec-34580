Came here my very last night in New York & so happy to have left eating the most amazing meal.  I'm very picky when it comes to falafel because it is one of my favorite eats, and this place nails it with both flavor & texture. I ordered a full plate filled with 3 different flavors of falafel, tabbouleh, hummus, pita & 3 different sauces.  It was mouthwatering. I actually finished the entire plate, and I couldn't move afterwards, but it was totally worth every bite.  The spicy falafel paired with their spiciest sauce was delicious, although it could have used a bit more heat.  I dream about it every now and then & cannot wait until I'm back for another round! The place inside is pretty small, so definitely take it to go! 5 stars for healthy, fresh & delicious food!
