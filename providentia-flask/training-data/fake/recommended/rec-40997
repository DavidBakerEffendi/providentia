The food tastes fresh! On my first time there, I ordered the Chirashi Farmer's bowl. I was impressed with the quality and I was back within a week for a macrobiotic roll, which exceeded my expectations. Good for the price, for a Brooklyn sushi joint. The service was very friendly and courteous. Despite the small space, they made a good effort in creating an ambience that kept it from looking like just a hole in the wall, plus they have an awning with seats outside for the summer.
