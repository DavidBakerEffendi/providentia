My favorite cold day food stop.   The soup dishes are full of flavor and extremely filling but I honestly can rarely order soup when there is the best dish in the world - SPICY BASIL FRIED RICE.   It is so good. I see other reviewers agreeing with me.   If you haven't tried it - you must.   I'm not a big fan of bubble teas but they have a great variety of hot and cold flavors.   You can't beat noodle house based on the quality, quantity and price.  Keep up the great work.
