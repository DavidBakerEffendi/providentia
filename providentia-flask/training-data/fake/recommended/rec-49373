Although I knew what I was going to Artichoke for, I was still surprised at how little my first bite tasted like traditional pizza - not that that was a bad thing, at all.  The artichoke slice is delicious and creamy, with a flavor unlike any slice I've had before.  As anybody else can tell you, one slice is definitely enough.  Definitely want to go back and try the crab.  When I want a standard slice of pizza, I'll probably head somewhere else, but when I'm craving something a little different, Artichoke is definitely at the top of my list.
