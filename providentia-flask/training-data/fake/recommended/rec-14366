Omnomnom!! Solid BBQ is always an epic meal. This Dinosaur BBQ location is just as good as the one in Harlem. For a chain they pump out delicious ribs, tender brisket, and yummy pulled pork. However, I think the definite must have is they're Mac and cheese which has a bit of Cajun seasoning in it. This location has outdoor seating, bike parking nearby, and chill staff. The service was a bit slow when we went (we sat outside), but once we were noticed the server apologized and was really courteous.
