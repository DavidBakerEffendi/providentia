Came here with a friend on our never ending quest for lamb burgers. They come with fries and a cucumber salad. The burger itself is moist and flavorful and the patty is really big. Wasnt expecting something that tastes like authentic medditeranean cooking from hipsterville but we were pleasantly surprised. Will definitely be back. Also the backyard garden is adorable so try to go when its nice out.
