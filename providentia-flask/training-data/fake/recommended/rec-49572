So the first time I came, I only got their veggie spring rolls & thai ice tea = wasn't impressed. This time, I got their pad thai (big portions) w/tofu w/the chili sauce on the side so I can control the spicyness - probably the best pad thai I've EVER had, seriously = was SO impressed. The wait is quite a bit (it's worth it) b/c it's a small place & they wait for all members of your party to arrive before they seat you, but the service is great & quick. Will definitely be coming back here, it's on the top of my list of thai food restaurants!
