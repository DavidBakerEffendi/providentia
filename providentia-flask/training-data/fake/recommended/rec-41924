Maysville will receive two stars from me for TWO reasons.  The first reason being that our waitress was super unfriendly and the second reason being that the ambiance was not great.  The interior felt cold and the lighting was too bright (picky I know).  But back to the waitress...she made my friend and I feel like she was just trying to get us in and out so she can move on to the next reservation.  It just did not feel like she wanted any part in adding to the experience.  She was kind of snappy.  When she came to take our order and we said we needed a bit more time, she looked at me like I had just murdered her entire family.  It was bizarre.  I thought it was just me who felt this way but when I asked my friend after she walked away, he was kind of weirded out as well.  So I recommend if you go here, to go eat at the bar.  The staff still needs better training on HOSPITALITY.  But now to the most important part..the dishes.  I had the crispy grits and the chicken for an entree.  The crispy grits were very good and the chicken entree was awesome.  I think overall this restaurant has a lot of promise.  If they put as much effort into their food as they can with training their staff I feel this review would of had a greater # of stars.  Cheers!
