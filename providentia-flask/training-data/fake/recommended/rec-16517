Good pizza doesn't have to be THIS expensive. Don't get me wrong the fresh mozzarella and ingredients make for a fresher tasting pizza. The sauce is good and the size is perfect. After a few bites all of that novelty starts to wear off rather quickly. I tried their pepperoni pie and thought it was quite good, but honestly for its reputation, I was rather underwhelmed. They were also pretty stingy with the amount of meat, and for the high price I'd expect a lot more toppings. Boo-urns. I expected more for New York pizza. Oh well, the search for BEST slice in New York continues. Bonus points if I can find a reasonably priced pie that delivers to my neighborhood.
