I was very optimistic, but the Say Cheesesteak, which both my wife and I had, was very underwhelming. The cheese itself was tasty, but the meat, for both of us, was somehow both dry and fatty, and just not a great experience. The menu has potential, but the actual sandwich is disappointingly lackluster. I should point out that this is also the 3rd time I tried to eat there after hearing a great review (from vegetarians, maybe stronger for them?) and Say Cheese being no-shows at different events they were scheduled for. Not worth the effort to have finally tracked them down, I'm afraid.
