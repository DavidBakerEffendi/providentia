I LOVE GOOD BEER!  This place has good beer!  Therefore:  I love Rattle 'N' Hum!!! Ok let's get serious:  there are A LOT of beers to choose from and I can only drink so much.  I'll be honest I cannot remember the names of the all the beer I drank - but I can recall drinking a stout that is a life changer (I believe it might have been the Southern Tier Mokah Stout) and an excellent blonde.  They have all their beers listed on the website so check that out.  The drafts range in price from $7-$10, but the bottle range from $7 to $25ish (but these are 22ozes).  The food is your typical pub food.   Warning - I went with a party of 12 and we really struggled to fit.  This is not the place for big parties.  Even though we were loud and annoying the wait staff was excellant, put up with all our seperate checks, and was surprisingly speedy.   For those of you who prefer a PBR, Natty light, or the like.... this is not the place for you.
