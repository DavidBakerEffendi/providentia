i've lived downtown for over 8 years and have been to great jones more than any other place. delicious, consistent, reasonably priced southern food and the best (free) juke box this side of bayonne. menu changes a bit each day, try the fried oysters, they're peeeerfect. then wash em down with a couple of shaggys (goslings rum and ginger beer).
