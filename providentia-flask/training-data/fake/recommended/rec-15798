I was visiting my friend on the UES and Uva was suggested by another friend who lives down in Murray Hill. We went for brunch this past Sunday and it was great! The place itself is absolutely adorable. Exposed brick. Candles in little nooks. Antique-y looking chandeliers. Now onto the food...they have a brunch special where you get an entree, side order, and a cocktail all for $19.95. No substitutions which is fine. I got the blueberry pancake. Yup, single. HOLY MOLY!! It came out and was the entire size of the plate! Delish and crispy on the outside and sprinkled with powdered sugar. YUMMMMY!! Pancetta as my side was nice and chewy with a tang of sweetness. Can't go wrong with a mimosa :) My friend got the market omelette with mushrooms, spinach, and feta with polenta and a huge cup of coffee (free refills). She had nothing but raves for everything. The bill comes and it did not include my meal, to which we brought to our waitress' attention. Some might scoff at this and only pay for the bill, but she was so great and having worked in hospitality, I know tips and bill close-outs are important. She thanked us profusely and said we would have good kharma for the day :) A GREAT find and when I visit again, there is no doubt we'll come back for dinner. Gotta try all those delicious looking tapas!
