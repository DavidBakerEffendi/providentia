The chocolate chip pudding dessert is amazing, but I was less impressed with their other dishes. Also a bit disappointed by the service -- they make it a point to refold your napkin when you leave for a moment to use the restroom, but getting a server to recognize you while you're actually sitting down is a bit of a challenge...
