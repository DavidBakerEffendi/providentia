A diner vibe that's sort of a scene with an Asian touch...I'm pleasantly confused. I sat at the bar and ordered shrimp tacos and charred green beans. The flavors are perfection! The portions were a little in the small side...like I'm thinking about ordering another green beans dish. The service was great. I'd come back next time I roll through town.
