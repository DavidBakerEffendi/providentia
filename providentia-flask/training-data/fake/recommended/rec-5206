We've lived in and around Ewing for many years but had never heard of Café 72 until we read the Yelp reviews.  The reviews convinced my family to give it a try.  We arrived at about 12:30 on a Saturday and discovered we could order from either the breakfast or lunch menu.  This was great news because the breakfast menu was so interesting, and the daily specials were intriguing.  A porkroll benedict?!  I'll try that next time. We tried the morning glorious pancakes (whole wheat, carrots, raisins and walnuts), the chicken and waffles, the Cajun shrimp benedict, the cheesesteak omelet, and the corned beef benedict.  The corned beef benedict was wonderful and we decided it was the #1 dish at the table, and nearly everything else was close behind, though the chicken and waffles was competent but not wonderful. Service, from a charming waitress, was very friendly and attentive.  The food came out so quickly that it was nearly like fast food!  We're going to tell all our friends about Cafe 72.   We learned that the restaurant has been there for years but was bought by new owners about a year ago.  The new owners seem to have taken the place on a new path, and we're delighted to discover it.  Long live Café 72!
