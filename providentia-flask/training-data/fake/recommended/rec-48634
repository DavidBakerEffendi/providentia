I sat at a table peering at the patrons, my two friends, and the surroundings when I came to the realization that this bar and grill is analogous to the parallel universe theory.  There must have been a drink special you say.  There was, $3 Sam Adams Winter on a Thursday.  But never mind that.  Because, you see, at the side of almost every U.S. route, there sits a bar just like this.  They will all have wooden interiors, relatively dark lighting, Americana menu, Sportscenter, and random drink specials.  Then there are, most probably, three normal dudes sitting at a normal looking table at every one of these places.  The faces are different, ages, body shapes, but yet still, three blokes at a bar on the side of a road. These gentlemen ordered food that all of those other gentlemen probably did as well.  The french dip came with a flavorful au jus.  Fish and chips, flounder, and good meaty fries.  Burger cooked to the correct temperature, enveloped with blackened grill char.  Typical things you'd find at a typical stretch of highway.  Even the conversation was ordinary of three dudes, mostly phallic humor.  And in this confined dimension of the multiverse, the Tiger's Tale exhibited all the traits of a proper roadside eatery.
