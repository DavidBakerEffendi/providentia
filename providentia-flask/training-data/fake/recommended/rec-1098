Hey kids! If you use HIMYM as a guidebook to New York you'll probably end up here because it's basically where Marshall got the 'best burger in New York' and was even mentioned in that episode. My friend was on a burger hunt and I took him here. We showed up, got shown to the back where tables were so close together that I basically shoved my ass into some German tourist's face. The service here is pretty...well it's not that good. The 'menu' was a board with hamburger, cheeseburger, bistro burger and the chili burger. I had no idea what the bistro burger was and so my friend asked our server what it was just as he was about to turn back because we didn't decide right away. A 'bistro burger' is just a bacon cheeseburger, by the way. We got fries as well which were just okay. The burger was thick, but small and honestly, nothing to be excited for. They serve McSorley's beer here but they've got a decent burger with house mustard for around the same price, if not cheaper. Definitely not the 'best' and there are better places around for a burger either basic or fancied up.
