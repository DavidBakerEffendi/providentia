I work in Midtown West and it is very difficult to find a good, inexpensive lunch in this area that doesn't come off a street vendor. I stumbled upon this place by accident one time when I was going somewhere else and saw people lined up around the corner for this place. I was immediately intrigued. The wait is well worth it as you can get a large soup and a sandwich for around $6.50. A deal that cannot be beat, especially in the area it's in. The sandwiches are all pre-made and are certainly not the staple of this little place. I've been here quite a few times and have not had a soup that wasn't delicious. Don't let the long line or extensive soup selection intimidate you they are extremely fast and efficient and are always willing to offer up free samples if you want to try a couple soups before deciding. I felt five stars was necessary here because it's just simply the best deal in the area by a landslide.
