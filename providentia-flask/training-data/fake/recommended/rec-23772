I moved to East Passyunk a year ago and Birra was our first night out ~ Christmas party of 7.  I loved it but decided to hit the street and try some other restaurants to see what else Passyunk Ave. had to offer.  We keep coming back.   They have what I call artisan pizza.  Each is a masterpiece.  I don't have the menu in front of me to recall each by name but I've enjoyed fresh mozzarella basil and tomato; pear and arugula, puttanesca, and my surprise favorite, buffalo chicken ~ THE BEST in South Philly.   I've had their small plates and I'm still trying to recreate a jalapeño corn muffin I had last Spring.  I even enjoy their specials ~ Pumpkin pasta most recently.  The draft beers are seasonal.  I find myself hitting the Bottle Stop on the way home to recreate the experience with my leftovers.  Casual and kid friendly but we leave them home for date nights ~ party of 2. :)
