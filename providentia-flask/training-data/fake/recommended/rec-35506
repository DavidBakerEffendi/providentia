I was in NYC last week and searched YELP for a new pizza place. I have to say thanks to all yelpers for your honest feedback cause that place was AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! My Best Friend lives out there and it was her first time there too. I believe that will be her new pizza spot. We got lucky and the manager there treated us like Queens and the servers were very sweet. But the Pizza was one of the best I've had, and I'm from Chicago so I'm bias when it comes to pizza. Luzzo's pizza and salads are definitely authentic, flavorful, and fresh!
