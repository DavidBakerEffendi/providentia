Oh man, I really wanted to love the famous burger but I couldn't do it. It's a solid burger but nothing special and it runs in the $7ish range. The server was brusque, rushed, and didn't speak english. Once upon a time, this was probably an amazing place to grab a beer and a burger but I'm guessing the tourist trade destroyed it.
