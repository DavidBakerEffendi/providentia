This place is so cute! I loved the decor, I went in right after Halloween and they just went all out and I loved how festive it was! There was quite a wait, but it wasn't as bad as I would have thought, the staff was courteous and if people were waiting outside, they took the time to walk down the stairs and outside to make sure the person was there. The wait staff was very nice and brought the food quite fast as well, and they have an awesome breakfast, especially after a long night out. They also have this adorable outdoor patio (no one was sitting there because it was cold) but the place is alot larger than you think. Love the little diner portion and the counter.
