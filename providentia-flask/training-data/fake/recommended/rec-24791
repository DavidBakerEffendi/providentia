Very good pizza accompanied by equally solid service. I went on a Sunday evening and was able to get right in without a wait. The service was prompt, efficient and delivered with a smile. The pizza was very good although Lou Malnatis in Chicago is my favorite. Prices are reasonable and the pizzas are enormous, a small will easily serve two with left overs. When you visit Lombardis leave your credit cards at home because they only take cash.
