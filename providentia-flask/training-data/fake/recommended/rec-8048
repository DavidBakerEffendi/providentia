One of my favorite wine bars in the city.  I come all the time for the excellent small plates and great wine selection.  The patio outside is also lovely when the weather merits it.   All of the food I've had at Ardesia is extremely high quality.  I rarely order deviled eggs; however, I saw another table order them and I thought they looked too good to pass up.  The deviled eggs are really special--the sauce on the is amazing.  I didn't want to leave any of it left on the plate.  The grilled shrimp are also great.  They are perfectly crisp and flavorful.  I recently had balsamic cauliflower which was very tasty as well.  The menu constantly changes and I've never had anything new that was not delicious.   Also of note: the music is great.  They play lots of Phoenix and other good alternative stuff that just makes me happy.   Ardesia is great.  That's all I have to say.
