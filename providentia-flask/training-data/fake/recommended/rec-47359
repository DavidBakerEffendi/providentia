The atmosphere was great, exactly what i was looking for: small place, cute tables, waiters in stripped shirts. i had the pasta with cauliflower, kale and broccoli, which was alright, but i would suggest ordering something else. but the pecan tart with bourbon ice cream was something to write home about (i would go just for that).
