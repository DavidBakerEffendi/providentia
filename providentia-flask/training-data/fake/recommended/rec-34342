This is a decent-sized sports bar, with many TVs and two big projection screens.  The volume level is good.  There is a DJ/ announcer that hypes up each team's scoring. The service was good, the food menu is OK and very typical of sports bars (unhealthy fried snacks and burgers/wings). One negative comment, they did not serve free water and each 16oz. bottle of spring water was $2.75.  That is very poor business practice for a restaurant.
