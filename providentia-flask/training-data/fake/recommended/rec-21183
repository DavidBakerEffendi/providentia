I have been here twice: once just to takeout truffle fries (my addiction) and the second time was tonight. I have read in other reviews that there is usually a long wait but wmy friend and I were seated right away. We ordered the truffle fries without the parmesan and with the truffle salt. They were really good as always. I have tried 4 places in NY so far that sell truffle fries and these are my favorite. I ordered the Truffle Beet Salad but since I am vegan I can not have dairy and asked for it without the cheese. When I got the dressing I saw it was creamy so I asked what is in it and the waitress went to check. About 5 minutes later she came back and asked how the food was and I had to ask her again to check on what is in the dressing. Another 5 minutes and she told me it had eggs in it. It really took a while for the whole process only to find out if the dressing has eggs or dairy. I then asked for a different dressing of maybe a vinaigrette of truffle oil and vinegar but she brought out vinegar and olive oil.. So not so much for a truffled beet salad. I asked if I could have it wit truffle oil instead and she said no. So the salad was nothing special just a bunch of arugula with 5 slices of beets and toasted pepitas. Also, it is served on this tiny plate with no corners so it is really hard to eat it without the arugula falling off. I do love the truffle fries so I will definitely come back for those.. But maybe only that.
