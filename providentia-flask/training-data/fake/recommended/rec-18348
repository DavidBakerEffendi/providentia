Really great food & atmosphere for rich hipsters, but very crowded and the drinks are VERY expensive. Of the 6 times I've attempted to go, I've been turned away 3 times because it's too busy. I have to say though, go early and sell your soul and save up for a bypass... and then order the short rib cheese fries.  Sounds disgusting, yeah? Well, they were unbelievable.  My normally classy and refined friends were scraping the pan and fighting over the left over bits.  We were going to order another, but were late for a show and were a bit tired of being jammed in the ribs by the waiters and waitresses running by.  Their selection of bourbons and scotches is top-notch, but be ready to pay more than you'd expect.  Hey, Garces is an Iron Chef now. Pay up suckas!   Would recommend and go again on a moment's notice even though I'm broke. :D
