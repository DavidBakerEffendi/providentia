We live around the corner and have been wanting to review this place for a while now. We absolutely love it! French cuisine when done right is unbeatable, throw in some Senegalese fusion into the mix and the result is divine. It's fine dining with a twist- classic french dishes with african aromas, The quality of food should have the place packed everyday but it remains an underrated gramercy gem. It's not cheap but it's worth it. The steak is sublime, the mushroom risotto is fantastic and the Senegalese chicken dish looks simple but has complex layers of taste and spiciness that fills your mouth on the first bite. nice for a quiet dinner for two, also works for groups. This is a family run place and the people are super warm nice and very friendly, during rush hours (weekend dinner etc) they are sometimes understaffed and the food takes longer, but be patient- it really is worth it - highly recommended !
