Also used a Groupon and were not made to feel like 'poor relations.'  Our lovely waitress even told us what most everyone orders, and accordingly , we both had the rib eye, which was a great steak - perfectly prepared, crispy charred on outside, medium rare inside as ordered, with generous veggies. House wine that came with it was just fine, along with nice desserts which, if there was any flaw there, it was that after the awesome entree they were somwhat of an afterthought (this from a 'dessert' person.  Only quibble is the menu price of the steak, which we of course didn't pay, seemed excessive at $30. I'd say it was a $22 or $24 steak, tops. Not in terms of quality, but it's not huge. All that said, point of groupons, from the biz's point of view, I believe, is to draw new customers. We never would have known of this place, but both said we would come back without a 'deal'. Great new find.
