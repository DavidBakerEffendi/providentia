My favorite Italian place on the strip in Little Italy. The food is always delicious and fresh. I have frequented the place about 4 or so times and would still go back. For the perfect night in little italy, head over to the Mulberry Street Cafe for Yeungling on tap, proceed to dinner, check out the little shops open late while you arrive at your final destination...FERRRA'S for dessert! Yum!
