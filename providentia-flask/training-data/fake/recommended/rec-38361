I just went to Burlington for an interview and had dinner at Sweetwaters. The place is VERY cute and the prices (I'm comparing to LA) are just fine. In fact, if you went to a restaurant this pretty in LA, you'd be dishing out waaay more than 10 bucks a burger... That being said, even though the place was pretty empty the hostess ignored us for a while...we ended up seating ourselves at a table by the bar. The waiter was nice enough to make up for it though.
