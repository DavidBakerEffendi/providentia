Highly recommend doing the tasting menu.  It's pretty worth it at 35/pp considering all the food you get.  All the dishes were very tasty but the highlight is really the pig's feet (just suspend your preconceived notions about pig's feet until you put a piece in your mouth becase you will like it) The wait staff is very helpful and cheery.  Thoroughly enjoyed my experience and will be back again.  Since the place is small, I would recommend making a reservation.
