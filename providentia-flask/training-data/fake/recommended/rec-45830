Yum! I was so won over by this place I had to write a review. My experience did not start out so great. I walked into the dingy, cramped space and was not even acknowledged by the 2 bored workers behind the counter. I was a little disappointed in the somewhat limited menu, but settled on the veggie sandwich with guacamole on the 7 grain bread. I grabbed a bottle of water and was a bit surprised when the total for that and my sandwich came to over $10. Seems a bit steep for a pretty basic sandwich. I grabbed a table outside on Church street and unwrapped what I assumed would be a sandwich as lackluster as the place from which it came. Boy was I wrong! With one bite, I forgot everything I disliked about this place. The bread is by far the best I've ever tasted - freshly baked and soft and chewy. Everything was so incredibly fresh and delicious and they were very generous with the guacamole, which I love. If I was just rating the food, this place would easily be 5 stars, but I guess the Red Onion has figured out that when your food is this good, it doesn't matter how bad your service, appearance, and prices are. Will I be back in spite of all this? Absolutely! I can't wait to see if all their sandwiches are this good.
