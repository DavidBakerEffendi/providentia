i am so charmed by penelope. she's adorable. situated in the crook of a busy street, one could easily miss the quaint brunch location. however, i am awesome and did not miss it when i walked by the other day and then proceeded to look it up on yelp when i got home and then INSIST on trying it the next morning. totally worth it. the interior alone is tiffany blue and white. (my favorite. yes i am a princess. no i don't think it's a problem). there was a recipe embossed in the wood table (i thought about writing it down but then didn't have a pen) and pretty much everyone in the joint was attractive. (sans the british tourists that sat next to us but they made up for it by having accents and being nice) since i only associate with pretty people, this was my kind of brunch place. Â i also liked the free coffee before getting seated. it was good... and free. the food deserves a 3 star. it wasn't special. i got the penny egg sandwich on a croissant. it was good. i like that they have soysage. jason got an omelet- his was decent but not the best (actually coopertown has better..i say this through gritted teeth because coopertown sucks balls other than their omelets) the ambiance gives it a 4. it should actually be 3.5 but yelp needs to get on it with the halfsies.
