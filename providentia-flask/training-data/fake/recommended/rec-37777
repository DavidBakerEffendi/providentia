Totally disappointed and I'm genuinely confused how this place is getting such good reviews. Was really excited to go to a place with spicy food, as I love spicy food.  The food isn't spicy at all.  On a scale of 1-10 the 10 (spiciest dish they make) is more like a 2.  My wife easily ate it and she can't really eat spicy food. The dan dan noodles were mushy and not very good, and that was the best thing we had.  The dumplings in hot oil were awful.  The double cooked pork belly was worse than the dumplings.  The mini-wok lamb dish we ordered was pretty bad but at least we ate half of that.  Even the rice was bad. I'm baffled.  Either everyone in the world doesn't know what good food is or what spicy means, or I've become too picky.  My wife said the exact same thing as we were leaving.  She said everyone raves about the place and even Anthony Bourdain visited there, and she thought it was terrible. It was so bad my wife asked to have the pork belly wrapped and as we were walking back to the car I threw it in in the trash receptacle. This isn't good Chinese food, or even good food in general.  If you want good Chinese, go to Sang Kee Duck house or Shiao Lan Kung.  They are both light years better than this place.
