This could easily be a FIVE star restaurant. If the server stepped up the attention to detail....."how's the food" etc...didn't see her until I was almost done with food.  Also...kitchen closed at 11 pm..which I though was really really bad..."last call for food and drinks" and it was 10:45 pm and we are in Manhattan...lol maybe their food/alcohol lic is only good until 11...who knows :-(   First...start night at the bar and TALK to "Antonio"   this guy makes amazing drinks.  Try his "specialty" drinks.  He always says..."try it if you don't like it...I'll make you another one" super sharp bartender and he will get your night started the right way!  In fact. .stay at bar for drinks and food. .. and you'll have a great experience .  Ceviche plater (paqueo pacifico is amazing) as for dinner all our plates where amazing.  Have fun.
