I went there with my husband and his cousin for late breakfast. Everything was okay beside service! Our server was kind a rude. We gave our order and she came back  with missing order, we told her we asked for two breakfast plate and she kind a yelled us said we made her confuse. We said sorry and requested other breakfast plate and bakery plate . She brought breakfast plate without bakery plate. My husband said to her"we also ordered bakery plate" which is coming with very tasty simit and bakery stuff. She rolled her eyes and said "oh guys you are making me confuse" my husband said "if you are not sure repeat your order and make sure you got the right order" she was still rude and said "okay" and walked away. Three star because of service breakfast plate, pastrami omelet, and bakery plate was delicious. We will give them another chance,hope next time this  server will loose her attitude.
