A couple blocks from my house, I've walked by this place a few times, but thought it was a fried chicken dump. Then found it on Yelp and decided to try it out. Food was delicious and surprising (was that a kimchi pickle thing hiding amongst the sweet potato next to the steak-- which was tender and cooked perfectly?). Oddly sweet but yummy salad with figs, pomegranates and was that tapiocas? Very inventive recipes but all very tasty. Excellent cocktail and friendly service too! I'll definitely be back.
