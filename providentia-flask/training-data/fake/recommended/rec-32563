Love this place! Excellent customer service, great food and drinks, and so inviting atmosphere! I usually come here for brunch; their Prosciutto Di Parma Eggs Benedict is to die for, but any other meal is just perfect here. It's also good for big parties; whenever I have guests in NY, I take them to Aurora and all of them have been delighted with the food and service. The staff is amazing; everyone is so kind and caring; first time you come back, they will recognize you. Not to mention that for such a quality the prices are so reasonable... A quietly chic place!
