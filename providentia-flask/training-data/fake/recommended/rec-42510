Had an exceptional Saturday brunch there on a beautiful warm October Saturday. We had a reservation, but unlike most places in the city these days where you have a reservation and have to wait thirty minutes anyway- we were seated immediately. Our waitress was terrific but the staff all help each other, which means quick water refills and drink orders. Cocktail menu is good, beer selection is excellent. Had the pulled pork sandwich and as a native southerner this was a tough sell for me, but I tried. It was up there with the better Carolina BBQ pulled pork sandwiches I've had. Braised bacon will make you almost dislike normal bacon. Wife had an omelet; others in group raved about duck in the tubetti and portions, which weren't small as some reviews suggested. Ambience is pleasant- I worry that the place has too much space. Hopefully others will enjoy this place as much as we did.
