i have only gone for sunday brunch, but it is the best brunch in the area i've had.  their crabcake benedict is out of this world, and everything from their eggs to pancakes and french toast, to simple granola is really amazing.   the atmosphere is cute and artsy, a nice place to take friends.  the chairs are funky and different, allowing you for many different choices with respect to your favorite body position (like a couch, a high seat by the window, or a regular chair with various cushions and back rests).  there are many cute items around the place, like upside down coffee mugs (light fixtures), or decorative dragonflies hanging off the ceiling made of household items. the waitstaff has been great (especially if you get tony) and the food comes quickly considering its complexity.  all waiters wear shirts with amusing writing on the back so you can entertain yourself reading them while waiting for your amazing meal...  this is definitely one of my favorite breakfast places on sunday mornings...  get there early if you don't want to wait.
