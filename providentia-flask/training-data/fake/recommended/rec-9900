The customer service was crappy, I had to tell both guys my order three times and I only wanted a small. Two guys who ordered like 3 jumbo fries each Â got their orders before me when I was in line before them. This time my fries were crispy, but they could have been crispier. I liked the pomegranate dipping sauce although I did not taste any pomegranate. Creative dipping sauces, but that's about it.
