My friend and I walked around the city and ended up in the West Village.  Spotted Pig was on my bucket list of restaurants to try.  We called at 5:30 and they didn't have a long waiting time - we showed up around 6:45ish.  The hostess informed us that there was an hour and half wait but the bar was free for all! Found a great spot by the window (great for people watching) and sat down by 7:30.  We ordered two on tap beers, the infamous burger, and the goat cheese with prosciutto as an entree.  For dessert we ordered the Lemon seasonal tart and flourless chocolate cake.  AMAZING all of it!! I would highly recommend going and will be back!
