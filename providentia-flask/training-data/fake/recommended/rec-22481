Although I don't think it's the most amazing place in the world this place is definitely worth the trip especially if you are drunk, a tourist, or quite possibly both. Beware though, there are many impostors along the way. I got the the chicken and lamb combo, pretty good, and for seven bucks it goes a long way. The white sauce is great.
