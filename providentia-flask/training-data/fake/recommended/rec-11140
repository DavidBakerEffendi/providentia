GO VILLAGE WHISKEY !!!!! Really good food that sticks to your bones and fills you up in a flavorful way.   I had the Popcorn Shrimp the Pork Sammy and those excellent Duck Fries that are nice and crispy.   The pork was perfect with the fried pickles and that slaw just cut the taste perfectly... Look here...if you are looking for a nice bite and reasonable prices for that area of the city I suggest it strongly. Peace. Out. Matty.
