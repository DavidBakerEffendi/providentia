Good BBQ restaurant! I always wanted to try it & when they opened in Bklyn, it was a must. I had the brisket & it was very good. The mashed potatoes, mac & cheese we're good as well. My husband had a platter with pulled pork, brisket & sausage, he was a little dissapointed with the smaller portion. Will try again!
