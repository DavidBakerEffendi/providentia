Being an out-of-towner, I can't recommend Penelope over any other brunch spot, but it was enjoyable none-the-less.  Went for brunch on a Saturday morning, before 11 am, and my party of 2 was seated immediately.  The atmosphere was really nice and with the wine bottles against the wall, it looks like a place I'd like to try out for drinks some time.   I ordered the Sam I Am which was good, but nothing to write home about.  Penelope seems like a great place to go with your girlfriends to recap the night before, but in terms of the food itself, I'd be just as happy with a taylor ham, fried egg and cheese on a hard roll at some corner deli.
