Best wings in town! The Hot & Sweet sauce is always a hit when I bring someone for their first time. Every now and then, they will feature a new item as a weekly special. This week, they featured a BBQ flatbread that I loved. Also, the staff is very nice. If you're looking for a great bar to catch your favorite team play, this is just the place. They also have two pool tables! :)
