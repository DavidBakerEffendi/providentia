Mmmm, Market Table.  Joey Campanaro does not disappoint with Market Table.  If you are a fan of the Little Owl, then you will love Market Table.  The Yellow Fin Tuna appetizer is amazing and just the right blend of spice and citrus.  From the main courses, all of the fish dishes are incredible, especially the arctic char.  I particularly enjoyed the whole fish (branzino), but I didn't care for the escarole mix that it was served on top of.  It really didn't compliment the flakiness of the fish.  I felt like the whole fish could be served simply with olive oil and lemon over greens or something a bit lighter.  The pan roasted chicken is also quite good and is served over a yummy sweet potato salad with brown butter.  Overall I really enjoy Market Table. I have been there several times and have not been disappointed yet.
