When in Rutherford where else would you eat breakfast?  Why are you asking me?  This was my first real time in Rutherford proper.  A place is called a Pancake House, I'm thinking it is probably worth a try.  Plus when with friends who live there, you go with what the local tells you.  It is just that simple. It was time for breakfast after a friend and I competed in a 5K.  I didn't want to go too greasy as that would've defeated the purpose of the run.  That is a tough thing to do in a breakfast joint, but certainly fun to try. Huevos Rancheros.  That is what I ordered.  Two eggs your way with Chorizo, Frijoles, Pico de Gallo, Sharp Cheddar and Corn Tortillas.  Yes, there is chorizo in this dish.  What are you going to do?  It is really tough to avoid breakfast meats.  I don't eat them often, but when I do I tend to go more towards the sausages and the like. This tasted especially good on this day.  Probably due to the fact that I burned some good calories a few hours before.  That and I had also not eaten anything in a good long time.  I'm sure it would have tasted good even if not for all of these factors. I'm not sure how many breakfast spots there are in Rutherford, but this one is a good place to start out with.
