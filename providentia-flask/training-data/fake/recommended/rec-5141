My friends and I stopped by Umami Burger for a "second dinner" snack of sorts after our first dinner left us rather hungry. For a Saturday night around 8pm, we were seated reasonably promptly at one of the upstairs tables near the window, which gives a great view of the street and the area in general. One of my friends ordered the Original Burger, while the rest of us opted to snack on the Sweet Potato Fries and the Truffle Fries. Having said that, our waiter was a bit taken aback by what he perceived to be a small amount of food, and rather rudely said, "That's it? No burgers?" to the ladies of the table. Wow. Stinkeye much? The Sweet Potato Fries were decent, but not very eye-opening. The Truffle Fries were a bit better, with crisp to the potato itself and a definitive truffle flavour. However, like other folks have mentioned, the sauce started coagulating over time -- while it didn't detract from the flavour much, the consistency issues are a bit off-putting. I'd return to try a wider selection of their menu, but hopefully we won't get a judgmental waiter next time around. Ugh.
