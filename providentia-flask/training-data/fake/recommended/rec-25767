My favorite Italian in New York.  I've been coming here for years.  They usually know my order even if it's been a year since my last visit.  The lobster cannelloni is def. the dish to have and do yourself a favor and order a bottle of the house red.  A true classic NYC dining experience.  However MAKE A RESERVATION!!!!!
