This place is unlike any Chinese restaurant I've ever been to.  I stumbled onto this place just walking around looking for a meal and I knew from the moment I opened the menu that I was going to love it.  I've come to terms with the fact that I'm a spice addict and Han has all the heat I can handle!   It reminds me a little of a Thai restaurant with the different degrees of spiciness labeled on the dishes but of course in a Chinese style which is light years removed from the predictable menus of every other cookie cutter Chinese restaurant.  The dishes are very inventive, creative, and fresh and the ingredients compliment each other so well that I find myself eating everything together instead of pushing certain veggies to the side which I tend to do at less delicious places.  The portion sizes are pretty good i think (of course, when it's this tasty you always wish there was more!)   When my out of town friends come to visit me, this is where I take them for dinner!
