For years I have been hearing about Pat's and Geno's.  Flying from San Diego to Philly all I could think about was sinking my teeth into the thinly sliced steak smothered with the best condiment ever created (Cheese Whiz) the anticipation was killing me.  So soon as I got off the long flight my friend and I drove straight there stomach growling the whole way. Finally I could see the neon lights from a distance and my mouth started to water. I decided to start with half of  "Whiz, wit" at Pat's and then half of the same from Geno's after the first bite of each I realized what I have been fantasizing about for the last 5 hours on my flight was all for nothing it was just OK I can honestly can say I have made better cheese steaks in my dorm room back in the day with a George Foreman grill and Steak-Umms. Besides the OK flavor of the meat at both joints I would have to say Geno's had better bread but less meat and If I had to decide between the two I would say Geno's but probably only because the cheese whiz covered up the bland taste of the meat. But if you love food it is a great landmark to visit but beware don't go into it thinking it will be the best thing you have ever sunk your teeth in...
