Absolutely every part of this meal was amazingly delicious.  From start to finish we were surprised by the creativity yet clean simplicity of each dish.  The pistachio crusted striped bass was heavenly... But so was everything else! Finally, a knowledgeable waitstaff, she knew the Greek wines well, and provided great service.  We found the place last minute on Yelp...saved the evening once again.  We WILL return!
