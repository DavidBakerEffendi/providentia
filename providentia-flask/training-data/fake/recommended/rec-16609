Overall, great food! For four people, we shared lamb, beef, clams, cauliflower, and brussel sprouts.  About half of the clams seemed undercooked/rotten/otherwise bad, but the remaining clams were great.  Our waiter told us that this was not enough food for us, so we held onto a menu to see if we would want to order anything else.  We didn't.  In fact, we didn't even finish everything.  Cute little place.  I could see going back here.
