Super friendly staff. I went for my first time on a day when Localvore had been selling $5 for $10 coupons. The food was great. Sandwiches are made to order with fresh ingredients. Lunch can be a very busy time. Â Like I said above, I had a coupon for $10 for $5 and when I asked if most of the customers were using these today, the woman replied it was the third she had all day! Long lines should tell you about the establishment. Worth the wait. Call ahead of you can.
