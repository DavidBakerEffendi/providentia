This is by far one of the best restaurants I have been to in a while, and I think that I am about to label it as my favorite in the area. The restaurant is very quaint, and the tables are close together, but this is expected given its location, and honestly, did not bother us at all. The service was great, descriptions of the meals were clear and the server definitely knew each item on the menu in detail. Sometimes if I see two items on the menu which have me torn, I rely heavily on the authenticity of their descriptions. That said, I was very happy with my choice. Food: As I had not been here before, I decided to stick with their signature dishes, the meatball sliders to start and the pork chop for mains. What a great choice, the sliders were simply delicious, with a lovely smooth gravy. The Pork Chop was extremely tasty. I definitely recommend these two if you've not eaten here before. All in all, I am happy to give this restaurant five stars, it's not cheap but these days you pay for what you get.
