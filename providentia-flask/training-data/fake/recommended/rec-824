I'm not sure what all the hype is about here. The first time I went here I remember eating my tacos and being genuinely surprised at how bland and flavorless they were. The only thing I ate that had any flavor was the tortilla. After my first experience I decided I wouldn't eat here again, but SO many people have told me that I needed to give it another shot... so I did. I got two different orders of tacos this time, this first time I got the Texican which was a fairly generic choice. This time I got the tilapia tacos and the pork tacos with some kind of mango stuff on them. Now these tacos where still, unbelievably bland! I couldn't even finish either of my orders because they were so unappealing and just kind of gross. The tilapia was soggy and covered in a sauce that was globbed on as to make up for the flavorless fish I assume. The pork taco has no essence of mango that I tasted and it was INCREDIBLY dry and actually difficult to swallow. The pork itself had a bizarre taste to it, kind of like an old, dry can of tuna fish. Now let me just finish this review by saying that I love mexican food, and I love it so much that pretty much as long as you give me a taco thats even remotely good, I'll be really freakin' happy about it, but this was just a waste of money, a waste of time and a huge disappointment.
