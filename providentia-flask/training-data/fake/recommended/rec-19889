I thought this place was a tad overrated. Â Took me like 3 trys to get in here because this place is always packed even when it just opens. Your best bet would be to make a reservation if you really want to go to this place. I thought the food was awesome just wished they removed the bone in the pork chop.Also wish the drink list was more extensive. Service was good but I've had more attentive waiters. All in all you will have a great time with amazing food in an awesome area. Worth checking out
