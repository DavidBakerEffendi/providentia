me: so you know about the "campaign for hot girls", right? b: no, what's that? me: it's a charitable organization that supports the right of people like you and i to gaze at hot girls whenever we go out. b: you are talking crap again aren't you? me: uh huh. but you have to admit they did a good job in this place... it's saturday night. 10.30pm.  we are sat at the bar in balthazar. b is gorging on the moule frites, i the steak.  it is perfectly competent brasserie fare.  not bad, not brilliant. same as always. the steak comes as ordered; rare is actually rare, not some prophylactic "medium".  it all hits the spot. b is struggling with the effects of last night, so we make modest with the wine: a carafe of marc olliviere's muscadet, and some  bourgueil to wash down my meat.  the wine list, as ever, is packed with obscure bargains.   i sit and chew.  my belly fills with french comfort food. i slurp wine.  b begins to seem taller, smarter and way funnier than when we came in. he tells stories.  i laugh.  he flirts with some girls next to him at the bar.   i people watch. i'm thinking i may just be able to finish the bourgueil.
