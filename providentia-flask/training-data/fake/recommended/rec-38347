The beer selection gets 4.5 stars. Lots of beer here and many different types. I tried 3 different ones tonight and was thrilled with them all. The food was 3.5 stars because it was nothing mind blowing, but it was good. My friends and I ordered the $14 cheese plate and were pleasantly surprised by the size. It came with a good amount of cheese and meat, oranges/apples, olives/pickles and crostini. Not bad for $14! I then ordered a chicken slider and a beef slider (each for $3.50). They were TINY! It was more like a meatball on a teenie bun than a slider. Not worth the $3.50 each. They weren't bad, just not worth the money.
