3.5 stars but rounded up. I made a reservation for 9 people on a Monday night for dinner. Unforunately, they don't seat you until your whole party is present. It's a relatiely small restaurant but has a pretty/trendy/low-lit decor. The service was good despite it being so busy, and the food cameout relatively quick as well. The food is cheap but good! Appetizers: 1) Room Service Tuna Tartar (minced tuna, wasabi, tobiko, mayonnaise, sweet soy sauce, red onions, thai balls and scallions. served with crispy tortilla) 2) Tofu Tod (crispy tofu served with crushed peanuts in a sweet chili dipping sauce) 3) Honey Glazed Ribs (with cherry wine and bangkok spices) - the ribs were cooked well and the tofu was different but the tuna was the best appetizer Entrees: 1) Pad Thai gstir-fried rice noodles with brown tofu, eggs, bean sprouts, scallions and crushed peanuts) 2) Bangkok Chicken Pumpkin Curry (thai herbs and spices blended in roasted chili paste with kaffir lime leaves simmered in coconut milk served with thai basil) 3) Thai Mango Blackened Fish (with bangkok-style lemongrass mango salsa sauce) 4) Grilled Ginger Honey Pork Chop (marinated pork chop sirloins with ginger, cherry wine and herbs served with saut√©ed mixed vegetables in a garlic sauce) Mango Lemongrass Chicken (grilled marinated lemongrass chicken breasts with mango sauce served with steamed string beans) - I had orded the fish which I really enoyed. I tasted the other dishes as well which were all well seasoned. My only complaint is that the pork chops were a little tough. Desserts: 1) Thai Pumpkin Flan 2) Kaffir Lime Pie 3) Green Tea Ice Cream 4) Chocolate Mousse Cake 5) Cheesecakewith lychee ginger sauce - none really stood out but they were all good
