Hands down the best churrascaria I've been to.  Let me break it down: 1.  The cheese rolls.  These things are more dangerous than the garlic cheese bread at the Red Lobster.  Pastry-like on the outside and cheesy-chewy on the inside.  Give me a nice French storefront and I would be able to hawk these for $3/roll.  I ate about 8 of these little things, so that makes the price of the rest of my lunch $8.  This place is a great deal! 2.  The meat.  This place actually has really good cuts of steak, including rib-eye and filet mignon.  Other Brazilian BBQ places I've been to have only had lesser cuts of meat (e.g., sirloin, flank, etc.).  So kudos to Fogo for pulling out the gourmet sh*t.   The seasoning is also excellent.  I'm able to eat all of their steak without needing any steak sauce, which is the way it's supposed to be.  For most of the cuts, they use only coarse salt and maybe pepper and that's enough.  They also have a garlic rub which is pretty good. 3.  Babyback ribs.  Not quite as good as the steak, but still pretty darn good.  Takes the edge off of losing Tony Roma's in SF. 4.  Papaya cream dessert thing.  It's like a high class milkshake.  Refreshing after a heavy all-you-can-eat steak dinner. 5.  The service.  These guys (and yes, they're all guys with the exception of the hostess) are really nice.  They are attentive, but not intrusive.  Also, my fiance needed a stapler and they brought one out from the back office. 6.  Butter mints.     I've been here for both lunch and dinner, and the exact same menu is served for both.
