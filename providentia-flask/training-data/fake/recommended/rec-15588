Found this adorable place on yelp while my friend and I were on a quest for a Saturday morning brunch. We were too hungry to stand in line for Jane, and not wanting to venture too far from our friend's place on Thompson, I looked up local brunch places and this was the closest thing with 4 stars, so we decided to give it a try! Firstly, I absolutely loved the open front of the restaurant. The restaurant itself is quite small, but the tasteful decor and relaxed atmosphere made for a very chill, enjoyable brunching experience. This is what I imagine it feels like to brunch in a modern Parisian cafe (although I can't say for sure on account of me never having been to Paris... :( but regardless, this place is CUTE)! The food itself was quite tasty. I got the special french toast they had that day, which consisted of four enormous half slices of french toast stuffed with a fluffy cream cheese filling and chunks of strawberry, and topped with a generous portions of fresh mango, cantaloupe, and fig! Mmmm fig :) The french toast itself was decent, however I found the filling to be a bit bland and a little too heavy, even with all the strawberries in it. Overall, I liked it, but definitely not anything mind-blowing. Order it if you like french toast and fruits! My friend got the eggs benedict with salmon. I stole one or two bites off of her plate and I was pretty impressed. The eggs were poached and seasoned very well. It went perfectly with the smoked salmon (but really can you ever go wrong with smoked salmon?), and the seasoned potatoes served with the dish were super yummy! After eating here, I am so glad that we were too hungry to wait for Jane. I am completely charmed by Vin et Fleurs.
