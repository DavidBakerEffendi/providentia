Carnivores unite! I love this place, not only for their 15 different, unlimited meat options, but for their great naturally gluten-free sides and salad bar. I believe there are only a few options they serve that have gluten in them, including beer-basted Chicken, wheat bread on the salad bar, and tabbouleh. The bread that is served on the table is made with tapioca flour and is SAFE! I had NO idea it would be gluten free because it looked and smelled way too good! The crispy polenta, which is one of my favorite sides ever, is also gluten free and incredible. Â Prepare to feast when you come here. It is worth every penny!
