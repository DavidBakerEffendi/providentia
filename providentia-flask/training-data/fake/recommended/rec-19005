Not only do you get a French accent on the phone when you call for reservations (I was shocked they take them, but very worth it as the place was packed even early on a Saturday night), you get an incredibly authentic experience from the decor to the food. Three of us split a cheese plate (huge and some of the best roquefort I've ever had), a salad (also huge with wonderful dressing), and then each got a savory crepe. Not your average crepe place as two of us got one with mergeuz sausage, a pepper ratatouille, and a fried egg on top. Fantastic. While they don't take credit cards, totally worth the trip and very accessible via the L.
