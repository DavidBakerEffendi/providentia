I just went on a date with my fiance here and they have some of the best food I have eaten in awhile. That kind of dinner where you have to say something about every bite you take. I drank a ton of their amazing rose and sat outside in the lovely spring weather. I liked this place when it was Fresh Table and it is even better now. Their scallops are the bomb and they hooked it up with some seriously delicious blue cheese before the meal came. I love it. I want to go there every night but I'm too poor to do that so I will just dream about their roasted garlic on their awesome bread until the next time. Kudos Juventino. I am impressed.
