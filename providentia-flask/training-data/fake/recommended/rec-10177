i don't get the hype of penelope. their price is good and the ambiance is adorable but their food especially during the weekend waits is not worth it. i've gone for lunch and weekend brunch and considering that there was absolutely no wait during lunch hours, it was fine but when i had to wait more than hour for their saturday brunch when the food is no better than diner breakfast, i didn't understand why. it's a cute place to go in theory but not worth the wait for their food.
