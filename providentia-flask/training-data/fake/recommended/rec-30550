I would give ABC Kitchen 5 stars but it's so hard to get a reservation there.  I'm just going to say, I love this restaurant.  Hands down my favorite restaurant in the city and I will happily belly up to the bar to get my fix.  What I love:  salted caramel sundae, roasted beets with yogurt, spinach pizza, roasted carrots and avocado sundae.   The ambiance is incredible.  If they could come and decorate my apartment (and feed me daily) I would be in heaven.  LOVE.
