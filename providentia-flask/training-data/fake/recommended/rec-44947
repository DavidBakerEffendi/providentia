I recently ate dinner at the Little Owl on 07/11/2011.  We had no reservations and it was after 7pm. The hostess took my number and promised to call if something opened up.  She called not long after and somehow squeezed us in.  The food was superb, the staff was amazing, the feel of the restaurant was cozy yet comfortable at the same time. What truly impressed me was the fact that I requested an itemized receipt two weeks after my visit via email and was shocked when i received a response within 20 minutes.  I'll be back.
