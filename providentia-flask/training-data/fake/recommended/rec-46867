Great local cafe in the heart of the Italian Market in Philadelphia. Sabrina's Cafe serves an eclectic menu where breakfast, served all day, is the star. I started out with a hummus platter plated with fresh hummus, roasted red peppers, olives, cucumber, and pita (minus the feta). For lunch I ordered the Vegan Brunch. Three corn tortillas, seitan, roasted vegetable salad with bell peppers, carrots, red onions, zucchini, guacamole, pico de gallo, and a side of fresh fruit. A great place to take your non-vegan friends with lots of options sure to delight all palates.
