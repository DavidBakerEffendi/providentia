if you can bare the willyb hipster's who dine here, it's amazing. staff is chill. i come here mostly when i'm hungover and for brunch and it's always satisfying. i know it's good because after a long day and night of drinking i don't end up puking it up. order (not all in one sitting) fried chicken, any breakfast egg sandwich, any omelet, any burger (if you get the breakfast burger get the gravy on the side), any breakfast bowl. i'm not a fan of the tots, but the sweet potato fries are on point. LOVE YA'S JIMMY'S! amen for the donuts too.
