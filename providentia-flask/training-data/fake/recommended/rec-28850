Had a dinner reservation here and so far this place gets 3 stars . I wish they had cocktails mixed drinks etc since they don't have a full bar , would've gone so well with my sushi dinner . Sushi was delicious , fresh , and fulfilling . But the seating gets packed so quickly so I had to make a reservation , that's why one star is subtracted from my review . Overall , I would go back again and try something else on their menu .
