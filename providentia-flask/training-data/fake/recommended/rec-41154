I forgot to review this from when I went in June. Luckily, I checked in on Yelp to remind myself later. My sister and I came up to Brooklyn, NY to visit a friend and he brought us here for "the best Ramen in the area". Now...in DC I'm only familiar with Pho (and I'm a HUGE pho fanatic) and he said it was similar so I was down. The place is really small and he said there's always a wait...which I didn't mind because I'll wait for anything that's supposed to be the best. We get in maybe thirty minutes later...the menu is really simple. Basically five ramen soups to choose from and they have a special ramen for the day. The broths vary in degree of strength. i believe miso (or veggie) is the lightest broth and soy is the strongest in flavor. There's also a Kimchi ramen that i was afraid to try because I don't rock with Kimchi like that (I mean...it's old ass cabbage) and there's a pork belly ramen and veggie. My friend suggested the soy ramen so that's what I went with. My sister picked the Kimchi because it was supposed to be spicy. Our food arrives quickly and smells great. My soy ramen had soy broth, smoked pork, noodles, maybe some onions (don't remember) and a soft boiled egg. The broth isn't the same as pho broth. This broth was way darker and more dense in consistency but not slimy like egg drop or hot and sour soup (which I HATE with a passion...keep that half ass jello broth away from me bro) and the serving bowl isn't nearly as large. This broth could stand on its own in flavor whereas with pho they give you basil, jalapenos, bean sprouts and lime to accompany your dish. Would I prefer ramen over pho? Hell nah...Pho for life; however, I really enjoyed my ramen...and even ate most of the egg. I'm not a fan of runny yolk so I worked around it. Whenever I decide to go back to New York I'll definitely hit this spot again and try the miso or veggie ramen.
