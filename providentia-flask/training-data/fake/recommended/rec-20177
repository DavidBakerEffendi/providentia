3 stars for the super cool restaurant.  Food was okay.  Not great but okay.  It needed a ittle kick to it.  A little spice.  It felt a little commercially produced.  Lunch special is very affordable.  I asked the waiter if he had a drink special.  He had that stick up the butt type of look...turned to me with a turned up nose...we don't do happy hour.  Well....exxxccuse me..I know for a fact the downtown location does because I've been there hundreds of times.  All the waiters had the stick up your butt look.  Non smiling, detached, robots.  Oh well..my food was only 8 bucks so whatever.
