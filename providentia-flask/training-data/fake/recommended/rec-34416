Grab a stack of napkins and stuff. your. face. It's a really good thing I do not work anywhere near this place because none of my pants would fit anymore. I can only speak for lunch, but those sandwiches are something to behold. The chefs manage to come up with crazy interesting and creative sammies without over-complicating things. And with the menu changing up every day, there is really no reason to eat the same thing twice... especially when everything is delicious. Plus, though many Burlington area restaurants are wicked good at doing up french fries, I must say that Misery wins the battle. So good. Every time I've been, the chefs and counter staff all seem to genuinely enjoy what they're doing, which just makes me love it more. FYI...follow their Facebook page for great food porn...the pastries these people come up with are insane.
