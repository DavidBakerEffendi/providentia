This is my favorite restaurant in the City.  I've had several things on the menu, but now always get the same thing (I usually like to try everything, but once you find perfection, why stray?).  I start with the muscles in the white wine with hot peppers.  The best part is the broth.  We let the bread soak it up.  Mmmm.  I'm not usually a muscle fan, but these are great and are not fishy.  Then the chicken fiorenta.  Beyond amazing.  When I take my friends here, they all like their dishes, but when they take a bite of mine they throw their heads back in ecstasy.  It's that good!  I play with side dishes, but they've even let me try the fancy pasta dishes (lasagna once, tortellini another time) as a side.  So that tells you something about the wait staff.  All with a bottle of the house wine.  And finish with the amaretto tiramisu.  The portions are huge!  I came here once with a friend who is 6'8" (and I'm a very "healthy" eater myself :), and we ordered one order of the muscles appetizer and the chicken dish to share and we were both quite content.  I only go there a couple times a year, but I swear the wait staff remembers me (I'm sure it helps that I'm told I look like Julianne Moore, who is a Piccolo regular-- unfortunately never there when I am there).  I also love the old school feel of the place, the staff shouting over heads in Italian, etc. (yes, its hard to have a quiet conversation here, and you will leave smelling like garlic.  Oh well!).  I've been coming for years and the staff never seems to change (I know much is family, but I don't think everyone is), so that says something good about them.  I couldn't praise them enough!
