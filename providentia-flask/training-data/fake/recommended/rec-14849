At first...I thought this had something to do with Afghanistani/Middle Eastern food...you know, due to geography and all that. The decor in this place is really awesome, with an old fashioned juke and great bar ornaments carved out of lustrous wood. There seems to be a slight punkish vibe to this, evidenced by the Cro Mags and some other gems playing in the background. Their beer selection is great, and I am not really a beer guy. What we really came for was...the nomishmcnomerstein southern food. Could it be? Southern Food in Philly? Somewhere in a past life I was a son o' the south, at least in my tummy, so I loooove me some greens, smoked and bbq meat, jumbalaya and all that goodness that really keeps the good ole cardiac surgeons in business. Hey- we gotta look out for the little guys ya know. I ordered an Oyster Po'boy..recalling the last time I had one was sitting in a steamy joint somewhere in the French Quarter. Naturally, I had to have a side of greens with that (a personal never ending quest for the best greens- smoked turkey necks are a key I am told). My girlfriend ordered the jambalaya and some croquettas to start. Everything was perfectly succulent. The croquettas were a hint of spicy and had a delicious filling. My po'boy had the right mix of oyster, fresh bun, and pickles to make it the hearty staple right after my hearty harr heart. Yes- it just made me speak like a pirate. I will hopefully be back the next time I am in the Illadelph.
