The food here is incredible! I highly recommend coming here on a weeknight if you want to avoid a longer wait time (though the food is well worth the wait). Dinner specials are always worth a look, especially the lamb soup. The whole-grain farro pasta dish is excellent; a wonderful combination of flavors. The half portion is the perfect size to share with other smaller plates and appetizers. Do not pass up the lamb kefteddes with spicy whipped feta and mint. The wait staff is very friendly and helpful with suggestions. Love this place!
