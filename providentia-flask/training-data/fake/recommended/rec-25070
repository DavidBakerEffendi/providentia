Once upon a time in a land far away, I was a little wild. I know, hard to imagine, yet true. This review centers on one of those times. My friend lives in the neighborhood, so I've been here more times than I can count. Another friend called it "The Sipowitz Bar" and I'm still not sure why. The food is solid and the drinks are strong and reasonably priced. The last time I was here a severely drunk guy with his relatively normal friends at the table behind us. On the way out, drunk guy walked up and said "If I weren't so drunk, I'd ask you out." And I said "If you weren't so drunk we might take you seriously". Ok, but here's the real story. When I was living on the east coast (and wild), one of my friends lived in SF and the rest of us would celebrate her birthday without her. One year her birthday coincided with a friend's husband's birthday, for which she had rented out the upstairs room of the London. Since it was such a fancy occasion, we made a 15 inch cutout of our friend in SF (we'll call her Cutout J) and took her out for the night. Â Cutout J was a huge hit as she posed for pictures down other people's pants and shirts, pictures of people licking her, pictures of her hanging out with the monkeys painted on the wall of the upstairs bathrooms (I have the photos, I know I wasn't imagining them). The waiters working the party were in love with Cutout J and asked to keep her. I said sure, as long as they didn't throw her away. Her parents went into the bar a couple of months later and noticed a 15 inch cutout of their daughter hanging out with the bottles behind the bar. That, my friends, was a high point in my career of fucking with my friends. Well, that and the time that Cutout J's parents threw a party at the London and I convinced Cutout J that another friend of ours had just gotten engaged at the Hard Rock Cafe in Philly after her boyfriend hired a mime to mime out "will you marry me?" Yes, I'm going to hell.
