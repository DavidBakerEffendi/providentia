On a Sunday morning, went there for a brunch.  Even though there was huge crowd gathered there (they don't take reservation), we put our name down and got the table within 20 mins. This place has nice outdoor seating which is limited and the indoors provide a cozy feeling to this east village spot.  Tables are closely stacked but if you are true NY, you will get over that. To start off with - I started with Bloody Mary and shared a plate of hummus.  Pita bread was very fresh and warm and hummus tasted delicious.  They have a quite a number of options of vegetarians.  Buttermilk pancakes looked delicious and were recommended by others. They have about 4-5 vegetarian sandwiches - ended up getting the roasted vegetables and goat cheese.  The sandwich was warm and the vegetables were sauteed in olive oil. As a vegetarian, this place definitely caters more than just pancakes and waffles which makes me a big a fan.
