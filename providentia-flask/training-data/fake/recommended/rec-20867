The food here -- including the pho -- is relatively standard for a Vietnamese restaurant, although I am comparing with restaurants of where I used to live (and eat!), in the Little Saigon district in Seattle. As well, it is inexpensive, the restaurant itself is clean but not fancy, the wait staff was friendly and helpful, and most of the clientele is indeed Asian, which I think is a good measure of taste.
