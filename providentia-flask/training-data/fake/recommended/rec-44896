We've dined here twice...tonight we did a "walk-in" and were seated promptly...at a table for 4 no less. (only 2 of us) I'll keep it short....tonight's meal was flawless and I REALLY mean that! I've read some of the recent Yelp reviews and I just don't get some of them & I'm sorry your experience wasn't as good as ours.... Is Market table pricey..yeah..but so what?? it was WELL worth it! starters- asparagus soup & soft shell crab special..KILLER. we actually split the soup and as we were eating it....both of us said...hmmmm...should've got my own...outstanding! entrees- me...spring flounder....the smokey wilted butter  lettuce was terrific she-  the pancetta wrapped pork tenderloin...she gave me some...I'm not a big meat lover......this changed me!  really delicious. nice bottle of Cabernet from the Napa and even a little dessert...chocolate chip ice cream sandwich..... a PERFECT evening of dining......thanks Matt for getting us in and thanks Chef Mikey for a great meal...
