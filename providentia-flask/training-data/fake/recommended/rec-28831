Probably better for tourists than as a place to make your new regular spot (I was living about an hour away and only in Philly sporadically so I liked getting to go somewhere different.)  It is right in downtown Philadelphia, offers a unique experience which I always look for while traveling, and in both of my experiences, great food and service! It is a little pricy, but again great if you are traveling or for a special occasion. You have to splurge a little on the dessert, get the little mini camp fire for your table and roast your marshmallows for the fondue!  So good, and so much fun!  I have never seen that anywhere else. That was our favorite - also tried the chocolate truffle heart cake, and a chocolate espresso milkshake. If you have to pick one, go with the fondue plate to share - delicious and you get a lot more. The cake is very, very small. I went for mainly desert both times so the only food I tried was the southwest caesar salad and mac and cheese - happy with both but definitely recommend the mac and cheese! Wanted to try the specialty coffees and chocolate martini, but there is only so much you can take in one sitting! They do offer those though. I see others posted that this place was great for kids, which I can understand given the menu, but both times I went were on dates, and we were looking for more of an up-scale place.  On Valentine's day, we got just that (I assume because no one had their kids out), but the second time we went, there were a lot of kids (running around), the place was very very crowded and hard to walk around, and I definitely wasn't as happy with the atmosphere as the first time.  So the vibe of the restaurant is a little confused - if you are looking for a quiet, romantic place, I would suggest only coming here if it isn't a busy time.
