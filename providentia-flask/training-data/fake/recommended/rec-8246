VPB, like many other places in downtown Burlington, had a 45+ minute wait on Fri. night.  The good news was that our wait wasn't as long as the hostess estimated.  VPB might as well have stood for Volume-heavy, Popular Business. I'm not a huge beer drinker, but I gave the Beetlejuice - a Bavarian style ale - a try, and it was decent. The newspaper style menu was chockful of options: fried appetizers, sammiches, burgers, and steaks.  My 6 oz steak was okay, as in Very Plain Bovine.
