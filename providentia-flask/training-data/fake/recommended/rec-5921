If you're really in the mood for pizza, this place is fine. But I wouldn't seek it out for two reasons. First, the wait staff is unnecessarily brusque. You're hustled out as soon as possible. I can understand this generally, but they take it beyond just hovering politely here. Second, the food is mediocre. There are a lot of varieties of pizza, but I can't think of any that are notable. It is cheap, though, and a BYO. So it has that going for it.
