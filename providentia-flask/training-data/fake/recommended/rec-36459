Good and fresh NY pizza.  My bro in law ordered the spinach and sausage.  It was memorable in that the fresh morzarella did not leave any grease on the pizza.  Also, the spinach which is supposed to be a tasteless vegetable ended up being tasty and very complimentary to the sausage and the cheese.  Probably would have given it a 4 star had my expectations been not built up so high. Would definetly come back for other flavors though.
