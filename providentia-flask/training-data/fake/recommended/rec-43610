Wow wa wee wa .... The place is small but the staff was really accommodating. The service was friendly and fast, just how I like my manicurists. The corn. Order the corn. It was unlike anything I've ever eaten. I just went for the classic Cuban Sandwich with a side of Tostones instead of fries, since after all, we're eating Cuban here broo. My mind was blown - the sandwich was the best cuban sandwich outside of Miami (since we aren't allowed in Cuba, Miami is the next best thang LOL). So flavorful and juicy and just what a Cuban sandwich should taste like. Heavenly grease with a slice of pickles. Also, the cocktails were fantastic. I had the Daiquiri Cubano with Guava Puree (twice) - delicioso!
