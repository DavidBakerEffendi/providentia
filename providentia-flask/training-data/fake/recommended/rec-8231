First it gets 3 stars for the location and the coffee.  We were staying at the Hilton which is one hill up from the market.  It was easily accessible and the staff is friendly.  However, friendly does not mean efficient.  We went there on a particularly not-too-busy hour.   We ordered a bagel with cream cheese and waited, and waited, and waited.  There were only two other customers in the market.  We went back to the counter and inquired.  Our bagel had been sitting in the toaster.  Yup.  Even better is that they did not toast a new bagel for us but gave us that one and there wasn't a heartfelt apology.  We decided that complaining wasn't worth it.  I have read that other people have had better experiences so perhaps it is hit or miss.
