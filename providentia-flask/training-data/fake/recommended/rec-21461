checked this place out on my visit from Colorado, stopped by for a late night (1a) snack. Got the hot roast beef sandwich and enjoyed it. big servings, didn't finish my sandwich or fries. fries definitely weren't fresh. friends really enjoyed the buffalo wings too. great service, nice selection of beer.
