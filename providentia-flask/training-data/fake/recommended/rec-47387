Came here for Sunday brunch with the girls...we had reservations for six, but because of Saturday night shenanigans...only three of us made it! Anyway, since you can only make reservations for a party of six or more, we were a little worried about getting seated...lucky for us, the hostess was super sweet and seated the three Saturday-night survivors regardless... I opted for a brunch classic: eggs benedict, which was delicious, with OJ and coffee (so good, and it comes in a cute tin cup with matching kettle). My only complaint? Our waitress. First, it took forever to get our drinks. I thought this was maybe just a fluke, but I noticed the couple next to us also waited a lifetime to get their drinks. Right after we ordered I changed my mind about wanting fries, and flagged down our waitress to ask if I could get a side salad instead. She said she had already put in the order but would go and tell the kitchen. As someone who once worked in food service...it's never "let me see what I can do...," it's "Of course, whatever you want...blah blah blah" Well, our food came out and there's no salad...just fries :/ So, I had to flag her again and remind her about the change. Instead of apologizing, she blamed the kitchen and asked for my plate. I asked if she could just bring out a salad and she rudely asked, "so you want the fries?" I didn't, but I also didn't find it necessary to hand over my plate, and her attitude about it was as if *I* had been the one in the wrong...and that I was putting her out...I'm sorry, but this is your job...If you don't want to serve people, then don't... Otherwise, the food was good, the place was neat and on a cute street, and the prices, though high, are pretty typical for this 'hood.
