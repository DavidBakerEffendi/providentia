thank goodness i've discovered this place! food is ehhh especially for the price but the drinks are so delishhh and reasonably priced! and let me tell you...the MUSIC is just TOOOOOOO AWESOME!!!!! WHAT WHAT! i am a huge fan of rap/hip hop like tyga, jay z, u know~ and this place just pumps up all them music! before 11 it's like a normal restaurant but past that! BAHM it turns into a hot sweaty hip hop club with everyone dancing everywhere! the crowd is pretty diverse and gotta admit, pretty good lookers out there! i'll definitely be visiting agains soon
