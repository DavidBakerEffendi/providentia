Pretty good price and value for Manhattan brunch. The line was long when we went on a Sunday morning; we waited about 45 minutes when they said it would take an Â hour and 15, so it wasn't so terrible. I always order the salmon wrapped poached eggs from the prix fixe. The slightly runny eggs and salmon are perfect together, but the green goddess dressing totally makes the dish and ties it together! It's my favorite. I would also recommend the Nutella french toast with bananas: yummmmm For some reason, their coffee is also really good to me, but I'm no connoisseur.
