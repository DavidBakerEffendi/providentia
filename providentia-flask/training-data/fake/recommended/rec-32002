My apologies to Spasso- I meant to write this review a year ago but am just getting it now. Short story: I thought I had my old city Philadelphia wedding all set to go months ahead of time.  Then- rude awakening.  I was planning to have our rehearsal dinner in one of the hotel dining rooms but was suddenly told that, since it was a Saturday, they were going to slap me with an 4-figure fee just to have the place.  Umm- no thanks! I was desperately looking for a room in Old City that would host about 90-100 people for a Saturday night dinner at an affordable cost.  I must have contacted 3 dozen places that all were outrageous.  But, lucky for me, I then found SPASSO! I still cannot believe what an excellent venue this was for us.  They charged us NOTHING for the space, even though it was a hopping Saturday night at the peak of tourist season.  Loredana was exceptional, helping me set up a menu and negotiate beverage packages.   When we arrived, there were special menus printed up for each place setting.  Spasso provided us a microphone and a plethora of servers and helpers saw to our every need.  Also- the food was delicious!  Many of our guests were vegetarian and Spasso could not have made it easier for us. To anyone else looking to host an event at Spasso in their private dining space- GO FOR IT!  I promise you'll be thrilled with the service- and the price!
