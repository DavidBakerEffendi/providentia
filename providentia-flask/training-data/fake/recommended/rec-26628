Applewood was around way before locavorism became another fashion trend for affluent Brookynites and then a "Portlandia" gag. They are very well-informed about food but not snobbish about it. Arriving just in time for the end of ramp season, I got the pollock with wheat berries, ramps and black bean puree, a very innovative and appealing entree. You won't be able to get the same thing since the menu changes every day, but you probably can't go wrong selecting at random. Even the bread is worth mentioning. They'll change up the spreads. On my visit there was a surprisingly great golden beet cream cheese.
