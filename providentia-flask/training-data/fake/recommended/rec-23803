This place just isn't what it's cracked out to be. The food really just isn't that good. It's a fun atmosphere but that's about it. We decided we will not return here. It seems to be thriving simply on the fact that it's a Steven Starr restaurant. I've paid less for WAYYYYY better Mexican food. It's one thing to overpay when the food is good but to overpay for mediocre or food that's down right bad...it just isn't worth it. There are so many places to choose from in the city. Spend your money on somewhere better. To get more specific: I am not one to send food back but I ordered mahi tacos based on a recommendation from my waiter. I let him know that I didn't like my chicken tacos the last time I dined here. He assured me that those were the worst on the menu and that the mahi tacos were way better. I took his word and tried them. They tasted like the ocean. It was disgusting. I just couldn't do it so I told him I couldn't eat them. He offered to bring me something else. I was ready to give up but I agreed to try the veggie tacos. The manager brought them out and said he hoped they got it right this time. These tasted like straight up charcoal. Also disgusting. I apologized and said I really wasn't trying to be a pain but I simply didn't want to eat or pay for something that I thought was terrible. They took them away and I stuck to my plantains (which were good). They brought us a complementary churro dessert. I appreciated this effort. We still won't return. The guacamole was OK but I can make better guac at home and it doesn't cost me $20 for a small portion. I tried not one, not two, but THREE different kinds of tacos and they were all terrible. I think this place should consider looking at their chefs, the menu, their flavor profiles and the food they are sending out and stop surviving off of the Steven Starr name.
