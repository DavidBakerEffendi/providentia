Sooo glad we stumbled upon this place! Did the prix fixed menu which was more than reasonably priced with plenty of delicious options! Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious. The staff was super friendly with proper knowledge of the menu. Very attentive and fast, but you don't feel rushed at all. I would def recommend this place for good Indian. ONE THING I wish I knew before was that they don't serve alcohol. But they allow you to bring your own and won't charge you a corking fee. However I didn't know this Til we already sat. Check it out!!
