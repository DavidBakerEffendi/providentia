I use to came here all the time when I lived in center city. I remember the hanger steak in the red wine sauce. It was great. This time I went with my kids and had the hanger steak again. My kids had the Margherita pizza and a regular cheese burger. Drinks are great but the food is the 2 star :(. Â Very disappointing.
