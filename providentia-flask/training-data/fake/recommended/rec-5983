This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chinatown. The menu is pretty large and varied, so there is something for everyone. The portions are huge and around $7 or $8 for a dinner. I wish I could make it here more often! It's delicious and you won't be disappointed. Â Make sure you have cash on you, though, as they don't accept credit cards!
