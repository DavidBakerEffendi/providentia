Wonderful meal. Great, friendly service. Every course was memorable, well plated and very tasty. A little noisy but not uncomfortably so. Went to a competitor (L'Amante) the next night and it was everything that Church and Main wasn't. The food was bland and forgettable, mediocre service and marginal atmosphere. Given the choice stay clear of L'Amante and choose Church and Main
