I am in love with this place.  I came here a couple of years ago and had such a great time (by the end of the night I was being hand fed french fries by a female version of a talkative Woody Allen, true story). I had to return on my next trip to swoon over a certain bartender.  Immediately it is way more crowded than I remember. I was told this is a slow night, and I was there on a SUNDAY and the bar was 2-3 people deep. I fear for what it would be like on a normal night. Unless you are completely claustrophobic, it is completely worth it.  Luckily, my friend and I snagged a seat at the bar and had just the best time ever. Their drinks are fantastic and if you are into mixing drinks yourself, they take the time to explain the ingredients. There was even a mini birthday burlesque show which was totally fun. Drinks are about 15-16 bucks a pop. Which is pricey I guess, but aren't you in New York? These are craft cocktails, not your well drinks/ redbull vodkas. I almost want to plan a trip back just for this bar. I love you guys.
