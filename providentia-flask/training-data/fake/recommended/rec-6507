I wanted to love this burger.  Last night, my burger was mushy and flavorless.  I actually added salt to the burger.  Similar story with the fries, unfortunately. Excluding the food, you cannot beat the $2.50 beers and atmosphere.  It's a true guys spot.  No frills, just beer, burgers, and fries.  Sometimes, you can't ask for more.  (Well, at Corner Bistro, ask to pass the salt!)
