First, a moment about my server, Vanessa, who greeted this LA'er thusly: "we only make our pizza two ways. Did you not hear what I said? Do you want to know how to make a pizza? First you take the dough...then you put some sauce on it...and then you can add toppings!" I had the biggest crush on her from that moment on and haven't forgotten her since.Sorry about that unecessary aside, I just felt compelled to comment on her because she was so special. Was in town to visit the fam a couple of weeks ago and came here on a reco. BYOB, so the overall bill will be quite reasonable, although most would probably consider the pizza prices quite high. No issues with the wait, b/c they took my bro's cell number and we went to a nearby bar to drink until they were ready for us. Blessings to them for that. The interior design is great. It just feels so nostalgic and comfy. Lighting is dim. Unfortch, Beyonce and Jay did not make an appearance this evening. Oh well. But all of that wouldn't matter if the pizza wasn't as advertised, right? It is. In fact, I'd have to say that Lucali has the best pizza that I've ever had in my life. No question. I highly recommend coming to Lucali for some outstanding pizza with a dose of Brooklyn sass. And you can trust me on this one; I'm an Elite. ;)
