Having had Geno's had to cross the street and give Pat's a try.  My friend ordered the cheesesteaks and we sat down and gave it a try.  The meat was better seasoned and I felt like the everything came together to make the cheesesteak taste better... it was lot lot better then Geno's.   So I can't say much other then I liked Pat's better then Geno's... yeah, I would take a taxi out there... but not too often!
