Went here for lunch with some co-workers, as it's close to my office.  I had the Pad Thai with chicken.  It was very good and flavorful.   As others have said, the service can be a little slow, but we didn't mind.  With a lunch entree and sharing of an appetizer, the bill came to 10-11 dollars a person. Not bad, and we were all full!  Several people could not even finish their lunch, and had to take theirs home with them.
