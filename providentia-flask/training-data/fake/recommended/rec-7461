Great, cheap place to get your noodle fix.  Came here on Chinese New Year and got their roast duck hand pulled noodles.  The noodles themselves were slightly chewy and great and the vegetable broth was not too salty.  Nothing really special about the noodles themselves and I would have appreciated more extras like scallions and cilantro and sauces.
