The food is amazing - they've come up with really inventive and delicious menu items. But the best part isn't the food, it's the atmosphere. Mary and Earl will make you feel like an old friend, and Mom is so sweet. You have to try her cookies. Handy's is a classic diner with lots of character, great food, and even better service.
