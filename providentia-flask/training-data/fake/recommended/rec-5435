BEST HOTPOT HANDS DOWN. PARKING WAS A TAD DIFF- IT IS LOCATED ON A MAIN STREET. The wait is a bit long sometimes but so worth the wait and of course, don't wear nice clothes bc you end up leaving the place smelling like something else. They have a lot of food choices and they were fresh. I REC THE CUTTLEFISH PASTE. Do the half and half bowl of broth so you can try something diff. I will tell you though that the bill ends up pricey but if you check in you get a free Melona bar so that negates all bad feelings towards the high bill :).
