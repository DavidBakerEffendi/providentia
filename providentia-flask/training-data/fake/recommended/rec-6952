Went for lunch on a hot day and it was a relief.I hadn't been here in years and the beer selection had improved greatly.I had a gyro and it was better than average , served with very good french fries.Service was relatively Â quick and pleasant- music was too loud - I put my earplugs in! I'd go back.
