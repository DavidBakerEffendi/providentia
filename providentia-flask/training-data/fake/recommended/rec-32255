I have had nothing but good experiences with Memphis Taproom. The food has been delicious every time I've gone, there's always a great selection of beers, and service has been perfect. They offer a large selection of great food, with nice sized portions, and they make it all in-house. I am definitely a fan and they got themselves a new regular.
