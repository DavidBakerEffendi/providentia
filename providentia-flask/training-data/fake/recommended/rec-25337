I've passed this coffee shop daily for about 2 years and stopped in on Thursday morning. I wasn't pleased with the drink. I ordered a Latte that had so much milk that my drink was cold. In addition, more expensive then my normal Latte I get from another, bigger-named coffee spot. The store itself is nice. I doubt if I will go back if I HAVE to have coffee. The people that work there are nice, also.
