Didn't get a chance to compare this to Pat's King of Steaks which is right down the street...but Geno's serves one great phillly cheesesteak. Almost ate the whole thing in a couple minutes without even realizing it. A little greasy but what do you expect, the overall taste and quality of it was damn good. Service was quick and simple. I'd come back and eat here, but I do want to compare it to Pat's as well.
