this place is the type of spot that everybody wants to live around the block from.  I was there for the first time last night and it was excellent.  Got the E.G.G burger and I'll be honest it was one of the most deliriously prepared things I've eaten in a while.  The egg was cooked perfectly and so was the burger medium and juicy and pink.  I'm daydreaming about it now as I type this out.
