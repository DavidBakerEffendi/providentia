I've been to this pizzeria 4 times now. The pizza is fantastic!!! The reason that it gets such a low rating is the guy in the back doing all the other cooking is horrible. Every time I try to order buffalo wings I always get something different. Sometimes it BBQ sometimes it's just fried wings with nothing on it... The last two times I made my order there was a hair in it somewhere. Once in the pizza and once in the wings... My opinion, fire the fry cook and buy some hair nets.
