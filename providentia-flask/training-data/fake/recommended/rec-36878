5 STARS! 5 F-ING STARS! I will never, ever, EVER forget this restaurant and the brown sauce that came with the filet mignon with a taste pleasure equal to 16 orgasms. OH MY GOD. Do yourself a favor and get dinner here. It's a small restaurant (26 chairs?) but wonderful, romantic, and most of all, EXQUISITELY DELICIOUS.
