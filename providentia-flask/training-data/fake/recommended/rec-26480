The price is very reasonable in this popular location. My friend took me to the restaurant which is in the basement. The restaurant is not big, so it is a good place for small group. You can find various Japanese food there, including Sushi, Grill and Sashimi as well. The portion is small, so we can try several kinds. I have to say the price is reasonable in this awesome location!
