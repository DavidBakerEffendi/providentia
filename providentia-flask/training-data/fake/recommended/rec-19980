Upon further review, I feel like I want to place Grimaldi's just slightly ahead of Lombardi's, which has been my all time fav since '98.  Seriously on some other level of what a pie can be...just had Lombardi's in May, as well, so everything's fresh in my mind. That being said, I suppose choosing one over the other is an exercise in futility - Grimaldi's crust is better, but Lombardi's still brings it with the sauce and toppings.  They should, by all rights, be forever tied as the two best pizza joints in the history of humankind's existence. Anyways, 5 stars is a no brainer here.
