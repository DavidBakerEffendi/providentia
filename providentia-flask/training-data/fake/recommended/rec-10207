My previous experience with Peruvian food is the mom and pop fast food type places, and I must say the chicken is the bomb.   This is the nicest Peruvian Restaruant I have been to.  Initially the cool design on the place gets you excited, but once you sit down the opinion changes.  Our servers sucked!  He was not very helpful in informing us how the menu worked as a lot of it was in Spanish.  Had two of the people in my party not spoken Spanish it would have been even worse. The food is no better than the cheaper mom and pop Peruvian places, so your paying for the ambiance and the experience.  If you have never tried Peruvian food and want a hip type of restaurant than this place would work.  However,  know that the servers are not the best around
