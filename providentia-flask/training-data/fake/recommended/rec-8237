Haven't been here in a while because of my schedule, but if you're looking for a good place to hang out with some friends, this place certainly gets a mention. Great for grabbing a late night bite to eat, this place is a fun and somewhat unique atmosphere. The menu isn't terribly large, but it doesn't need to be. The have the classic pub fare and do it to great effect. Two shout outs I will give is to their hard cider (which is much lighter and tastier than most others I've had) and to their sweet potato fries. I don't know what kind of honey mustard they serve with it, but the two put together is a little slice of heaven on earth. Sweet potatos and honey mustard as heaven. Who knew? ^_^ Definitely gets my vote for good late night fare.
