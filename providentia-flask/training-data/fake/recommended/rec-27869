I expected a better meal considering the majority of the 4-5 stars this restaurant has recevied. Maybe we should have had some pizza. To me it was average. I ate here with 2 friends. We shared a bottle of house wine for $30. We had the stewed calamari and eggplant parm to start. I loved the sauce the calamari came in! I could have just eaten that. I ordered Rigatoni al Rag√∫ Napoletano (rigatoni with baby back ribs, sausage, and meatballs). This dish wasn't too bad. It came with one meatball, a piece of sausage, and a slab of meat. The presentation could have been a bit better. However, I never wound up eating my meal because I switched with my gf. She ordered Pappardelle alla Bolognese (but instead of pappardelle asked for spaghetti). She did not like the flavor at all and was ready she send it back; this partially had to do with the meat served with it. She's a picky meat eater and this was definitely not your typical bolognese sauce. She thought it tasted a bit like fennel, which is typically in sausage. I didn't mind the dish. my other gf had the gnocchi but I think she was so full from all the bread she ate she barely touched her plate. Mostly likely we won't be back since when we left and walked a block north we passed another Italian place that we said maybe we should try next time and it'd be better. Or if we go back we'll need to try the pizza
