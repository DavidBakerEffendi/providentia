I got the spinach and artichoke slice: It started off tasting great; maybe the best slice of pizza I'd ever eaten. The problem is that unless you eat the whole thing in less than 30 seconds, some of the cheese is obviously going to begin to harden slightly. As it does that, you realise how buttery the slice really is. Each mouthful then begins to taste like pure unhealthiness (if you can classify that as a taste), and not in a good way. I might eat a slice there again, though the resulting food coma/panic attack about the damage done to my heart, would probably make me regret it. I do understand why people give it 5* though - if you can handle all that grease you'll love it
