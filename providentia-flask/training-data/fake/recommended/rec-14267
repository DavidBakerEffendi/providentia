Everything about my experience was off. I have a hard time describing how, why, but my friend agreed. The food was fine. There are probably a dozen places in the neighborhood that I would go to first. Â And if whiskey and meat is your thing, you should go to Fette Sau up north, though it might not be "nice." One positive - the 1 ounce whiskey pours. I appreciate that.
