I recently visited Beco for the second time. And I'm glad I did because they finally got the feijoada right! Not only was there more meat in with the beans but also 3 large pieces of pork and sausage on the plate! And as before, very tasty. My wife also ordered the feijoada but it was too much for her so, of course, more meat for me. I was in vegetarian hell and loved it! I really do like this place, very casual and inviting. The first time I went was on a Saturday and it was really fun, the Brazilian beats were pumpin' and people were groovin' (obviously drunk off caipirinhas). This time was a Tuesday and the place was Bossa Nova and jazz, cool and  relaxed. The decor is still wack but who cares the food is delicious. And as much as I enjoy it, I have to admit, the main reason I am looking forward to go back is for their national cocktail. I didn't get to go to Academia de Cachaça in Rio (still kicking myself over that one) but I think Beco makes the best caipirinhas I ever tasted!
