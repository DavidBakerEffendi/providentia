My mom and I grabbed lunch here during our shopping spree last black Friday. I love French cuisine and have been to magnificent places over in Paris and a few (2) in Florida. The inside was cute and very small (typical). I was expecting our waiter to parler fran√ßais, but he was a nice, average American. I felt like the prices were average for the area we were in; I wouldn't really know as I only visit NYC. My mom and I both had the french onion soup, which was okay. Not the best I've had. A small bowl with a lot of broth and not enough onions. We also split the marinated portabello salad which was good. If I were in the area and didn't know where else to go, I'd return. Otherwise, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.
