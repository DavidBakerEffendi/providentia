I went there last night and let me tell you ... I am going back sometime soon!!! The good:  The food was great!!  We had the cheese platter which was really quite wonderful.  I loved the fact that they presented the cheeses with a side of honey ... it was a nice combination and really brought out some interesting and delicious warm flavors.  Of course I also had their famous fried chicken ... and I am NOT a fried chicken kind of girl ... but ...  up went my white flag ... and now I am in love!  It was not overbearingly greasy, it was light (who would have thought?), juicy, fresh, and crispy.  I am not sure what the brown dressing was that came with the chicken but it was the perfect complement!  The PECAN PIE SUNDAE was a perfect ending to the meal!!  I will go back just for that! The bad:  THE WAIT ... Ugh... we were told to wait for an hour and forty five mins!!!!!!!  The hostest was a bit snappy too!!  Thank goodness the waitress made up for that! I think we ended up waiting for an hour ... they take your phone number which is helpful because we headed out to a nearby tapas bar for a drink and were call when our table was ready. The ugly:  Nothing!  The decor was comfy and warm! It was, however, a bit on the dark side.
