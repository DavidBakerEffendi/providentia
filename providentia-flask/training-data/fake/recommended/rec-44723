My parents tried to get into this restaurant last year on their trip to NY. They were unsuccessful, as they were feeling rather impatient and the line was down the street (per usual, as the restaurant was featured on the Food Network). This year, they were determined to get in. We hailed a cab to Brooklyn to drop us off at this circus of a restaurant.  The line was actually not bad, according to my parents. I think we got there right before peak lunch time. We ended up waiting roughly 40 minutes to get in. Luckily, it wasn't one of our torturous heat days, so we were OK. The wait to get the food was roughly 40 as well. We ordered the meat pizza as well as a veggie pizza.  They were both super good, but I do think it may have been a tad overrated.  I think the wait may have also hindered my taste buds.  It was fun watching the pizza chefs make all the pizzas.  I wish I could make pizza that quickly! Lastly, we had one of the ice cream truffle desserts.  The dark chocolate and espresso bean one.  That was the best part of the meal, those things were DELICIOUS! I am not sure if they make them homemade, or if they are store-bought, but regardless--SO AMAZING. My sweet tooth was definitely satisfied. All in all, it was a great meal, and I enjoyed it. Would I go back again? Probably not, but I am glad we went since it seemed like the touristy thing to go.
