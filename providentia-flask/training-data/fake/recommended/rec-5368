Went here on a Saturday night without reservations and they were able to seat us within 15 minutes. The decor and ambiance was modern and upbeat. They had today's hits music playing at a comfortable noise level and the place was packed! Place had a very lounge feel to it. There are lots of seating, so wait time wasn't long. We were seating in their cage swings, which are for parties of 2. The swings were fun and cute, especially if you're out on a date. Our waiter promptly told us that they have an open order system, meaning that as soon as we give her our order our food will be out within only a few minutes. So be ready for lightening fast food! The food itself was good/decent. We had the beer battered calamari which was tasty, flavorful and the just the right amount of portion. The lobster mac and cheese was ok..you can tell that they use canned lobster b/c it was lacking that distinct lobster taste. Also, it's not really mac and cheese, it's orzo pasta and it wasn't that cheesy. The chicken tikka was good, I expected it to be a lot worse, but I was pleasantly surprised. However, the raisin bran rice that accompanied was not good. Overall, it was a fun ambiance and food was good. Pretty casual place, so you can wear whatever you want!
