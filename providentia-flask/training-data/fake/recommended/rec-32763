I want to like this place more, but I keep thinking its better than it is when I get there. Having Saturday Brunch is a big plus. Ambiance: casual, easy, anything goes. We take grandparents, friends, whomever in whatever state we're dressed. The decor and crowd are also pretty eclectic. On a nice day, it's pleasant to give on Elizabeth Park. Service: Nothing stand out. Takes our order, nor particular fast or slow. The menus are on digital tablets that I can't stand. They have ad's on them, they solicit your email, and scrolling vs. tapping is a constant headache. I get what they're going for, I just don't think it's well executed. Food: Solid, simple food. We do brunch a lot, and we've always liked the french toast and BLT omelette. This latest time, the french toast was way too almond-like, and the guacamole on the BLT omelette was barely a spoonful. Overall good, but falls short of being something worth recommending. I'll probably return as it's a great place to take your grandparents: handicap accessible, access is very easy, no stairs or steps in any part of the restaurant. If I had to do brunch in West Hartford, I'd sooner go to the center
