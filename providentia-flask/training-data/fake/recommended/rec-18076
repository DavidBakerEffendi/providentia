How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways... Actually it's a waste of my time to be creative in trashing this place, so enough of the faux poetics. I really wanted this place to be awesome, but for me it just isn't. If you like to be treated poorly with your good food and great beer then this is the place. I've been four times, just to give it a fair shot and because I wanted to be wrong, but nope, it sucks. I just don't enjoy being scolded or yelled at for ordering a burger at the wrong time or having an incorrect number of people at a table to maximize the profits of the business. Maybe you're cool with that, perhaps things have changed, or most likely I'm a kook. Try it out if you like, but the most positive thing I've ever heard is that it's the best available option in the neighborhood, or that you just put up with the attitude to get the food and beer, a soupnazi kinda thing. I've decided on a self-imposed lifetime 86 from this place and I've extended that to the Memphis Taproom and Resurrection Ale House too, same owners, even though I have heard good things about them. There are other places to spend my money. I go to Fiume, just around the corner, or get food at the various restaurants within a block of this place. All in all I'd rather it go back to Kelliann's, the rather lowbrow former occupant of this corner.
