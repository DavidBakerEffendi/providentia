If you are looking for the old Restaura_t you'll have to just fall back on your memories.  The long awaited "new" Rudy's is good, just not like the old one. Some familiar faces behind the bar as well as some new taps and an updated menu.   Key item : Frites!   They were rated 8/10 on the scale of Belgian Fries and having traveled to Belgium and consumed more cones of frites than my Dr would have wanted me too i can say this score was right on.
