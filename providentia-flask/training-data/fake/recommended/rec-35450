This is hands down my favorite restaurant in the world. I still comeback from Morristown every so ofter for a meal. The calamari is always done to perfection and their signature Chicken Senape is to die for. The pastas are always first rate and the specials are not to be missed. The service is warm and professional. They now serve wine and the house merlot was quite good. I was MUCH more impressed by Trattoria Il Cafone than Cafe Matisse. Do yourself a favor and check it out; you won't regret it.
