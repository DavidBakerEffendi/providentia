Whoa.  The place is a real gem.  We went for brunch.  The popular order is the giant french toast, but we resisted and ordered the Chicken Sausage & Eggs spicy corn bread, white gravy, home fries  and the candied pecan, caramel apple pancakes.  Both were exponentially more delicious than they looked.  So good, the sensation reminds you of childhood where you are so focussed on your pancakes that nothing else matters- at all.   The home fries were crispy, yet not oily, the bisquit was a little sweet a little spicey, the sausage was not oily and was savory and delicious.  The caramel sauce on the pancakes stole the show- yet was complimented by the maple syrup. They have a large room downstairs for parties- very private and surprisingly spacious.  The menu is full of comfort food- I will be back many times. Other New York Gems: thelunchbelle.com
