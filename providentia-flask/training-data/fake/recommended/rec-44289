I went here this past weekend and after hearing all the good reviews, I was disappointed to say the least. While the good was good, I thought the brisket I got could of had a more smokey flavor and less reliant on the sauce. Â Also, for $14 for the large box, I felt I should have gotten more meat. Instead, 3/4 of the box was the other items and 1/4 was the main part of the dish. Service was also not helpful nor friendly. I was very dissatisfied and let down seeing that the owners run excellent restaurants but obviously don't care enough about this place.
