I went with 3 friends to this new restaurant, and we love everything about it. We tried two pizzas, two salads, and a few of the meats and cheeses -- all of it was just incredible. There is much to choose from on the menu, but it's not overwhelming like in some restaurants. Looking around at the other customers, we could immediately tell by the colorful food (and by how much everyone was enjoying their meal!) that they only serve fresh, quality ingredients. In addition, the decor is beautiful (check out some of the photos), and the restaurant has a very comfortable feel. The kitchen opens into the dining area, so you can see how spotless it is, and you can see all the work, precision, and pure culinary talent that goes into creating these dishes. And our particular server was very nice, knowledgable, and helpful when it came to narrowing down both the food and drinks that interested us. (I imagine the other servers are just as good.) As for the prices? They're surprisingly low for the quality of food and service there. I would've gladly paid twice the bill. And some nights, they offer half off some of their pizzas (follow them on Facebook and they'll post when you can get this deal). In Riva is an absolute gem in East Falls. My only complaint? I live in San Francisco, so I won't be able to get back there until my next trip to Philly!
