Not bad, but not stupendous.  I thought it was fairly quiet considering the crowd of people and size of the place.  Then, dinner hour picked up some more and it got quite loud.  Being the table by the door sucked, too, because the door kept slamming open and closed. The burgers are ok, but kind of pricey for what you get.  I know some people rave about the burgers, but I've had better at home!  Not juicy enough, or with anything interesting.  Saying it's just simple sometimes is bad.  A hamburger should make your mouth water, and this just felt like eating fast food.
