ROCK. JOHNNY BRENDAS. the reviewer below (duocorn) is my beautiful roommate and she brought me to johnny's on wed night to see David Vanderveld and I was very impressed by the atmosphere and the music. From the outside this place looks like nothing. I ride by it on my bike every single day and never realized how sweet it is. The first floor is a regular bar, the second floor is another bar but with a stage for performers, and the third floor is a mezzanine level to look down on the performer. not to mention I'm now in love with David Vanderveld...and his bassist!
