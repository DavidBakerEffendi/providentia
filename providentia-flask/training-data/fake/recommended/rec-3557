I found the food not as great as many have hyped it to be.  It really wasn't worth my trip to Queens.  My friend and I split our dishes so we could each sample them.  The calamari was rubbery.  The duck with eggplant was smothered in sauce and tasted a bit gamy.  The Chinese broccoli with crispy pork was OK.  I did like the drunken noodles and the rice balls/taro cubes in coconut dessert, but the two alone wouldn't be worth the trek.  If I were in the area, though, those would be the two dishes I'd order. The only other thing I liked about the restaurant is their outdoor dining area with beautiful flowers, but there are other places with a pretty outdoor garden and dining area that have better food.
