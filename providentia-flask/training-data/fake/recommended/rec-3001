Excellent overall experience here. Although it was busy, we were seated almost immediately which was nice because there is virtually no room to wait anywhere. The service was outstanding, from the server to the bartender. A notable experience:I inquired about the delicious wine I was drinking (can't remember if it was the Pinot Grigio or the Sav. Blanc.) and a few moments later the bartender came to our table, chatted about the wine with us, and wrote down the name and area of Italy that the wine came from. As a young female patron, I don't feel that I usually receive this type of service when asking about wines so i was very impressed. Last but certainly not least, the pizza. Absolutely delicious is a decent start to describe the pizza. Fresh, unique ingredients combined with creative recipes and original twists to classic favorites. Will definitely be back here again.
