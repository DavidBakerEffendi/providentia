Used to think this place was great. Used to be there every weekend. Over the past year or so it seems to be slipping.... which is really too bad. Last time we went I got the GF french toast and a side of bacon. The bacon was beyond crisp, black and charred. I tried the french toast - which looked fine-  and it tasted completely burnt. I flipped over the french toast and every piece was completely burnt on the bottom. Unbelievable that they would serve this,  have never been served food so very burnt. And the fact they flipped it over to try to hide the burnt side is particularly ridiculous.   When I asked for the food to be remade and showed the waitress the food, she seemed really annoyed and mentioned they were having lots of problems with the kitchen. Sorta figured that part. Can only hope they get back on track.. this used to a favorite local joint and my husband and I are disappointed in the decline of the experience/food quality. Definitely some good staff who work here, always a fan of local businesses. We are routing for you PH!
