I've recently made the switch over to vegetarianism and Golden Empress is easing me into it for sure. Their mock meat dishes are delicious! The mock chicken with peanuts is just spicy enough and the veggies in the dish seasoned well. Love the sauce it's in. They are not small portions either; I've ordered from here a few times and have always had leftovers for a whole second meal. Their online ordering system is super convenient and the delivery is speedy. This is definitely going to be my go to Chinese delivery spot from now on!
