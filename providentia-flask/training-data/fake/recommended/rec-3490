Tomorrow I'm starting this killer diet, so I figured I'd eat the best bullshxt my banging body could find. That's where Bubby's comes in (or at least that's where I thought Bubby's came in ). He ordered Bubby's Breakfast & I ordered the Griddle Special. He ate everything except my 2 tasty pancakes, the cold axx grits & the stringy so called French fries (that I was charged for after the manager offered them as a replacement for the cold axx grits). All I can do is laugh. Fxck Bubby's. #yeahisaidit Â ..2 stars for those 2 good axx pancakes!!!
