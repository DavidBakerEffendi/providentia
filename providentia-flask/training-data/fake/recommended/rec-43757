Went for lunch & drinks with a friend. We started out with a plate of Rosemary Manchego cheese and Blackberry sangria, both very good. Then we enjoyed the prix fixe lunch menu. For appetizers we shared a chilled tomato gazpacho w/ grilled rock shrimp and a warm romaine salad with bacon, grilled asparagus, & a crazy good savory dressing (I think it was some kind of strong cheese that I am oblivious to.) Incredible. Another glass of sangria later we were brought a plate of their homemade chorizo in a red wine sauce with lots of bread (always a good thing) and a dish of chilled marinated mussels in a spicy tomato broth with some really good grilled bread with garlic and herbs. We pretty much licked our plates clean. For dessert we had a small dish of flan and churros with chocolate sauce, both very good. The atmosphere was cozy, I would recommend it for a date. Also, you can see directly into the kitchen and watch them do their thing. I really liked the place & plan on going back to try the Strawberry sangria. Yum. ****
