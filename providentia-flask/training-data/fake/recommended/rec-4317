This place is so much fun. It's great for big groups and events like birthdays cause there's games and the beers come in huuuuuuge quanities!! the food is great (sausages, fries and pretzels, the best drunk foods!) and there's a fire pit in the middle where you can make your own smores. This is a great place to start off for happy hr and then move on to another bar. Or stay here all night! It's so much fun!
