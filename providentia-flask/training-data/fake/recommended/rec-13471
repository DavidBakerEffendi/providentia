This is right around the corner from where I live, so it's my go-to place when it comes to getting a drink. Midtown is full of shitty and overpriced bars, but Rattle n Hum sticks out like a sore thumb as to being one of the only decent bars with a GREAT beer selection. My boyfriend is a huge fan of craft beers so he seems to enjoy it even more than I do (i'm sure he'd give it 5 stars). THeir happy hour is good and always super crowded. and they have live music on some nights which is a nice touch. The staff is very hit or miss- sometimes super friendly, sometimes not so much. I've only gotten food once here and it was okay, but a little overpriced.
