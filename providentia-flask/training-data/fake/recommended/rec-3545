Barbuto has a great environment and is a perfect place to spend an evening with friends over wine. I came here with three of my girlfriends, and we split a bottle of wine and ordered a bunch of things to share. Their eggplant bruschetta appetizer was delicious, and so was their gnocchi. We also ordered pesto pasta, steak and the roast chicken. The first two were delicious, but we found the chicken a bit disappointing considering all the rave reviews about it. For dessert, we had their amazing chocolate mousse. It was also not too pricy-- ~$45 each for a bottle of wine, 2 appetizers, 4 main dishes and a dessert split between 4 people.
