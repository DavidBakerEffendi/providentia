My friends and I went to Soul de Cuba for lunch. We got the croquetas de jaiba, empanadas, papa rellena, chicken fricase, and two desserts. The croquetas were great, crispy and airy, and tasted like crab. The filling of the empanadas was unfortunately dry and bland, though the pastry itself was well fried. The papa rellena had a nice crust to the outside, but the filling - probably the same filling as the beef empanada - and the mashed potatoes tasted pretty bland. The chicken fricase was well cooked but again, extremely bland. Soul de Cuba isn't authentic nor particularly flavorful or spicy. The flan and tres leches cake were excellent though. I'd go back for coffee and dessert.
