By far the best $25 I've spent on real food in New York.  Sure I've had tastier, more expensive meals.  Of course I've had cheaper, snack food.  But as far as values for a sit-down restaurant goes... Kefi takes the prize. This extremely large semi-casual Greek tavern offers small plates in the range of $7-15 and entrees in the range of $11-20.  Nowhere else have I found food this good for that little.  Other Greek restaurants would easily run these selections at $20+  I was extremely hungry, so I ordered 3 small plates: dip sampler, meatballs, and sausage. The dip sampler contained hummus, tzaziki, sun-dried tomato hummus, and a baba ganoush-type eggplant dip.  All were delicious, though nothing unexpected.  Lightly flavored, but definitely tasty.  They were served with 8 pita wedges. The meatballs were served in a tomato sauce with buttery roasted garlic, peppers, and olive oil.  This was fairly ordinary and plain, but the meatballs were as tender as could be.  They fell apart at the split of the fork. House-made sausage was outrageously tender.  Oddly, they undercooked it and it was left a tad red in the center, which made the sausage all the softer.  Crusty on the outside, flavorful and tender on the inside...  Perfect sausage.  It was served with tzaziki and a julienned cucumber relish.  A bit of yogurt, a few strips of cucumber, and a sausage on top of the pita... Best Greek wrap you'll ever have. The food is by no means the best food you'll have, but its flawless and delicious.  Large portions are also a plus.  And the whole thing about a $25 meal only adds on to the greatness.
