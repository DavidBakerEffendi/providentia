Mostly went here for the history, as being the first pizzeria in America.  The layout of the space is interesting, after having our name called we were lead through the dining area, through the kitchen where the pizza ovens are, and into a secondary dining area - it was interesting in a good way, kind of neat.  Started with a salad and then had a pizza.  Nothing extraordinary but a satisfying meal with nice ambiance. Almost forgot, one thing to note.  The waitress was nice but didn't return with my change after I payed the bill - pretty sure it was intentional - the amount I gave was close but slightly higher than meal+tip - but I didn't set an expectation that she should pocket it.  Other than this incident things were great.
