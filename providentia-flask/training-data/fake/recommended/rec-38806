Ok, so yeah this place is good, BUT... 1. It takes a LONG time to get a sandwich 2. It's EXPENSIVE for a sandwich $$$ I will say the chicken and kimchi was amazing. And the large is really big ($13 big? I don't know). It came with a pickle which was also very good. I'll definitely be back, but I'll bring a book to read while I impatiently wait for my sandwich (now all I need to do is buy a book)
