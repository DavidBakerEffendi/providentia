have always ordered pizza from Tonys and recently decided to try a new place in the neighborhood based on price alone....never again. Was so disappointed and regretted it immediately with the first bit. I'll never stray from Tony's again. I've noticed all the low star ratings were based on things other than pizza. I've only ever had the pizza and its great!
