Sometimes a girl just needs a steaming hot bowl of ramen in her life. And that, Terawaka delivers. I usually order the Terakawa ramen (pork). The broth is flavorful, the noodles are slightly chewy/al dente, the pork is perfectly cooked, the vegetables add great texture and the soft boiled marinated egg is the icing on the cake. The buttery yoke drives you straight into the heart of flavor town. The pork buns are pretty good. Soft pillowy buns filled with pork and spicy mayo. The service is great. Everyone is very friendly and makes sure to keep that water cup full at all times. The prices are reasonable. A regular bowl will pleasantly fill your belly. Extra plus if it's a chilly day. Nothing is better than a bowl of ramen on a chilly day! 4 stars because there are very few reman joints in the city and I think Terakawa triumphs over nom nom.
