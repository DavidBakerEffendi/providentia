I really wanted to give it a five, but I could not for a few reasons.  Very very slow on the serving of drinks, to the point of being annoying.  I think the price points are a little on the high side as well. Group of 7 of us, very loud, we had a great time.  Manager of the place was exceptionally warm, as was our waiter (did not catch his name, short fellow, very funny).   The cocktails from the bar in general were spot on (although slow in coming).  The Whiskey Smash is a great drink, and I had two of them. We ordered quite a few appetizers.  The guacamole was good, a little on the hotter side which I personally like.  The chips were delicious as well.  The croquettes and fish tacos were out of this world good.  I literally would go again just for those croquettes.  The Arepas were ok.  Emapanadas were decent as well.  I didn't try any of the cold appetizers, but I bet those are delicious. I had the Lechon, which was good, not great.  I did like the freshness of the habanero sauce though. The Ribeye and costilla were tremendous though, and would recommend them in the future.  Another member of our group had the so-called brazilian paella, which was a very large dish.  He liked it though, although it came out steaming hot.   All in all a fantastic meal.  The space is very nice as well.
