We recently moved here and were hoping to find a good Mexican restaurant in the vicinity and folks, this ain't it. First things first, it is EXTREMELY overpriced, especially for what you get. We ordered a pork tamale to start, a burrito plate, and a chile relleno. All of these items had been left below a heat lamp for too long, which instantly adds a grody flavor; we were one of four tables in the entire restaurant, so this was unnecessary and lazy. On top of that, the food was bland and had no flavor beyond sauce, spice, and vague meat. The cost for this tripe? $50 for two. NEVER AGAIN
