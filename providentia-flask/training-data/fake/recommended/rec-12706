I think this is a chain from the really fabulous Ippudo Ebisu in Tokyo, which has ramen that I dream about. The horrid people that are desperate to get in to this restaurant have ruined it for me. The food is great, but it's just as easy to hop a jet to Tokyo and avoid the anguish of another dense tourist asking me to take a picture of them while in line for a reservation. I bluntly said no to this request, after all, what a disservice to society Â would that have been, that is to have another lame picture at Ippudo NYC to be posted on facebook? For anyone else who is against taking pictures at restaurants (e.g. think Tavern on the Green circa 1990), try the one in Tokyo. You won't be disappointed.
