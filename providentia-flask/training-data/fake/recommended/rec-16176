I was definitely hesitant about Barrio Chino. A hip Mexican hole in the wall in Chinatown? Well the surprise was on me. The best Mexican food I've had in NYC (yes..even rivals the Mexican in LA). I went to Barrio Chino for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Got there around 11:30 and we were seated as soon as we walked in at a large communal table with others already there (always fun once in a while). It was about 90 degrees out so they had the large street windows open which added to the great ambiance. This place is known for their drinks and guacamole so we started off with habanero grapefruit margaritas and a bowl of freshly made guacamole...absolutely delicious. For a main dish, I had the chorizo, eggs and black beans dish. It came out relatively quick and was accompanied by a side salad. Everything tasted really fresh and the spicy chorizo left me wanting more. The bad: Too pricey and that's why I rated it 4 stars and not higher.
