Disclaimer: I was a little drunk during my visit here. I'll do my best to recall with accuracy. The ambience (dark, elegant, intimate) and service (attentive, courteous) were top-notch. We arrived slightly late for our dinner reservation, if I recall, but had only to wait a few minutes before our table was ready. They offer wine lockers here (my bf's sister had one, so we had a bottle of red from it) which I think is a pretty innovative idea - or at least, it was to me. I love the wide selection of game Public offers - I'm all about exotic meats, especially since I don't eat seafood - and this place certainly does interesting things with exotic ingredients. A little TOO interesting if you ask me. I like a some flare, but not too much, and I felt they tried just a bit too hard, and that combined with small portions, loses them a star. We shared grilled kangaroo appetizer, which was perfectly cooked and well balanced the various flavours of falafel, sauce, and relish. I must ashamedly admit that I'd never had kangaroo, despite my Australian nationality, but it was not unlike buffalo, or such, I'd say. Not as strongly flavoured as venison, but certainly more gamey than beef. For entrees, I know we had the roast duck breast, and I believe the venison as well, but I began to get a little hazy at this point. Again, small portions, but perfectly cooked (ie nicely rare in both cares) meats, with good flavours and accompaniments - quite tasty, but lacking that true touch of magic that makes food outstanding, regardless of price point. It's not a cheap restaurant, so I'd return for the interesting game offerings and lovely atmosphere (provided I'd had a large lunch earlier), but there are so many similarly priced restaurants I have yet to explore.
