I really wanted to like this place since it's so close to my house.  On the upside, I liked the beer list and the neighborhood vibe at the bar.  On the down side, the food was absolutely awful.  We started with the short ribs quesadilla, which  was okay.  Unfortunately, we also ordered entrees to share.  The shrimp grits was more of a soup than grits.  (I'm from Atlanta, so I know grits.)  It was so soupy that we though they had brought us the wrong dish.  In addition to being soupy, it had a slightly off taste.  We ate it anyway because we were hungry.  The meatloaf entree came out last.  The meatloaf was as big as my head, though I suspect that my head would taste better than this meatloaf.  We could barely hold back our laughter when the waitress asked if we wanted to take home the majority of the entree.  Based on the location, we'll be back to drink beer but definitely not to eat.  If I could, I'd give the Wishing Well zero stars for food and a three stars for the bar.
