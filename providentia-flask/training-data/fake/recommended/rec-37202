I give stars based on what I expect for that restaurant. When a place exceeds my expectations, especially more than once, they get five. Kumo is well deserving of a five star review. Here is why: The place is beautiful, clean and spacious. Parking is not a problem despite the corner location on a busy street. The hostess is incredibly sweet.  The hibachi chef, Tony, was hilarious, attentive and made our food with precision. We were there for my best friend's birthday, they sang to her three times, and they were so nice we invited the staff to enjoy birthday cake with us after the meal. As far as the food-- there is a reason we drive 45 minutes to Kumo each time. Scallops were perfect. Filet was med. rare and flavorful. Even the vegetables and rice/noodles were worth noting. The sushi rolls we had before our entrees were delectable -- the New Haven roll and Tri-color were really popping with flavor.  The mango martinis and Mai Tais were strong but still sweet and tropical tasting.   All in all, a wonderful evening with amazing food, great service and a great group of friends. Can't wait to do it again.
