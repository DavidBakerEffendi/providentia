So what if the kati rolls have gotten smaller since I first ate here 4 years ago.. and what if sometimes, on a busy evening (or late night) you end up with a not so well toasted wrap..kati roll is still on my 'must go' spots when I am in New York. The tea is way better now than it used to be. Personal favorite - unda chicken (egg n chicken) roll! The achari paneer (it's not too salty sour as the name suggests, achaar means pickle) roll is good if you are a veggie. The aloo (potato) roll is for you, well, only if you really don't want anything else they have to offer on their menu. If there's more than one of you, one of you ought to scoot off to grab the first empty seat and stake claim to the next available empty spot while the other should waste no time in staying put in the line to place your order. Mind you, you might wanna look up the 2 kati rolls for discounted $$ (if you are hungry, 2 is a breeze). Words of wisdom - When the first yummy bite just beckons you to go on without a pause, pray pay heed to the possibility that you might end up with some of those juices from the wrap flowing out onto your plate. If you are sharing, do remember to ask for an extra plate. So long then...bon app√©tit :)
