I came with a friend on a Friday night during prime dinner time (8pm) and it was definitely crowded at the bar, but there was still some seating in the front. Luckily, because it was just the two of us, we were seated right away, side by side on little stools against the wall. I imagine that a larger party would've had to wait a little longer. It's definitely a super cozy place, although it is kind of weird to be sitting and eating next to a shelves of leather bags, luxury toiletries (like lotions and soaps), and gourmet sodas. There were four white wine selections and we chose two. They tasted very similar to each other, but equally delicious. They were fancy french wines, and not familiar to either of us, but our waitress did a good job giving us some background. As for the food, we ordered a dozen oysters (6 of each of the two options) and split the lobster sandwich. The oysters were very fresh, but there wasn't quite enough lobster on the sandwich. The bacon was definitely overpowering. The rest of the menu items sounded pretty delicious, accented with various type of fats like duck cracklins. I have to say, the service was very (almost too) attentive. All in all, i enjoyed the experience. It's just kind of a walk to and from the subway.
