My three friends and I went there last night for dinner and a few drinks. I did not know that yesterday was their first night, the waitstaff and the owners were wonderful. The menu reminded me of a fun SAT exam. We ordered the salmon, beef and vegetable meatballs in mushroom and cheese sauce. I loved the Salmon in the cheese sauce. There was a really good selection of sides as well. We ordered about 6 different types and I think the winners were the braised vegetable and the risotto. Mixing and matching the sauces, sides and meatballs kind of made it a fun way of dining. Okay now I shall speak of the ice cream sandwiches. My goodness! The home made ice cream and cookies were out of this world. The flavors were so rich and fresh. The walnut meringue cookie with the espresso was crazy. The prices are extremely reasonable. I think I want an ice cream sandwich now. Go visit them, it's worth it.
