When I go out to eat, I rarely crave Italian food, so when my friends suggested this place, I was very hesitant. When we walked into the dimly-lit, nicely decorated restaurant, our large party was met with a friendly waitress who was very accommodating to our needs. Before taking our order, she asked if anyone had any allergies. None of us had any allergies, but most of us don't eat pork and she was very helpful in pointing out any items on the menu that had no pork in them. I had the veal which was good, but I tried the rigatoni with meat sauce and that was exponentially better than my dish. Definitely get this dish if you're in the mood for pasta. It was a little different because instead of your standard ground beef, they had shredded beef in the sauce. I don't why, but it made it that much better. We also had the tiramisu which was some of the best tiramisu I've ever had. Tiramisu is one of my favorite desserts and I hate it when they douse the ladyfinger with too much espresso or rum. This dessert wasn't too strong which made it perfect. If the tiramisu is good, then you know it's a good Italian restaurant.
