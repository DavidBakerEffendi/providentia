This place is an incredible find thanks to yelp! I'm not a fan of west Philly, but have been really wanting some Ethiopian food to try for the first time. At first, this place looks like a simple cafe until you read the menu. From what I've read it's a husband/wife ownership and I'm assuming the super sweet woman who helped us was the wife. We ordered the vegetarian platter and one other thing, to which I can't recall the name because it was her suggestion. We were brought heaps of food and could have easily shared the platter, everything tasted super fresh and healthy to beat. I didn't try one thing that I hated, which not knowing anything about ethiopian was A+ for me. This is a new staple in my rotation of restaurants to frequent.
