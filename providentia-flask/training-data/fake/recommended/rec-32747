I was pleasantly surprised. I split a tray with a friend and had a couple of drinks- the food was delicious and reasonably priced, the drinks were a bit overpriced but delicious nonetheless. Bonus points for three salsa varieties, the guac was mild but flavorful, and the fact that most of the menu is gluten free was a big plus for me.
