Love this place.  One of the few burger joints that actually has a turkey option.  All of their burgers appear to be freshly made and they have tons of addin options.  There is a standard menu to choose from and they also have "specials" which include a veggie option I usually get the 500 with turkey and an order of truffle fries, delicious! The buns are pretty standard buttered buns.  Nothing special, nothing to write home about.  The toppings are fresh and very tasty! The meat of the taste comes from... well the meat.  I've never done the beef patty but the turkey is very moist and not dry like it usually can be.  Haven't tried their milkshakes but that is next on the list!
