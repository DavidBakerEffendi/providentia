Another great spot for lunch in the Old City area. This place is a step above Qdoba, Chipotle etc.. The meat is a little better quality and you don't get that 'meat has been sitting out since 10AM' feeling. The line can get quite long during lunch but it moves fast as they have limited options (burritos, tacos, bowls). Only issue is they close quite early during the evenings so don't think about going here after 8 PM.
