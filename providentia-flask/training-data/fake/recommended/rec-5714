It's the bf and my last day in NYC.  It's almost 2 o'clock.  We need to be at the JFK airport by at LEAST 5pm.  We are desperate for delicious New York ramen to tide us over on the flight. Of course, there is a huge line at Ippudo.  What do we do?   We wait.  And surprisingly get seated within 30 minutes (as opposed to the projected one hour wait the hostess told us)! OH. SO WORTH THE WAIT. After being greeted enthusiastically by the staff, we settled in the communal table and ordered the Akamaru & Miso ramen, as well as the Omakase Appetizer (chef's choice).   Akamaru Ramen was divine, chock full of garlic and salty flavor.  The pork slices were so tender and nearly melted in my mouth.  My bf's Miso Ramen had a nice creamy and slightly sweet taste to it.  We both conceded that though delicious, we wanted the broth a bit thicker in consistency. The Omakase Appetizer was a delicious spread of three meats: fresh salmon sashimi, roasted duck, and a slightly chilled shredded pork.   Great food for a reasonable price.  I also loved that a Mariah Carey album was blaring in the background the entire time.  This place is definitely a must-try for any ramen lover.
