Being a Massachusettsian, I feel I've had a relatively well rounded pizza experience. I've always thought that Papa Gino's is the best pizza around, and recently gave some accolades to Halftime Pizza as well in Boston. But when it comes to pizza, I'm picky. It's gotta be good, it's gotta make me hate myself a little after eating it, and it's gotta be a good value for the price. For Philly, this is a great slice. It was about the size of a Sal's slice, but without the extra crust and grease. I got a slice of buffalo chicken, and it was perfect. Good ratio of cheese/chicken/hot sauce, and big enough that I had one of those "I feel so full, I hate myself, never doing that again even though I know I probably will" feelings; that's when you know you got a decent slice! For a slice and a bottle of water, I paid less than $5. The service was friendly, the food came out fast, and I definitely will be stopping here again.
