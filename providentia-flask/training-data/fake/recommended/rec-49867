Stumptown.... I bow down..... Best coffee in town. Good goodies, too. Yummy cupcakes and other stuff, but I really come here to savor that complex, smooth, delicious coffee. A tiny deduction for the uncomfortable seating. Bony chairs, but hey... otherwise, people would set up shop and linger half the day, the atmosphere is so pleasant.
