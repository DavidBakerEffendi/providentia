This is such a cute, original and cozy little place. And all the food we ordered were really good and tasted just like Italy! (jk) We started off with some very delicious arancinis and an avocado salad that was very fresh and delightful (good portion for sharing too). We were then graced with the presence of a special - BURRATA! It's very rare to find good quality burrata in NYC and this place did not disappoint at all. The super-friendly owner(i think?) lady explained that it's a very seasonal ingredient and therefore they did not want to put it on the menu yet - if you crave for burrata, make sure you give her your number for immediate contact upon arrival! The risotto dishes we ordered were all very delicious. Mushroom is a definite must-get. The Del Fontanile was VERY generous with the ingredients and very flavorful - almost tasted like paella! The pesto is very refreshing and not too heavy, but does not have much "ingredient" (aka meat or veggie). In the mood for a slightly sweet risotto? Try the fig risotto wrapped in prosciutto. Very interesting flavor and perhaps not for the faint of heart. This is overall a very comfy reasonable and enjoyable little restaurant. The cherry on top is it's BYOB until they get the liquor license. Hit it up before word gets out and it gets busy!
