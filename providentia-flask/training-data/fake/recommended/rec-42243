Thai food is not the first kind of food I think of when I want to go out to dinner in Park Slope, but after eating at Song, it's one of the top 5 places I enjoy going to in The Slope. The spicy noodles were referred to me by wife who frequents the establishment for years now, and I was totally impressed. It has the perfect balance of not killer spicy, but just enough that it brings a tear to my eye. The food is always fresh and the ambiance is comfortable and modern. The waitress's can pay more attention to detail at times. Last time I was there, I was not brought the Thai ice tea I ordered and I couldn't seem to find my waitress to remind her. By the time we did see her, we were done with our meal. It doesn't take away from the quality of the food and I highly recommend this restaurant!
