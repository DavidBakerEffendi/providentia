I always feel like Starr restaurants are all ambiance with little substance. It's certainly a "cool" place to go in an Epcot kind of way. The guacamole with goat cheese is pretty darn good, but everything else is just "fine" and the portion sizes are very small. The service has been slow when I have been in there for dinner, and everything is overpriced.
