There has been a lot of hype around these burgers, and I must say I was not disappointed! I really enjoyed the simplicity of the burger, and the three different sauces they served along with the burgers were delicious.  I am a big fan of the spicy sauce which had a nice, subtle kick that hits you a few seconds after you taste it. The truffle fries with cheese were equally exciting.  And I loved the fact that they weren't drenched in cheese as they are in some other joints.  Just enough to make them tasty with a little something extra.   I went on a Sunday afternoon, so the wait wasn't too long, but I'm not sure I would wait hours for their burgers.
