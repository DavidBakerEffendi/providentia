I've been trying to go to Brooklyn Star for over a year, and man, has it been worth the wait. Recently went here for dinner on a Monday evening with Rus, Jes and Ras and we had a delicious meal! Coming on a Monday was a good choice. The restaurant was about half empty, definitely still bumping at the bar, but only a few tables were seated in the back area. They don't take reservations for your party (unless you're 6 or more), so be prepared to wait if you're coming during prime time. We ordered the bone marrow, the spicy fried duck wings, mac and cheese with bacon, cornbread, and the fried chicken dinner with mashed potatoes and collard greens. Everything was so good! The fried chicken was some of the best that I've had at a restaurant, as were the mashed potatoes. I don't fully understand the joy of bone marrow, but it seemed like Rusty and Ras were really enjoying it, so it must have been good. The duck wings were also delicious; we were sopping up the spicy sauce 'til it was all gone. They also have hot spiked cider. Super yum. Brooklyn Star is extremely filling, with a menu that will knock your socks off. Prices are a bit on the more expensive side, but it's definitely worth it. I can't wait to go back for their brunch and for the T-Bone.
