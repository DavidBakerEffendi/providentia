When my friends and I can't handle another second more of being groped and prodded at Plough & the Stars, we head on over to Sassafras for sweet potato fries and a recap of our night. And let's just be honest, we sometimes plan our nights AROUND a late night snack of these delicious fries: salty, crispy, and served alongside the yummiest garlic aioli. We've been known to force ourselves out to P&S or other neighboring Old City bars, if only so we can leave after 30 minutes, convinced that we've earned our Sassafras fries! So to sum it up: amazeball fries (pretty sure they'd be delicious while sober too), good cocktails, and a cool ladies room!
