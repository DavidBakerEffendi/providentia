My favorite place in all of Philly to brunch, followed close by Day By Day. Nothing overly fancy here, they just do traditional breakfast right. The biscuits, jam, and grits cannot be matched. Don't go here on the weekend if you are in a rush. Brunch is about enjoying being alive and hungry and recovering from the previous night. I go here for friendly service, the best breakfast/brunch in the city, and because I have so many good memories here with friends and family.
