I was in New Haven Yesterday and was told Sandra's was a must Visit.   That was an understatement:). I had one of the best meals ever. My friend and I were treated like Royalty by Sandra's staff they suggested we start off with a Mason jars of Their Lemonade And the Peach Ice tea unbelievable we ordered two extra to take with. Next I told our server I wanted the Oxtails and she demanded I also get their Carribean Rice:). I could have kissed her. I rounded out my meal with Yams and Mac & Cheese my friend ordered a house special Marinated chicken with fried okra and green beans I finished her chicken:) I asked if the owner was in and Sandra herself came out and she couldn't have been more Hospitable. She was wonderful I also met her Husband and she informed me her four children were also working.  If you ever get close to New Haven Ct  like Columbus Ohio, :) it's worthy of a visit. I was truly impressed with the food and the service. Love ya Sandra!!! Your New friends Forever James and Andrea:)
