This is a cool, hip place to go in Fishtown!  Great place for drinks on the their deck during nice summer days.  On my first visit they had Sangria which was just ok.  I recommend sticking to beer and they have a nice draft list. I went with the Allagash White which has a nice fruity, smooth flavor.  The menu has almost a New Orleans feel to it with Po Boys etc. I went with the pulled pork sandwich with fries. It was delicious! Nice sweet flavor of the pulled pork on a fresh bun and the homemade fries were tasty.  Others in our large party of 10 ordered burgers and wings.  The service was quick even with our big group and they were able to pull together tables so we could sit outside.
