Saturday night was my first trip to Alla Spina & it will certainly not be my last!  We snagged a last-minute reservation, but ended up having to wait almost an hour to be seated.. bummer.  Luckily we had time to browse the menu while waiting at the bar, so once we were seated we knew right away what to order.  We started with the pretzels & beer cheese sauce (it said spicy beer cheese sauce, but it didn't seem spicy at all) & they were a HUGE hit.  We even kept the cheese around to dip our beef fat fries in.  I ordered the Maple Glazed Fried Chicken (crispy, juicy, amazing) & my friends got the sausage cheesesteak (delish, but I could only eat like 2 bites of it.. so rich) and the beef tenderloin.  After devouring our meals, we saved room for the Choco Taco dessert.  Just like the original, but so much better.  Can't wait to come back again!
