The food here is SO DELICIOUS. The kitchen wasn't opening until 5:00pm, but they were happy to seat us and serve us drinks when we arrived at 4:45. Our waitress took our order as soon as the kitchen opened and was very attentive. I had the tomato soup off the regular menu and a spicy honey chicken sandwich, which was one of the specials. The tomato soup was described as coming with "grilled Vermont cheddar cheese." I thought that meant there would be cheese on top of my soup, but no. IT ARRIVED WITH AN ACTUAL GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH. It was awesome, obviously. And the soup itself was so creamy it was orange. My chicken sandwich was great too, huge and fried and topped with diced pickles (!!) which I loved, but might've been hard for a pickle hater to pick off. And the French fries reminded me of boardwalk fries. Highly recommended! I can't wait to go back.
