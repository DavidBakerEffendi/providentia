I've been here multiple times for food and hookah. It's a great place for a date, the patio is cute and small. The hookah lounge itself can get busy because it's a tiny area so you might end up sitting at just a table which I personally don't mind because you don't get much privacy if the lounge is super busy. The atmosphere is my favorite part of this place. I will definitely come back.
