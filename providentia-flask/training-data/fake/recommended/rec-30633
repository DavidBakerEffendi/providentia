I went here for dinner Friday night.  My friend lives nearby and had gone for brunch several times and was a big fan.   The good: my drink was tasty--gin and jersey...it was great. Perhaps dinner is just not their thing...I had the suckling pig and friend had the duck and both were bad.  No flavor out of duck and suckling pig? there is something wrong with that...other friend had salad and that was good.  So I guess they have decent brunch and they can make a salad but save your $30 bucks and don't bother with the dinner entrees.  terrible.  i will not be back
