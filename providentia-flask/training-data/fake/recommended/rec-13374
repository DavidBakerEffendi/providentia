After seeing a Broadway show, my husband and I were wandering the streets tired and hungry, looking for a good place to grab a bite before heading back to our hotel. It was getting later and later, restaurants were closing, and we were losing patience, about to start gnawing on eachothers arms. Yelp to the rescue! NY style pizza, with rave reviews, a block away from our hotel? Please tell me this is for real! We hoofed it to Patzeria Perfect. I was a little unsure about it- it definitely doesn't look like much. Our growling stomachs and aching feel left us no choice. Â We grabbed 2 Margherita slices, a Hawaiian slice (for dessert) and two Amstel lights to enjoy in the comfort of our hotel room. IT WAS THE BEST PIZZA I HAVE EVER EATEN. I'm not lying. The crust was not too thick, not too thin, a little crispy from being twice baked. The sauce was plentiful and sweet. The cheese was nice and gooey. My mouth is actually watering as I write this. It really was perfect.
