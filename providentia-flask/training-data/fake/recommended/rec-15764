My three siblings and I went here with my grandma for her birthday., yesterday (it Â was a Tuesday) Place was busy-dinner was at 7. It was awesome. She had never been-she loved it. The food was very fresh, the waitstaff helps with recommendations.-Not just the more expensive item but what they think will do better with the other items you have ordered. Great wine, great food, best service around. Ask for a table in the back. The cost is typical for NYC.
