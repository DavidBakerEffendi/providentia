Ok, so I haven't tried the food but who cares? As an aspiring architect, this is exactly the kind of space I'd want to create! What better way to spend a summer's afternoon/evening than in a beer garden/hall? Their selection of beers was great bla bla all that good beer snobbery nonsense but what really got me was that beer garden. It's a perfect way to socialize and once in a while join in on conversations with strangers- under some sun umbrellas with a the breeze sweeping your back. Oh and did I mention they have a woman walking around who's sole duty is to offer your pretzels thrice the size of your face?
