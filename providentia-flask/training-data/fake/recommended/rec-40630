Awesome drinks and great food. I had the chicken enchiladas that I thought would be ok but I was really surprised at how good the sauce was. Â I also had a couple oh great drinks... One I highly recommend we the pineapple canela. If you decide to sit outside beware the cockroaches, but that's basically any of the downtown Philly spots. But overall it's a great spot. Pricey but good.
