My overall impression of the place is its a pretty (but strange) location with a great view but the food is just eh. There was nothing wrong with the meal, it was fine, but it was nothing special or amazing that I would want to go back for. To go that far out of the way, I expect to be wowed. The staff - especially the bartender- was really great. As a starter, i had the pork and corn pasta, which in hindsight I should have had as a main dish and the pork chop as my main. The pork chop was well cooked and I love the peaches but the rest of the plate was eh. The best part of the meal was the sorbet. It was light and refreshing.
