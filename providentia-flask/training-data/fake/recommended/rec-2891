REUBEN!!!!!! Where have you gone my love?! I came here regularly to delight in your pleasures! To taste the tenderness of your flesh and the brightness of your kraut. You were my beloved. Why have you left me? I have been to this cozy neighborhood joint numerous times. I've tried a ton of things. All are good, some are super (the kielbasa rocks). But the Reuben must have been too close to heaven to stay with us. That sandwich could woo me from my hungover slumber. It could convince me to leave my house and put on human clothes. It was the grandest, I say. Memphis!!! BRING HER BACK!!! It was so good my boyfriend and I would literally be walking to a different restaurant, look at each other and say, "Wouldn't a Reuben be better?" turn around and walk to Memphis. Then we'd sit down and BOTH order the succulent hunk of meat love and slip into a heavenly beer food coma. I could go on. But I won't. You get it. I'm mourning. I just want her back :'''(
