Cafe Orlin was rated as one of the best brunches to visit so we made plans to eat there. They do not take reservations for brunch and we waited for over an hour to be seated. Not a big deal since it was brunch on a Saturday in East Village. But then the food came out and it was just ok. I had the Norwegian salmon eggs benedict, with the eggs overdone and the potatoes dry. If you're looking for a solid brunch place with nothing special you have it right here at Cafe Orlin. Nothing to complain about and nothing to praise.
