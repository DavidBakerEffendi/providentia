This place is below par in light of the configuration of the dining room. I believe when you eat out, if the place is expensive, which this place is, the food should be good and the experience should be good. The food is good the experience is terrible. If you are a party of 2 chances are you will have the worst tables in the restaurant. All the "two tops" are in the smaller, low ceiling, part of the restaurant and not the open nice part. It's a shame.
