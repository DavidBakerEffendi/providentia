Love the ambiance, decor, and interior design. The bar area is modern and hip.  I was there with other 4 people.  We just kind of walked into the restaurant on a whim on a Saturday evening around 5.  Dinning area was pretty much booked for reservation, but the bar area was pretty empty.  Since we didnt really want to have a formal sit down dinner, we just hung around the bar area. We all ordered different small plates.  Brussel sprouts was so delicious with a mixed flavor of sweet from the grapes and a slight bitterness from brussel sprouts.  Duck Sherwama was good, it can be a full meal in my opinion.  Dipping sauce for the Fries was very tasty too.  I now want to go back and try their entrees. Oh! and my Mojito was mixed to perfection!
