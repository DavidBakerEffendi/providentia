Good food when it is fresh but half the time when I come here the food is dried out. This place gets 3 stars because they dont have vegetarian dishes. And everytime I come in I have to wait for steamed veggies. if there is a low amount of food left they wont opt to make any fresh batch for the customer ordering. Other than that I like their chow mein and orange chicken. But then again I can always get that anywhere else.
