I loved this place when it opened, and ever since.  Interesting and tasty menu options.  I've had lunch and dinner here. So why 1 star?  The NYC Dept. of Health review with 7 critical violations. I am a big fan a small businesses, but I am an even bigger fan of my good health.  If the violations are resolved, I will update my review with actual recommendations.  Until then, be mindful that appearances can be very deceiveing.
