So I was in NYC with my family and my wife found this breakfast place.  We waited 1 hour to be seated on a VERY hot day.  Somebody has done some good marketing because there is no way I would wait to eat here again.  The food is tasty but nothing earth shattering.  It certainly is not any bargain either. They do have an excellent Text Message system when your table is ready.  I just wish I did not have to rely on such a system for that long hour I waited. My recommendation is if you are nearby and there is no wait go for it.  If the wait is more than 15 minutes check out someplace else.
