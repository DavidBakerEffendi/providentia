Wow... Just wow. One of the best meals I've had in a while. Who knew crepes could be so freaking good? I had the white wine, potato and bacon crepe and my girlfriend had the fig and goat cheese one. One of the the best cups of coffee ever too. We had the organic French press and it kept me going all the way back to philly. Â Do yourself a solid and Eat here.
