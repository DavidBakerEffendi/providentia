Mmmmm I love this place!!!! Everything is reasonably priced, they always have yummy specials, and I love that they send you a text message when your table is ready. The food is consistent and really good!! I have to try the "kitchen sink" which seems to be the ultimate breakfast served in a skillet. Order the cheesy grits for the table...you won't regret it!!!!
