A good, local place. Came here with family, and we ordered a mix of sandwiches and pizza. The sandwiches were very good -- I give this place 5 stars as a sandwich shop. The bread was fresh, the chips were home-made and delicious, everything was great. The pizza was well intentioned (and pretty good), but I just don't think they have the oven for a great pizza. The crust was a little too soggy, without the right crisp. Service was also a bit disorganized, but there were a lot of us. I will come here again for sandwiches.
