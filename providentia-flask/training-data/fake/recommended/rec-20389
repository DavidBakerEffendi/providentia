Terrific place for drinks - haven't tried the food yet, but I can't wait - looked great when I was there enjoying old school gin martinis (served in those brilliant, rounded martini glasses circa 1952).  Very cool wait staff and excellent decor.  Definitely check it out if you're feeling parched on the south side.
