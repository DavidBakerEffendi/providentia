My aunt and I stumbled in here from a rainy street. After ogling the menus along Korea Way, a nice gentleman in a hotel uniform held the door open to us and encouraged us to "check it out". We were both glad that we took his advice. I tackled the hot bar. First, I have to admit that I am not a big fan of really spicy food or kimchee, so my options were a bit limited. Still, I was able to score some tasty shredded beef, a fried chicken in sweet sauce, and some tasty roasted pork and gravy with potatoes. To complete the meal I picked up a set of prepackaged vegetable dumplings. These were the only "yuck" of the meal since they were tainted with egg. I just don't like egg. Sorry. My aunt tried a beef dish--ribs of some ilk and some Kimchee and rice soup. She was quite satisfied with both of her choices. Each of our meals totalled less than a ten spot, including a drink. Worth checking out!
