THE PRICE IS RIGHT! 53rd Street and 6th Avenue at night is the perfect place to be for halal chicken or lamb meat!  I am usually not a huge fan of lamb meat because I can taste a certain after taste that I really can't stand. However, when my friend got a plate of half chicken and half lamb on a bed of safferon rice, with a side of greek yogurt and hot sauce, it was to die for!  I highly recommend this hang out spot with plenty of seating on the steps to the side, beautiful night life, plenty of people watching and GREAT food.  I love New York and good eats like this make me want to come back.  My friends and I got lucky because supposedly the line can get pretty long at night and apparently this cart only comes out after 6pm, therefore don't be fooled by other carts that might occupy the same spot at early hours!  There were plenty other Halal carts too but you should definitely try the one at this corner.  A plate of food and drink for only 8 dollars. I left very happy!
