mhmm..I don't think this is the best pizza I've ever had.  It wasn't bad...I mean...I was anticipating a "wow or/and omg" reaction from eating this famous NY pizza.  Unfortunately, I didn't get the wow factor eating their pizza.  I wouldn't come all the way to NYC for pizza.  I can get really good ones here in CA.
