I've had the chicken biscuit andwich and the beef on challah sandwich. The chicken biscuit one was good and I would definitely get it again. The beef on challah sandwich was okay, but was salty and not flavorful at the same time. I do like the fact that it's on challah though. I've also had their bread puddig, which has good flavor but is a little dry. Maybe popping it in the microwave would help. They are very reasonably priced which bumps this to a four star.
