Don't really understand the hype about this place. The outdoor seating is a plus, but the decor is just kind of blah. I didn't find the staff to be friendly, they seemed bothered and rushed and more interested in constantly smoking cigarettes out in front than tending to their customers. Food took a bit long to come out and it would be nice if they took credit card and if they also had a drink menu as well - that would probably bump up the experience a bit for me. The fries were a disappointment. Definitely not handcut and the sweet potato fries got cold in a second. The pulled pork sandwich and the rib sandwich were very good, though, as well as the mac and cheese but nothing outstanding - I've definitely had better, but it's a decent place to come to if you're looking for a "quick" bite to eat. I wouldn't come back here, but I wouldn't NOT recommend it anybody. It's more of just an "eh."
