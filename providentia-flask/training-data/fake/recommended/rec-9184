I can't believe how good their chicken and lamb over rice is.   I ate 1/2 of the container after having a 3 hour dinner at a sit down restaurant that involved too many courses to count.  I thought I was going to explode, but I couldn't stop eating because the chicken and lamb with the white sauce was so good. Don't get scared off too much by the line.  It moves pretty quick.
