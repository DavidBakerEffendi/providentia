I got the chicken katsu curry to go this afternoon.  I just needed something quick to go and it was AMAZING.  Like Carol said, I would recommend getting the katsu on the side. I also got the Bimbimbop for later this evening.  I cannot wait.  Though the front of the restaurant looks rather sad, the food cannot be any different.  If you're looking for somewhere to get a quick lunch in midtown, I would highly recommend stopping by here.
