Great lunch spot. Stopped by with my parents today for quick lunch. Lunch special is great deal. We ordered two lunch special and one appetizer and still had left over. Lunch special burrito was huge and my parents loved it. And my parents are pretty picky eaters so I assumed burrito was good even though I didn't taste it. I had chicken taco which was great as well. I will def come back again.
