I've been to Amada a couple times but last night was my first opportunity to go with a group of vegetarians like myself. We sampled quite a few options. My favorites were: Setas: Mix of grilled mushrooms. Buttery and hearty. Our waitress encouraged us not to overlook it and she was right. Berenjenas: Roasted eggplant with raisins and goat cheese. Perfect combination of sweet and smoky. Amada's Empanada: Delicious but pretty small given the price. If I had the $ I would eat 10 of these. Alcachofas Y Setas: the vegetarian flat bread option. Very satisfying for manchego fans. We also tried the Tortilla Espanola, Arroz Temporado and the Esclavada. All really nice but didn't stand out as much as the others. The only disappointment was the bread. Apparently the complimentary bread is not vegetarian. They brought out a spiced cracker with tomato dip that was very eh. Seems like they should be able to do a more interesting complimentary options for vegetarians.
