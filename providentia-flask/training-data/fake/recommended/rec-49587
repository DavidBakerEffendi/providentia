After reading only a couple of reviews on Yelp for this place, I knew I had to go. So I did. And it was d.e.l.i.c.i.o.u.s. The sushi, salads, and fresh rolls are colorful, beautifully presented, and delectable. And did I mention healthy, too? Seriously, I want this place to become a chain. It's friggin' brilliant. The ONLY reason it doesn't get 5 starts is because it would've been nice to have more drinks options. Namely alcohol. Does a comment like that put me on the fast track to rehab? Will a psychotherapist eventually read this and give me shit for it? Perhaps. But c'mmon, if you're going for dinner--especially one as delicious as this one--you want to imbibe, do you not?
