This was my first time at this restaurant. I attended for my friend's birthday and she had a set menu. It was set up as family style because of the amount of people. I let the waitress know in the beginning of the meal that I was gluten-free. She was absolutely amazing. She let me know everything that I could eat and anything that I could not eat a special plate was brought out of a item I was able to eat. Shana was absolutely amazing and the food was mind blowing.
