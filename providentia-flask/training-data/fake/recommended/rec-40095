I came back to New York with my parents to see the Addams Family on Broadway.  I decided to take them here for dinner after my past good experience.  The service was great, and the food was great all around.  My dad devoured his Veal Francese, and he's not easily impressed when it comes to food.  We stuck around for dessert this time as well, and the cannoli was amazing.  5 stars for two excellent dinners here now.
