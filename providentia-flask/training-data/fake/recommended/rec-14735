I thought this place was great! The service was excellent from the moment we walked in.  They constantly refill your waters.  There were many entries that were cheap considering we are dealing with NYC standards.  The place itself is chic and has a cute, intimate design. This would be perfect for a date night or a night out.  Drinks are moderately prices.  We got two drinks and they each cost $9 per drink. The food was great also.  We both finished our plates.  I got the Pad Sea Ew and my friend ordered a salad and the ribs.  It was a great experience from the very beginning.   I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a Thai place near Times Square!
