Bistango offers a large selection of gluten-free, Italian food with top-notch service in a very friendly environment.   First, the food.  The waitress placed wonderful, toasted, gluten-free bread at the table, with a tasty oil and garlic dipping sauce.  The owner told us that he orders the bread from Everybody Eats in Brooklyn.  The gf bread was some of the best that I've tasted in a restaurant. I ordered the "Barbabietola" salad, consisting of roasted beets, toasted walnuts, gorgonzola, arugula, and pomegranate vinaigrette.  The size was just right for two people, and the veggies were fresh.  The vinaigrette was slightly sweet without being saccharine.  Next came the spinach ravioli in a marinara sauce.  The pasta tasted fresh, and the spinach filling was rich.  The marinara sauce had a strong flavor, without being overwhelming or acidic. I drank Green's gluten-free beer, which has a strong body and crisp taste (and which I prefer to Anheuser-Busch's Redbridge).  For dessert, I tasted an apple tart, consisting of apple wedges spread over chocolate cream and encased in a nut-based crust.  A dollop of vanilla ice cream with a sprig of mint completed this amazing dessert.   As for the service: the waitress explained which items on the menu could be prepared gluten-free (although the menu also details the gf items). She was at the table when we needed her, but otherwise unobtrusive.   The owner came out twice to check on our table and was very attentive, which was particularly impressive given how busy the restaurant was.  The food arrived in good time, but we never felt rushed and had ample time between courses to digest our food and enjoy the ambiance.  A top-notch dining environment. Note: I recommend calling ahead to make reservations.
