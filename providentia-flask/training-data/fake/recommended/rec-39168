after living in tribeca for 9 months, i finally had the infamous bubby's brunch this past Saturday.  went with a friend around 1:15 pm and the place was packed. we probably waited 20 minutes for a table (which was fine, neither of us had been out the night before - otherwise the crowded bar area would NOT have been the place to nurse a hangover). i had a bloody mary which was perfectly seasoned.  the decor is definitely cozy, mom and pop-ish, with pies and cookbooks on display.  got to our table and the hardest thing was deciding what we wanted!!  my friend suggested the cheese blintzes which is not something i would have normally considered but we went for it and they were AMAZING. crepes with a rich cheese filling covered in gooey blueberry sauce.  we also got the special omelet, which was bacon, apple, and cheddar, which is a combo i love..i thought the omelet was good but lets face it, you can get good omelets at most decent restaurants/diners right??  i would definitely come back (especially since i live in the 'hood, and have also heard great things about dinner here so would like to try that too. PS make sure to allow ample time between this meal and the next one. you will be STUFFED when you leave. in fact, best to go straight home and take a nap!
