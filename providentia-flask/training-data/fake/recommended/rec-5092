Came here for dinner this week.  After many of the reviews online, I was expecting a beyond amazing experience.  While the food was not amazing, it was tasty and the flavor combinations and dish pairings were creatively ambitious.  The food was good.  And the waitstaff was pleasant. Dinner We were provided two amuse bouche(s), which were both delicious.  One top of puffed pastry it seemed with asiago cheese and the other was a chilled aspargus soup.  Those two items and the bread/dips were by far the best part of the meal.  Started off with raw oysters and quite honestly one of the best in Brooklyn so far.   We also ordered the lamb tortellini.  Flavorful combination, but the pasta was overcooked.  Also took the advice of fellow yelp reviewers and ordered the octopus.  I would have preferred a lighter/softer octopus.  The beans seemed overcooked.  And the two together wasn't a perfect pairing.  But I will say the flavor of the sauce with the beans was tasty.  We also ordered the cod and rabbit.  Rabbit was along one of our favorites of the night.  For dessert we had the peach item in the parchment paper.  It was just okay. All in all, good restaurant for the neighborhood.
