On my way to Virginia( from Boston), I decided to do the Pats vs Genos Cheese Steak challenge.  I tried Pat's on my way down, then Geno's on the way home.  First of all, u do need to be prepared to order correctly, dont ask 2 much Qs and have ur $ ready.  The service is not the friendliest, cuz honestly they dont have 2 b.  U are warned on the wall while waiting in line on how to order so if u pay attention, u will b aiight.   Your cheese steak will b ready in mere seconds after u order, and will surely hit the spot.  Proportions r just rite, although a bit pricey.  Spice fanatics will love the roasted chilli peppers in their condiments section, i had 2 grab a handful 2 take back home with me 2 Boston.  Not exactly for the over sensitive or very timid as they may not like Pat's direct and no BS style.   I cant believe the low score avg, they deserve better.  Its fun 2 try both Genos and Pats but if u could only eat at one, its gotta b Pat's.
