We enjoyed the gravlax and chicken salad sandwiches for a casual weeknight dinner. Both were served on a great baguette and were generously sized. We also appreciated the unusual selection of sodas. The menu was simple, but there were several options we both would have happily ordered. (The menu didn't list the onions in the chicken salad, so be forewarned if you're not a fan.) The space was a little underwhelming, although we liked the darker colors and family-style seating. It nevertheless felt too sparse (could perhaps use a divider to break up the space between the dining and counter areas). The woman working behind the counter was helpful and cheerful. We will definitely be back...actually, I could use a prepared dinner for takeout tomorrow....
