Came for lunch and looking forward to coming back for dinner.  The Guacamole samplers ROCKS!!  But, requires Margarita pairing.  Huevo Rancheros is as close to authentic as a contemporary Mexican restaurant can be north of the border.   Oh yeah!  The oversized Yuca fries...YUM!! Great place for groups.   Cheers
