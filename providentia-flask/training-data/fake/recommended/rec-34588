Crazy long lines, the only cart for miles that has anything near a line and the food is great. It's mostly because the food is fresh, they are making so much on demand that nothing you get has been sitting around for a while burning up and getting old. Mind you this is cart good and it is greasy... Be warned, the hot sauce is very hot. This is not tabasco, heck it's not even the extra hot tabasco, it is crazy spicy, insane heat, and totally delicious.
