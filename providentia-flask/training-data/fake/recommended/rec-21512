S'mores Bread Pudding - I've never actually stepped foot in this restaurant.  However, my boyfriend brought home takeout tonight and I'm in love.  He had been craving The Chronic for months and finally decided to bite the bullet and pick it up on his way home.  He also brought home what is without a doubt the best dessert I have ever had in my entire life. S'mores Bread Pudding.  The "bread pudding" is the most delicious moist brownie covered with that classic taste of big gorgeous roasted marshmallows.  Oh, and it comes with a graham cracker ice cream which is enough to start your drooling on its own.   Can't testify to their food, but definitely go for dessert! WOW!
