Gastro-pub food evolved!  Yes, the burgers are all that (with a side of chips) but there's plenty of great eats on the menu as well.  You can't go wrong with the Duck Pot Pie, the Meatloaf or the FishTacos (although the Salmon Tacos seem less good than others, so unless you're crazy about Salmon, wait for the next iteration).  Dining companions have raved equally about the Korean BBQ sliders and the Lamb Belly Sandwich.  Beer selection is always good too.  Come!  Sit!  Stay!  Good Dog!
