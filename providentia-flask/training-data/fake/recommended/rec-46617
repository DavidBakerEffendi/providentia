I walked into this place today and loved everything about it! The cozy warmth of the fireplace was perfect on this chilly day. Our bartender was very accommodating when my tomato veggie soup needed some bread for dipping :) The veggie burger had a consistency of a crab cake, which was surprisingly awesome! Loved the arugula salad too! Thanks so much! I'll be back :)
