I expected more. Lombardi's has been named again and again as one of THE NY pizza spots, so I finally gave it a shot. Now, I'm not going to pretend to be a great pizza expert, as I am one of those dreaded Caifornians who keep being mentioned in these reviews. But I know what Di Fara's in Brooklyn tastes like (review coming soon), and this place is not even in the same ballpark. There is practically no cheese (at least on the original pie), and the thin curst verges on flimsy. On the plus side, service is very friendly, and we didn't wait long for a 2-top table on a Thursday night around 9 - maybe 15 minutes. But it's not worth crossing town by bus and subway for.
