Not what it used to be, that's for sure. Red Cat is (or maybe was...) my favorite NYC restaurant for years. The space, the service, and the creative menu, not to mention being consistently good all around. However, for the second time in as many months, I've been disappointed by the experience. My partner and I had dinner here last night after a lovely walk on the High Line and regrettably, the food was subpar. The tempura bacon salad was thoroughly gross (too many flavors, poorly assembled, and reeked of blue cheese, which i normally like). The roast chicken was a greasy, buttery mess and not well cooked at all. Had it not been for the tempura green beans, I think I would have walked out....The service is aloof now (it used to be so nice). The whole place is starting to feel old and shabby....and the clientele feels a lot more touristy (and geriatric) than artsy and cool. I think my enthusiasm for Red Cat is beginning to wane....after 11 years of dining here every three months or so.
