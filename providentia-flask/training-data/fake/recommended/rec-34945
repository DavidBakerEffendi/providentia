The food could be a little spicier, but everything I've had here is tasty. The vegetable samosas are particularly good. Unlike many other Indian places, they have goat on the regular menu, which I find excellent since it can be one of the best red meats available when prepared right. I haven't been there for the lunch buffet, but friends say it's good.
