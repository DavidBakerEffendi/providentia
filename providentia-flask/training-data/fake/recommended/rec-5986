Pat's popped my cheesesteak cherry. Visiting from NYC for the weekend, me, bf & best friend stopped in. Don't know why, but I've just *never* had a Philly cheesesteak, here or anywhere else till this weekend.  It just never appealed. After our drive from Queens, early check-in at the hotel and a few minutes pumping the a/c as cold as it could get, we realized we were HUNGRY. We decided to head to one of the 2 biggies to sample the local legendary foodz.  Walked from the Doubletree on Broad in CC through the italian section (quite amusing!) and finally, after what seemed like forever in the sickening heat and humidity, arrived at the intersection of Cheesesteaks.   We got on Pat's line because Geno's seemed a touch longer and we are lazy.  After 20 minutes of waiting we were all starving.  I ordered mine wit' and with provolone, then got on the soda line, which for some reason was the BIG hold-up that afternoon.  Seriously??? But anyways - clearly there were no seats to be had, so we ate em standing up. It was pretty yummy, I'll admit.  The steak wasn't overly chewy, the onions were good, but I would have liked a little more cheese (ok I love cheese.)  I wasn't blown away, but I would definitely eat one again.
