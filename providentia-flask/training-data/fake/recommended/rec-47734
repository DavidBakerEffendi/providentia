Great.  The fakin bacon BLT was amazing.  The best fake blt I have ever had.  I also enjoyed my nutella french toast but it's not really french toast.  It's more like nutella on a baguette cut into thirds and fried.  Still good.  The waffles were not the best especially compared to the other food.  Had to wait 45 minutes but worth the wait. Good service. Mimosa was pulpy.
