I usually buy whatever hummus is on sale at the supermarket, but Dizengoff is a game changer. Solely hummus, sold out of a fancy garage, this place is an ideal place to Â - that is, if you don't mind a wait and grabbing your food to-go (like mentioned numerous times before me, this place is TINY. seating for 20). The menu changes day to day, but my lamb and beef, with mint hummus blew anything I've ever consumed hummus-wise out of the water. Served with a huge pita, a side of pickled vegetables (a few pickles, onions, and tomatoes), this will certainly sustain you, even on your hungriest days. Highly recommended~~
