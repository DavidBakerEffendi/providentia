I absolutely love this place, and everyone who has been here with me loves it as well. The ambience is very warm and cozy - I have always struck up conversations with neighbors. The fruity Mohitos are yum - I am not a tequila fan but I believe the margaritas are awesome. Food - I have always gone with a small group and normally ordered a bunch of appetizers - all the little taco combos are GREAT. The guacamole is a MUST-HAVE - I think it's the one of the best I've had. I have always gone on weekdays and only had a very short wait.
