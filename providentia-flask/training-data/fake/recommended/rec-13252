We walked in here and were seated right away.  Took forever to get our orders taken.  The table next to us, who were seated right after us got their order taken after us, they ordered the same thing.  There was 3 of them and only 2 of us.  We were given 2 cups of water... there were tiny particles floating on top of the water... GROSS.  The table next to us were served their food before us.  We waited 15 minutes and nothing for our table had come out yet.  They were served the rest of their meal... Uhh??  We decided to just walk out and leave because we couldn't even get anyone's attention.  The girl who helped us wouldn't make eye contact with either of us for the life of me... I felt like I was on a TV show or something.  We ended up going to Habana-to-go next door...  The service was way friendlier and the food came out fast and even though there is less seating in there, it doesn't feel as cramped.
