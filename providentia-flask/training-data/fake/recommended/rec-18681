Bocca Lupo is my of my favorite neighborhood restaurants.  The staff is really nice, the food is great, and the prices are even better.   Having been there a million times over the years, I love that the food is consistent.  For dinner, I would recommend their pasta special and the pizza.  For brunch, EVERYTHING is good, but the egg dishes are the best.  It's winter, so the baked eggs is especially appropriate. There are only 2 things to be aware of: the strollers, but if you go for dinner after 8pm or brunch after 1pm, you should be fine!  And since they do not take reservations, it's not a sure thing for a group.
