Although the lines can get long around lunch and dinner, Hoagie Haven is well worth the wait. Hands down the best sandwiches in the Princeton area. All the ingredients are fresh and taste delicious. They have both hot and cold hoagies that will fill up your stomach without emptying your wallet! Prices are amazing for hoagies, especially for being in Princeton. A "half" hoagie (which is still about 10 inches) is between 3-4 dollars for most items, with a "whole" being a couple dollars more. If you are in Princeton, this is a place definitely worth checking out. If you go at peak hours thought (lunch and dinner) I HIGHLY suggest calling ahead so your order will be there waiting for you, so you don't have to wait in line. Their whole menu is on their website.
