We had been here a number of times and thus chose it to celebrate a special occasion. Whereas in the past, we considered The Bohemian a 5  star restaurant And experience-quite disappointed last pm. The restaurant has lost its originality-becoming more of a trendy venue. Some of this is not their fault and due to their success/becoming known. The restaurant was extremely loud-impossible to have a dinner conversation and killing the prior ambiance which had been so unique .Loud music played did not help.service attentive.food underwhelming- almost each dish required something special/ extra in way of seasoning. Also it would have been nice to discover additions to the menu that appears same than upon opening. We hope The Bohemian can restore some of its original appeal,and not become just one of another trendy downtown restaurant venue. Unfortunately, this not all under their control: most unfortunate that these days NYC dinner guests seem to think that  speaking as loud as possible ensures a good time.... This has killed the very special ambiance of The Bohemian.
