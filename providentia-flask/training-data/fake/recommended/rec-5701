While my boyfriend was getting a cheesesteak at Sonny's next door, I browsed the restaurant's menu to see if anything looked appealing. I thought several things did and went inside to ask that if both my boyfriend and I could sit outside together-- with my order and his cheesesteak. They told me no, which is understandable, so I ordered "to go" and sat at the bar to wait. I drank a diet coke, which turned out to be RC cola. When my chicken finally came, it had very little on the plate aside from chicken, despite the advertisement saying otherwise. The chicken, however, was pretty good, and the ambiance was neat. I also thought it was also a little expensive. I think I paid $12 for chicken, which seems like a lot at a pub, especially considering there wasn't else.
