It took us a long time wandering through the Italian Market to find Paesano's (and then even longer when we realized we needed to go to the ATM first) but it was SO. TOTALLY. WORTH IT. The two sandwiches we shared here were easily among the very best I have ever eaten. They were incredibly flavorful, with fresh, quality ingredients. They were also ENORMOUS. My fianc√© and I split the Paesano (brisket, a fried egg, horseradish, fried egg) and the Bolognese (fried lasagna, and a bunch of other stuff but oh my god FRIED LASAGNA. Oooey-gooey delicious madness!). They were each mind-blowingly good. I can't decide which I prefer because I enjoyed them both so very thoroughly. I wish I could get Paesano's to mail me some sandwiches to Chicago so I could enjoy their mind-blowing sandwiches once more. Until next time, Philadelphia! GO HERE.
