this is my new favorite pizza and I'm someone who's an evangelist for the closest dollar pizza, but this is some gourmet stuff! enjoyed a lovely dark beer and shared a bunch of pies with my beau and two friends. and it was very reasonably priced with friendly service! what more can one ask for. OH and it's walking distance from my apartment? i love you, wheated.
