We dined there last night. we are a  sri lankan family and  i missed  my homemade  kottu roti for  long time. this place has the  best  food. everything  was  fresh , nice and spicy very authentic... service  could be  little  bit  more formal but does not  matter. owner was  great and helpful... please  go  try best authentic sri lankan....we love it
