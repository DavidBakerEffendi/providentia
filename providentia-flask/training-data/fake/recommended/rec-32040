The burger is to die for. Amazing fries, and you can only love old-fashioned glass bottles of Coke. The beer selection looks incredible (alas I am not 21!) and is something I can't wait to try when the appropriate time rolls around. There are a few staff members who are not worthy of the rest of Hawthorne's awesomeness, but that can be overlooked when an overall wonderful experience can be had. One individual was thrilled to hear that Hawthorne's is the new default date spot, as I live in the area, and asked for the names of myself and my boyfriend. Knowing that we will be welcomed back as familiar faces motivates me to come back often, as most of the staff genuinely cares. No matter how full you are, GET THE CHEESECAKE CHURRO. it can easily be split between two people and is incredibly delicious. The Plank's Poulet is decent, but does not beat the burger.
