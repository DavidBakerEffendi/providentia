I have been here three times and have never been disappointed. The Sambal Spiced Calamari has been consistently good on all visits. Squid is one of my favorites and this appetizer just ruins other calamaris I've tried before. My sister, who is a big fan of Vietnamese pho approves of their Pho Bo. The Spicy Lemongrass Kalbi Short Ribs is rice's perfect companion. It will not only leave you fully satisfied with asian-barbecue flavors but literally leave you full too (it's a big plate). I also tried the Pad Kra Prow which is Thai Basil Chicken. This is a spicy dish which is perfect to thaw you out on a cold winter day. It has a good balance of chicken, peppers & string beans and a pool of spicy soup at the bottom that you can coat your rice with. Prices are affordable but not the cheapest. Food servings depend on which dish you are ordering so I suggest yelping out pictures before ordering them. Food service was always good and their servers are very friendly. I like the ambiance of the restaurant. It's Zen meets chic. The decor is ingenious too because they use ordinary objects and turn them into quite a presentation (like chopped wood as accent wall). The only gripe I have is that the space can be very constricting specially if you're in a large party. But this is not enough to deter me from giving the place 5 stars. Make sure you request a spoon with your meal because they don't include it. I for one cannot eat rice without a spoon. I am definitely going back to try more of their food.
