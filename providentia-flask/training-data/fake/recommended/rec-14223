Hot damn!  As a visitor to NY I always feel a bit overwhelmed at the food choices, so on this trip I turned to my trusty foodie friend who lived in the city.  His first words: "You have to go to Clinton Street Baking Company!  Best brunch EVER!  And I know my brunch..." Considering this same friend gave me a clutch recommendation on the other coast, I trusted him enough to drag my friend and convince her to wait the hour we were given by the hostess.  Which turns out isn't that long for a Sunday.  And when they say an hour, they mean it.  Not a minute before. Good news is that gave us plenty of time to look at what everyone else ordered.  So before I sat down I knew I was having the frittata with goat cheese and mushrooms.  My friend had the blueberry pancakes.  AMAZING on both counts.  The only pancakes I will usually eat are Grandpa's, and please don't tell him, but these were the best freaking pancakes I've ever had. It was so good we went back later that week.  The menu was slightly different on a weekday, but there was no wait.   I will definitely hit this place up every time I'm in the city.
