Used to be my favorite Chinese restaurant I have ordered from them often for years especially when I lived in Fair Haven, when I moved to exit 8 I still ordered from them & had it delivered now I love across town closer to West Haven and I have continued to order from there with all that being said the last couple of times it was ok but not like it used to be I figured no one place is perfect all the time so I have them the benefit of the doubt but after tonight forget Â it all bets are off the crab Rangoon was dried out on the inside and HARD on the outside I thought I was going to break a took biting into it. The lo mein was also dry & tasted weird the only thing that was good was the fried dumplings but everything else was such a disappointment I couldn't even enjoy the dumplings what a waste of money!! Don't even bother!! If you want some to eat go across the street to c-tow but it & just cook it yourself no matter how much you don't want to cook I wish I cooked tonight!!
