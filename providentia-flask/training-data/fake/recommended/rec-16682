Unbelievable. Brooklyn Star is wonderful. A phenomenal vibe and amazing comfort food. The second time I've been there we ordered the Bisquits (add honey, butter and siracha) which come steaming hot, wings - which are sticky and delicious, Mac and Cheese - creamy and cheesy with bacon and the pork chop which is tr greatest pork chop I've ever had (sorry Buttermilk Channel). Must go back and eat more.
