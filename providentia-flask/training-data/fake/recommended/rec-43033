If this is the best pizza you have ever ever had, let me take you to St. Louis and I can find a few better spots (and a lot more in San Fran). The pizza was solid, but it  aasn't amazing and certainly was expecting a lot more from what I had heard about this place...coal burning oven is nice and all but it didn't make the pizza taste as magical and some might make it sound. Thought the sausage topping along with the kalamata olives was really good.  Could not really find much cheese on these puppies. Oh, and not that you go here to eat salad, but they should just call it lettuce, not salad.  They cram a ton of lettuce in a bowl and sprinkle very minimal toppings.
