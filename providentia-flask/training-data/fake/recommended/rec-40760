Totally would have given Rex five stars if it wasn't for the long wait for drinks. I believe we waited ten minutes for two drinks.Service was attentive and the ambience is perfect. Beautiful chandeliers, romantic lighting and comfortable surroundings. Prices were very reasonable. We had a variety if appetizers and hand crafted cocktails. The Deep South was my favorite drink--flavorful and refreshing. The macaroni and cheese was delicious and the chicken slider special was tasty. However what took the cake was the general tso rock shrimp and the bacon cheesy grits with fried oysters (the latter being my favorite appetizer--it was absolutely amazing). We pushed the limits with dessert--seriously I was about to burst but the rum milkshake made my night and I was quoting Kelis song by the same namesake the whole night much to the friends' dismay. The chocolate tasting that my dining companion had was yummy as well. This spot was perfect for a rainy day dinner with my best friend and I would definitely return to this American/soul restaurant.
