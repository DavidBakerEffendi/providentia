I came here on Friday and sat on the rooftop deck. Food was great, service was good. I would have given this place 5 stars but I didn't know smoking was allowed on the deck... My girlfriend is a non smoker and she had smoke blowing in her face the entire meal..unfortunately there weren't any other seats available except for inside.. She was extremely disappointed.
