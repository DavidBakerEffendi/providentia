My mate and I new it was going to be good when we showed up to see people standing in the rain waiting to get in. Spring rolls, summer rolls, and the crepe started us off right. By that point, we new how the rest was going to roll. My rare beef Pho was delightful and I added lime, mint, and siracha. It was EXACTLY what we needed, and stays true to the simplicity that is just damn good.
