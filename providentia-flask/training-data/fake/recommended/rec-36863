I came here like two years ago, and to this day, I still remember the name, the location, and the atmosphere of the place.  It was just that good. It took an hour to be seated here, but that's OK.  Trust me, it's worth the wait! I can't remember what I got here.  I think it was a sandwich.  But it was an incredible sandwich!  I promise!  The fries were unbelievable!   I also got a coffee here, which was outstanding and powerful stuff! I'm sorry I don't remember any more details of this place.  If you have money to spend (it's expensive), and are either a native or a tourist like me (FROM BAHHHHSTON), make sure you pay homage to this small relatively unknown spot.
