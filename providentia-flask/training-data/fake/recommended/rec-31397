Nice place, hummus is great -- probably the best I've had in New York [and I grew up in the Middle East]. I often go there for lunch and have the Greek Salad, adding hummus and beets. The vegetables are always fresh, nothing is oily, the side-salads are yummy, and the place is aesthetic and clean. I'm leaving out the 5th star only because the service is kind of stiff and impatient. They will not make any changes to a dish [like to swap the feta cheese with hummus in a salad -- for $13, that's not too much to ask]. They are very inflexible and not so welcoming, which is too bad because it spoils the experience a little. But in general, if you're after excellent, fresh, healthy food -- it's worth it.
