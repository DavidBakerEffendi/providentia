Pretty good, not great, Korean food, and I've been eating Korean food here and in Korea since '84. Kimchi more sour than tasty. Yook Gye Jang was barely spicy and it's Â supposed to burn your face off. Soon Du Bu was just average. Also, stingy on the 'pan chan' in general. Perhaps the best in the area, but there are few choices evidently. Hostess was friendly enough. Considering Koreans can be outright rude as a rule, that's a bonus.
