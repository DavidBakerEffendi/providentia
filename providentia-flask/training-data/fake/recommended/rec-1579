$9 for a sub that aint even overstuffed. I wish my husband wouldve took a picture of that ish because my opinion is that it is overrated and overpriced.   2 pieces of thinly sliced meat with something that look like nacho cheese slathered on the bread.  The guy who was manning the grill had a whole heaping of meat, grilled onions on the grill but that was a damn tease---that ish aint got no meat on it for $9.  What the ish is that all about? $9 damn well at least give me a few ounces of meat. Walk up service.  You want fries, go down to the other window.  I have to say that the place is super clean but sorry Geno's -- you aint it.
