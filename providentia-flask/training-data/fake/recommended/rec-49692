can't say enough how goooood it is...great quality food and decent price....but there is no reservation...got to wait in a long line but totally worth it... recommendations: seafoods :grilled sword fish with lemon potato...greek style shirmp ...grilled fish(bass or red snapper), fried calamari...the lamb kabab and chiken kabab is very good too....try it with greek salad the house wine is pretty decent and cheap....food comes in very big portions
