Found myself on Astoria Blvd yesterday, hungry and tired.  Stopped in to this cozy place not knowing what to expect by the name.  I was so pleasantly surprised to find Texan specialties like smoked brisket and spicy beans, biscuits with white gravy, collards, cole slaw, potato salad, and some slammin' BBQ sauce.   The cilantro sauce is a must, especially for the brined chicken which was perfectly cooked.  The mac and cheese is light and happy, not weighted down by a heavy bechamel, and perfect for a summer day. The dirty rice and sausage is awesome, as well as the crispy pork belly.  I look forward to tasting the Chicken pot pie and Banh Mi burger (what a great idea!) on my return trip. By the way, the chef/owners are really friendly, and welcome customers as if it were their home -- pretty cool addition to Astoria!
