This is by far the best hoagie in Philadelphia, which naturally makes it the best hoagie on the planet.  To top it off, the owners and employees are some of the friendliest people you'll ever meet.  I used to live a block from this place so I've tried pretty much everything on the menu and can honestly say everything was incredible.
