Went to Carmine's in midtown with my family after graduation at the nearby Millennium Hotel. Before that I had only been to the Atlantic City location, which I was very impressed with ( the price fix menu came with a whole lobster per person and more eggplant, chicken and pasta than I could eat in a month) hence the choice for a big family affair. I was worried about getting a reservation for a large group during graduation season but had no problem at all, even booked it on OpenTable and when we arrived a little early they already had our table set up and sat us immediately. For appetizers we had fried calamari and zucchini with spicy marinara which were both amazing ( my family orders calamari almost everywhere we go, this was definitely a favorite). The platters come with so much by the time they were finished we were all questioning whether or not we could even continue eating... But we managed. The eggplant parm, penne alla vodka, chicken marsala, broccoli rabe and spinach were all too good to pass up. Even my tiny italian grandmother who used to make wine and homemade pasta in her basement was impressed. Of course to top it off, a few orders of tartufo to celebrate my graduation and my grandpa's 87th birthday were in order. Overall great experience, will definitely be back-thank you carmine's : )
