Chavela's is a great find!  The lunch menu is a bargain!  Food is excellent, the chicken with rice and beans were cooked to perfection. I also had the Salad w/ chicken, it was superb.  Portions are more than enough.  The Sangria is delicious which is served from one of the taps.  Also, the Hibiscus Iced Tea is refreshing, and perfectly sweet.  The atmosphere gives you the feeling as if you are out of Brooklyn, with beautiful colors, unique doors, and tiles.  Service is friendly, and helpful with suggestions.  Seating is kind of tight, unless you get a small table near the door.  And I am not certain, if they put on the a/c all of the time when needed.
