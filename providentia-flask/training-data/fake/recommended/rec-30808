I saw pictures and reviews of this place on Yelp before I got to Brooklyn. I tried it out due to the high reviews and the pictures. I was determined to get the grits, soft egg, greens, and bacon. The Chai sticky bun also looked intriguing. The person who greeted me when I came in was helpful and nice. It's crowded inside and you can't sit down but the food is delicious. I got a sticky bun (They were out of chai- pecan) It was good but it wasn't hot so not my cup of tea. I also got the grits, soft egg, broccoli rabe with bacon and it was every bit as delicious as it is in the pictures. The portion size was perfect. If I lived in Bed Stuy, I would be hitting up this place often. We need to bring this place to Florida, please?
