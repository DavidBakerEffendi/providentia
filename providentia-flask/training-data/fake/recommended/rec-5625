So I had some friends coming in for my birthday and the plan was to go have dinner together.  We are all pretty cheap so we didn't want to go somewhere fancy, but I did want a place where we could kick back a while with no pressure, drink wine (BYOB), and eat good food. I found this place on Yelp, and it had good reviews so I gave it a shot.   Okay, so my first reaction was, "eehhuuuuu....i dunno about this place."  It's super small, had vibe I wasn't initially digging, and we almost bailed.  But, we were hungry so we gave it a shot. Best decision ever. First off, the staff is amazing, extremely friendly and helpful.  The owner in particular was fantastic. I called ahead and said I was comin for my birthday and even though its tiny, he said he would take care of me.  Then we showed up (it was way smaller than i thought) and he totally took care of us. Extremely nice, conversational, but not obtrusive at all, even gave me a free birthday dessert! Secondly, the food was amazing!  We decided to enjoy it family style, we got 3 flatbreads and 2 pastas.  The Diavolo was out of this world.  The flatbreads were fantastic too.  There were 5 of us and we had 4 different favorites, so it all really just depends on your own personal tastes.  Either way though, we loved all of it! You guys gotta check this place out.  Grab some great wine, get some good friends, and have a fantastic cheap meal.
