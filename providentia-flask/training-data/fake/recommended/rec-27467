We go to Kefi often....at least once a month if not more.  While the price is incredible for the food , the food DELISH and the service lovely, we have noticed recently that the portions are MUCH smaller.  For someone who may be a first diner here, you probably would not have any frame of reference.  But for those who frequent the restaurant, we are disappointed.  Has anyone else noticed this?  I would definitely give this restaurant a better review but don't feel necessarily the same way about it any more.  Very sad!!!
