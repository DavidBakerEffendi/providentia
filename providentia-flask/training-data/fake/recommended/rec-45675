In the wake of what used to be a very good Japanese hibachi restaurant; Ten East, Otaiko has risen to be a more than comparable encore. Â From the staff' superb hospitality to the succulent grill mastered hibachi selections, we walked out with our bellies full and our spirits happy. Great family fun as well as an entertaining first date venue that will definitely break the ice. I happily give Otaiko 5 stars.
