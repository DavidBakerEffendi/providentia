I'm not a fan of this place. We went here after my nephew's graduation because he looooooves this place. While I did enjoy seeing my Mom, sisters, niece and nephew go out on the floor and dance and sing with the servers (yes.... my family is EMBARASSING like that), I thought the food was gross!! I can see why little kids like it. It's a fun place to eat. Loud and full of action for a 7 year old.  However, I'm thirty...... something!  LOL Totally NOT my thing! I think I ordered the crabcake sandwich, which was all BREAD and filler. (Not lump crab meat.) It was FRIED, which made it extra greasy... and just NOT GOOD at all. I think my nephew was the only one who enjoyed his food.
