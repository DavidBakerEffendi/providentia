A cute and clever brunch spot. The only downfall is it might be a little overpriced. I had brunch at Locanda Verde recently, and I enjoyed myself. The food was good, and the service was very fast and accomodating. I've just experienced some equally or better food at other restaurants for less. So if you are looking to save a few bucks, I'd look else where. But if you are looking for a special treat, and you love to brunch than this is the place for you. Started with the sheep's milk riccotta with truffle honey and burnt orange toast. This is probably the most unique thing we had, and I would recommend ordering it. Perfect to share as well. I had the Uovo Modenese. The hash was really nice, and I was glad there was some greens in there for colour and freshness. The tomato hollandaise is also an interesting spin, but they have this at Jane as well. My girlfriend got the waffle with the strawberries and marscapone, and ordered some bacon on the side that she could crush up on top of it for a salty and sweet combo. It was a tasty waffle for sure.
