How long does it take to make a sandwich? Came here 3 times and each time waited over ten minutes to get my food. First time they gave my sandwich to someone else; second time they took 15 minutes to make it; third time they made it but didnt bring it to me even though I was 1 of two people in the place. Terrible service. As for the sandwiches: they are pretty tasty, but not worth the $10+ price. I won't be coming back here.
