When you're trying to convince your bestie to move to Brooklyn... take her to Traif. That's what I did, and it worked. (Short rib sliders and sweet potato fries sealed the deal.) Want to impress a hot date? Traif. (Tuna tartar on eggplant tempura is going to get you invited home.) The food at Traif is complex and interesting. It's meant to be savored and talked about and slowly enjoyed. You'll order a bunch of things to share, and your waiter will bring out the dishes one by one in order from lightest to heaviest. It's also a nice touch that they always include a palate cleanser to start and to end. My only caveat is that the first time we went to Traif, our waiter told us that we should order 4-6 dishes for two people. We ordered 3, and that was enough for us -- and my husband is a big eater! Maybe it would be different if we ordered a bunch of salads and cheese plates, but just the sliders and fries were pretty hefty! We've returned a few times and have always found the service to be friendly and the food to be delicious and consistent.
