I usually come here for the lunch special, where I get the sushi roll combos. For the price of three rolls at around $8.95 or $9.95 I'm not complaining, but the individual pieces are pretty small. The lunch special comes with a soup or salad. I would choose the soup. It's nothing to really praise about, but it's certainly better than most supermarket sushi. The restaurant (you can kind of tell) is specialized in Korean cuisine more so than Japanese. My favorite thing to get on the main menu is Chapchae, which is clear sweet potato noodles with a bunch of veggies and beef stir fried together. Totally yummy and one of my absolute comfort foods. When you order a dish from the main menu, you also get small dishes that come along with the main dish as well-- like kimchi, dried anchovies, broccoli, cooked potato, sesame soy slices, etc and a soup or salad. Good place to eat at, waitstaff is not that friendly. The guys are pretty nice, but the female waitstaff needs to be more welcoming to customers. Also, I would drink with a straw and not directly from the glass/cup. Some cons is that it can be pretty pricey, but the food is decent and they try to get the food out to you as fast as they can, but they can be slow when the restaurant is crowded.
