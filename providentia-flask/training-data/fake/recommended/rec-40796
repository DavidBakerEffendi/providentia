I live in Levelland and eat at Amore Mia all the time.  Their food is better than anything you'll find in Lubbock, as far as Italian is concerned.  They have great pizzas (although Dions in Lubbock is better) and some very good "in house" dishes.  The service can be spotty, but overall I would highly recommend it.
