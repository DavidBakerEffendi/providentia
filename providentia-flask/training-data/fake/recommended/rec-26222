Love this place! It was awhile ago since I went with my boyfriend but I definitely give them five stars. We went on a weekday but during dinner time so of course there were a lot of people waiting in front of us. My boyfriend and I were told that the wait is at least two hours but since it was so hyped and got good reviews, we decided to wait. We waited for one hour and maybe 20 minutes and finally got to order. The place is pretty huge. Great customer service! The food was delicious, especially the pork buns. It was so good that even though we were full, we got an extra order just to further stuff ourselves. I will visit again soon!!!
