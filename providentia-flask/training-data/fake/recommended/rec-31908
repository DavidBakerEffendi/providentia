Made reservations a few weeks in advance to take the wifey and in-laws who were on their first trip to NY.  We also reserved the duck in advance. Our reservations were for 10 PM, so we were starving.  We ended up ordering a few appetizers because our eyes were bigger than our tummy.  Our order consisted of the pork buns, kim chi, and the massive duck.  Our duck came with a few sides;  potatoes with duck fat drenched and bak choy. Pork Buns -  good, but Chairman Bao (in San Francisco) and Ippudo are better.   Kim Chi -  unique, but again nothing to write home about. Duck - WOW!!  This is a huge dish, enough to fill the 5 starving tourists.  It came with rice, buns, and sauces.  Personally, I liked the ginger and hoisin sauce the best.  It's kinda like peking duck where you make a sandwich but if you want less carbs you can use lettuce.   We were each impressed with this dish; how flavorful and tender the duck was.   The staff was pretty good in re-filling our drinks and accommodating our requests for more sauce and veggies.  Would be happy to recommend and come back!
