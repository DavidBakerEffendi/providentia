The chef served us pink raw chicken.  He refused to cook it more because he insisted it was perfectly cooked, and the manager and waiter were unsympathetic. Both my wife and I were sick hours after our meal.  This restaurant clearly does not mind gambling with their customers' health. It should be shut down by the health department.
