Really cool, great menu and very tasty food.  We wandered into this place one afternoon looking for lunch.  What a cool place, and what's better than a restaurant that's also a chocolate store?? chili chocolate dusted waffle fries are a MUST. Worth a stop in, most anything on the menu is tasty, and the prices are really reasonable for a Center City eatery.
