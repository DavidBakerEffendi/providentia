I have never dined on "restaurant row", but my goodness there are plenty of places to choose from. Randomly picked this place before a show for a few glasses of wine and an appetizer. They were very attentive, almost strangely so....but not in a bad way, most places you walk into don't really care that you're there. They have happy hour from 4-7p, of course it helps if you order the drinks from that menu (I didn't), but it's there. For where is it, for what it is, it's great. The ceviche appetizer was small and a bit pricey, but delicious. If I had to (i.e. was in the area before a show), I would go back - definitely would never travel to this part of town otherwise, but that should be no reflection on the restaurant.
