After looking at all the reviews, and the recommendations of so many people and places, we decided to go there yesterday after seeing a show.  Gotta say, I wasn't too impressed. We started off with the deep fried Octopus ball entree/appetizer.  Good but not great.  Felt like we were tasting more ball/breading, and I couldn't really taste any octopus.  Next up was the single order BBQ and the BBQ Squid.  Had one lamb, one duck, one waishu beef, and one asparagus bacon.  All GREAT, as was the squid.  Last, we chose one of the hot plate pancake dishes (can't remember which one, but it had pork on top), and the Yaki udon.  The pancake was good, but the bbq sauce on top overpowered it a little.  The Yaki Udon was just not good.  It tasted like the they just threw the sauce that was on the pancake onto the Yaki Udon.  They both tasted exactly the same, which didn't make it any better as a whole.  It ended up tasting very very salty. Unfortunately, I'm not drinking right now, so I wasn't able to have any sake with my meal.  But maybe that's the trick, right?  Alcohol might make everything taste better??  Overall, just for the food, some good, some great, one bad.  Very hit or miss (but with bbq being a definite HIT), with other places offering better overall tastes.  I would've given it 3 stars, but with all the recommendations, I was just a little more disappointed...
