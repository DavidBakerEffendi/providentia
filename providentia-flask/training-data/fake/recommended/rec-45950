This diner has what you need, hands down. I prefer their lunch & dinner options over their breakfast options...but...everything is good and you really can't go wrong. It's on the pricey side, but the dollar signs can be deceiving. Their portions are HUGE. You can easily share, so keep that in mind when you decide what to get. I've gotten everything from surf & turf to omelettes. I don't recommend their fish tacos, but you're good for everything else. A few favorites are chicken noodle/rice soup, eggs benedict, belgian waffles, chicken francaise, bruschetta, and lasagna. I think you can get any option (breakfast/lunch/dinner) at any time during the day. Depending on when you go, there's a wait so I would time it accordingly. My friends and I have been there on Sundays around 2 pm and there's been a 5 minute wait at max. If you go during prime lunch time (11:30-1:30), prime dinner time (6:30-9), or late night weekend eats (10 PM - 2 AM), it could go from 1/2 hr to 45 minutes. Their cheesecakes are DELICIOUS.
