Went here for the first time this weekend. I'm a fan! I had mixed vegetables, Mediterranean chicken, falafel, hummus, chickpeas, spinach - all of it was delicious. The owner is very accommodating (eg. Grilled instead of frying for me, substituted a couple things) and cooks the food himself. Great value, plus I even had enough left over for a second dinner. I'll be back!
