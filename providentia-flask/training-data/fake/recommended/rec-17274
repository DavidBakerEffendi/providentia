Food was overpriced.  We got a $50. restaurant.com certificate to use.  We only ordered Tapas since it was lunch time.   We were a party of 6 girls, we ordered 10 Tapas, only soda and each had a dessert and coffee/cappuccino.  The bill was still $200. AFTER the $50 was deducted!  The food itself wasn't bad.  They  waiter insisted on a special ham from Spain so we ordered it only to learn it was thin slices of prosciutto!  Only street parking during the day which was another inconvenience.
