What a nice place. Started with grilled octopus that was cooked very well, then had half order of gnocchi and shared the cauliflowers side dish that was extremely tasty. Â the waitress forgot about my salad, but they were very busy that night, so no biggie.. everything was really good, beside the dessert.. Im not sure if its a new thing or what, but I did not have a good dessert in this city in a while!!!
