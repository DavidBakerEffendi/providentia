The lychee sangria was amaze. Just the right amount of lychee-ness (neither overpowering nor nonexistent) added to a red sangria. However, the sole purpose I chose to go to this over another Thai restaurant was their coconut calamari. Although I can now say that I was pretty disappointed. The calamari was extremely lacking in its coconut aspect. I was hoping for something along the lines of coconut shrimp (the kind they cook with mayo), so a lot more sweet and saucy. But it was nothing of the sort, just fried calamari with I guess slight notes of coconut? Also tried the Spicy Thai Basil Noodles which is essentially drunken noodles/pad kee mao. As tasty as it was, it wasn't spicy at all. Which makes me think this can't be a very authentic Thai restaurant. Though with the decent ratings, I can see how this place would appeal to the general American audience, especially if you like Thai food but can't take spicy well, since Thai typically make their food very spicy. This one has more of a "sweet spicy" taste to it, which is probably true for the other dishes too. You know how they say "Americanized Chinese" food, well my conclusion for this place is Americanized Thai food.
