The Bavarian pretzels come in two sizes and one of those sizes is larger than your plate and your face. It's kind of ridiculous, worthy of county fair status, but it's just an everyday occurrence at Frankford Hall. The pretzel was delicious in all that makes pretzels good in terms of chewiness/saltiness/sweetness, but nothing outrageous besides being gargantuan in size. The cheese dip, served in a paper trough, was some extremely mild melted down cheese formation of American and cheddar. JT and a I still noshed it all up. And this knot goes down in the books as the biggest. Frankford Hall also has sausages and burgers in addition to an outrageous supply of German beer. The Spicy Bauenwurst with sauerkraut was screaming my name as I ordered a huge mug of beer and knew eating something with a kick would help me drink it all. Although this pork and beef sausage was not spicy, it was snappy and juicy and even better with in-between bites of mouthwatering sauerkraut. JT got "The Kanzler" burger with dry-aged beef, balsamic onions, gruyere and grilled bacon. The burger was seriously the boss. It even bossed around its buns. It was mean and delicious and one of those sandwiches that doesn't stick around long enough to discuss. Frankford Hall is a great place to grab a huge stein of beer and pretzel/beer/sausage and congregate as well as showing off how large your pretzel is.
