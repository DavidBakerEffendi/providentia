I come here coz its local, cheap, and a quick sushi fix. The service sucks. They don't say much but I guess that's okay. The seaweed salad is excellent. I've had better sushi but it's not bad either. The food comes out pretty quickly. They hardly check up on you. You'd have to flag them down if you need something.
