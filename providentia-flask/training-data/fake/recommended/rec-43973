As my first official review for yelp, I thought of the place that I like to eat at most in New Haven. Thai Taste offers great lunch specials at fairly decent prices. the food is always served fresh & hot, and is quite delicious. I really enjoy the way they cook their tofu-and I am pretty happy with their vegetarian selections. I doubt that this is the place you want to go to if you are watching your figure though since its too good to be healthy. But at $7.95 for a lunch special that includes, soup and your choice of some side-ie egg roll, wonton, etc. its a filling delight. I really love the Pad Se Â Eww with tofu-they make it with Chinese Broccoli, which is absolutely cooked to perfection. Even better are the cheap drinks...so all around its the best Thai meal on Chapel Street.
