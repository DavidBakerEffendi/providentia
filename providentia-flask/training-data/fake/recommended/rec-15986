The Waiting Room is one of my favorite spots to go eat.  The food is really delicious (way better than you would expect from a sports bar), and it's very reasonably priced.  I love their nachos, ribs, and pork chops.  They also have a really great selection of drinks.  It's also a pretty nice restaurant, very open and home-y feeling. I do have a couple of issues with it.  For one, the service can be very hit-or-miss.  Sometimes we're treated well, sometimes it's so slow.  Second, it's really hard to determine the crowd you'll see there.  Sometimes it's like a dance club for twentysomethings and some times it's got a cover band and a bunch of people in their forties and up.  I assume that's how their able to draw such a big crowd (much bigger than other restaurants in Rahway).  It's quirky, but I do really enjoy it.  I hard to go wrong with the Waiting Room.  I really love them during Oktoberfest too.
