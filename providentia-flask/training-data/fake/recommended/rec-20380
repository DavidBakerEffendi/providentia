I have been here for brunch and dinner many times and the food, service and wine selection are great.  And the atmosphere is really fabulous . . . there are tall ceilings and open expanses of windows.  It is especially nice to sit at one of the tall tables facing out of the windows . . . if you get really lucky you may even see the pigeon trainer's pigeons flying (he lives diagonally across the street).
