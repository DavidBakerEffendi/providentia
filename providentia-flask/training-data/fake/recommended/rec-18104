Oh boy were these noodles good.  I'm probably not the best judge of noodle character, but my nascent journey into the noodle world will probably grow because of this place.  It's one of the best places I've eaten at in Chinatown, and my heaping bowl of shrimp noodle soup was only $6.50.  The amount of shrimp I had in there would probably be $18.00 as shrimp cocktail at a steak house.  Just sayin'.
