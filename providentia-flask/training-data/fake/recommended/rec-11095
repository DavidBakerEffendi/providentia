So far I've only had coffee here on numerous occasions for meetings and it is very good!   Strong, flavorful, and hot.  Every time I'm there I'm tempted to eat since the aroma of deliciousness saturates the air.  If there character of coffee and wonderful whiffs of nutriment is any indication of food, it has to be good!
