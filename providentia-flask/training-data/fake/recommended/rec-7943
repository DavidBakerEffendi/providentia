This is a wonderful, cozy place.  I have eaten here twice so far with my Art Gal group visiting from Washington, DC.  I love the local, organic, sustainable focus.  The food is fantastic.  I'm a vegetarian and there was plenty for me to choose from.  This time I had a wonderful tofu dish.  The wait staff is friendly and helpful.  Plus, restaurant is within easy walking distance to 30th St Station for our train back to DC.  We will return!
