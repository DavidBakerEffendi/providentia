We visited this restaurants while vacationing and found a decent lunch with a great view of Lake Champlain.  Crab cake was awesome, fried shrimp was not.  The cocktail sauce was different than any I have ever had; almost like ketchup with pickle relish in it.  I am sure that some would like it, but it was not for me.
