I've been to Extra Virgin many times over the last few years, and it never fails to deliver the goods: quality food, excellent service, great ambiance. When you walk in, the hostess greets you very cordially and quickly. Her estimates on wait time are usually pretty much on target. Given that most of the limited space is wisely put to use with tables, the bar area can get a bit crowded on popular dining evenings and hours. If the weather is nice, and you are dining with one other person, and a bit more patient or lucky, you can dine outside on their "railing-less front porch" and watch the interesting foot traffic go by (W. 4th has very light auto traffic there so you won't feel like you are dining with fumes). If you opt for sitting indoors, hopefully you can get seated closer to the brick wall table or booth in the back, as it cuts the hum and foot traffic a bit, and adds to the "cozy-ness" of the place. The waitstaff is superb, able to consistently deliver that rare zen-like table waiting skill of being extremely attentive and timely, without being the least bit intrusive. They provide excellent and accurate wine and food recommendations in helping with decisions. The food quality is excellent, consistent, and well-portioned. I usually have either the EV salad or calamari, which is fairly light on batter and oil. I can't speak to the meat dishes personally, but the Halibut and Scallops are excellent. The flourless chocolate cake (with molten center) is a staple as well, though I have had opportunities to try the apple tart and it is delicious as well. The ambiance is cozy, and decor relaxing. As a testament to its reputation, I often see models or movie start dining there (last time, Chevy Chase was there), but the celebrity appeal does not affect its charm in any way. I have sent many folks to eat here as well, I have only heard good experiences. For the money, you won't find a better place for service, food quality and variety, and ambiance.
