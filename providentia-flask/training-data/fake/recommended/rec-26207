Leron's Lesson: Trendy decor, solid Thai food, healthy portions and a pretty good choice for a date. Full Review: I stopped by for dinner last Friday night with a couple coworkers and waited about 20 minutes to be seated. On this particular night around 9pm, the restaurant was packed. Luckily, they have a few small areas where you can wait. After we were seated, we received decent service and began our meal. Nothing in particular stood out, the Pad Thai I ordered was alright. My coworker ordered the pineapple fried rice and I was immediately jealous because it looked better than my food lol. Don't you just hate when that happens?
