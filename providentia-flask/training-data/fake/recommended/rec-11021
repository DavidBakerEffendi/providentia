As a disclaimer, this review has nothing to do with the quality of the food. On a whim we decided to try to get into the Old City location (we live in Old City) last night (Saturday). We showed up early at about 5:50 PM, since we had our 5-month old with us. The place was EMPTY - as in a couple bar tables taken and maybe one in the dining room. When we said we didn't have a reservation the male host was incredibly rude, and said he had nothing. We said ok and turned to head out and with attitude the host said "this is OLD CITY on a SATURDAY night." I understand having no space but you don't have to be rude about it - I know it's Saturday night, we just figured we would try. The attitude alone made us not want to go back, no matter how good the food reviews are.
