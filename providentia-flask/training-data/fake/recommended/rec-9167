I am completely obsessed with Ippudo. 100% over the top obsessed. Three reasons for my obsession in order: incredible pork buns, 2 for 1 Kirin special at the bar during weekday evenings, best ramen in the city. Ippudo is a well known chain in Japan, whose main game is ramen noodles. This is the restaurant's first location to open outside of the homeland, and judging by the 45 minute wait every time I go there (day or night), they are doing quite well. Ippudo does not take reservations, and there is almost always room at the bar to squeeze two bodies up to the counter and start sucking down Kirins while you wait. Though the front bar area is fairly humdrum, you will be surprised by the relatively large and slick space that is the dining room, which stands out in comparison to the minimalist Momofukus and the bare bones feel to the other East Village ramen joints. This place has a great, fun vibe (chefs in pajamas constantly yelling to the wait staff in Japanese), and the waiters are always polite and attentive. full review and more at immaculateinfatuation.com - let me know what you think!
