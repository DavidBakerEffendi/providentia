So as someone who works in the high end restaurant business, I was pretty disappointed after reading the 4 star reviews of this small East Falls byob. We arrived on time for our reservation and waited about 10 min to be seated. We were greeted by one waiter who opened our wine, and then were told specials by another waiter a few minutes later. From what I understand the man who waited on us was either an owner or manager. We put in 3 aps to share and then ordered three entrees for myself and my parents. We waited a long time for our aps and then watched them be delivered to the wrong table. After a half hearted apology we waited another 10 minutes to receive our calamari, tuna carpaccio, and dried beef. I liked the beef the best but none of them were anything to write home about. We ordered two Veal Rollatini and one of the Branzino specials. The fish was by far the best, veal was OK; very classic italian but sides were also nothing special. Desert was great and so were the home made lemon cello shots. MOST IMPORTANTLY We paid by credit card and left a 20% cash tip, but discovered online that were were charged an amount that was unauthorized...20% credit tip was added to the bill. After stoping into the restaurant a day later everything was corrected but Fiorino is definitely not a place I would rush back.
