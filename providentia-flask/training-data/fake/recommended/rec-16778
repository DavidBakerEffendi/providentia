I've been to Valenca many times in the past and had enjoyed their food, however due to their lack of etiquette and poor service I will not be returning.  I was looking for somewhere to eat, so I called them up to see if they had a reservation available.  They said they did so I made the reservation.  Less then an hour before my reservation I receive a call from them telling me simply that they have no tables available.  I asked when they would have tables available, once again they repeated we have no tables, without even an apology.  I have never had a restaurant cancel a reservation on me at the last minute with not even an apology.  I will not be returning.
