Delicious! Seriously... so smokey and juicy and delicious. We usually go grab their classic regular pastrami sandwiches... you cant go wrong. I love that they have different size sandwiches. Medium is perfect... not too much or too little meat. The small is okay too if you aren't so hungry. Yum, go try it!
