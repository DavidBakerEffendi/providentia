This is, by far, the best pizza I've had. I'm officially ruined. I can see the "mashed potato/bacon" topping is all over yelp, and for good reason. We added spinach to the mix and it worked. The service was fast and helpful. We were parched from July heat, and they kept the water and beer coming. I'm sticking with four stars because the server snarked at my request for a serving utinsel, "Use your hands." Hm. Just give me a damn pizza server. My friends don't like my grubby hands all over their pie.
