Only gets three out of five for having plenty of TV's to watch football. Food was subpar and beer on the high side for draft. I ordered the Chicken Philly and cheese fries. Philly tasted bland and cheese wiz fries were ok, I prefer real cheese. If you're looking for quality cuisine I would pass. Great place to watch sports though.
