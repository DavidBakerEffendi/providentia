My boyfriend heard this was a must try place in NYC for quick and casual Indian food. Came in around 2 pm and the place was packed. Ordered a number 7 and 8. 7 was alright but number 8 was absolutely fantastic. If you are hungry make sure you get two since they are rather small. 4 stars because of the price and number 7 being so so.
