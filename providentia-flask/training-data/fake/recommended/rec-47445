Had a lovely dinner on the sidewalk here.  Lots of families pass by, so if you want more intimacy, head indoors.  Service was polite but a little scant.  Took a long time for our cocktails. Maine Crab salad to start was presented beautifully in an oyster shell over a bed of ice.  Flavor was just ok.  Too much fruit and sweetness for me.  Not much of that brininess.  Could've had more crab. Tuna tartare - delicious.  Nice fresh tuna in small cubes and sesame oil.  Light and flavorful. Fiance and I both had fish entrees.  He had the whole grilled fish, and I had grouper.  Both cooked well and delicate, but not that unique or memorable. Thrice Spiced Fries, I hope to love these, but they were very salty.  Not sure if it was just the day we went, but I definitely tasted more salt than spice, so don't order that if you're watching your sodium.  Do order if you want to be bloated. Roasted corn side - delicious.  Tasted like summer.  Sweet and crunchy.  Very satisfying and would definitely order again.
