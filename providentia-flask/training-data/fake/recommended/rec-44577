Room Service is proof that Yelp can sometimes steer you in the wrong direction.. We made a reservation for 7pm several days prior. At 6:30pm, I realized we were going to be a tad bit late & called the restaurant to give them a head's up. I told them we would be about 10 minutes late. This did not seem to be an issue. Luckily, two people in our party arrived to the restaurant only 5 minutes late. They already gave our table away at that point. I arrived several minutes later and was told (with an attitude) that we would have to wait at the bar for the next available table. I fully understand that we were late. And I fully accept the consequences. Time to pay the price. Literally. Â While waiting for our table, we each ordered a drink from the bar ... and we were each charged a $3 service charge. PER DRINK. There's a first time for everything, right? Now, on to the best part.. the food. Not only did our orders arrive at different times, but my friend's dish and mine were both cold. The tofu had literally just come out of the refrigerator. I politely explained this to our waiter. At first, he was very hesitant about giving us new entrees. We made it very clear that we were absolutely not going to eat cold food. He eventually took our miserable excuses for Thai entrees into the kitchen to be replaced by warmer food. Don't be fooled by the high ceilings and the stereotypical trendy Asian Fusion decor - This restaurant blows. And not the good kind of blowing either.
