Great Breakfast. Low Prices, Cool Atmosphere. Best Waffle I've ever had, came with 3 unique butters - Banana Strawberry, Cinnamon, and Pumpkin. Server told us they made each butter daily, rotating different flavors in. The Atmosphere was great, the place really has kept a '40s vibe. As we were leaving our server gave us free cookies, and we got a nice goodbye from an elderly woman behind the bar who seemed like the owner or family of the owner. If you're looking for a great pancakes or waffles, this place is a must.
