In NYC over the weekend for #NYFW I was staying in BK and I was visiting the BK museum. There was a 15-20 wait ( normal) when we arrived and there was a line wrapped around outside. This place gets 5 stars b/c during our cold 15 min wait outside, the staff came out to greet the patrons with hot appetizers and coffee complete with cream and sugar. Of course the food was wonderful and this place has some of the coolest decor I have ever seen. This is def on my must have brunch list while visiting NYC from now on.
