In over twenty years of restaurant-going I have never not tipped at the end of a meal, no matter how unfortunate the experience. Salinas last night proved to be my first. The evening, service-wise, was so appalling it verged on the comedic. The contemptuous, disdainful front of house; the bartender who refused to acknowledge our existence; the server who had little grasp of the menu, and who once she had taken our order never appeared again; the delivery of dishes flung on to the table over our heads as if by the Keystone Cops; our complete abandonment once the entrees were cleared, so that after 30 minutes I had to go to the kitchen to get our check. Add to that the deafening din, the broken toilet seat in one restroom and the lack of toilet paper in the other. All this is a great shame, as the food overall was terrific: the suckling pig was extraordinary. But if you do not own a residence in one of the new, billion-dollar buildings in the restaurant's vicinity, or at least look like you do, you're in for a night of being treated like a leper by this restaurant.
