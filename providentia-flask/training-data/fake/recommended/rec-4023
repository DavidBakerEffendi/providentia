Bogota is my go-to place for having people out to dinner. I took my parents here when they were in town and they loved it, but have taken plenty of other demographics here and everyone has been impressed. Out of the many times I've been here, only a couple not-so-great experiences. Once we ordered several drinks during happy hour but were charged regular price... And sometimes they rush out the mixed drinks and they aren't so good. E.g. big chunks of ice in a pina colada. But the staff has always been super nice and even though we have had to send a couple drinks back (and once maybe a dessert), they always come back to us with problem solved. Â I love (maybe a little too much) all the girly, fruity mojito flavors they offer. The arroz con pollo, so good. Well, everything is good, really. Go here with some friends and have a pitcher of mojitos -- You won't regret it.
