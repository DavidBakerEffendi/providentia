I must admit, I was underwhelmed. THis place's reputation precedes it, so I was expecting brunchtime greatness. I also had heard dreams about the fries (yes, Bobby Flay's favorite), but interestingly enough I found the fries at Bar Americain (Flay's restaurant midtown) to easily win in a fry-off with Balthazar. Underwhelmed by menu, eggs were bland, and service was horrible. Couple that with about a 5-10% too overpriced menu, and I was, to repeat, underwhelmed. Have to admit, our waiter was also VERY creepy (in vibe, voice, and actions) and I understand the place is crowded, but it is simply unacceptable for you to press your thighs against my shoulder when reaching across the table to grab our salt and pepper shakers. Dear lord.
