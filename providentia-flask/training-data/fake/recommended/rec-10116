Picked this place for brunch for 5 girls because it's pretty spacious. They started us a basket of bisciuts with butter and preserves. It was okay. I ordered an omelette with greens, tomatoes and feta. The egg wasn't fluffy and the spinach was bland. It was okay. The service was okay. They refilled my water a couple times, I guess that counts for something. Overall... this place is okay. The food was edible enough to not be completely dissatisfied, but I'm not raving either. Just "okay."
