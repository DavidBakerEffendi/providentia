It's really such a shame that a great restaurant space and location has to be wasted on an over priced and underwhelming restaurant. Besides the fact that the food is mediocre at best, extra Virgin has the worst service. The waitresses are just flat out rude and are not good at their jobs. It makes the entire experience disappointing. I've witnessed other diners fighting with the staff on numerous occasions. I do have to say that the bartender Dawood? is an awesome guy, wish the others would learn a thing or two from him on hospitality. If you want to go here I recommend eating at the bar, he will actually take care of you properly.The food menu is uninspiring and the preparation is always just a little bit off. Butter nut squash raviolis soaking in a pool of butter (yuck).  Fries are good...I recommend going somewhere else in the village, this place is a waste of money and not worth the annoyance of the service.  Sitting outside at their tables is nice but they give you attitude and barely come back to your table if you tell them you are just ordering drinks and an appetizer. Gross! Needs an intro class in restaurant management and hospitality 101.
