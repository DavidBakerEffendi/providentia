This is one of my new fave brunch spots!!  They have some interesting items on the menu & they're consistent.  I've been a few times & I love the Israeli breakfast, you get plenty of food!  The French Toast is great also- really good flavor.  The service is good too- & the price is nice- about 12$ for most brunch plates.   Miriam's will not disappoint you!!
