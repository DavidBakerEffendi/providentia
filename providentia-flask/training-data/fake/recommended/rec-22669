The first time I came here, the kitchen was closed (we got there late) so me and my date decided to have a couple of drinks. We had the beetini and another cocktail, wish I could remember the name! Both were delicious, so we decided to come back the next week a little earlier to try the food. So glad we did. We got two kinds of dumplings for an appetizer, the mushroom and the pork. Both of them were superb, but I liked the pork one better. For dinner, we got the schnitzel. Not only was it super filling and tremendous, but it was also fantastic! It came with awesome mashed potatoes and a nice side salad. We tried to finish everything but after the appetizer it was an impossible task. We hope to try the brunch soon! Oh, and before I forget, both times we went we had the same waitress. I didn't get her name, but she was an absolute sweetheart. Absolutely positively highly recommend this place!
