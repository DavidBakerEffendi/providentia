Great pizza but...bugs in salt and stupid check policy. The food and beer was great. However, this place uses a lame excuse for not offering separate checks: "It's our policy and has always been our policy". Which just means that they are too lazy to do it. We found several gnats and other unidentifiable things in the salt shaker. Won't be coming back.
