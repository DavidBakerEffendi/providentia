Picked this restaurant off of Urbanspoon after taking a quick unguided tour of the Independance Hall area. We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. I had a sweet potato chipotle soup to start and the Flat Iron Steak as my entree. Both were well prepared and very tasty. Looking around at the other diners in the restaurant, I can say that the chicken pot pie and the grilled cheese with tomato soup dishes looked very tasty as well. Everyone at our table loved thier dishes and everyone cleaned their plates. No dessert for us tonight, but they had some pretty tempting offerings. Just too full.
