Always go where the long lines are. Even if you've been living under a big fat rock and have never heard about the chicken and rice platters from here, follow the above food mantra and it will be unlikely to fail too hardcore. Even if it does, the platter is like, what, $6? Small price to pay for a large reward. This cart is so much better than any of the other competitors trying to leech business away in the nearby vicinity. For all the impatient people who grow tired of waiting for the best chicken and rice, just wait!!! (the lamb is okay too but I prefer the chicken platter) You'll be so disappointed if you go somewhere else. Secret ingredient white sauce is the key to this place's success. I know that sounds disgusting but it's a legitimate claim. In conclusion, get the chicken and rice from here and douse white sauce all over it. Add the red sauce if you want to make it a real hot mess. Awesome possum!
