I've been numerous times, but mostly for atmosphere at the bar.  It's a good happy hour spot, or perfect for a low key margarita or two, but not for anything more.  Most recently, came here with a group of 4 friends for drinks on a Saturday night...We were immediately seated at a large dimly lit table in a lounge-y booth.  i was not a fan. The lighting was super dim and the seats were super low and uncomfortable. I felt like I needed a booster seat (like a child would at Pizza Hut)...I am not a petite person by any means and felt super uncomfortable.  I asked our waiter to move us to a booth over by the windows, which were brighter and had "higher" seating. Once we relocated, everything was fine. Food/drinks:  Every time I get a margarita here, whether it's the house or specialty flavored, I am never disappointed. The chips and guac are delicious. No complaints about the chicken tacos or enchiladas either. Atmosphere: I love the colors and the way the interior is put together so I would say hella yes on that. Service: I haven't experienced any negative vibes as far as service...especially considering I've been here well over 15 times.
