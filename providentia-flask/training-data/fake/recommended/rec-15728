Went here on a Monday evening for a quick dinner before seeing a movie.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Mondays are Meatball Mondays!  In addition to the regular menu they have a number of meatball specialties that are outstanding.  We had the chicken meatball appetizer and then I had the spaghetti with veal meatballs. I highly recommend this restaurant, especially on Mondays.
