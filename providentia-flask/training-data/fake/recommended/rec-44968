Went to La Sirene for my birthday and was extremely satisfied! If I could have one last thing to eat before I died, it would be the foie gras filet mignon, magnifique! Very cool that it's BYOD, just make sure you come prepared and if not, there are several wine shops near by. The reason I do not give it 5 stars is because of the ambiance. It was smaller than I expected and not very crowded (however, I was there on a Sunday night so might be different on other nights). Then again, with food this good, who needs trendy? I will be returning very soon!
