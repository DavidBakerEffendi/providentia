The food here is hit or miss depending on what you order. I have been here three times now, the first being the best. The last dish I ordered was missing a few of the ingredients I would have greatly enjoyed and the meat was in such huge chunks that I had to chop it off to the side and then add it back in. My boyfriend and I both had water delivered to us in cups that hadn't been cleaned very well because our water was sweet, like there was still some soda in the cups. Even on days when the food is good the service has always left something to be desired. Generally unattentive and gives off the vibe of just wanting to be somewhere else. Not very welcoming. We always have to tell them when we are ready to order and we always make it to the counter to pay before the check arrives at the table. If you are deciding between here and Pho Dang in Winooski, Pho Dang is the way to go.
