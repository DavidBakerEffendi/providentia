I was taken here on Mother's Day for dinner.  I had hoped it would be better, as I have some good memories of Eli's in Hamden from the days when I lived over that way.  Sorry to say it's sorry.  Since I'm low carb these days, I had the chicken sauteed with vegetables & hot peppers.  I'm sure they didn't (did they?), but the chicken pieces tasted like they weren't cooked with the veg as they had no flavor and were slightly overcooked.  My daughter's turkey burger was mediocre and her only comment was "I should have ordered the chicken strips".  My husband ordered a burger, which by the looks of it is what they want to be known for:  huge stack of bun, beef, etc. which even he had trouble figuring out how he would get it in his mouth.  It was more of a shock effect than a taste sensation.  Sweet potato fries were not anything special.   After a long wait, we sat in the sullen back dining room, the only decor being two large screen TVs with sports on them.  Since we were in a booth, the only thing we could glimpse were the TVS and the door that people come through, no ambiance whatsoever.   The service was friendly, can't complain about that.  If my family hadn't waited til the last minute to take me out, we could have had a much nicer meal at a restaurant more to my liking.  I can't quite figure out why people come and spend their money here when we have such great choices in town!  I know a restaurant broker looking for a large second generation spot to place her client in -- this would be perfect.
