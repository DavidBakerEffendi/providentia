After some friends cancelled for happy hour last night, I decided to grab the girlfriend and head to Hagi.  When we walked in I was the only non-asian (always a good sign).  We ordered our food and drinks and sat for probably 2.5 hours constantly ordering more as we got close to our last dish or two.  The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the chicken wings.  They were good, but compared to Kasadela, they just didn't cut it.  I will definitely go back.
