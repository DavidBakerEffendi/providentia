My boyfriend and I watched a rerun of Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and decided we just had to go try this place! Although the duck pot pie that we watched being made on the show, once I got there I just had to try the Mac and cheese. Best decision ever. Corn flakes sprinkled on top, this Mac and cheese was to die for. Plated with a side of blueberry cornbread. My boyfriend got a burger that was so full of cheese in the middle...oh my god, yum. AND THE FRIES. A delicious blend of regular potato fries and sweet potato fries served with a delicious aloi. I would definitely suggest anyone in the area got try this place. The menu and beer list make up for the tight corders!
