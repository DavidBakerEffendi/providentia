The good is brilliant here.  If you're thinking low brow, your right and wrong.  Sure there are perfectly prepared seafood boils but that's just the start.  I had the line caught Cod with andouille, potatoes and cherry tomatoes is a hearty deliciously lemony wine/ butter sauce.  Don't miss this place!  It's family owned and operated, and the care and concern is ever present
