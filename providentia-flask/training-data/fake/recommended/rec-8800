Ordered take out from Room Service and the delivery actually came quite quickly. We ordered the Pad thai and house special pad thai in egg. Food was a big minus. As the food was just either too overwhelmingly sweet or too salty. The seafood in the pad thai was way overcooked and chewy. It's basically bad americanized thai food. From passing the restaurant though it is very swanky and well decorated. Looks super hip. But whats the use of a hip looking place when ya leaving the establishment with a tummy ache.
