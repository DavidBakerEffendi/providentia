Not sure what we were expecting but the atmosphere was a bit of a surprise.  Not good or bad, just not what we expected.  We tried several of the hams (one smoked and cured, one just cured) as well as the pork buns.  Oh the pork buns.  Nothing like pork belly and when you throw in the hoisin sauce and the scallions it is just perfect. Would definitely go again
