This is a great place for large parties and birthday dinners (even though on the night we went it seemed like everyone was having a birthday). The food was tasty with really good portions. I would suggest the Shrimp with the yellow rice. But skip the calamari appetizer, was very disappointing. Sangria has a good kick to it. Just go for the large pitcher!
