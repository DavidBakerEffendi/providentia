Went here quite a while ago before I started yelping. The food at this restaurant is magnificent. The decor isn't impressive, but they do have cloth napkins. The place seats maybe 16 people at most (4 tables). Service is very good. A guy opened the door for us when he saw us looking inside. This place is BYOB and the waiter helped us open our beer bottles. Also, since we came with 6 people, they put two tables together for us. They have very limited space so I don't expect them to do that during peak hours, although it is possible considering how nice they are. I remember having... Shrimp Poori with naan - One of the most amazing sauces I have ever tasted. I remember it being sweet and extremely appetizing. Would definitely have it again. Chicken (or was it lamb?) Jalfrezi - I don't remember how it tasted but I remember it was amazing. We didn't order dessert but they complimented each of us (all 6 of us) with sample sizes of rice pudding, which was very good(I've never had bad rice pudding anyway). Everything here is inexpensive, so definitely come here and don't be afraid to pig out. You will be treated like royalty here.
