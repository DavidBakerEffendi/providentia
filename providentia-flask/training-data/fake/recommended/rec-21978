Wow!! Really love the New Kings Pizza!! Since the new owners took over the pizza quality has improved 200%!! I also recently started getting delivery, the veal parm was off the chain! I stop in for a slice at least two times a week now, I can't wait till the new dinning room is complete so the family can go there! Looks like we can even have a small party right there in the back.
