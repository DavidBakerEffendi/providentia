I have been here several times and had amazing experiences and not so great experiences.  When it comes to the food certain items are awesome, while others I struggle to finish a bite.  I was there last week and for the first time ever I wanted to complain about the margaritas, which tasted like watered down juice.  I have never had this complaint before and would normally that their drinks are pretty strong.  I like this place but just wish it was more consistent.
