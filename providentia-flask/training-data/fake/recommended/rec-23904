I had heard some really good things about this place so I was excited to try it. I can say for sure that Le Virtu lived up to my expectations. After living in Rome for 2 years and returning to Philadelphia I find it more and more difficult to find authentic Italian food. This place definitely has the authentic cuisine I was looking for. If you're looking for Chicken Parm, you're not going to find it here. I felt the prices were reasonable compared to the portion size and the quality of the food. I went on a Tuesday evening and it wasn't too crowded. The service was great. I'm looking forward to returning when the weather is a bit warmer so I can sit outside.
