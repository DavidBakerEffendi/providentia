ordered a chicken parm grinder yesterday for lunch . Definately one of the worst grinders I've ever had . I actually assumed it'd be a real chicken cutlet, but knew as soon as I saw the guy pull a preformed thing out of the deep fryer that it was going to be that ground up pseudo chicken... someone that was w/ me ordered a sausage grinder and he later said w/ no prompting on my part that it too was an awful sandwich   Oh , and the womens bathroom still has no  toilet paper,  & and when I told them , got no more than a blank look.   Burger king across the street probably would've been a better choice
