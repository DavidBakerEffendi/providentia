Both lines are the same, guys. Stop waiting on the longer line cause you think that's the "legit" one. Meat is leaner than typical halal platters from street carts. Nutrition on average is about 40grams at The halal guys versus 60grams of fat from other halal carts. Take in to account the 40grams includes the pita bread which is really filling and you got yourself quite the macro nutritious platter for $6.00. Gotta love NYC.
