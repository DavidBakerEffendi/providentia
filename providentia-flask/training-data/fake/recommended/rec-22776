After trying desperately to get dinner last night, we eventually arrived here. I really liked it. My vindaloo was superb: spicy and tart like it should be. The garlic naan was fresh and the paratha had that wheat taste. Jack's mattar panir was full of panir but was lacking in peas. Still this is my favorite Indian place in the Hartford are so far.
