Delicious, cheap Indian food with great portions. We live pretty far away from here (according to Seamless, we're out of their area), but they still manage to deliver our food quickly. They've even occasionally thrown in little treats when we place a large order. Not only are the people who take orders over the phone especially polite and kind, but the delivery guys always remember how to get into our weird building. I've tried every other Indian place in the neighborhood, and they've got their competition beat by a wide margin.
