Probably the best burger I've ever had. Pros: Fast and great service Four different sauces for your fries and burger Not only has great burgers but also great dessert menu Cookie ice cream sandwich was well worth it Sweet potato fries were scrumptious Con: 25-30min wait (got there around 630pm and had two people) Tip: Ask to be seated upstairs! It's quieter, commodious, and you won't have people waiting stare at your table.
