I wish it was bigger. That's what she said. But really. All of the "beer gardens" I have been to have been in a forest in Germany, so maybe I am being a little unrealistic. Anywho, I went with a group of peeps for Dunkel Dare hosted by Marc Summers as part of Philly Beer Week. I had a GREAT time and felt nostalgic towards Marc Summers' former show Double Dare, they even had the huge booger-y nose and everything! Good atmosphere, great beer, even greater food. I got the Victory Summer Love pale ale, and it was divine. To add to that I got a massive soft pretzel and the Kasekreiner sausage which was beef, pork and cheese. Topped it off with some spicy mustard & sauerkraut and called it a day! I took a nibble of my man's fries, and they were some of the best I had. I would hate to see this place on a weekend, I just feel like it needs more space! But my 5 stars go for the service, food and bevs. Had a gread time. Will definitely be Bach, I mean back.
