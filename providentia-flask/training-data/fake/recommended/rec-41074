Cute place, very small and a bit hard to find. They have a sign in the window but its hard to see from the road. Food was decent but not amazing. We had the crispy gyoza to start which had this odd chip like stuff all around it that you had to peel off, my guess was that it was some sort of fried egg or sauce? I really dont know. The gyoza was alright it came with a chili soy sauce, not too spicy but flavorful. I ordered the #6 ramen as my entree with an additional soft boiled egg. The egg was awesome, the ramen was good but as i said earlier, not great. My mom is Japanese and I lived in Japan as a child, so Ive had some pretty good ramen. I could be biased, but I found it strange that there were no Asian customers! Usually if there are asians eating there, its good asian food. I would definitely go back though, its not easy to find ramen restaurants outside of nyc. It does the trick if youve got a craving!
