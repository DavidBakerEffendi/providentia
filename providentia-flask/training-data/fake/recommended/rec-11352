The Oyster House is a really fun place to get together with a group of people.  I, myself, am not a big fan of oysters ironically but I went with some people who are.  I had the new england clam chowder to start and that was okay.  It could have been thicker.  It didn't wow me and I probably wouldn't get that again if i went back. I then had the Lobster Roll for my entree.  It was out of this world.  It is pretty pricey but once you get the roll you will understand why.  They use TONS of lump lobster meat.  It is served with a side of fries that are also yummy.  I skipped on dessert, which is out of character, because I was so full.  The restaurant is decorated very nicely and has a fun atmosphere.  I would highly recommend The Oyster House.
