Really really good. We didn't get seats at the grill/bar, unfortunately, as we were a last minute pop-in.  We did a seat in the beautiful back dining room, which was just what we wanted on a cold, rainy Saturday after a soak-inducing walking tour.  The hot towels and speedy green tea were perfect for our chilled group. We ordered a bunch of veggies and meats along with an agedashi tofu and roasted mochi.  We also got the sashimi platter special which included toro and sea urchin. The sashimi was amazing.  The quality was out of this world and presentation was great.  Some of the standouts from our ordering were the enoki, the duck breast and the roasted mochi.  Desserts included the green tea pudding and the mochi soup, both different than any other dessert but really good and not too sweet.  The perfect ending. Service was great and our tea mugs were never empty. The only downside was the price.  All those little dishes add up fast. Also, for the ladies - check out the remote-control panel toilet.
