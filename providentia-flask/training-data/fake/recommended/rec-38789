I've been in Los Angeles for 6 years now, and I've yet to encounter a better dao-fu-fa (translation: tofu flower)--the silken smooth freshly-made sweet tofu dessert thingy--outside of Philadelphia. I'm convinced that to satiate my cravings, my only resolve is to plan my vacations to somehow navigate through Chinatown Philly (unless someone can recommend a reasonable LA-equivalent). And I don't think I'm alone here because I've seen my aunt from HK do the same thing, and I'm sure these aren't isolated incidents. Plus, they're not here to gouge their customers, as you can get dessert for an entire family of 6, a Chinese newspaper for the grandmother and 2 freshly made soy bean drinks for $10.75. Seriously, this is just plain awesome.
