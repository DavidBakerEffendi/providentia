The food is great, no doubt about that. However service is rather biased or just plain horrible. When you pay, they will hover over your table and make you feel VERY uncomfortable. This is a typical thing I see in Chinatown. Usually I can deal with it, but this restaurant expects you to pay 15 percent tip when it's not even on the bill. I came here with 5 others and service was poor. They gave the entrees out in weird orders ( sometime 2 people got their meal - 4 others waited 15 mins, why not all the same time?). In the end I paid 10 percent tip, low but it represents their attitude and their low attendance on tables. The woman then comes up to me and counts the money right in front of me. What..? Then she tells me to pay 15 percent, shame.
