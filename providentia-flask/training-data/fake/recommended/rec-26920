We came here with our NYC / Larchmont friends. Les Amis is a relatively small resto with a lot of French charm. It is truly a calming place in an otherwise hectic SoHo, where you can kick back and enjoy the ambiance and varied menu. We came for lunch and I had the Tuna Ni√ßoise Salad which was incredible. I can hardly tell you the other ingredients since the tuna, ordered medium-rare, was so good that was all I could focus on. I highly recommend it. They have outside seating which is nice as long as you don't mind the auto and pedestrian traffic. Our server was attentive but not overbearing. Would definitely return.
