Great meal. We had high expectations and Perilla did not let us down. The special dessert of the night was a chocolate souffle and it was amazing! The staff was attentive and helpful but not overbearing. This is also a great place to bring visitors especially if they want to say they ate a restaurant owned by one of the Top Chef winners. We will be visiting again.
