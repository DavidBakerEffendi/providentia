They have some really fine, simple and cheap food here (for beeing in Broklyn). Go for something brazilian! The pastries is not very good. And to be honest, the fruit-capirinhias is not very good either since they use concentrade juice instead of fresh fruit. Go for the original one with lime instead :) For lunch is between $9-15 and the capirihias is $8-10. I will get back at night time next time since is a lot more busy then!
