Despite the fact that this place is obviously very popular, I always enjoy going here. It's the first breakfast I have whenever I visit NY. The blueberry pancakes are nice and fluffy and really enjoyable but I like the savory dishes a bit more. I had a farmer's breakfast (I think?) once that had cheese, toast, roasted tomatoes, and eggs with a side of bacon. In the summer it's nice to have the fresh, big, yummy breakfast. Usually my trick to avoiding lines here is to get there right when they open but in the summer it's impossible. I don't know, I just love the experience of visiting Clinton St. Taking the F train down at 7:30am in the fall, entering the just opened bakery, sitting down to a big plate of blueberry pancakes across from my brother is my favourite things to do when visiting NY. (Also they have really good hot chocolate. This is worth noting, it's scrumptious.)
