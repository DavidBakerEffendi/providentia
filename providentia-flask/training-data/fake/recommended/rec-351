Amazing Tapas Restaurant in East Village!! Been twice already and i cant wait to go this weekend. Made a reservation for the flamenco saturday night show and it was spectacular! Awesome food, the goat cheese balls, crepe with seafood and the ground beef pocket bites are to die for!! Service really friendly and courteous!! Music and show something else. Looking forward to go again!!
