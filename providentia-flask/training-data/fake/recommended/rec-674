CHIPS AND DIPS is what I have come to associate this place with, and I mean that in the best way possible. The "De La Hoya" guacamole with chips is BOMB! When I first went to this place I asked the waitress what guacamole she suggested, and she said that she would recommend the one above, if I was a garlic lover, I assured her that I was, maaaaan what a great guacamole. I'll keep getting it, and getting it, every time I go back. Honestly, I never had guacamole taste so fresh and flavorful, until now. I love this place's interior design and even if I didn't, there are tables outside.
