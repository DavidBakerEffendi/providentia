After waiting over three months to get a table, we weren't sure what to expect going into the tasting menu at Laurel.  We're used to picking from a few appetizer and entree choices, not having an entire meal chosen for us! The first course was good- not outstanding, but by no means bad, just good.  It only escalated from there- each course was simply better and better.  And we got to pair the amazing menu with our favorite wine since this fine establishment is also a BYO.   The seafood heavy menu was full of twists- every day items (jersey scallops) and special treats (walu).  Each course was plated beautifully and flowed like a lyric into the next (cheesey, I know, but this food makes me want to wax poetic!).   Plus, as a Top Chef junkie, it was great that Chef Nicholas served dessert himself.   All I can say is check it out, for $80 per person it's a phenomenal deal.
