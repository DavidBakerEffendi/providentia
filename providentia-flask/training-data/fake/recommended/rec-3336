There are at least 25 pizza restaurants in Bayonne NJ. Many of them create great pies. However, one clearly stands out. Denapoli's Krispy Pizza not only makes incredibly delicious pies their prices will astound you. When you get the bill you will swear that you went back in time to the 1980's Large pies are $9 and there is a special deal for pick up only, of two pies for $15. Everyday you can buy an oversized slice of pizza  and a can of soda for only $2.25. But enough with the prices. The pies are not too thin or too thick. They will also make any thickness you may ask for. You will never see a burnt pie and though I usually do not eat the crust of most pizzas the crust at Denapoli's is always crisp and never soggy. Only the best ingredients are used. Homemade dough and sauce with actual pieces of real tomatoes can be found in all of their pizzas  You will think you ordered a pie with extra cheese as their is always plenty of fresh Grande mozzarella spread across each pie. Finally, don't forget trying their sandwiches. They are large in size,great in taste and also ridiculously low in price. Go to their restaurant located between 31st and 32nd streets on Broadway in Bayonne. You will never want to go anywhere else. 10 Stars. SM
