First off, the only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because it's cash-only. It's 2013, this is ridiculous. Kudos to Carnegie Deli for finally arriving in this century for allowing customers to pay with credit cards. A place as popular in the neighborhood as Tom's should get on that train ASAP. Having said that, this place is great. The service is quick, the place is always crowded but not enough that my girlfriend and I couldn't get a table right away on the patio. I had the chocolate chip pancakes and they were fantastic. They really hit the spot. At $8, it was a great bargain compared to all the brunch places in Manhattan that would charge twice as much for the same food at half the quality. I definitely recommend this place if your group is 3 people or less because otherwise you'll likely have to wait a while, though if you're not in a rush, the food is definitely worth it.
