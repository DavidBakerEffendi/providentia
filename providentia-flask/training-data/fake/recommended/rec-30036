Came here for lunch buffet three times. Every time, a great experience. The staff was nice, but the patrons were also friendly! In separate instances, they stopped and told us how to put the food together. Like, "Crack the ball and fill it with this." Or, "Put the fried dough in the cup, then ladle the soup in." Super friendly. Or they feel sorry since we look like lost sheep staring blankly at the food while holding empty plates. Can't vouch for or reject the authenticity of the food, but they were excellent. The Goat Curry was my favorite. And the ice cream was so very good. I think it was cardamon ice cream.
