A good place to grab a bite by the waterfront. You order your food at the counter inside and then are given a number to put on your table and can sit anywhere inside or outside while you wait for them to bring you your food. They are usually pretty fast with the food, and I don't think I've ever had to wait more than 10 minutes for mine. There is a patio outside that has water views with a bunch of tables to choose from, most of which have umbrellas, which is nice for when it's really sunny. I pretty much get the turkey burger and fries every time I go and think it's one of the best turkey burgers around...probably because of the cranberry mayo they put on it. Fries are good too. After eating there is a little window around front where you can order creemies, which are also really tasty. Occasionally I have also called and ordered take out, so that is an option too here.
