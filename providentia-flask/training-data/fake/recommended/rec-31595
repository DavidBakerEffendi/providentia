Ok, so I've been going to this place for about a year and have heard people order the "square" pizza rather than regular.  Finally tried it and it's the most interesting sicilian style pizza I;ve had  Very good.  I usually get the regular pizza,which is just ... regular.  Their chicken parm sandwiches are excellent too,
