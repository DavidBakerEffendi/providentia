I went here for Restaurant Week. I was excited because the menu was pretty stocked, for $35 you got a cocktail, mac and cheese fritters, appetizer, entree, and desert. We made our reservations over 2 weeks in advance, and called ahead that day to confirm. When we got there, our party still had to wait over 40 minutes to be seated. Why have people make reservations if you're going to make them wait a huge amount of time? The hostess was rude, and blamed it on OpenTable overbooking it instead of having the restaurant own the mistake. When we finally were seated, our waitress was sub-par. She rushed through our orders and barely gave us any time to eat. Like another yelper said, there were flies EVERYWHERE. The mac & cheese fritter was too salty, and there wasn't enough cheese. Someone else in my party got the coconut shrimp appetizer and it was burnt. Another person got crab cakes and they were dry. I got the shrimp and crab linguine, it was bland and flavorless. I wouldn't recommend this place, there are plenty of other better restaurants in Philly to settle for mediocre food and bad service.
