I just went to employees only for the first time last night and it was amazing, even on a late Tuesday night. The drinks were really good and the bartenders were very attentive. My first drink was the Vesper it was remarkably smooth and also had another cocktail on the list with cognac in it and that was superior. There was also a girl next to me that got a little too drunk and the bartender instead of continuing to feed her drinks gave her some water and made sure she slowed down, I really respected that. This place really had an amazing atmosphere and a good crowd to go with it. When we first walked in there was even a girl doing tarot greetings at a table. The place is just very classy and yet fun at the same time. I will be going back!
