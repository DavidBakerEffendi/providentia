Amazing atmosphere to have a drink in. The bartender was wicked friendly and the bar itself had a very inviting ambiance. A large assortment of drinks to choose from. I was only in town visiting but if I end up coming back to Philadelphia I will definitely be stopping by the bar again for several more drinks.
