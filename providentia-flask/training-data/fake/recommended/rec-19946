We were wasted. In from LA. We saw the mecca of fried foods. I ran. SHIT. They were closed. Got some looks from the guys cleaning inside. One came to the window. "This is my last bag. It's a large, I'll charge you for a small." YES. F YES. Thank you kind sir. Sauces to get: The mango chutney mayo. Curry ketchup Rosemary garlic. ALL OF THE REST OF THEM. I heart you french fry place.
