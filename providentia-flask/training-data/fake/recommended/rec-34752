A friend and I visited Hagi for the first time last night and boy were we glad we did! It's so nice to have another place on our midtown list. I feel like sometimes it is easy to forget that there are actually some really great meeting spots, even around Times Square where we both unfortunately currently work. (The word "unfortunately" in that sentence is what divides locals from tourists, I guess.) We're both big fans of Japanese food - Izakaya, fresh soba, and home-style cooking especially. Since we were new to Hagi, we decided to get an array of small dishes, like ya do, and test out the cuisine. Absolutely nothing was in any way disappointing. That is to say, everything was delicious! The fish was fresh, the daikon plentiful, the meats and peppers were grilled just right, and the ochazuke was just like grandma used to make! (OK, just like my friend's grandma used to make. My grandma is Italian.) We're going to have to go back to sample the sake and shochu because drinks and noodles were probably the only things we didn't sample. OK that's a lie, too... There is still so much more of the menu to explore! Which is why we're going back. And soon! A quick word to the wise - we arrived at 5:45, just 15 minutes after opening and it was pretty full already. And it was a Monday! Naturally this is a testament to the quality of the food. However, if you get there anytime after, say, 6:00 or 6:30, be prepared to wait.
