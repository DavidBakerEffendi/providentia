mola mucho! came here last night with a big group of friends for a bday party... we had an awesome time. i lived in madrid for a year, and i truly felt i was back there... from the look to the music to the accent of our waiter (racion pronounced "rathion" :) . the food was quite good and they did a good job recommending items to us (with 9 people ordering little plates, i was nervous we were going to end up with 18 servings of patatas bravas) as well as timing the serving of the food. the staff was super friendly and nice, and brought my friend dessert and sang and then even after we had paid, sent over two more pitchers of white sangria (which was very tasty) gratis. definitely recommend...and i want to go back on a night that there is a flamenco show!
