Cute little place in downtown Newark, next to a Dunkin Donuts in an area that gets very busy with office workers during lunch hour. As soon as you walk in, you see the very friendly owner by the grill.  You can order to go or stay-in, as there is seating towards the back.   I ordered a garlic chicken burrito, which wasn't as great as I expected but still good.  The steak burrito is beyond outstanding, so go with that if you like meat.  It is filled with rice, black beans, corn, peppers, and a spicy cream sauce. What's most impressive is that you can stuff your face with a great burrito for about 5 dollars, which in northern NJ is a steal.  I really wish I had known about this place earlier. If you work or study in Newark, you have to head down here to give it a try.
