$2 slices of cheese and $3 slices of pepperoni. It's not your traditional New Haven style pizza........more like your high school cafeteria's pizza, but it tastes fine. I honestly like it more than Brick Oven's pizza across the street. Also, the gyros are pretty damn phenominal and packed with a lot of lamb. Thank you for staying open so late and catering to my drunkeness.
