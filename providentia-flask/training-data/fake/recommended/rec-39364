Second time here and the service sucks. You can't customize anything on the menu. Apparently everything is premade??? Â So I'm paying for food that isn't fresh?!?! That's exactly why I go to restaurants so I can't get what I want and pay lots of money for it. Besides the fact that I can't give it 0 stars the one saving( and that is stretching it) is the drinks. Good luck with the food since its a hit or miss.
