If you're expecting the BEST HALAL EXPERIENCE OF YOUR LIFE, you're probably expecting way too much. It's just a food cart, people!! But - it is a damn good cart. For only $6, you get a big aluminum tin of chicken and/or lamb with rice, salad, and pita bread, along with some of that delicious white sauce. I've only ever been at like 2am, but I think that's when everything tastes the best!! Don't be a newb and make sure to look for the yellow circular symbol with "The Halal Guys" on it. They're not ONLY at the location across from the Hilton; there are now several carts down the street and one diagonally across the street from the Hilton. The other carts tend to be a lot less busy and it's the same food. There are a lot of fakes though, so be sure to look for their logo on the bags. The service isn't the best as the tins of chicken and rice are usually shoved into my hands but if you wanted friendly service, why are you eating from a cart in the middle of Manhattan? It's also pretty rare to find so much good food for only $6 around here. Most importantly, don't be a dick and leave your trash lying around. If you're eating around the fountain or the building areas around the carts, CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF. I really despise people who eat and then leave their trash as if someone's going to love cleaning up after them. Makes me want to punch them in the face/neck/gut. If you do this and someone suddenly wacks you in the face, well... you had it coming.
