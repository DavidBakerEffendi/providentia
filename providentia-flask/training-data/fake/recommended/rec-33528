Yummy! I loved the food here. It reminded me of Penang, which used to be on 3rd Ave. The service was fine and the portions large. The prices were out of this world. Of course a bowl of rice should only cost a buck, but I can't remember the last time I saw it priced so cheaply, especially not coconut or brown rice. We ordered the roti cani, curried spare ribs, some tasty dish that consisted of fried shrimp, tofu and pork , coconut rice (2) and green tea ice cream. The bill came up to less than $30.00. Can't wait to go back!
