I try and eat here as much as I can. For me it is usually on a Saturday or Sunday for Brunch. Dumplings a must !! Then I try something different every time.. Â To be honest I do have a couple of repeat offenders (Bibimbap, Steak and Eggs).. Drinks are legit ! Service is fantastic. They are nice and attentive. I have been here for dinner a few times as well. Enjoyed every bite off my plate, and my guests plates as well! One of my favorite places to eat anywhere.!!
