First review also first time eating at cast iron and I must say it was good. Ordered wings as an app then the whiting with the Mac and cheese. My hubby had the pulled pork sandwich with Cajun fries. Also good. My fav was the fries which was well seasoned. The Mac and cheese could use black pepper but it wasn't bad the way it was seasoned. I will definitely be back to try the ribs and fried okra!
