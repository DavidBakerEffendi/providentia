First of all let me say the only reason why it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because I only went once on Valentines Day so I didn't get to try their full menu. The food I had was delicious.  The staff was amazingly sweet.  The only thing I have to say is that it was very expensive, granted it was Valentine's Day, but still I think it could be a little cheaper.
