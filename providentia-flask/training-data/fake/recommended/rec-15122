I have tried as many of the cheese steak places as possible on my trips to Philly and I have to say that Sonny's is THE BEST.  Forget about Geno's and Pat's those are no where near as good as Sonny's.  Geno's and Pat's barely give you any meat in their sandwiches and the flavor is blah not to mention they charge and arm and a leg.  Sonny's has the best tasting Cheesesteaks in Philly that I have tried so far.  My only complaint is that they are not nearly big enough.  I need two just to fill me up.  I would say a close second is Ishkabibble's Cheesesteaks because of the size, the fries at the place are good too.  But Sonny's beats out the rest because I always leave there wanting another Cheesesteak.   Save yourself a trip and a wait in line and go to Sonny's.  After Sonny's then try Ishkabibbles.
