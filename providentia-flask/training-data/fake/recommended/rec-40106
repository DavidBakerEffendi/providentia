While National Mechanics has an awesome concept and location, it is pretty disappointing. Beyond being completely overrun by hipsters, it generally is an awkward place to be. I have gone several times at the behest of friends and every time I hate it a little bit more. It is ridiculously and uncomfortably overcrowded which only adds to the awkwardness of the floor plan. And if you plan on spending more than 20 minutes there, you might as well kiss your eardrums goodbye and hope that you don't have to hear anything for the next day or so. The drinks are overpriced and poorly made --- that is if you can make your way to the bar and successfully deal with one of the surly bartenders or if you can wrangle one of the rarely seen waitresses that I honestly think might just walk around with an empty train holding up your index finger to everyone they walk by as if you are on their way somewhere important, but never return. If you are going to brave it anyway and disregard my comments, at least take this one --- pee before you go. There are only two bathrooms (one of which is almost always out of order) that everyone shares and the line is usually 20 or so people long at any given time. This is probably why you pretty much always see guys heading out of the building and into the ally to take care of business before heading back in.
