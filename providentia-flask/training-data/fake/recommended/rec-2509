I pulled a Guy Fieri and visited this famous cheesesteak intersection to see which I prefered. Of the two in the famous rivalry, I think I prefered Geno's to Pat's King of Steaks, but that's just because I got it with Cheese Whiz. Trust me on this point, out-of-towners: Get the Whiz. It sounds gross but it's really not bad. The upshot of my little adventure tells me I've had better Phillys in Philly. Worth a visit to gawk.
