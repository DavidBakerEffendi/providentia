This was a great experience! Food was fantastic.  We had to wait a little bit but I would rather wait for fresh food.  The cashier was really nice and took her time to explain things to us, even though there was a line.  The guy making the sandwiches kept letting us know that he is working on our food and where it was in the process. Overall, a fantastic experience.  I would go there again!
