Fanstantic meal with friendly and attentive service.  Small  dining room belies both the size of the menu and the expertise in the kitchen. Papadum served  upon arrival, along with pitcher of water at linen clothed table and napkins.  Three dipping sauces were fresh and tasty. My husband ordered the whole ffish promfret, and it was fresh, succulent, cooked to perfection, slathered with a delicious sauce along with broccoli, squash, carrots, onions and freshly chopped coriander.  Served with white rice, we also ordered naan, which was done to perfection.    I ordered the chana masala and a side of poori, what aa great combo.   We were treated to a rice noodle dessert which concluded a very nice meal.  We live in an indian food wasteland and this was an especially appreciated meal as our hopes were high and we were not disappointed.  Loved it.
