I like Johnny Brenda's for a number of reasons. As a music venue they bring in some really good, but to the average fan, obscure bands. It's an intimate setting which allows you to be real close to the band. The food is really good and I haven't had a bad meal their yet. The octopus salad I got awhile ago was something that I still can't stop thinking about. Unfortunately it was a special and I haven't seen it on there since. The beer selection is good and they often have beer events. The service has always been good. The bartenders are very friendly and the wait staff has always been good and fast.
