Warning: Two dollar signs ($$) for this restaurant is on the low end. Expect to pay $25-$30 per entree. After that surprise was out of the way, the food was pretty good, but make sure you ask how spicy things are. Not all restaurants put little chili peppers next to the items as a warning to white people like myself. This white girl don't do spice. So someone telling me what I ordered is spicy is always appreciated, and something I've gotten used to. Aside from that, everything was good.
