Truffle burger is hands down the best tasting on the menu. So are the truffle fries. Our order came out pretty fast and although very delicious it was on the colder side. Not complaining THAT much because we scarfed the food down. Oh and the cheesy tots are OK. Just get an additional order of the truffle fries instead. They're THAT good!
