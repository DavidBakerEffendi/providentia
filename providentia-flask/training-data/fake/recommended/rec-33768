I hesitated to write this review immediately following my meal at Marrakesh, because it was not going to be glowing to say the least.  But the fact that the evening I spent there still botherd me, I felt that I must share my experience with Yelp readers.  In May, a group of about 20 women went to Marrakesh to celebrate a 50th birthday.  Reservations were made in advance and we were led to a cozy private room.  At first, all was well,l but when we asked to have the air conditioning turned down, we were accommodated, but just briefly,  Before too long, the air was back up.  During some birthday toasts, we asked for the music to be turned down, which it was, but before too long it was turned back up.  This happened at least three times.  During the course in which a whole chicken is served, I asked for a fork - I was dressed up for the occasion and really didn't want to eat a whole chicken with my hands.  What I was given was the smallest, cheapest plastic fork imaginable.  Later, a few of the guests left early, leaving a tiny space open in the private room.  The hosts tried repeatedly to sit other diners IN OUR ROOM and seemed surprised that we didn't want strangers joining our celebration.  I can't imagine that the strangers would have wanted to sit with us either.  At 11:00 p.m., the hosts made it clear that we had to leave, despite the fact that restaurant was still busy with many other guests.  As we were told to leave, we asked the hosts to call us a few cabs in order to return to our hotel.  This apparently was not a viable request and our group walked quite a distance to our hotel.
