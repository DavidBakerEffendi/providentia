I've been here more than a few times for brunch and really enjoyed the food. This weekend, I had the steak and eggs and it was absolutely fantastic. The meat was cooked a little bit more on the rare side, but it was super tender and delicious. I definitely should have gone with a full appetite. The service most of the time is decent, but once in awhile, I feel the waiters forget about you. This particular time, the only time the waiter came to our table was to take our order, bring us food, and bring us the check. While I hate it when the waiters talk to you every 10 minutes to see "if everything is okay", I do expect my water filled. I do hope to go again soon since it's so delicious.
