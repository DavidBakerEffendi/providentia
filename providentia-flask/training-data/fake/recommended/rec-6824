Amazing dishes:  summer squash salad with smoked trout, jalapeno & bacon cornbread, and the bone marrow. Everything else was a bit too...wet?  Like my wings and the grits accompanying the shrimp & grits.  Waitstaff was pleasant overall, noise level is a bit ridiculous in the backroom due to back acoustics.  But great spot for large groups. PS the portions are fat people sized.
