A trip to Philly has to include a cheese steak. Pat's King of Steaks is much better than Geno's across the street. While Geno's is flashier and better-looking on the outside, Pat's tastes much better. If the thought of a cheese steak grosses you out (I just had a bite of my boyfriend's because I can't stand the thought of eating a whole one), still get their fries. Amazing French fries! Oh, and apparently you need to know how to order these things. Look it up on their site before going. They'll say weird things like "wiz wit?" and it's nice to know what the hell they're talking about so you don't look like a tourist.
