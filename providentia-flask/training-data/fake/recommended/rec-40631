Ok, so I would have given it a zero, but there wasn't that option... I am in town for a conference and my friends from the midwest wanted some fresh seafood. I don't eat seafood, but what the heck, most seafood restaurants have something for the non-eater in the crowd. So we got seated right away which was good. But that's where the good ended. I started with a half full glass of water. They brought out 2 very small plates of bread for 6 hungry people. I looked at the menu and noticed that there was nothing without seafood. The only option was a hamburger topped with blue cheese and an oyster. I asked for the blue cheese on the side and no oyster. I will admit, that the hamburger did taste pretty good. The blue cheese wasn't on the plate though. Two of my friends ordered appetizers which never came. Most of the portions were undersized. No one at the table left happy. To top it all off, since we are at a conference we all needed separate receipts so that we could get reimbursed. The waiter said he couldn't do it because they were "too busy". The ambience was the only plus, but the rest of our experience made me never want to come back. It's pretty bad when you go to a seafood restaurant with seafood lovers, and they're all drooling over your hamburger.
