Steve's Place is terrific.  I will agree with the other reviews in that it is pricey, but if you ask them to load up your sandwich, it's worth it.  Without a doubt, they have THE BEST chicken salad I have ever had.  My buddy lived in Newington & told me about this place...needless to say, I'm very glad I tried it. If you live in Newington or near 175, swing by for some lunch; you'll enjoy!!
