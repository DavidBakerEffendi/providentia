Been here once. Good meatballs. Service is meh. Wait was crazy. The hostess was having some kinda bad day or something because she seemed frustrated and pissed off. The meatballs were good and the ginger snap ice cream sandwich, which lacked flavor, was just ok. Definitely not worth the price for the amount of food received. If you come here starving, be prepared to either spend a lot or leave unsatisfied. And if you're stuck in a long wait, forget about it. The meatballs are pretty small and you only get 4 with some bread for $7. Good to try it out at least once I guess.
