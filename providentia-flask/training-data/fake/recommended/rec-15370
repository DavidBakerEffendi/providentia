Went there around 11:30am. Serve breakfast all day. Ordered the breakfast platter with sausage. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted great. The portions were large portions. The breakfast platter had a lot of food and was pretty inexpensive. The only downfall is that this is a tiny tiny restaurant. There is one long diner counter section with only a few seats... Maybe about 10 seats and two tables in the back that fit 2 people each. However, people were in and out pretty quickly, so the wait was not too long. Â Maybe 10min...
