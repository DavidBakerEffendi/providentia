No nonsense, well made, puerko sammich. Ze boo and I split the Italian pulled pork with everything on top (that would be 1. Greens-spinach or broccoli rabe, 2. Peppers-hot or sweet, and 3. Provolone cheese). I love cheese but usually don't get like too much on my sandwiches-the amount they added was just perfect. LOVE. Simple, like your grandma just made it. Line goes by quickly, don't get scared and just be patient!
