I meant to write a review of this place after I came for my birthday dinner in October. My boyfriend and I liked it so much that we came back for our anniversary yesterday! I was afraid that my expectations were set so high after a special night that it wouldn't live up but YO. This place is amazing. Both times we sat at the chef's table - one experience was super chatty and the other was more subdued but it was still great either way to be so close to the action. I'm aspiring to mere competence in the kitchen but these guys really know their way around. The cocktails were inventive and delicious. I have no idea what I was ordering most of the time but it was all flavorful and unique. The Set Sail in particular is perfect for this time of year - it was on the spectrum of Manhattans but more complex and a little sweeter. The first time we ordered cauliflower and lobster toasts, hen of the woods, hamachi, and swordfish. It was too much food for two people but we rallied and pushed through because food. The restaurant knew it was my birthday and brought out a complimentary dessert which was very thoughtful. The second time we tried to be strategic about it and ordered the lobster toast and hen of the woods again as well as the tuna and squid. I should say that although the cauliflower toast was not my favorite, it was still really good and all of this food is superlatively delicious. I want to come here all the damn time.
