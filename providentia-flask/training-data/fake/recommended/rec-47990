Took the family here for brunch on Sunday.  We were warned that there is always a wait, and there was, but not too bad, about 20 minutes (and they accurately told us it would be 20 minutes, unlike many establishments that tell you it will be 20 minutes and you're still waiting 45 minutes later). Service was friendly and good and the crepes were excellent.  We had two savory crepes and split a sweet one for dessert (I had L'Orientale, which was excellent).   Would definitely recommend this place for a nice, easy and not too expensive brunch. The restaurant is very tight though, and there will likely be some wait because it is so small.  Also, as everyone has mentioned, cash only, so be prepared (though they do apparently have an ATM if you forget the cash)
