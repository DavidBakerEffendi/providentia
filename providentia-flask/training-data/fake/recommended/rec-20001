Just average place in my opinion. I went there for dinner and had the fried chicken and cheddar waffles, it wasn't amazing.  I was disappointed because so many ppl rave abt this place. The drinks on the other hand were great although the brunette barmaid could just TRY have a nicer attitude.  I'll go back to try the brunch menu.
