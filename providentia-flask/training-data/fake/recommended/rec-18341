Great food, period.  Walking in doesn't give you a great impression as the tables are fit for Barbie and Ken, not for adults eating lunch...  First time at a Garces restaurant, and as soon as we walked in - taking advantage of a wonderful Fall afternoon, we asked for al fresco seating, which meant we had tables twice the size of the inside tables.  Most lunch guests were eating at counter seats, either facing the bar, or with their faces two inches from a wall.  Sorry, not for me.  The outside seats, on the other hand, are ample and spacious... The service was absolutely impeccable.  Our waiter was a master in the art of being there when we needed something and not being there when he wasn't needed.  Food wise, it was superb.  The duck French Fries are absolutely yummy, if a direct line to the cardiac ward.  And the Hamburger with avocado was out of this world, a full half pound of beef. Other than the unimpressive seating inside of the restaurant, this is a winner.  It would rate higher if the accommodations were in line with the food and service quality.  But for a lunch time rendezvous with great friends, it was absolutely great!
