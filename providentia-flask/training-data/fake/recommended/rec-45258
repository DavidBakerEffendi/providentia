This green line is the worst.  They never have anything in stock - no sandwiches, no iced coffee.  You have to just be willing to eat or drink whatever.  On a recent trip to buy a vegan wrap for breakfast the server told me that the breakfast wraps don't come till after 10:30.  Not an ideal time for breakfast.  Of course, she told me that they just stay for a couple days so they should be in stock the next day.  Then, she corrected me several times for saying breakfast burrito when I meant sweet potato burrito.  Why did it matter so much?  Both were out of stock.
