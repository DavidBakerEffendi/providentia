Been wanting to go here for quite a while, so was expecting great things  Had the signature pork buns, but sorry, my mama ruined it for you.  They were really good - they just didn't blow me away.  I also had the grilled octopus with shaved fennel, which was tasty and paired it all with a nice slightly chilled red wine. Personally, I thought it was a bit expensive for what you got, but the staff is friendly and you can tell they love food.  I heard one of the employees telling a friend about how they made the soy sauce flavored panko crumbs and it was very cool. Looking forward to trying Momofuku Ko some time.
