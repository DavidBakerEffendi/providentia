Avoid if you can (and yes you can, there are other options down the road). I've been to this place twice. Both times it was empty (first sign of a bad restaurant). Both time there was no one in the restaurant either, it took the lady about 3 minutes to come out from the kitchen. Food was disappointing, seems like it was just thrown in a microwave as when I got home some portions were piping hot and other portions of the meat were cold. The second time I went there I went to get a drink. She didn't know the price of the drink and stared at the wall. First it was $2.25 then she just said "Three dollars will do it". I myself have managed businesses and this is concerning. I don't know if the lady is the owner or just an employee, but no care at all. Restaurant itself is lackluster, doesn't give a clean vibe at all. Its not cheap so just AVOID.
