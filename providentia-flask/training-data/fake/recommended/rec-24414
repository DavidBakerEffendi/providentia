This is the REAL deal...I am a native NYer in my 40s - I have had my share of Indian food.  I was engaged to an Indian guy once, I know Indian food.  I am usually very hesitant to order out from unknown places - Benares is AMAZING.  I have gotten four meals out of what I ordered:  Saffron Rice with Peas, Paneer Makhani, Chicken Tikka Masala and the Seekh Kabob....AMAZING not GREASY and substantial white meat chicken TIkka.  LOVE this place.  Don't hesitate.
