Definitely one of the best options on Seamless Web for Thai food - got the duck pad see you and the beef green apple salad for delivery.  Both delivered for under $30, and more than enough to feed one person (probably could feed 2 people if you shared). Duck pad see you had many slices of Chinese roast duck, with the skin on.  The beef green apple salad has flank steak grilled and sliced (generous portions), with apple, onions, and lettuce with a vinagarette type dressing.  Light and tasty.
