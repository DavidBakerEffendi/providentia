My husband and I went to Umi this past Saturday afternoon with high expectations. I've been looking forward to the opening of Umi since I first heard that it was in the making. On this Saturday afternoon, at around 4ish, the restaurant was by no means packed but there were several Â booths of people. To make a long story short, the belt was almost completely empty (save for the weird mayo covered rolls and cold chicken teriyaki that no one touched) the entire time we were there. What we did get to try, was just about what you'd expect from food sitting around for an hour or two. We also only got one round of drinks (we each had an Umi Mojito that, save for the fact that mine had a dead fruit fly in it, were delicious) as our waitress disappeared (which seemed like the norm for all the wait staff and the chef in the center of the belt). For the money that we spent, I would have rather gone to any of the other wonderful sushi places in the area. At least we would have left full and satisfied and not reeling from the utter disappointment.
