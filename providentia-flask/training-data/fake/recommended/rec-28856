My family and I went here for brunch for my younger brother's birthday. If you don't like sweets, the food isn't that great. My family are a bit of food snobs, but it IS centered around chocolate. I got the Cinnamon Apple & White Chocolate Cream French Toast and my meal was delicious...very sweet! The place was pretty crammed--but it was also a Sunday afternoon. The hot chocolate was awesome, but my stepmom ordered a Bloody Mary and thought it was awful. All in all--stick to the sweets and you'll enjoy your experience more.
