So they just started taking same day telephone reservations at 3pm. I called on the first day they started to do this and was given an option of 8:45 pm or 9:15 pm for a party of three. I opted for the earlier reservation and arrived around 8:20pm. If you are late by 10 minutes then you loose your reservation. It was my first time trying mu ramen and I wanted to see what the hype was about. As we arrived we sat down on the benches around the front. There was a large communal table with seating for 22 in the middle. The waitress said we were too early and would be seated in about 20-25 minutes which would have been our reservation time. Well, that time passed and we watched couples and groups sit down before our eyes. It was a bit frustrating because a couple just walked in without any reservation and was given seats. The waitresses could have put an extra stool and my friends and I would have been fine to sit there. It was about 9pm, 15 minutes after our reservation and the waitress apologized and quoted us 5 more minutes. We sat about 9:15-9:20 pm, aka despite having a phone reservation we still had to wait. And that day it was really poor weather. Finally we were seated and ordered the u&i and okonomiyaki for appetizers. The uni in the u&i tasted a bit fishy and was not as fresh. We all loved the okonomiyaki which was a bite of hot and cold; hot being the scallion pancake on the bottom and cold being the smoked trout. We all ordered the tonkotsu 2.0 which was the best dish of the night. The broth was super tasty and rich. But it was loaded with a ton of salt. The waitress refilled my glass a couple of times. As of right now they don't have a liquor license so they don't offer any wine or beer options. It was a perfect bowl of ramen on a rainy day but the wait isn't worth it. Either come early for dinner or super late when they are about to close.
