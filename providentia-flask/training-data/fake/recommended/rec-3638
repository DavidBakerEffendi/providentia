What hits you upon entering Bonjour Montclair is a sumptuous and heady aroma of chocolate and fresh fruit, cheeses and enough other things to get you salivating like Pavlov's dog. The atmosphere inside is close with the heat and sounds of cooking and other patrons. Outside seating provides a pleasant, relaxed setting when the weather favors. Where this crepe hit the fan, however, is when it comes to consistency of the service. Over a dozen visits, it is still unclear to me whether to order from the counter or wait to be helped -- funny enough it seems to be the same person doing both jobs. Additionally, upon my last Bonjour experience, I waited close to 40 minutes for my food and ultimately had to approach the counter to remind them of my existence and potentially (ineffectually) speed the process. Another point of contention is that despite being a sit-down restaurant with breakfasts upwards of $9 and often significantly more, you are still served your meal on a styrofoam plate. Now, there is something cool and casual about this that I might really dig under different circumstances. But at the same time I don't want to worry about leaking nutella all over the place when I should be enjoying it. Really, the food is worth it in the end, but I think next time I'll do takeout.
