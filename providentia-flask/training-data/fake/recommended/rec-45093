I go to brunch pretty much every sunday with friends and I was a little disappointed in last Sunday's choice, even though it was mine!  We went to Diner in W'burg, where I have been many times and after waiting for nearly an hour, we where asked if we could sit outside as the tables where already set up - why not ask us that straight away instead of making us wait??  They had changed  the menu and reduced it to 6 things with 4 or 5 specials - overall 3 items were chocolate and one was donuts!  If I wanted bloody donuts I would go to Dunkin's.....they also didn't have their steak and eggs which was a huge disappointment and I was still so hungry after the meal that my friend had to give me a power bar!  Kinda sad.....not sure if I want to go back again even though it was my standby if I wanted a local brunch....
