An early dinner found this place empty.  Read the reviews, figured we try it.  WOW.  Wine list broad and interesting, more reasonable than most and all price ranges.  Dining choices equally broad and interesting, but the best part was actually eating!  Great flavors on the appetizers, especially the polenta/cheese/truffle combo.  We found service perfectly lovely.  Would absolutely return.
