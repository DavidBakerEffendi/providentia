I had never head of this place and it's now one of my favorite restaurants in Manhattan! It's off the beaten path but is well worth the visit. The setting is lovely overlooking the East River with upscale, modern nature-themed decor inside as well as comfortable seating outside (please ignore the FDR noise). There is even an outdoor area for larger groups. The food was fantastic with the prefect combination of flavors (the fluke carpaccio and branzino were amazing) and the freshest of herbs and vegetables from their on-site garden (you pass it on the way in). The service was also excellent - very knowledgeable and attentive. I even loved my cocktail! I feel as if I should write a thank you note for the evening as I was so surprised and impressed! Why haven't I heard of this place before now?!
