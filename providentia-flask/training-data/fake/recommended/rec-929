This place is awesome. When it comes to pizza, this is my #1 place to go. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is because the parking can be a pain in the ass at times. There's limited street parking and your only other options are to park at the bank across the street or park in a parking lot about a block away. To add to that, the pizzareia is a little on the small side and it gets packed! When it's crowded, which is often, ordering can be a hassle and so can finding a COMFORTABLE place to eat... Aside from that, I gotta agree with everyone else, their pizza is the best in the area. They also have the largest selection of gourmet pizza. I haven't tried anything other than the pizza, but that's mostly because every time I go there, I see a new kind of pizza that I never saw before. Smh... So with that said, I'm dying to try their other food and when I do, I'm sure it'll be nothing short of amazing.
