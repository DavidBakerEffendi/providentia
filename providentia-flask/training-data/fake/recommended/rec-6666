I have walked by this place a few times and been intrigued.  i love the location, tucked under a brownstone in a residential block.  (by the way, its between 4th and 5th ave on Union, not 3rd and 4th). my omelet was great, and the papusas were very good.  I was disappointed in my side of bacon, and I speak as a  committed and knowledgeable baconista.  the avocado soup tastes like well-spiced liquid guacamole, if you're into that.   nice atmosphere.  I'd love to come back and try the tasting menu.
