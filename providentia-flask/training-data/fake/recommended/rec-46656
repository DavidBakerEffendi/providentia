This was my absolute favorite eatery during my 4 years in Philadelphia!  Excellent location, near Rittenhouse Square and Market Street.  Excellent prices and menu.  My favorite sandwich was the eggplant sandwich!  They also provided awesome carrots as an option for your side.  Although I ordinarily love meat and consider myself a carnivore, I would literally eat at Mama's every day if I could.  Great place to go to pick up a quick meal, to drop in for lunch or dinner, or for a casual date.  Highly recommended!
