This is not the Tom's Diner who's iconic facade was used in the NBC t.v. series "Seinfeld," nor the subject of Suzanne Vega's eponymous hit single "Tom's Diner" (which refers to the same establishment featured in "Seinfeld"). This is a good ol' fashioned neighborhood staple in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. The long lines of convivial Brooklynites all too happy to wait for a table at this gem and the establishment's congenial response to such popularity, serving pro bono coffee to those waiting, tell the story of everything from the food to the spirit of this place. Standard breakfast items are made to perfection with all fresh ingredients and, though quite busy, the kitchen and waitstaff animate at hyper speed in a splendid choreography that bring you your orders in a timely manner.
