Better than Chipotle! The salsa is so flavorful! I ordered the 4 crispy tacos and got one chicken, one steak, one beef, one pork. They were all so good. Wish they had this place in NY! The only thing they can improve upon is placing the meat, salsa, cheese, and lettuce on the tacos. It's a bit messy. In terms of taste it's really good! Makes chipotle taste like a Taco Bell!
