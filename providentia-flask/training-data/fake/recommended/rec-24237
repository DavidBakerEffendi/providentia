We went here last night and thought it was some of the best sushi I have had in the city. The prices were on par with what I expected to pay. Its a small restaurant and we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table for our party of four. Â But we did sit at the bar and opened our wine to enjoy while waiting. I am already planning a visit back.
