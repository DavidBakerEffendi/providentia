The food, service and decor is all outstanding. Service - When we arrived, we were immediately greeted by the hostess, Marti, who acknowledged our reservation, sat us, and asked periodically, throughout the meal, if we needed anything else. Our server, Joel, was equally on target. The menu was clearly described. Questions were answered quickly and accurately. The sequencing of the food was excellent. Food -The food was a nice surprise. The Strand Bistro is well priced and is definitely "FIT FOR FOODIES." We had pan seared scallops, a lobster risotto (generous amount of lobster), a cauliflower truffle soup that was "to die for." Cocktails -The margaritas were incredibly well made..lots of fresh lime. Try it..you'll love it!  Quality Tequilla Decor - Very nice and comfortable.  While the restaurant is in a hotel lobby, the walls are lined with books and there is a fireplace in the center. Try it...you'll love it.
