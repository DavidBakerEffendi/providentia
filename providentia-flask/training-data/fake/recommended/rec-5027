The service was great. Our glasses never stayed emptied and the staff was very attentive. I am from a Caribbean background so I am used to my food being highly seasoned. This is my second time here and this time I didn't allow my discriminating Caribbean pallet get in the way and dropped all predisposed judgement. I had the chicken with yellow rice and black beans, salad, tortilla soup and salad ( I was hungry) The food is consistent in that although mildly seasoned, the garnish and sides of lemon and different sauce allowed for a flavorful and authentic Mexican cuisine experience. I would come back.
