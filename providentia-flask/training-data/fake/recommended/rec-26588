AMAZING SUSHI!!! Specially for that area, where is not that many choice for sushi. A lot of options, fresh fish, and creative menu, they always have specials going on, the place is super clean, it's BYOB, which makes your check not that high, and on the side of the restaurant is a licquor store of a very nice Spanish Senor who owns a dog named Khalua (super cute by the way :) The owners are always there and they're super sweet! The service could improve a little, but it's worth it for the food, never tried the chinese option though... But the sushi it's excelent!
