Went here last night for the first time after being made aware by a friend that I had missed the best falafel spot in the city. I went in having my reservations, as I have lived in town for years and felt I was fluent in what the city had to offer. How could I have missed this gem for so long?   We both got standard falafel with hot sauce and it was one of the best I have eaten. Reasonably priced and filled you up completely. The sandwich was so big my friend couldn't even finish theirs.  No need to order anything else, although the complementary pickle bar was definitely worth tasting. The staff was so nice and accommodating. We got here at 845, when they were about to close, sat outside and they told us to sit, relax, and enjoy. They were not in any rush and insisted we should not be either. Will definitely be back soon for more.
