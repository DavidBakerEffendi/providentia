PIG WINGS!  Magical meat popsicles!  Get some! It took me a while to get back to El Camino Real, but I have become a fan.  The chronic is everything that I need in life on one plate.  The jalapeno grits will cure what ails you the morning after.  The french toast listed on the menu is a lie; it's regular old french toast.  Good, but a let down after reading their magical description.  Mac and cheese is still rad.  I enjoy most of the barbecue and the gringo burritos, but still maintain that their traditional burritos are, well, disappointing.   I have yet had anyway disagree on that point.
