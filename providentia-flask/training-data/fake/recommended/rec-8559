This is my favorite place to see live music in Philadelphia. Sure, the sound may be lacking and may occasionally sound muffled and just plain jacked up. But you couldn't ask for a better, more intimate atmosphere to see some of your favorite bands in. I went to the Wire show last night and I wouldn't have chosen to see that band any other way. It was true perfection. Before the show, my fiance and I grabbed dinner downstairs and I will dream about the eggplant sandwich that I ordered until we meet again. Also, our waitress, a petite girl with short-shorts that take a large amount of self-esteem and don't-give-a-crap-about what-other-people-think attitude was very friendly and as quick as lightning. I will go back to Johnny Brenda's time and time again, regardless of the sometimes-lackluster acoustics.
