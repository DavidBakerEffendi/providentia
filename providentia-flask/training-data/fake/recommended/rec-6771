I had a yummy Italian sandwich at M&Ms. Philly is the city of hoagies and cheesesteaks, but Matt & Maries definitively shift the scene with their delicious Italian sandwiches. I had a eggplant mozza chicken combo and it was delicious. I also appreciated the free treat (it was Halloween week). The atmosphere was chill with not too loud music and warming colors. Finally, being greeted with a large smile is always a plus. Will definitively come back for more!
