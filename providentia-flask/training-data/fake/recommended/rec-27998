great panini's, a few good vegetarian options that can easily be made vegan (or daily free). Lots of delicious and innovative brunch paninis too. Gorgeous backyard patio you can eat in spring/summer. The coffee is delicious. Organic and fair trade. They even sell it by the bag so you can use their grounds at home. Love!
