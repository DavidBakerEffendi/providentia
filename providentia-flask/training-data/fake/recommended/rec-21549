My high school friends are mostly fire fighters, EMT's and paramedics which basically means that I've gotten stuck at the fire station when they've gotten a call. I wish that their fire station had a restaurant next door! Hook and Ladder is head to toe fire fighter themed. There is a ton of memorabilia. First received warm, sweet corn bread. My friend and I both had the BBQ burger. It was decent burger. The waitress came by at least 5 times to check if we were okay which was a little too thorough but better than nothing. The best part was that it was really affordable.
