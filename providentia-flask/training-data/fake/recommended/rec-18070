I don't really want to like it here, but I still do. It is an incredibly weird mix of people -- suburban visitors, babies dressed in gingham ties, occasional hipsters, people who write "COCK" on jenga blocks, 50 year old professorial types out w the professorial bros -- I just can't figure it out and I think it's better the less I think about it. I am not really into the Stephen Starr restaurant industrial complex and try to avoid his reach, but I went here a few times last year for Nerd Nite and (ugh why!) I like it a lot. I like that you can play Jenga at your table, I like the beer prices during happy hour, I like the giant pretzels and the weird condiments they come with, I like sitting outside in the summer, I like that it fits a lot of people, I like the gravel in the biergarten, I like the system they have for ordering food, I like the beer selection. I will continue to reluctantly really like Frankford Hall.
