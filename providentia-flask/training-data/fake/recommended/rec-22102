Went here with a group of 8 for a birthday party. Through the reservation process our host was incredibly patient and accommodating, and very helpful with menu planning. We shared a family style 9 course meal that was absolutely stunning. We left happy, bellies full, and a bit drunk. The meal would have been a steal if we didn't keep ordering bottles of wine. Â Everything was tasty. The best part was that even the courses that don't seem like a big deal were executed with a care and creativity that made them surprising and special. the meal: Caponata Crostino Grilled Cauliflower Arancini Creamy Polenta Broccoli Rabe Meatballs Housemade Cavatelli Roasted Organic Chicken Housemade Tiramisu Some notable quotes from our guests: "This place beats traif" "Tiramisu delivered the knock-out punch" (somebody really said this) "Is it overboard if take my date here tomorrow?" "This service is incredible" "How many bottles of wine have we ordered?" "That Old Fashioned is legit"
