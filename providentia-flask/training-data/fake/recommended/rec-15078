A lovely cafe serving fresh plant-based food. Located ten minutes from the airport this nice little spot will satisfy diners with a variety of dietary preferences. This place was a win all-around. We split the Vermonter "Gouda" sandwich and the Broccoli Buffalo Bites. Flavors were Balanced well and everything was seasoned appropriately. Thank you for that. The staff was knowledgeable, welcoming and hospitable. The food arrived in a reasonable amount of time and we were satisfied with the portions. We will definitely be back before we leave town. Â Next time your in Burlington check this place out.
