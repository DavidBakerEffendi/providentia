I had the great pleasure of attending a publisher's dinner here, and had a truly delightful time.  The decor was charming.  The beet salad simple, but delicious.  The seared tuna was absolutely fabulous...even my friends who do not like fish or sushi admitted it was tasty.  And the little tiny desert cups were to die for.  The wait staff were attentive and friendly.  An excellent place for a group outing!
