I work a few blocks away and have been craving a fresh nutritious lunch option, and I'm happy to have found Zen. The $6.00 lunch special is both reasonably priced and a generous portion size: 1 entree with choice of brown/white rice and choice of Soup/Spring Roll. The girl behind the counter recommended the mango chicken, which was really good. The table sitting down to lunch had a lot of fresh vegetable and salad dishes, which I look forward to trying. Also, I'm someone who enjoys a freshly made juice. I had a carrot & apple juice that was made while I waited, and was delicious. For those of you who don't enjoy the carrot variety, they have about 20 different combinations to choose from. Really happy that I stumbled onto this spot. Food seems to be fresh and nutritious, and not overdone with sauce like so many Chinese places in the area. I think this could be a viable lunch choice perhaps 2 or 3 times a week if you're willing to try different items and mix a salad in now and then.
