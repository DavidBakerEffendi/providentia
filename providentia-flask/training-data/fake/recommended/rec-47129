I had both the most expensive and the worst spinach salad in my life at Brigid Foy's.   The worst. Please note that when I say worst, I am  including the one that my old boyfriends mother made for dinner one sad day. She didn't know to wash the sand out of the spinach and it was a tooth crushing salad of sand. I ate her salad out of politeness, whereas I was able to just fully reject the foible of Foy's. Some day, if your lucky, I'll tell you about his mothers recipe for hamburger soup (main ingredient - ketchup). Blech.
