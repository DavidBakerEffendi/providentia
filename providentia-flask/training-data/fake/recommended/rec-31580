This place gets real busy which causes a lot of confusion with the hostess. Despite the initial crowd (sometimes) the eating experience is very enjoyable. Because they have hibachi and a sushi bar it is above par. Being the food guru that I am I could tell the ingredients they used for hibachi weren't the freshest, but it was still good. Give this place a try and see for yourself. I believe it's hit or miss.
