Amazing! I've always passed this place on a walk through Rittenhouse and finally made a date night out of it with my girlfriend. We were seated inside - it was a little nippy outside but they do have heat lamps. Everything was amazing from the drinks (not the strongest in the world) to the appetizers (charcuterie is a great pick) to the entrees (we had the rabbit and roasted chicken). Honestly the best part of the meal was the amazing decor and OUTSTANDING SERVICE. We had Deborah (except said in a French way) and she was so nice. Expensive but a 5 star restaurant, most definitely.
