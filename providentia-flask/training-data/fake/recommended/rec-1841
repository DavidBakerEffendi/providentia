If I *had* to choose between the two rival cheesesteak places, then Pat's would win the battle. The cheesesteak is good and I felt more comfortable eating there than at Geno's. From what I observed the other night, when I made my first trip to either one, I noticed that Pat's was jam packed versus Geno's and I can see why. Great people, chopped up steak and way more relaxed.
