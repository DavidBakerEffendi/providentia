I visited this location around March earlier this year and was super excited to finally be able to come here so I could try their infamous roast pork sandwich. They are located in the center back of the Reading Terminal. Be prepared for a wait because it's long. When we went, the line wrapped around the stall twice! The only seating is (if you're lucky enough to grab one) on a stool alongside the counters. I was told to order the roast pork sandwich with sharp provolone and broccoli rabe. OMG, so de-lish! I tend to not to eat roast pork sandwiches, but this sandwich.. So tender and juicy! Absolutely blew me away. If you're in the area, you GOTTA try! Way better than the Philly cheese-steaks in my opinion!
