i've always been a big fan of this place and i'd describe my visits as frequent, and consistently awesome. they really know what their doing and stick to austrian classics: schnitzel, gulasch, spaetzle, sausage, beer (the staff's cool about explaining dishes/words/beers you don't know) and they knock each one out of the park. like, they have really good beer. and cocktails. as for some reviewers' complaints about screaming kids, it's not like they hired them to be there because they thought it would improve the ambience. this is a park slope prob, blame the parents, not the restaurants. Â  anyways, a+ in my book
