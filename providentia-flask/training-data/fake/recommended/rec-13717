I've been living in the neighborhood for many years and wasn't able to try this place out because of the ridiculous weekend crowds. I finally remembered to check it out during the week when I had a day off and it definitely lived up to its reputation. The menu has a great mix of sweet and savory options for brunch from pancakes to every kind of egg dish imaginable.  I had the potato pancakes, friend green tomatoes and the Spanish chorizo omelet.  The tomatoes were friend to perfections with just the right amount of seasoning in the breading. The potato pancakes were light and flavorful and the addition of smoked salmon and a hard-boiled egg on top was perfection.  The omelet seemed to be one of the weaker choices on the menu. It had too much cheese for my liking and nothing that made it stand it out from the rest. Ps. don't miss the fresh orange juice or raspberry lemonade: so yum! So refreshing!
