This was a surprise stop in our journey to SoHo. I am glad we did ! First let's get my negative portion out of the way - I would rate our server 1 star!!! I didn't get his name but he was bald . He was rather a disappointment to the establishment ! Would it kill him to at least fake a smile?? He really gave off an " I don't give a shit about what you want , and I don't want to be here" vibe. Thank goodness the food was to die for !!! We had the goat cheese salad - Amazing! It was flavorful , but not to much dressing,lightly tossed in a delicious vinegarette. Then I had this pasta with tiger prawns , asparagus , and spiced with Andouille sausage , danced on my tonge! If the food had not been so delish , this place would have sucked based on that disappointing service.
