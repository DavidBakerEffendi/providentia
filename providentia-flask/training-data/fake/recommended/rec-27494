I'm writing this review in response to the recent attacks on Iris Cafe's no laptop/iPad policy. I'm a writer, so I appreciate cafes that let me spend hours writing there, but I think it's pretty entitled to believe that you deserve this privilege.  First of all, it's a private business, they don't owe you anything.  If you don't want to go back, go online at Starbucks.   Secondly, anyone that's ever run a restaurant or cafe knows that survival depends on turning over tables.  How many writers you know constantly make substantial purchases to warrant their time there? I think this is bringing into focus a lot of cafe owner's business plans, and many are dealing with this dilemma in creative ways: nytimes.com/2010/08/25/d… eastvillage.thelocal.nyt… So if a cafe wants to offer wifi and laptops, great.  But if they don't, I don't believe we should knock their stars down for it.  What the Iris Cafe should do is offer wifi and laptops during certain non-peak hours.  I was just there between 8:30 - 10 this morning (a Tuesday) and it was packed, definitely not the time for laptops.  But if you're there at 3p and there's nobody around, then yeah, they should relax a little. Bottom line: this is a FANTASTIC cafe--a neighborhood secret, great Stumptown coffee, cute (great tin ceiling), good food, communal feel.
