I sorta feel bad for PYT as (you can tell by its reviews) it gets a bit of a unfair rep for its location and clientele. But I gotta keep it 100....I'd be wayyyy more likely to go back if the location and clientele were different. I don't like the piazza. i (generally) don't like the people who inhabit it. basically, i don't like anything northern liberties stands for these days. I cringed as i walked past all the scarves, dirty skinny jeans (that probably cost what i pay for a month's rent) and american spirit's to PYT. It's nice enough, but I had to give the staff an immediate side-eye. I won't spend time discussing their attire (because we all have our guuuurl, no! outfits), but I just felt like the wait staff/host staff were dressed like patrons, and as a result, hard to identify unless you dine there often. That's just one piece of the "locals only" vibe that really turned me off. Â  I had the Mac & Cheese burger and it was delicious! Imagine my disappointment when I realized it was the "burger of the week" and not part of the regular menu. The regular menu is relatively dull (seems like all the creative juices were wasted on names and not the burgers themselves) and fairly limited. Oh, and onions & pickles cost an extra dollar each ! In my "ocho cinco" voice...CHILE PLEASE. Insane. My friend got an "adult shake" which may be appealing if you enjoy thick and frothy alcoholic beverages...I don't. The food is good, but not good enough for me to inhale the "air o' hipster douche" for 2 hours at a return visit.
