Food and service were pretty good here. We have not tried burgers or steak, but pirogis and duck spatzle were good, although pirogis were not exactly what we expected. The portion sizes are not very big, so order appetizers. Overall I would not rate this place 4 stars if Â it didn't have a great selection of Czech beer and eastern european hard liquor. This is the first place I found in NYC that has Staropramen on tap. Add to that jazz on Tuesdays and you get a really good motivation to try Korzo at least once.
