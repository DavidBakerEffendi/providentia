Decided to come here for my birthday dinner with 8 girlfriends last month before a night out. Walking in, the place was dim with candlelight making it quite intimate (perfect for a first date if you ask me!). We were seated on a long table against the wall which would probably be big enough for maybe 1 or 2 more people. They are very accommodating! I had read the reviews and BYOB is your best option (we did approx 1 bottle per person). I believe they wave the corkage fee after a certain price point is met per person (first bottle is free). Started off with a bunch of appetizers split amongst us. The BBQ Squid and Rainbow Layer (ceviche) were my favorite, fresh and tasty-NOT smothered in sauce. We ordered around 4-5 appetizers amongst 8 people (the portions are quite small) and the waiter gave us 3 free bowls of edamame! For my entree, I ordered two special rolls (Fiery and Samurai) and a classic roll (salmon avocado). My friend kept saying she read the rolls are really small, BUT THAT WAS NOT THE CASE! Anything on the special rolls section is quite big, so I would suggest just ordering one to fill you up and maybe a classic roll/sashimi if you're super hungry. Rolls were pretty darn good, not too much rice and unique in its own way. Fish was fresh and sushi rice was not too vinegar-y. Mid dinner, after a few bottles of wine, I did notice something awesome about this place music wise. They play old school hip hop!!! In my slightly buzzed state, mid girl chat, I felt my head bobbing to Tupac and Biggie (haha). Totally unexpected, but made my dinner so much better. Our waitress and waiter were attentive and would help us refill our glasses whenever they were almost empty. GREAT SERVICE! I would love to come back and try their happy hour!
