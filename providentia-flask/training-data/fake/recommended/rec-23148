Second-best after Nomad pizza in Hopewell, but this one is right near where I work, so it's always slices for lunch. I particularly enjoy their delicious sausage, although sometimes they do put a bit too much sauce on for my liking. Takeout only, unless you sit at one of the two stools at the little counter in the window. (tip: you can take food over and sit outside Blue Point Grill a few doors away (at LUNCH time only) although I have heard they have recently begun enforcing a "please only eat food from Nassau Seafood here at the tables" rule).
