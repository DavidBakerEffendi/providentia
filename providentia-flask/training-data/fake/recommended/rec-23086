Have you ever been to a diner where the servers wear white shirts and neckties?  I have, and it's called Americana Diner.  But don't worry, they welcome a casual dressed crowd, no problem.   We started off with the Small Plate Sampler: Lamb Kofte (best I've had outside of Turkey), Fried Mozzarella (nicely breaded, chewy, not crunchy), Cajun Calamari and Smoked Salmon Rolls.   For a main dish there was the Roasted Littleneck Clams and the Open Faced Steak Sandwich.  Sauce on the clams was very good, but a bit heavy on the pepper flakes (caused a sneezing fit).  Steak Sandwich was a little dry, but served with VERY flavorful roasted tomatoes. Our server was very fast and on the spot with our drinks, order and check at the end. We are very lucky to have this diner next door to us.  But it is well worth a journey from almost anywhere.
