Father/Son outing with 9 at a big table. Of course most of us got steaks. Appetizers started out pretty good with typical artichoke/spinach dip, calamari (a bit tough) and grilled shrimp (a bit overdone). My steak was tasty but cooked to the next higher doneness. My son's ribs were tasty, but not fall off the bone tender like you might find at a smokehouse.
