I ended up at Yuca Bar last Friday.  My brother had been there once before and raved about it.  We got the "Carnitas Plate for 2"...  It was out of this world...  Six different types of meats and all sorts of sides.  The meats included two types of sausage, brisket, steak, chicken, and fish.  All was served on top of sauteed onions and a savory sauce.  I would highly recommend this place and plan to go back the next time I'm in the city...  Note on the Full Bar, no frozen drinks...  Oh yeah, and somehow, we got right in on a Friday night...
