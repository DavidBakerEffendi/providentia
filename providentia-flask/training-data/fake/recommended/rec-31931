I lived in Bogotá, Colombia so hopefully this review is helpful as I can compare with real Colombian food. We liked Bogota Bistro.  We went on a Sunday afternoon and had the ajiaco, empanadas, arroz con pollo and fruit juices - 1.  The blackberry and lulo juices are fantastic, a tad on the sweet side. 2.  The ajiaco was as good as the best I've had in Colombia.  Amazing flavor. 3.  The arroz con pollo was also delicious, and came with moist plaintains, frijoles, red cabbage (repollo) and avocado.  Definitely a signature dish for them. 4.  The empanadas were fantastic, particularly the goat cheese empanada (have it with the sour cream salsa). The only thing I found slightly annoying is that it appears the restaurant is trying to sell their salsas separately.  So when we ordered a little extra aji salsa for our dishes we were charged $1 extra.  Unwarranted (and highly unusual for any Colombian restaurant or American restaurant) in my opinion. Otherwise, the ambiance is great (Botero paintings on the wall, maps of Colombia, etc.), great Latin music (Fonseca, etc.), cheerful staff (we seemed to get the one gringo waitress convinced she had to speak with us in Spanish... :), the food was fantastic (although I would add the proper Colombian restaurants in Astoria, and Jackson Heights have equally delicious food (La Fonda Antioqueña, Natives).  As does El Tequilazo in midtown Manhattan).  We'd definitely go back. I hope this review is helpful.
