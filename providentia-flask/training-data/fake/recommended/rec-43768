I'm not sure I need to review this place after Anthony Bordain, but what the hell. I love no frills izakayas and Hagi is definitely in that category. When you get there, go downstairs and write your name on the list. Get comfortable at a bar, maybe the russian vodka place, while you wait to be called. Â As for Hagi itself, I'd suggest demon slayer sake and grilled squid and maybe a pancake. Enjoy!
