It is easy to miss this joint as you walk past the 9th avenue. But once you get in you will be welcome by the tantalizing asian food food fragrance. Â The place is not fancy but the food is great!! We ordered some veg dumplings and spring rolls along with beef soup noodles and wok stir-fried vegetarian noodles and it was OMG Good!!
