Literally a family-style restaurant. Portions were HUGE and tasty, and I'm so glad my cousins A and K brought me here. Even though we were 5 people, we couldn't finish 2 dishes. You get that intimacy for your party even though it's a spacious restaurant. I would definitely come here again with a ton of hungry friends.
