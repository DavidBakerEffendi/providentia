One of the BEST places to get affordable korean food on the go, I can't tell you how many times I've been here to grab a quick lunch and run back to the office. They have a buffet table that gives you a wide range of fresh korean food that is priced based on weight, it would probably cost you about $8-10 on average. I usually go for the other korean dishes already prepared and boxed in containers toward the back right side. Food changes everyday, but there are usually familiar items like the kimchi fried rice for about $3, some fried chicken for $5.50, scallion pancakes, rice cake, noodles, sushi, etc. This is also a great place for those who drink around ktown at night, and have some crazy food cravings after! I would definitely come here day or night to pick up something yummy and warm that's both filling and cheap! FYI they have a stamp card, so when you collect 20 stamps worth $5 each, you get something! I haven't reached it yet, so not sure what I get.... :D
