We were looking for a Sunday brunch destination when we happened upon Box 63. We had never been here and we figured we would give it a chance. From the moment we entered we were enthralled. We were sat on the patio.The staff was very friendly and the service prompt. Our server Samantha made the entire experience worthwhile. The food was excellent and moderately priced. The beer selection was vast and the unending mimosas kept us well entertained. Would definitely go here again.
