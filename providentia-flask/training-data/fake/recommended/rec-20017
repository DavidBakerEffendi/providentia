My brother and I stopped by Vonda's Kitchen for Breakfast on a Sunday morning.  It was a pleasant surprise for us both.  I had the catfish and grits with a side of scrambled eggs.  My brother had grits with beef bacon and beef sausage and eggs.  They have a great choice of teas.  It was a great breakfast and the wait staff as well as the manager were extremely helpful and gracious.  They have a simple menu and it looks like everything on the menu is done well.  It was early morning so there wasn't a large crowd but the restaurant had a brisk business.   If you're in Newark looking for breakfast - this is the place!
