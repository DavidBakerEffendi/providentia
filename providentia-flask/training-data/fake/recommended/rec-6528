My friend and I stumbled upon Ruby's while walking aimlessly around Soho in search of a lunch destination.  Most of the tables were full at this adorable cafe, but we were lured inside by the large windows and jovial time happening within.  We were lucky to grab one of the large tables overlooking the street and settled in to review the menu, which consisted of standard lunch options with a gourmet flare. We placed our order and glanced at a mounted Ruby's review on a neighboring wall.  Apparently this cute, trendy bistro was centered around Australian culinary flavors - not something you often come across in Manhattan.  The framed write-up was extremely positive, so we looked forward to digging into our meals. My crispy panini was stuffed with Italian tuna and fresh tomato.  A creamy slathering of goat cheese replaced the mayonnaise that usually accompanies a tuna sandwich.  The fish was also elegantly sweetened with a lime dressing.  This interesting combination actually worked well together, providing a mix of tang and smokiness.   The baguette encompassing the fresh ingredients was hearty and crunchy.   The sandwich was also served with a side salad of mixed greens in a sweet balsamic vinaigrette. My companion's Chicken Avocado Salad was also sublime.  The hefty bowl of field greens was topped with a herb grilled chicken breast, avocado chunks, and hard-boiled egg slices.  The chicken had been pounded thin and was served warm.  The meat was perfectly cooked and tender.  The same balsamic dressing had been poured on top of these savory greens. While both dishes came in large portions, they possessed a fresh and light quality to them.  We were able to finish our meals and leave satisfied, not stuffed.   Ruby's casual atmosphere and clean, simple cooking style make it a fantastic lunch destination.  It is a great place to share an intimate conversation, watch the trendsetters shop around Soho, or just enjoy a leisurely meal.
