Good Pho. Great price. The menu seemed to be just one item, differing by the day of the week. I have no complaints, as the Pho was excellent. The beef strips were tender, large and plentiful. The portion, as is expected with a good Pho, was massive. I was impressed they even included a good amount of the basil, sprouts, lime and sauce with my to-go order. It was FAST (this is the upside of serving just one item, I suppose) but the spring roll suffered from pre-preparation (is that a thing?) as the lettuce was a little old, the rice dry and the shrimp on the rubbery side.
