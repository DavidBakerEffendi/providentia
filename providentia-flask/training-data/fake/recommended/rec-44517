Came here to meet up with an old high school friend to catch up on life over tea and desserts. There's a nice ambiance here, it's dark and sophisticated. We ordered the sampler with 6 little dishes, and the dessert sampler with 5 or so different things on it. The Black Sesame Crème Brûlée is something that I remembered, it's been a few months since I've visited this place. Very nice, and chill spot to visit. Btw it's a cash only place.
