In shock that this place was rated THIS YEAR as the #2 top restaurant by zagat and that its so highly rated on yelp. Perhaps lunch vs. dinner is entirely different? The 3 of us had the lunch tasting menu which is a "steal" vs. ordering off the regular a la carte menu. The service was awful. Not only were the guys all chit chatting on the side and making jokes the entire meal, but this took away from the service. We had to ask over a handful of times for water refills - maybe they should have been focusing on that instead? Despite one person in our party still enjoying the 4th course they pushed dessert on our table and wedged it behind her. As she reacted in a surprised manner he explained "well the ice cream is going to melt!"  Really? You didn't wait until we were done with the course before pushing out the final? So yes service was pretty shockingly bad for a place that's suppose to be top notch for New York. We wondered if this was the training staff only but doubt it. And even if it were the captain was also joining in on the jokes and unprofessional demeanor. The food was also NOT impressive.. The flavors just didn't jive for me from the chlorophyll soup to the porcini flan and pear dessert it just wasn't quite right. The duck main and strawberry and almond ice cream "pre-dessert" were the only enjoyable dishes   For me.
