One of my favorite places!  Okay their entrees from Lomo Saltado to Half Rotisserie are so good!  Al Pastor was the best version I had ever had, even comparing to California joints.  Maybe its because it doesn't have all the other stuff and is literally a pork gyro. Lamb tacos mouthwatering!  Cactus taco...Not my cup of tea but was good!  And they got purple corn drink!  Note: Mostly soft tacos.  Not really a place for crunchy.
