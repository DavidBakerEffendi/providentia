It should be said that you should only go here if you are prepared to deal with lots of people and a lot of waiting.  That said, it provides some great people watching, excellent food, and great service (once you actually get seated). There was actually a guest list just to sit at the bar, where we ate and had drinks.  The food was delicious (priciest burger I've ever had!) and the cocktails are fresh and fun.
