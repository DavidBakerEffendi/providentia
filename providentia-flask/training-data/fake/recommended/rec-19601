There was much "hype" before Chips opened in Wethersfield.  I was excited waiting for it to open. SO as soon as it opened, I was there for Breakfast. I ordered my usual, an egg white cheese omelet but with three speciality pancake (an additional $3.20) instead of potatoes and toast,  The omelet seemed small and the pancakes were good, but not great. And the price was a couple dollars more than what I usually  pay. So I thought the next time I go to CHIPS for an omelet, I would not replace the potatoes and toast with pancakes.  SO that is what I did.  But the omelet was still small and the serving of potatoes was not generous . I tasted better omelets which are bigger and the price more reasonable at several local breakfast. So I debated between three  or four stars and decided on THREE STARS. Service is good and there are plenty of servers.  It is just the size of the omelet and the price which kept me giving it four stars. The restaurant does promote over 40 different kinds of pancakes.
