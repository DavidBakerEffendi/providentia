Best service and the sushi is pretty good too. It's a small spot but it gets packed around dinner. I've been coming here for years and they know my order by heart. The waiting staff is extremely friendly.  They'll bring you out some complementary mussels to tide you over until your order is ready. When they have it the mochi green tea ice cream is amazing. The sushi itself is better than most I've had (volcano roll being my personal staple). There is a real charm to this place. Don't let the crowds scare you away.  Wait it out once and your likely to add it to your usual dining repertoire as well.
