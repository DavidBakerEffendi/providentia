Lesson for the evening: Venture outside of St. Marks and head over to Avenue C for a good meal. Where am I?  As someone from our party of 4 described, it's like leaving NYC and being transported to Central Europe.  Kafana definitely has a good vibe to it.  There was huge birthday party going on that took up half the restaurant and included a "Happy Birthday" banner, complete with balloons.  We still managed to get seated within minutes, although it was a tight squeeze between the two tables.  Good thing I went to yoga beforehand. As other reviewers have mentioned, the complimentary red pepper spread is delicious.  It also enhanced the flavor of the Serbian burger, which comes sans condiments.  When our server mentioned that there was only one order left of the special for the evening, I knew the stuffed peppers had to be mine.  The savory rice and beef filling was hearty and delicious.  The prices were reasonable.  Will definitely be coming back to try more Serbian dishes, as long as I can order them by their English name.
