I'm happy to call B2 my local coffeeshop now. Not only do they have awesome drinks (I'm a tea drinker, and they have some nice fancy tea lattes), they have great breakfast sandwiches, pastries, and LOTS of vegan options (vegan soft serve ftw!). The only thing I really don't like is that there's no clear line/ordering situation ... it's really like a bar rather than a coffeeshop in that way, and that tweaks my anxiety! People tend to line up to the right, but you can also just go sit at the counter and wait for someone to notice you. I was about to do 4 stars, but honestly, I still like it so much that it's a 5 star. I choose it over other coffeeshops in the area. Other notes: Seating fills up (but sitting solo at the bar is really nice), cash only, and there's an ATM in the back.
