So my veal was really good. I even ate the lima beans like a good little girl because they were so awesome. So, basically the food is great. But the service, jeez... I was really annoyed to order 2 dollar olive oil and pepper mix to have them bring me a plate of seasonings separated and not mix it. Not to mention I was given one slice of small bread and no one thought to ask if I wanted more. I'm sorry for $2 olive oil I think someone could check to see if maybe I would like to enjoy it with another slice or two of bread. Â So in addition to being BYOB, cash only, expensive, and small now I gotta mix my olive oil and beg for bread. I guess.
