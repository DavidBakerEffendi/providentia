First time there was a positive experience. We only waited 10 mins for a table outside on a Saturday around noon and grab beers from the bar prior. Â Quirky decor, solid beer list, and friendly staff. The fried fish BLT was excellent...good size piece of tilapia with an awesome caper tater sauce. We will likely be back for brunch and to try the Bloody Mary.
