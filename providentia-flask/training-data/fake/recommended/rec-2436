Right across the street from Geno's crap steak, this place is way better.  The bread is more softer, the steak has more flavor than Geno's, and it was just more fulfilling.   If your heading to Philly and want to try out the famous Cheesesteaks they have there, skip Geno's, go across the street literally and get it from there. Hands down, Pats is greater than Geno's.
