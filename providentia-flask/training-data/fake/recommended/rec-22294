Got there at opening on weekday, in the off season, and first in the door- no lines. Immediatley ordered a Clam and Margherita pie. Clams were tough and chewy and a bit "off" extremely disappointing, noting that this is their signature pie, hence the 4 star. Other than that the margherita out of this world and the basic house salad was excellent baby greens, misuna mix, a few bits and pieces of salad vegs, and great olives and a nice easy going Italian vinagrette dressing. Service friendly and prompt. Best of all, we weren't treated like jackass tourists from another planet!
