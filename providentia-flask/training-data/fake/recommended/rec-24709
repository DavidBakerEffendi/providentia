This place was awesome!  They had a romantic retractable roof in the rear which sadly has to be closed at 11PM.  The place is romantically dimly lit and serve amazing Spanish food.  It's a great date place and really they don't make anything bad, at least nothing I had.  So what did I have? Jamon Iberico.   Pretty interesting, wouldn't get it again, not that it tasted bad, it was interesting.  Just wouldn't pay 18 bucks for a little piece of ham. Patatas Brava tasted awesome, a bit spicy but good!!  Interesting twist on fries. Rosejat Rapida Wow, awesome.  Ordered a Spanish entree which was a bit unusual because most Spanish rest are tapas.  I was not disappointed very interesting and yummy!!! Membrillo for dessert!!!  Get it!!!  You won't be disappointed!!! I'm definitely coming back but might wait for another "special" occasion cuz it was a bit pricey but worth it!!!!!
