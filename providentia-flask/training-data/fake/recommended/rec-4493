Came here to try to eat a healthy meal, I failed. 1. No hard boiled eggs. 2. Only type of lettuce is Romaine. 3. The employees don't know the difference between oil and vinegar and balsamic vinaigrette. When asked them if the Italian dressing was creamy they replied no, guess what, it was. Threw my salad out and walked out.
