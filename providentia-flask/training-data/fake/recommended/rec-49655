Went there for wine and appetizers. The wine list is low priced...most bottles were in the $30 range. Â  Enjoyed the pork sliders, nachos and potato skins....all were very good and good portions. Nice look. Nice bar. Mixed crowd. $8-$12 ea. Might go back one day to enjoy their outdoor section when warmer weather comes. It was OK.
