If you want to eat at a Chinese restaurant with a nice ambience that's not the exorbitant price of Taste of China, this is your bet. I have really enjoyed all of their off the menu specials and the service is friendly/attentive. They compete with Great Wall, which is right across the street, and I would say that Great Wall is better for larger portions, a larger selection, and cheaper meals. I recommend the 3 cups chicken and pea shoots! Fried rice and noodles are mediocre imo.
