I love this place. I have been with my friends and my family. This place has a fantastic happy hour with half priced drinks and apps at the bar. The food is incredible (on-par with the best gastro-pub food you've ever had) and the service is fast and friendly. Any time, any table you'll get great food and great service. Try the Kobe Beef sliders, the Truffle Butter fries and the Chacouterie Cheese Platter and enjoy some of the fresh draught Yuengling (all half price at happy hour). Every time I go near Philadelphia I find myself drawn here.
