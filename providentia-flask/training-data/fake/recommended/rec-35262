I found this place through Yelp as the BF and I suffered through a horrible service experience at Cartier up the street. We both love donburi and we were pretty excited to try this place. We got a counter seat right away and was able to squirrel our carry on under the counter. I ordered the croquette trio and a tonkatsu curry rice plate and the BF ordered the tonkatsu donburi. I love croquettes and I love the three different types they had. The BF was not a fan so I got to eat all three myself. hehehe. I didn't like my curry as much as I thought I would. It tasted like the boxed ones I get at the Japanese supermarket. The donburi thought was great. I really wished I had order that instead. I kept stealing bites out of the BF's bowls as he struggled to eat and defend his food at the same time. I definitely recommend this place for the donburi.
