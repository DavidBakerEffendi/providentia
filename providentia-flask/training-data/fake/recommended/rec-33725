My friends and I were waiting on the Bolt bus back to New York so we decided to stop in. It looks like any typical Irish sports bar. Very spacious. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. That was a huge factor for the 5 stars They have $3 Yungling light bottles which was pretty nice. The hummus platter was huge and for $9, it was pretty worth it. I ordered the Salmon BLT. It was good, nothing special. Max ordered the Shepard's pie (which he loved). Denise got the chicken fingers which were also pretty standard but, the Old Bay fries the accompanied them were delicious! All in all if you're waiting on a bus or just in the area, stop on in!
