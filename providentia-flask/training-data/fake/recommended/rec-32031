This is one of the bests trucks in the city. I love Jamaican food and this truck did not disappoint. I had the ox tail stew with rice and beans and steamed cabbage. I also had the mac and cheese on the side. It was a lot of food and enough to feed off of for two or three meals. Great food! I will definitely go back to the truck again.
