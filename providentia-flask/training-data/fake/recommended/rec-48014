Yummmmmm! This is some of the best pizza i've had! Went on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. Seated right away in the air-conditioned back patio. Food came fast and was delicious. The Bee Sting Pizza is a must! Took off one star cause they didn't have soft-shell crab as the menu suggested and it was what I was really craving. Definitely will return!
