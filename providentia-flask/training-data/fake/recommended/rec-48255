Some of my best food and family moments have been spent here. The food here is incredible----of course from a top chef. No really he won on the show! The pastries  are to die for, and the gelato is home made. Does it get better...no! My fave is the spinach soup made fresh every time. Even the dipping sauce with the "while you wait" bread is out of this world. My daughter and I treat ourselves every mothers day and whenever we can. It's not cheap but worth every penny. The dining room is alittle small and cozy to say the least but I like this location better than the one on Hylan Blvd. It reminds me of Brooklyn I guess. The waiter hover a bit but they are on point so I don't care. I get great service every time so when lunch cost $70.00 I don't care.  A cake from here says " i love you and you mean ALOT to me" because it does not get better on Staten island. Period.
