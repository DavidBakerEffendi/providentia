Having a great week in the Financial district in Manhattan. Fourth great night of food! Came on the recommendation of a colleague. Crepes for dinner are something else. Just the right amount of food after a busy day. I had the chicken and asparagus crepe. Savory crepes are made with buckwheat flour. It was an inspired choice, nice complement to goat cheese. For dessert, the Midnight Sun, white chocolate and strawberries. To die for. Also got to watch the crepes "in progress" which was amazing! And Devon, my server, was friendly and attentive. All in all, a great night!
