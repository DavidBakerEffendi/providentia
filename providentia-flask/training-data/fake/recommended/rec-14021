Despite the lovely neighborhood vibe, Park Slope, Brooklyn, can be somewhat cutthroat on a Sunday afternoon.  Many restaurants vie for the brunch crowds.  The really good places for brunch usually have a bit of wait time.  Too often, this atmosphere results in irritated patrons being rushed by impatient staff seeking faster turnover. Rose Water manages to avoid all this, despite being quite popular.  The  interior ambiance immediately conveys a relaxed feeling that is very Brooklyn.  The staff contributes to the feeling by providing excellent service without being intrusive.  The core of the Rose Water's success is the thoughtful and creative menu.  Rose Water is committed to working with local, regional, organic and sustainably raised foods.  Even more important, the kitchen seems committed to offering delicious food.  On a recent visit with some friends, the duck confit sandwich, smoked cod cake and baked polenta with goat cheese were all delicious and wonderfully executed.  The pumpkin bread was disappointing, but pumpkin season is coming to a close. A visit to Rose Water is definitely worth the trip, especially with a $14  prix fixe brunch!
