One of our favourite restaurants in the world, this lively bistro serves consistenly excellent food in a loud - oh-so-Bistro - atmosphere.  And - as if you need more than Balthazar - it's Spring Street location puts it steps away from a handful of trendy watering holes if you are looking to keep the ball rolling.  The French bistro fare is well done and the menu includes such delights as the Le Balthazar Plateaux De Fruits De Mer, a $99 three story underwater fantasy, and Branade De Morue, a $7.50 appetizer of mashed potato and shredded cod whisked together.  Really, one of those places which you can't go wrong with unless you dont have a reservation.
