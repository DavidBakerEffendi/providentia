New spot at the Loews - amazing transformation worth a visit! It's nice...and could get 4 stars in the not too distant future. First, the space...what an amazing transformation of the now tired Sole Food restaurant. Masculine use of wood, lots of sight lines, a central bar that wraps around from the dining room side to the now lounge-y hotel lobby...really, really nice makeover. The staff is good and seemingly getting better. A few great holdovers from the previous staff hold things together (Thanks Melissa, Drew, Brian and Jacob) and a few new additions really seem to be adding to the polish and the service levels. It wasn't until my second visit, however, that I realized...I'm struggling with the menu...there are considrably less "attractive" options than I thought there might be. In the snacks, I had oysters (kumumoto's that night), which were great. But other choices include steak tartare, a taste of ham, chicken liver duck parfait and a charcuterie plate. Not a whole lot here screaming my name. Then there are just 5 starters...I've tried the corn and snap pea salad which was good if not somewhat simple...and the pastrami beef short rib...it was way more about the pastrami than the short rib for me...and slightly salty...but not bad. Entrees are about the same...limited number of choices and some of them that you just can't get excited about. I've had the burger off that side of the menu, which is very good...but then some steaks get into the $30's and $40's and I'm not going there on an average week night out. Definitely worth a visit...hopefully the menu will continue to evolve, bumping this rating up...and no matter what, this place is a vast improvement over what's been here before, so let's support what could be a great new dining addition to CC.
