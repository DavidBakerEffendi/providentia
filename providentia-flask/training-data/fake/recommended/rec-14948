In a word: such bourgeoisie nonsense. I've never been given such a hard time trying to have a drink somewhere.  It's been going on since they opened, and it's finally time to say something.  Carded a dozen times by the same waitress in the span of 4 months.  Bartenders must not be accustomed to folks having more than three drinks.  I've never laughed at someone after being cut off before! They need to make up their mind if they want to be a Chilis or if they want to actually be a decent bar. Such beautiful beer. Such beautiful brunch.  Good neighborhood place.  Just don't laugh out loud.  And screw Darius Rucker.  So torn to be living half a block from you, Yup-yup A-Hole's Den.
