I don't fry at home so whenever I'm craving fries I go here. The fries are good and well seasoned. They're thick so you might not like them if you're into thin fries. I love thin fries but I'll make an exception for these. Most people like to try out different sauces to accompany their fries but I prefer to stay simple and have them with ketchup. The place is small but Â I can usually find a place to sit.
