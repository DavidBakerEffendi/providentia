Frequented this restaurant when it was Pucket cafe. Thought we would give the new place a try. First impression was that they fixe the place up nice. The waitress asked us if we had been there before and we told her we had when it was Pucket. She told us we were in for a real treat! Well, not so much! The food is not better and if you BYOB (while they are waiting for their liquor license) they charge you a $6 corking fee! Which wasn't mentioned until we got the bill. The drunken noodles were pretty good but the cow soy sucked! I don't think we will be going there again. I'll travel to rocky hill for my Thai!
