You know how Disney movies brainwash you into believing that when you meet the right girl or boy, you *just know*? Public has convinced me that this is true for Bloody Marys as well. I had never been a big fan of the drink, but turns out it was simply because I had never tried Public's take on the spicy tomato concoction. The space and food were good too, and we didn't have too much trouble seating a group of eight there at 12:30 on a Saturday. They get extra credit for pulling off that feat.
