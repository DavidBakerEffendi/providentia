Worth the trip coming from the UES on a Saturday afternoon. We got there around 4pm there was already a line but it wasn't as bad as I expected it to be.  Placed our order took about 20 minutes and our pizza came out perfect! Fresh mozzarella and pepperoni on thin crust was super yum!  Best pizza in New York!!!  No slices and cash only.
