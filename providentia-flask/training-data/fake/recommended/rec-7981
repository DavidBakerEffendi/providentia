This is one of my favorite places ever! does not matter WHAT SEASON IT IS!   whether it is summer or winter they have outdoor seating. in the winter they had heat lamps in between tables and they have a firepit where you can make smores (they sell the smore packets for $1 by where the bar is) German beers on tap---my favorite is "Franziskaner Hefeweizen". LETS GET REAL! i am a small korean girl...there is no way I can pronounce that correctly, but I just say I want a "frankenstein" and they usually understand what I am trying to say.  the beer is light, crisp and goes perfectly with their food.   A lot of their food can be somewhat "salty" but it works well bc the beer just taste THAT much better. so thirst quenching mm!-----GET THE PRETZEL AND FRIES! dont freak out when  you realize that you already used all the ketchup they give you in that tiny paper cup...you can go refill it by the condiment station. great games to play with fweeenndds ping pong table, jenga, foosball, and dominos. I'm not going to lie...the jenga is getting real dirty -_- borderline get some purrell.
