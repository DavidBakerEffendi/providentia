HUGE sandwich menu, open 24 hours, and cheap prices? WHATS NOT TO LIKE? I was overwhelmed by the bright lights and extensive menu when stumbling into this place in the wee hours of the night. Not to mention the drunkards roaming around the tiny store. Got the pho sandwich (now they have a pho #1 and a pho #2 (see photo)), and it didn't disappoint. Whoever created that sandwich perfectly transformed a hot steaming bowl of pho into sandwich form. Quite impressive, really. Anyway, you can call in your order beforehand so you dont have to wait in the store, fearfully monitoring any signs of impending projectile vomiting from a drunkie.
