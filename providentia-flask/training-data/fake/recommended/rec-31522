Craving anything oyster we hopped in the car and headed to Samson Street. On the half shell with lemon, horseradish, and a cracker they were fresh and really had a delicious flavor. The fried oyster platter, I had never seen oysters so big, these monster oysters were perfectly fried, crisp on the outside and tender on the inside a dunk in the sauce and I was satisfied!
