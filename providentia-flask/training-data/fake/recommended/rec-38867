Went here with my family for a birthday lunch on a Sunday afternoon. The food was good, but I thought the prices were high for the portions.  I had 6 cubes of chicken, with a little rice, 1 slice of a grilled pepper and 1 slice of a grilled tomato for $15.   I was disappointed with the lack of veggies.  Throw some more grilled veggies on the plates! I may give it another try since the food was good, but overall I was underwhelmed.
