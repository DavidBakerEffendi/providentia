a local fav!  i live on memphis street so how can i not want the name glorified!   :) anyway, love the beer selection, the veggie burger, atmosphere and the people/ staff.  did i mention their veggie burger?  yum!! only negative is that some of their food, in my opinion, is hit or miss.  i don't stray too far from what is tried and true.  ] either way, love it still!
