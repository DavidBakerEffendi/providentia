Great menu and concept, still has the chance to tweak the execution to improve.  In general the space, service, and food all good but not in line with price relative to nearby competitors in the $30 entree range. Dinner for 2 (three courses each) without any drinks or tip $125.  Note taken of other reviews complaining about scant portions: Go to Olive Garden if you are in need of food coma!  We were full half way through the entrees.  Yes, you get five little mind-blowing ravioli in a half inch of browned butter for your appetizer - it's enough! Delicious bread and butter - just the right amount, and yes, there is a salt cellar on the table which is a nice crunch to the sweet butter.   No added salt needed on the rest of the meal, in fact it was all significantly oversalted in our opinion.   We started with a squash ravioli in butter sauce - seems from reading other reviewers that you cannot go wrong with the day's ravioli.  Little pillows of melt in your mouth deliciousness.  Hand rolled "pici" spaghetti like pasta in a meat sauce likewise delicious (though salty). As others have noted, the entrees were less impressive.  Turkey stuffed cabbage was OK - too salty!  Fluke with chard in a hollandaise was bland and "sushi" in the middle (not that I don't like sushi).   Dessert:  Mille feuille terrific.  Cheese plate was good but plunked down without any identification of the cheeses or accompaniments (there was a honeyed fruit something which was really good, and paper thin crisps of bread).  In general service was competent but lackluster. We love a good BYOB in the neighborhood and will give Russet another chance after they settle in - maybe next time will do all appetizers and dessert!
