Tasty brunch, proper portions and decent price. The croque madame was great; had a nice slight heat to it, sourdough was fresh and egg cooked perfectly. Chicken and waffles benedict was also tasty; chicken thighs were crispy and moist, waffles tender but stood up to the Benedict sauce and syrup, eggs cooked perfectly. Only complaint is it's not REAL maple syrup. Food tries for a Cajun flare, but the sweet potato home fries could use any seasoning. Regular home fries are tasty but not really more than fried potatoes. All in all def be back for more.
