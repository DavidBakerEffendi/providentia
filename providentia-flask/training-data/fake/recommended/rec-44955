Thank you, thank you Little Owl for making our night!! It was pouring cats and dogs and you welcomed our party of six with the warmest of greeting, finding space for us in your bustling evening. Yelpers, this place is so inviting, the food is divine, and the atmosphere is lively, creative and intimate. From host to kitchen to servers & bussers everyone is there to make your experience delightful and memorable. Tagliateli as a starter is rich and divine. Bibb and beets was tasty-perfect, crisp, bright, crunchy. A few of us had the lamb which was not only succulent and falling off the shank the portion was the most generous ever. The creamy goat cheese potatoes and greens on the side were phenomenal---i'm reliving the tasty joy just thinking about them! The skate was tender and perfectly prepared. Soft shell crab divine. The mushrooms, omg. Forest in your mouth. They were so kind to let us close down the place, not even a tiny throat-clear hinting that our party should skedaddle so they could leave. It was raining even harder upon exiting and when we were hanging out under their awning planning a taxi strategy the host came out and offered us a spare umbrella. Lil' Owl you've melted our hearts. Thank you.
