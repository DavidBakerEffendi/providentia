dinner here was amazing. Great lighting and great service! Had a couple appetizers...including the cheesesteak eggrolls, shoestring fries, and the chicken skewers which were all great. The shoestring fries are way thinner than shoestrings and they come out as this huge mountain. The cocktail selection is great and you get the whole shaker too. Next time i'm in the area, I'd come back and try other things for sure.
