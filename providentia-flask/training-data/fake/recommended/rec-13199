Setting up a family brunch is usually an issue for me. I have to make everyone happy and thats hard to do. When i looked into Kefi, it seemed like the perfect place. It has reasonable prices, you can make reservations, you can order from the brunch and lunch menu, and good for groups. We had a nice long table in the back of the restaurant. the place itself is fine, nothing special for decor or ambiance. The servers took good care of us. We started with the bread and olive oil that was on the table which was actually very good. Then we got some pita bread and spreads... another hit. for my main dish i got eggs Florentine. it was really good and sat on a flat pita bread instead of english muffin. there were 2 Greek cheeses on it that made it really tangy and salty but i loved it. Eggs were cooked perfectly too. My uncle and brother got a skillet baked dish they both enjoyed. my one uncle, who is extremely hard to please got fish which he said was overdone, but they made him a new one and he raved about it. only complaint is that people who got the chicken souvlaki said it lacked flavor which was disappointing because it looked so good. either way everyone had a nice time and i would definitely come back again to try their dinner
