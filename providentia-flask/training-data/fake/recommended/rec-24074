Ate there last night for the start of restaurant week.  Food was good and they give you plenty.  Sat outside cause the weather was nice and the inside is a little dark.  The dark setting might be nice for a romantic dinner.  Only negative was the food took a long time to come which I was surprised by since the restaurant wasn't even half full.
