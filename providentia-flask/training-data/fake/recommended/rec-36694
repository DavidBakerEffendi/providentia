This is my favorite tasting menu of all time! I love this restaurant.  Inside it's a cozy romantic cave--sloping ceilings and walls painted a deep red, pretty little tables set up against squishy banquets and low candlelight. The menu is wonderful--and the fact that you can pick and choose around the tasting menu is great--I'm a bit picky and always want to try these, but don't want to miss out on courses. Surprisingly, the amuse was one of my favorite parts--a chilled tomato gazpacho with seafood, avocado and scallions. yum. The icing on top of the cake was the fact that the guy with the bread cart came around 5 times. I'm a carb-aholic, and the fact that there are 15 different flavors (olive, pistachio, raisin, whole grain, rosemary, etc) put me in carb-heaven.   Get the wine pairing--it was a great adventure from a dry white to a sweet dessert finish.
