There can be a wait, and it is a small restaurant...but I gave them 5 for the following: Excellent staff and service.  The wait staff is friendly, and the managers tries to accommodate you to the best of their ability.  If you call ahead it will save you some of  the frustration others had mentioned. The food is amazing, and the servings are well proportioned. They have an extensive Italian wine list, its pretty awesome.
