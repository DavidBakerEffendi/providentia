I think this place is over hyped.  I waited around 20 minutes and ordered the pork buns, cucumber salad and they spicy ramen. The pork buns were yummy, but not Momofuku good.  The cucumber salad was really nice and the presentation was pretty special and the spicy ramen just wasn't that spicy.  The noodles were really good, but I didn't feel that this place was beyond words or anything.
