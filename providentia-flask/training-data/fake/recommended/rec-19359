I like any place where you park 4 blocks away and can still smell the cheesesteaks wafting down the alley you are walking through. Be sure to have cash because they don't take cards. I have had a lot of cheesesteaks since moving to Philly and this was by and far the best. Probably not the best idea to have someplace important Â to be after eating here as I promise you will smell of meat and onions when you leave.
