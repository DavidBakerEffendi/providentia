Yet another "Meh." The male waiters here are always extremely friendly. I mean really, really friendly... like my friend and I have come in here quite a few times, been seated and left because we didn't see anything we liked, and were still treated in an unbelievably friendly matter. Which is probably why we decided that we would order something, anything, just to try the food out. Â We came for brunch and it was "meh." Nothing too special. But, with the crazy level of friendly factor, we will probably try Jimmy's out again.
