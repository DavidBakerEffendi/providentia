This place is pretty good and was not crowded at all so we had room to relax & hear each other talk.  The calamari is a must-try, its unique & the best I have ever tasted.  Our entrees were tasty and a nice portion size, fairly fancy although I expected the beef filet to have more flavor. The prices are similar to Leunigs, C&M have smaller portions.  The waitstaff was very pleasant and knowledgeable about both food & drinks.   I'd go again but only if someone else was paying.
