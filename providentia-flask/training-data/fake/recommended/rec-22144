Public is a stellar restaurant.  It's beautiful inside, the service is phenomenal, and the food and wine are fantastic!  If you or anyone you know is a vegetarian and you're not sure where to go....go here!  I'm a vegetarian and I was pleasantly surprised at how many options they had.  They only have one entree option, red curry, but it is SOOO good it doesn't even matter.  I also had the mushroom ceviche as an appetizer which I thought was out of this world.  Although Public is a bit out of my price range, I am hoping to return on a special occasion but for now, I want all of you fellow yelpers to try out the goodness too!
