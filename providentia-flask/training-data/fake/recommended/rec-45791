Who knew that sleepy Robbinsville would become a mecca for foodies. First there was DeLorenzo's Tomato Pies that came to town two years ago. The latest addition to the food circuit is Ploy Siam. Believe me, I know my Thai food. My gold standard for a long time has been Four Seasons on Stelton Rd. in Piscataway and Highland Park, NJ. Ploy Siam blows them both away and could easily be the best Thai restaurant in the NJ/Philly/NY Corridor. The decor is elegant, the service is superb and the menu and food are par-excellence. My family loves this place so much that sometimes we go there twice a day - for lunch and dinner. I had serious reservations about Â writing this review only because I did not want to let the cat out of the bag and keep this neatly-tucked away restaurant a secret and to myself. But, now that many others seem to have discovered this gem in the Foxmoor Plaza in Robbbinsville, it only seems fair that I pour out my praise for this place. By the way this place is BYOB, so you can spend all those savings in ordering extra dishes to doggie-bag.
