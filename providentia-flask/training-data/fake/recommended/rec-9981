Great food! The Matador Combo chicken dish feeds 2-3 easily. This is some of the best chicken ever. Everything was very good.  Make sure they give you the green salsa, we had to ask for it. Service is adequate but minimal. It was good that we could talk to the kid who fills the waters in Spanish because he was helpful. The sangria is the best; get a pitcher full.  From the outside it looks like a hole in the wall. We walked past it one time. But inside it is big, and very busy and loud. Food is five stars, service is three.
