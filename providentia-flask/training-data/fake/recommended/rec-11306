Being a popular BOYB in center city, a few friends and myself were excited to check it out - but we were sorely disappointed.   Having reservations, we still had to wait about 45 minutes to be seated.  It was very crowded, but that seems like an awful long time to wait.  Two of us had to wait outside in the cold because the lobby was sardined with other hungry patrons. The owner greeted us (and everyone) and was friendly and apologetic - but I feel maybe he does this often to calm people down? The food was really not that special - I don't understand what the rave is all about.  Every dish between the four of us was bland - something you could find at a diner.  And the bread that was brought out to us was frozen.  We had to send it back. Needless to say there are plenty of other BYOBs that have a better record of consistency than this place.
