The best Sri Lankan restaurant in town!! Love the modern ambience with a touch of Sri Lankan culture. The photo wall was one of my favorites! Don't forget to check it out when u visit Ceylon Curry. Serves awesome seafood at a very reasonable price! Loved the seafood buriyani!!! Food took a while but only because it was made fresh. Had a few appetizers while waiting for the food & it was delicious!! The watalappan dessert was the best I've had ever! The owner is super friendly & the staff is awesome! Looking forward to my next visit!!!!!
