would have 5 stars except that the first time i went, i ordered a burger to see what all the talk was about. it came our raw. not rare. raw. like i bit in and i wondered why there was something cold in my burger and why it was mushy. it was as if the patty did not even touch the grill. ended up sending it back but i was worried about my health for a little while there. well, the booze is cheap. beer list is nothing to write home about, but at 275 for mcsorleys and 350 drafts, you cant go wrong. especially when you have the adorable old bartender man.
