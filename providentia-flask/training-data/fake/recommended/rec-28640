This place is so great!!!!! I had the french toast and my friend had the jordy cakes!  So glad we decided to share as we didn't know which one to get!  Very delicious and gluten free!  Doesn't get any better than that.  Left feeling satisfied but not stuffed.  Prices are reasonable for the quality of food.   The place inside is very nice and clean, much bigger than I thought.
