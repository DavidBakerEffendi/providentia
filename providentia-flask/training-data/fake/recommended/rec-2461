Everybody from philly raves and rants about Pat's and Geno's... I really dont think there cheesesteaks are really worth it. And I live about half a mile away.... Good price and its real quick service, but honestly i have had better cheesesteaks in NY and NJ... Skip in my opinion... unless u just want to say i ate at Pat's. I realize it is the same review as Geno's but lets be real they practically the same. I apologize to all the geno and pat fans...
