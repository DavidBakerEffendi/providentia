We had gone here for a birthday party on Saturday.  We went with the fixed price menu where you get the standard appetizer, entree and dessert for $45.   I started off the night with pork/veal 2 meatballs covered in fondue.  I felt like we should have at least got 3.   I hate to be a cheap bastard, but I'm guessing they're pricing these balls at 5 a piece.... For the main event, I had pappardelle pasta with wild bar ragout.   Friggin delicious.  This boar lived a good life from the way it tasted. Dessert arrived.   I had picked the Pana cotta- blew my mind.   I savored every little bite.     Overall the service was excellent.   The tap water was refreshing- literally best water I've tasted from the tap.  I'd give it more stars if the meatball portions were bigger.
