My girl friends and I went here the other night and had a great time. The food was delicious and the servers were really nice and helpful. I ordered the Chana for appetizer and it was great. The garden salad isn't the best but that's to be expected at an Indian restaurant. I had one of the seafood specialities (shrimp with almond and cream sauce) and that was really delicious. They even gave us a free pistachio ice cream for dessert. I'm giving Â it four stars instead of five because the bathroom is awkwardly placed at the back of the kitchen so I had to walk through the tight kitchen which was a little bit awkward.
