Personally, I think Cheese Steaks are over-rated. The meat is often flavorless. Dalessandro's defies this stereotype. It actually has flavor without having to add a ton of fixings. I got a mushroom cheese steak, and of course opted to add the yellow pepperonici peppers anyways. I'd recommend Dalessandro's over the tourist infested Pat's or Geno's (assuming you're willing to make the drive to this part of town)!
