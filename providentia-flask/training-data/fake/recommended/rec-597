We totally enjoyed our meal at Ngam. Ordinary Thai dishes were made exceptional by great flavors and ingredient twists, such as zucchini substituting for pad thai noodles. Â Chicken wings were outstanding. We also loved our Tom Yam Tinis. The great music was drowned out by the high noise level, not unexpected in a small crowded space. Only complaint was lack of AC: with an open kitchen, this was a problem. I'll go back in the winter.
