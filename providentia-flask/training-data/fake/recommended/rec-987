$6 for all that food! Great Value. Fast Eat. Yummy Flavors. These guys have developed a conveyor belt machine, where you stand in line to order your food, drop off six dollars, then move on to their drink cart. It's very efficient and easy to find why these guys are so popular. I went for the half and half and drizzled the bbq sauce near the "salad" side and drenched the rest with their white sauce (Mayo, Vinegar, Salt. and something else I can't distinguish). It's just ... good. Only downfall is that there are no places to sit away from or avoid the harsh cold weather of a wintery night, but this isn't their fault. Overall, Just BOMB!
