*music: Â is good but a little too up beat for dinner time. I know other similar Thai places that play house/trance but more of a mellow beat. *food: Tom yum is pretty good. Could be spicier. crab ragoons had a lot of cream cheese and little crab. Sake wasn't impressive. Pad Thai was too sweet. I've been to Thailand though so maybe I just have high expectations :)
