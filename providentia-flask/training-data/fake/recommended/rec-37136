Ok, so I'm big on pizza...like REALLY BIG on quality pizza. Bottom of the barrel for me when it comes to pizza are places such as papa johns, and dominos. Thats not "REAL" pizza to me. "REAL" pizza is the brick oven thin crust, non overload of cheese, with hearty toppings; just like what I had at Grimaldi's. This is by far THEE BEST pizza I have every had! It's absolutely amazing compared to that oil bath you'll take from your neighborhood pizza joint. Nothing compares to the freshly made mushroom pizza with white sauce that I had. The pizza that will have me traveling to DUMBO, and quite possibly walking along that God forsaken bouncy bridge (though I don't have to). The people are pleasant, and the smiles are welcoming. Even conversation from the manager seating us was very nice, though he's been working all day. Yes, there are long lines, but your best bet is to wait to be seated, then order. Folks who come to order out tend to wait longer for their pie. It isn't sold by the slice. The price you pay is just fine for quality pizza. I strongly recommend, and it is most certainly somewhere I will visit again!
