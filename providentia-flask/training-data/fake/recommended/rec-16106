UVA deserves a solid four stars for ambience, excellet food, knowledgeable wine sommeliers. Â Service was good. Food menu was great, expect a little pricey, but you get what you pay for. Buy wine by the bottle if you find one you like. Duck was amazing, gnocchi was good, brushetta was great, lightning was very dim and it was a bit loud in the restaurant but it was overall a fantastic spot to have dinner a long as you want to pay about $30 per person for appetizer, food, wine, and salad. Minus one star for not having real candles!! Otherwise fantastic!!
