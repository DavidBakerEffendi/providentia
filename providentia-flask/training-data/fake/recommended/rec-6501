I enjoyed this place. It's a bit of a scene because that area is teeming with tacky wealth. So on a Friday or Saturday, expect S.U.V. limos to be pulling up outside. But the space is huge and the tables are decently separated so you're not eating on top of one another. The menu is extensive, all of the food was good and the service was very friendly. I feel our waitress talked us into ordering too much (that puffy bread will fill you up) but I took home what I didn't finish because it was so tasty.
