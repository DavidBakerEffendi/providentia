AMAZING! Food, service, and people made the entire experience enjoyable.  Yes, this place is small, but that's what makes it so much better.  We had to wait over an hour, but the servers never stopped asking us if we needed anything, and even gave us free wine for being so patient (which, we were okay with....). This place has an awesome vibe- 80s and 90s rap/hip-hop playlist, and almost feels like a bar.  Definitely a younger 20-30s crown as well.  Once we finally got seated, it was in front of the kitchen where Louis, the chef, was so incredibly friendly and fun! As far as what to order, you MUST try their bacon with honey! My friend and I are not huge bacon lovers, and still enjoyed this.  The avocado toast was also to die for.  We will be back for sure :)
