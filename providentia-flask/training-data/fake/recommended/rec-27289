It's an outside cheesesteak place where you order at the window and get your food to go but when I tell you that sandwich was so damn good. Extremely messy... But I expected that. The service is a bit slow tho. Perhaps because I went on a Saturday. The people taking the order were kinda rushing me but I mean it's a cheesesteak for 2 (or half now half later) for under $10.
