Wait: I expected the wait...it was going to be over an hour so we took off to exploring the area...not much to explore so headed to chinatown walked back and still had to wait...almost to the point where it's not okay because I trained my tummy to wait only that hour and it started to yell at me....breathe....then waitress announces that our table is ready!!!!  YAY!!! Atmosphere: The place is small and packed don't know how the swifty staff dodged each other w/o crashing...but place is very clean.   Food: I had the pancakes w/ banana walnut with warm maple butter and my bf had eggs benedict w/ petrossian smoked salmon and a side order of sugar-cured bacon.  Pancake D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S sooo fluffy and light!!!  and I'm not even a pancake fan Bf's egg benedict was even BETTER!!!  the biscuit is very light and fluffy as well not really sure how to describe except that I never knew pancake and biscuit can be THIS GOOD!  they were a lil short on the salmon but it was okay.  The sugar-cured bacon was yummy too.   Price: It is not a cheap breakfast but all worth it Would I go back?  HELL YA Would I go back w/ the wait?  Ummmm...DARN IT
