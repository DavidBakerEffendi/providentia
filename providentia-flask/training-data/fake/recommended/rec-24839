I've brunched, dined and lunched here (once in the same day).  The food and the wine selection are always solid and and change gracefully through the seasons.  The interior is cozy and elegant, sometimes quite cosy around dinner time, but the bathrooms are huge.  The burger (I know) is filling but it's a must. Rouge isn't the cheapest place on the block either. A dinner for two will run you about half a benjamin (without wine).  But all-in-all one of my favorites.
