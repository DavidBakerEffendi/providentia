we went to Piccoli for lunch. We ordered the shaved brussel sprouts with the citrus dressing. It was delicious. Then my husband had the grilled calamari and he said it was good. We shared the pappardelle with a ragu sauce and it was simply delicious. We decided to try this restuarent because of the good reviews and we were very happy and will definitely come back.
