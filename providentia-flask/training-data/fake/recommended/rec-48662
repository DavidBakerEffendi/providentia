I've got two words for you... bedazzled turkey.  I love hitting this place up every time I go to Philly, its truely the best place to go out for a night.  Grab a tall boy of PBR and kick back in the downstairs or up.  Last trip I had we ended up there on a Sunday night and they were making hand turkeys.  I know, who the hell makes hand turkeys, well everyone at Tattooed Mom's was making turkeys.  I was so proud to see mine hanging up behind the bar the next night when I stopped by.  And all my Philly friends were making fun of it because it looked like Liberace with all the feathers and bedazzling.  Okay guys, I get it, everyone outside of SF thinks the whole city is gay.  Haha.  We're not all gay, we're all just Fabulous!  Eat that on your toast in the morning!
