The reviews are right, this place is classy, but a little cramped.  It's easy to overhear the conversation at the the table next to you, but that to me is half the fun.  The menu is short and not fully developed but the food so far is delicious and simple, not smothered in sauce or spiced up past recognition.  I would get there early for anything that wasn't a couple.  The service is great and friendly and it's a BYOB which cuts way down on the cost.  All in all, a great eat.
