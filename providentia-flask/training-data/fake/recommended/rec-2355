Good, but not as good as it gets. Good steak, but Geno's across the street was just a bit better. The best part of this place was the attitude I got from the guy who ran me up. I'm a newbie at placing my steak order and the guy gave me a hard time just like you'd expect, it made it an experience! disclaimer: normally attitude doesn't win points, but does in fact lose them, so don't try this at home!
