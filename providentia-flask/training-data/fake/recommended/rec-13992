I LOVED ilili! We went there Friday night for a friend's rehearsal dinner. The place was lovely, the service was excellent and the food was wonderfully flavorful. We had hummus, falafel, kibbeh, lamb sausage, tabbouleh salad and so much more as the food just kept coming. I was in heaven! For dessert we were served tiny chocolate brownies which packed amazingly large punch. They were unbelievably good. Â Ilili is definitely one of the best Mediterranean restaurants I've been to & I can't wait to go back! I'd definitely recommend it to anyone is is a fan of exotic food and beautiful settings.
