went there today for lunch. it's the perfect place to have a drink or work on your computer. bartenders were chill and the atmosphere is so comfortable. delicious cajun burger. wish they had ketchup. they forgot our order but there was apparently a problem with the printer. it wasn't a big deal. will definitely be back.
