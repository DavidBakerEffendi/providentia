Not good... I felt like we were in a tourist trap rather than a gourmet restaurant. The atmosphere was nice and the service was fine but the food... Nothing to write home about. They gave us bread and some tasteless tapenade to start.. Then we ordered salads. I've had many a caprese salad, but this was awful.. Instead of Balsamic vinegar they put on a rancid olive type oil.. My SO's Caesar wasn't much better. For the main course my salmon was overcooked and so were the veggie sides... I could barely eat half... The linguini and clam sauce was just okay. The restaurant was not cheap either... $9 for a small pour of red. Would not go back!
