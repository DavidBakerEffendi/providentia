I've been away from staten island on and off for the last 8 years and THIS PIZZA IS THE HIGHLIGHT OF MY VISITS (along with ralph's ices), aside from seeing my family. I tell people who don't know staten island who are touristing or curious about what is here on our forgotten borough that Denino's is the main attraction (this and ralph's). Sometimes in my sleep and hunger in grad school, I dream about denino's crunchy crust and simplistic cheesy goodness. Sometimes, in desperation, I will look at photos on yelp of Denino's pizza in attempt to trick myself while I am eating a sad, soggy butchered pizza made 400 miles away from home. Â  Logistics: This is a no-frills mom and pop pizza joint. Family friendly. Parking along the street may be hard depending on the day. The wait times vary, but if you show up with one other person, it's a short wait ~5min wait. Super quick service. They want you in and out like it's chinese take out. $12/ plain small pie. $3-5 for beer on tap or bottle. I forgot the calamari prices, but the calamari is awesome too.
