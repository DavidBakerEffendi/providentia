Definitely a good place to go. Pretty casual, it's dark and dim and relatively small. I wouldn't want to go here with a group of more than 6-8. The food's not too expensive, and it's pretty great Italian-style pizza. I ordered the last pizza on the menu (I think it was just called the "Da Mikele"). It was a rectangular pizza without sauce, with cheese, prosciutto, mushrooms and a generous portion of truffle oil poured on top. Ohhhh the truffle! It did make the pizza rather oily, but it was absolutely delicious. And the small serving is still quite large, I ate just over half of mine and had an awesome lunch the next day! I also had a couple glasses of prosecco during and a specialty cocktail following dinner. They have fresh fruit on display at the bar and seem to use it in most of the specialty cocktails (Which are a hefty but not oturageous $12). I went for the super girly Raspberry Explosion and it was as good as it sounded. It's not the best place you'll find in New York, but I'd definitely recommend it for a great bite of Italian pizza--and I hope to go back and try the pasta. I went for a late dinner around 9, when I got there the place was full, me and my friend got the last table I believe, and I definitely liked the atmosphere. There were a couple people at the bar but it wasn't very bar-y. For late night eats or a small dinner + drinks is what I think Da Mikele excels in.
