I was really excited to try this place b/c sometimes you just want a good hot dog with spicy mustard and sauerkraut.  The space was hipster, warm, and clean all of which I liked.  Guys and girl at counter were so friendly and helpful.  But I was left underwhelmed by the food. I ordered a Bronx Bomber which is a dog with spicy mustard, onions, and sauerkraut.  But in this case it had onion sauce (ew) that tasted ketchupy.  The kraut was good but there was way too much mustard.  The roll was good, really good, but not for a hot dog!  Woulda been better for a hoagie.  The dog was long and skinny, tasted ok.   I also had fries which were really, really good!  They were the right balance of soft but crispy and salted just right.  Yum!  Also got a few dipping sauces - honey mustard (good), chipotle mayo (bland), and garlic rosemary (awful).   To sum it up: average dogs with some good topping, some not; too much roll, not enough dog; excellent fries but skip the dippers.
