I'm not normally a steakhouse kind of gal, but we wanted to see what the hype was all about, and Guild definitely lives up to the hype. We finally had a chance to try the World's Best Beer from Hill Farmstead Brewery in Greensboro, and my first sip was so evocative and complex, it was almost psychedelic. Wow. We started by sharing the rabbit terrine, delicate and delicious, and complimented by perfectly grilled bread, pungent coarse mustard and lip-puckering cornichons. For dinner we shared the bone-in ribeye for two, which came perfectly cooked and carved tableside with two excellent sides: rich creamed kale & spinach and a lovely potato leek gratin, some grilled onion on the side and Cyrus Pringle sourdough. Really a perfect Sat night.
