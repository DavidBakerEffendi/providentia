My husband  & I stumbled upon Dev's by accident, in the neighborhood and hungry!  What a wonderful surprise to eat such a delicious home-made dinner.  We had jerk chicken, rice and peas, cabbage and plantains.  Everything was just right, and not greasy.  We also tried their sorrel drink which was something I'd never even tasted before, pungent, gingery, and not too sweet.  The restaurant is run by a very sweet and warm family.  I would definitely go back and try other dishes.  It is not expensive and the portions were very generous. The other customers were friendly, too!
