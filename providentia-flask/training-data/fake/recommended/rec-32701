We eat here at least once a week. Not necessarily a place for foodies, but good Italian food. Stuffed pork chop, stuffed artichoke, zuppa di clams, talapia over spinach are favorites. Ask for marinara on your pasta side dish instead of their standard "sauce." If you order pizza and want thin crust, ask for a medium stretched to a large.
