Having heard rave reviews for Osteria, I was eager to enjoy a meal there.  And it delivers. I didn't give it five stars because my expectations were likely set too high after so many "oh, man, you have to go there" comments. It breaks down like this... FOOD: Excellent.  The flavor combinations were unexpected yet simple. We had a table of seven and shared 5-6 appetizers. The wood grilled octopus was amazing.  If I could recommend only one starter, this would be the one. The lemon and chives enhanced the flavor of the octopus perfectly.  We tried two raviolis -- the double with chestnuts and duck was the better  of two. The brick-oven pizza with meatballs and capers was light and tasty.  We also tried the special for the night, which was roasted seasonal vegetables. Nice but not great.  On to the entree.  I had the grilled venison leg with parsnips, apple and chestnuts.  Wow!  The meat was gently grilled and really allowed the natural flavor to make its presence felt.  The apple puree along with the chestnuts was spot on.   WINE: They basically offer only Italians, which is fine.  Unfortunately, I only recently started drinking Old World wines and can claim no useful knowledge of Italian varieties.  We had a jaw-dropping Brunello.  More fruit than I expected, but really just amazing. The Montepulciano we had was nice, too, but not on the same level as the Brunello. SERVICE: Attentive and knowledgeable.  I don't remember much other than we were taken care of nicely.  That's all I really expect from the service side. PRICE: This was a treat, so I would only visit here once per year.  The juice is worth the squeeze. ATMOSPHERE: Loved it.  Great energy. Soft lighting. Memorable without taking the focus away from the food. OVERALL: Osteria deserves the hype. You will enjoy a special dining experience.
