Went there on a Sunday morning and ordered a half PBLT and half Miso Braised Beef. Got a free unsweetened iced tea with yelp check in. Both were excellent sandwiches and will definitely come back for more. The average time for the sandwiches was about 10 minutes (wasn't busy, probably too early in the day for people to come in). I had company with me so it didn't feel like a long wait. People started rolling in when it was lunch hour. There's hand sanitizer near the cashier and trash area- glad it's there since I'm messy sandwich eater. Napkins, forks and sugar etc. are under the menu board. Overall a nice "kickback and relax" kind of place for lunch. P.S.- I think they also have Belly to accumulate points especially good if you frequent the place often enough. Also noticed that you can show your student ID for 10% off :)
