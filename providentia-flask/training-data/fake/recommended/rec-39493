Absolutely LOVE this place. What a great little corner resturant/ bar. It is a noisey little spot in East Village but the food is to die for! We were there on a late Saturday night and the wait wasn't long at all. We got a small little corner table and it was perfect to see the mix of New Yorkers. We ordered the empanadas to start which I recommend to everyone who is there. They were so delicious and had a mouth watering taste. For the platos fuertes, we ordered the Paella Valenciana, which was AMAZING. Being Spanish myself, I am always the first to judge everyone Else's so called paella but Yuca definitely know how to make a good one! My friend had ordered the Puerquito Cubano which was just as good. The meat was so tender it was falling apart and full of flavor! Would definitely recommend this to anyone who is in the area and looking for Latin American food! Definitely coming back for more!
