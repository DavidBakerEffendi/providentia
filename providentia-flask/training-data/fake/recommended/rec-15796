I love Uva! Great wine list and very nice atmosphere and the backyard patio is very nice (even in the winter). The prosciutto and mozzarella and the salmon dish are amazing. I love meatball Mondays (don't skip dessert- the polpetta di gelato is awesome). However, I was not a big fan of the gnocchi in the black truffle and chive sauce- the truffle taste was a little overwhelming.
