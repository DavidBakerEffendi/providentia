This spicy tomyun soup is THE best cure for a cold/ stuffy nose. I also love the spicy wok basil. Fast take out, they haven't messed up an order, and their service is just as speedy for sit down. I love that you can hear and see all the cooking even though tt does get hot in there during the summer, but they do have an open patio and a downstairs.
