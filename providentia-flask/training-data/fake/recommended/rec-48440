I love the setup inside the restaurant-- and very nice workers which adds up for great service. What impressed me the most was their hummus-- it was home made & the bread was very traditional afghan bread. I also tried chicken kebob and lamb roles, both were delicious. Overall - great original food & great service! They have a great menu & place is HUGE inside.Also- its great place to take out. Since this place is literally across the street from me, i will be going there many more time and highly recommend it.
