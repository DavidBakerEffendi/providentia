Last night was my first time at Matthew's, and I was impressed.  The food was amazing, the service was excellent, and everybody in the restaurant had big smiles on their faces as they seemed to enjoy their meals.   For my soup, I had pasta & faggioli; and for my entrée I had chicken scampi.  I happily devoured both :-)  My wife ordered the black cod with cheese risotto, which was delicious. The only negative: The acoustics made conversation difficult.  A lot of that had to do with fact that it was packed with customers (a good sign), but perhaps some sound absorbing material would help. But all in all, it's a great place to go for Italian food, and I can't wait to go back again to sample all their other dishes.  BON APPETIT!
