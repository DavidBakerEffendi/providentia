Very interesting blend of two cuisines one would never think to combine. The space was a bit crowded and cramped, but the decor is beautiful! The dishes...different indeed, pretty pricey even with a % off. Nothing really memorable as far as service wise. Cute date spot or taking out-of-towner. Wouldn't recommend it for a regular night out (due to the price menu). The Crab cakes & Lobster BLT? To DIE for!! Sea food done right with a French/African twist? I'm sold!
