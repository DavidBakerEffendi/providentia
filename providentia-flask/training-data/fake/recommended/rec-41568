From what I could tell, this place was pretty new. They're definitely on the right track so far. Even though the restaurant is small, its decor is very cute and relaxing. The owner and wait staff are all very nice and polite. Noodies is BYOB, so my friends and I picked up a bottle of wine from a store that was 20 steps away. The shrimp pad thai was delicious and perfectly done--not too dry or nutty and the shrimp was perfectly cooked. My friend got the shrimp cake appetizer, which came shaped around a sugar cane "handle". I had a bite and that was absolutely delicious. The prices are GREAT here, and I'll definitely be coming back. It stands out in a sea of Thai restaurants in the area.
