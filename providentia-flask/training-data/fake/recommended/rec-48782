I used to be a regular here when I lived in the area, and I still there go there occasionally.  I'm tolerant of gluten, but I love risotto, and this place satisfies the craving.  The risottos are flavorful and well-prepared.  The salads are quite good as well, although I can't finish both in one sitting.  A bit noisy, and crowded on the weekends, but it isn't the type of place you go for a romantic candlelit dinner anyway.
