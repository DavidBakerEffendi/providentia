It's a shame that my first experience eating halal was with The Halal Guys... I can't stand eating halal anywhere else! The Halal Guys are truly different, exactly as their sign states, "We are Different.' Personally the difference for me, is the seasoning of the chicken, the freshness of their veggies and inclusion of naan. (There are very few halal carts in the city, that serve naan with your halal.) And as disappointing as it may be to wait in a line, outside, the line moves QUICKLY. The Halal Guys is a def must for a quick, cheap and scrumptious eat!
