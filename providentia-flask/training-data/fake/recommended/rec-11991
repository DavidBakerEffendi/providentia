Food excellent, service eh...good brunch, and everyone seemed happy with the food. But service loof. Â Long time to place order, starter arrived with main course, place-setting not at the table until seconds before food, and maple syrup for pancakes and ketchup for potatoes arrived well after food served. Also confusing, server french press coffee pot for 2x price of drip coffee that comes with refills. Again, good food...just a bit disappointing on service and setup
