Another hidden gem! Petite Crevette has to be one of the cutest, coziest, romanticest restaurants I've eaten at and I'm so glad I decided to dine here after a fierce search on yelp for a Tuesday night dinner venue amidst Brooklyn. The waitress who was serving us that night had to be the politest, friendliest, sweetest waitress I've ever come across among all the restaurants I've been to. I don't think I've heard any one say "Thank You" as many times as she did within the two hours we were there. I ordered the cod entree with capers with mashed potatoes and side of vegetables. C ordered the pan seared talipia that also came with mashed potatoes and a side of vegetables. For an app, we shared a corn crab chowder. All were absolutely delicious. And on top of an already delightful meal, we stopped by the bodega across the street and had ourselves a six pack of beer to top off the perfect night. I'd dine at Petite Crevette again in a heartbeat.
