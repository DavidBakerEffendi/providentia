Great selection for restaurant week especially for $25! However I would've gave this rating all 5 stars for the delicious food but if I could, minus one and half stars! Why? .. Well a few friends of mine who been here on different days for lunch RW got to do the cereal&milk as a supplement charge for $3, which clearly states it on their menu for the restaurant week website.. Unfortunately they refuse to honor that for me for the supplement charge. They also ran out of the rabbit pasta when I arrived sigh, had my head set on that.. So my server did Â recommended the risotto which was just okay. Another thing is the service I received from my first server, rude vibe and didn't check up on us or anything. Overall I loved how everything on the plate compliments each other. My boyfriend's lamb ribs were very delicious, falling right off the bones with very minimum knife/fork work to it. I especially love their desserts(basil cream puff&frozen smore's YUM)though I payed a full $13 for the cereal&milk anyways.
