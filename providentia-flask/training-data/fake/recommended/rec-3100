Great burger, good place to catch a brew and some sports. Awesome bartenders and one of the last OG bars in the West Village. Been coming here since I was a shorty with my mom when I use to split a bistro burger with my sister cause it was too big for either of to eat by ourselves. Nothing fancy here just a good old fashioned NYC burger. My favorite burger in the whole city! If you ever get the chance it's a great place to have a nice quiet lunch and read the paper. One of my favorite lunch spots in all of NY.
