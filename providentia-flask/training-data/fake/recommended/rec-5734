A solid, if unspectacular alternative to some of the splashier Starr/Vetri/Garces restauants in Philadelphia. The staff is welcoming and the restaurant is attractive enough, with a nice second floor that affords a great view of 5th and Chestnut. Staff and service are a definite strong point. The drinks are wonderful, while the food is hit-or-miss, more hits than misses. A nice place for a second date. Jessie, the Austrailian bartender, my dear.. I have a huge crush on you.. and that accent. Our beautiful bartender sold me on the St. Rosemarys of which I had multiples.. even at 12/piece. My go to drink here.. give it a shot. I usually eat at the bar if Jessie is working and on my most recent visit, I had the  Smashed fingerling potatoes ($8),  Marrow bones ($9), and Pear salad w chicken ($15). The smashed fingerling potatoes were a pleasant surprise, the Marrow was rich and had a depth of flavors I had not experienced since Luke Palladino's and the Pear salad was the only low-point of the meal.. missing the mark the on both the dressing and flavors, the overcooked chicken didn't help either. Still a great value at $32, cheaper than most other comparable places in Philly for a proper three courses. Other than that salad, which I would not order again, I have had only positive experiences here both food and drink wise. Don't miss the rooftop, either!
