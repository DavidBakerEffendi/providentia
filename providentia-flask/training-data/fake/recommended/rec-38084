Barboncino is a pizza place in Brooklyn,NY and the pizza is made in a brick oven style for better taste. They have different types of pizza but the one I picked was with an Italian sausage and extra virgin oil and black pepper. The pizza was really good but a bit burned and I think over all the price are a bit high even though this place has a good night life feeling inside and has low lights make it very good place for a date or late night snack.
