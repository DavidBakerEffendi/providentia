Yes!!!! Finding a place in the city with great food and great costumer service is not the easiest, but I must say, I've found it. Byob, great food, LOTS of vegetarian options and pleasant servers make this place one of my favs!! We decided to come on Christmas Eve. This is actually my 2nd time here. I have no idea why I don't come more often. It's definitely a hidden gem.
