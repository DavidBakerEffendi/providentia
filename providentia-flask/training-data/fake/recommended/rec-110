I ordered tenders and fries last night.  It will be the last time I order from here. The garlic parmesan tenders were over fried to the point of having no taste or moisture, and sprinkled with some sort of powder that I can only assume was supposed to taste like garlic parmesan topping.  The fries I ordered with mild sauce and blue cheese.  I was given half a little cup of sauce, and no blue cheese.  Plus the fries were awful; soggy and flavorless. Perhaps if I were so drunk that I couldn't taste food and could brush off the resulting queezy feeling as a hangover...or if I ate there.  I leave these questions for someone else to figure out.
