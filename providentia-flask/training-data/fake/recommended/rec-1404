I'm a Philly girl. Therefore, I've tried out countless cheesesteaks from different places. This place is by far, one of the worst cheesesteaks I've ever eaten. For the prices they charge, I would think that the quality would be a little better. I still can't figure out what the hype is all about. Til this day, I still don't know. The meat is dry, big, and chunky. It's like they just chop the meat up, toss it on the grill, and leave the juices to drain for hours. I shouldn't feel like I will be choking everytime I bite and chew the darn thing. As for the cheese and mushrooms, tastes like it is straight from the can. The reasons why I'm giving it a 1 star is because: 1) there's no 0s and 2) the only thing that is yummy is the pickled peppers that sits on the outside part of Geno's with the condiments. Do yourself a favor and save your time and money. Definitely not worth it, this goes for tourists as well as the locals.
