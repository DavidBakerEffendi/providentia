Today went for the first time. I had a Cup of House Blend coffee & it was delish!!! Then I had a sweet crepe with Banana, Nutella, & whip Cream... It was amazing! Truly satisfied my sweet tooth! My Daughter loved it as well. My Husband had an orange & pineapple juice & before I could ask for a sip.. He drank it ALL! Pleasant staff & everything was nice & clean.. I will def go again!
