Wow!!!! 2nd time visiting The Red Stone Tavern and it was a 5 STAR HIT AGAIN!!! The 1st time my husband and I went, I had the Prime Rib and he had the Skillet Chicken Carbonara, which was amazing....On our 2nd visit we started with appetizers, Red Stone Lollipops, and the Crispy Calamari, (a choice of teriyaki sauce or marinara) which was absolutely FAB......DELICIOUS!!!! Then we ordered the California Pizza, which is with garlic oil, fresh mozzarella and avocado, topped with bruschetta..... (the pairing of all of these ingredients is GENIUS)...The atmosphere is beautiful, hip, and finally we found a restaurant with great music...Can't wait to go back.. P.S. The Bartenders are very knowledgeable, professional and MAKE A GREAT SANGRIA!!!
