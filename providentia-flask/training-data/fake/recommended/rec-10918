Went on a Sunday and got there at 1:30 to be the first to get a table.  As we waited, we chatted with the bartender Ariel, who is super nice and makes a great drink! There were 11 of us and we got seated right away.  We sat for a while drinking and having apps, and then order entrees.  The waitress was accommodating, if a bit pushy. Food was delicious. Very fresh! Some reviews comment on the price, but the portions are big enough to split. After we went downstairs and had pitchers of beer, which were reasonably priced, and played cornhole, which was free. We all had a great time! Trick is to get there early.  The vibe of the place invites people to sit longer then you would in a more traditional restaurant, which is why I think the waits are long.
