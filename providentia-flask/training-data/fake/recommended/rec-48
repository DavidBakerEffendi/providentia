Really hit or miss. First time got the Selcuk kabob which was delicious. Second time was unimpressed, it was an eggplant ground beef dish, can't remember the name. The service was pretty awful though. Our waiter was not only disgruntled the entire time but took calls on his phone while serving us, maybe it was business related but it didn't seem like it. Maybe he was just having a bad day. It was pretty junk service. I would've given this place 4 stars based on my first visit but the second visit averaged it out to a 3.
