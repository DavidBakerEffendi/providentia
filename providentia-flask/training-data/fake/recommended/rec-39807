I always enjoy peanuts and beer-who doesn't?  PLUS you can throw your peanut shells on the GROUND or at your friendly bar tender (not recommended;)  My friend tried this and was nearly thrown out..  But seriously, a fun place to go with the pals to chat about girls or to go with girls and talk about other girls. The best part is that you keep munchin' on those nuts until you have piles and piles of nut shells on the counter and the bar tender comes over to tell you to get your act together and throw that sh*t on the floor.  I end up eating the most nuts out of anyone, feeling sick and drowning my sickness in delicious ale. I feel weighed down the next morning, but it's all in good fun and I'm usually ready to do it again that evening.
