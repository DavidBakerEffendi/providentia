I'm hesitant to review because I LOVE THIS PLACE, but I love the owners, the food, the atmosphere, and the crowd, so I need to ensure PA never, ever, goes out of business. I've been going to PA for about 7 years now and have never been disappointed.  PA is a family owned place, it's red or white wine in a carafe (never insult by ordering off the list) and the food is to die for.  Let me recommend the meatball appetizer.  Everything else is equally amazing. As in Italy, they are closed on Monday and I recommend you make a reservation! Too boot, when you're done, load of great bars including the White Horse Tavern down the street.
