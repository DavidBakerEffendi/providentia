After seeing all the great reviews about this place, I really have to say I kind of expected more. The setting is very low-key (that's an understatement), and I'd even say divey in nature. Then I thought, maybe this means the food will be that much better and more authentic (after all, sometimes the best places are those that focus more on the food and less on decor).  I got the beef noodle soup, and while it was generally satisfying and tasty, it was by no means anything to write home about.  I've heard that lamb noodle soup in flushing is better, and I've certainly had better ramen in the city. I realize these are totally different cuisines, but I'm speaking generally in terms of noodle soups. The noodles were very good, and tasted extremely fresh, as were the green vegetables in the soup. There was a consistency to the noodles which was truly different and more interesting than your typical chinese noodle soup dish. However, the broth itself was really uneventful, tasting watery and lacking any real flavor. The beef also was a bit tough and unimpressive. However, if you are in the mood for a hot, bowl of soup, with some good noodles, a bowl of noodles here will definitely satisfy that craving and its definitely worth a try if you haven't been. And the prices can't be beat. Honestly, 5-7 dollars for a huge meal is pretty good in my opinion.
