I havent had many experiences with Xiao Long Bao but this place was by far the best i have eaten.  I am from Texas and there arent many good places to get it.  The soup was perfectly flavored and the meat was tender.  I was careful about how i picked up my dumpling so that it wouldnt break since the skin was rather thin.  This is actually a good thing for i have eaten some with thick skin which just wasnt my taste.  Overall it was one heck of an experience! NYC food is amazing
