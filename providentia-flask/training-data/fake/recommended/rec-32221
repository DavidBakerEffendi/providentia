This place is amazing! The people are generally super nice, except when it gets busy. The staff seems to get a bit flustered when it's a busy Saturday night but the food never falters as a result. The burgers are amazing.. my personal fav is the Kobe beef. The sauces are different and can get spicy so choose wisely! I love going here and will be more than happy to go every weekend just for the fries alone! I would recommend grabbing a burger and fries and drawing a picture to hang on their walls as a momento!
