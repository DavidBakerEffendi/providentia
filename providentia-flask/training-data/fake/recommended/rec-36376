This place almost reminds me of bottega louis in los angeles. the wait for a table was over an hour so the boyfriend and i decide to sit at the bar and eat. we started off with the chicken liver and foie gras mousse. i wasn't Â a big fan of it, maybe because just the thought of it being chicken liver grossed me out, but my boyfriend LOVED it. as my entree i ordered the eggplant sandwich and the boyfriend orders the duck confit. I thought my dish was very tast. i just wish there was more eggplant, but other than that i'd order the dish again. my boyfriend loved his dish too. he noted that the duck was very tender and moist. whenever we return to new york this is a place i would love to revisit. :)
