Went with friends on a Saturday night. Half the city was down the shore, so the place wasn't that crowded. The first of us to arrive made it clear we were there for drinks only, and the hostess said it was no problem. We were seated outside in the garden, and the waitress immediately became visibly annoyed that we were not ordering food. At no point during the 2+ hours we were there was there every a point where there weren't free tables, so it wasn't like we were preventing her from having customers who wanted to order a full meal. When we paid, she did not bring the change back, which is incredibly rude and presumptuous. So, very bad marks for service. Won't be returning any time soon.
