The service and food at Tinto were both incredible! My date and I made a last second decision to head to Tinto on a Saturday night, so we were lucky to get a table towards the end of the night. Though it looked like it had been a very busy dinner service, the wait staff was still as vigilant as I have ever experienced. When my date dropped her fork, there were two servers offering a new set of silverware literally within 4 seconds of hearing the metal hit the ground. When the kitchen made an order of prawns for another table by mistake, we were offered them on the house because it was our first time dining at the restaurant. Our waiter was attentive, yet knew how to keep his distance - perfect. I haven't even mentioned the food yet. The duck canape was absolutely delicious, and the baked foie gras was equally as impressive. Every dish we tasted was perfectly assembled to have savory and sweet notes with the right amount of acid. The mixture of textures made each dish complete (you MUST try the toffee and black pepper custard!) I just moved to Philadelphia from Washington DC, where I have been thoroughly impressed by restaurants in the past. I must say, Tinto has provided one of the best dining experiences I have ever had in any city, and has instantly become one of my go-to restaurants in my new town.
