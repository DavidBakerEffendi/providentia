This is my go-to bar in Philly.  I have taken all of my friends and immediate family here.  The blood orange margarita is fantastic, along with an awesome beer selection and cocktail list.  I have had almost everything on the menu and everything is delicious.  I recommend the thai wings, the fish tacos, and the tuna sandwich.
