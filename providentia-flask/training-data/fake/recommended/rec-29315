A buffet where you pay by the weight of your food can understandably draw some skepticism, but this place is phenomenal. I had chicken, beef, rice, and what l think was zucchini with a cheese topping. I got everything from the buffet and it was quality stuff. My friends waited to get beef from the actual barbeque and theirs was insanely good for the price. All around a great meal.
