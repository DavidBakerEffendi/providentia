CRAWFISH POT PIE.  GET IT.  Holy shit it's so good.  The creamy crawfish etouffe and the perfect crust of the pot pie.  Amazing.   We also got the fried catfish with hush puppies.  Awesome.  My friend got the bbq chicken special which must have been delicious because when I went to go sample a bite, it was all gone.  The Deep South cocktails were fantastic.  The vodka with honey syrup made it so easy to drink, that I downed 4 before I knew it. The mussels, however were just okay.  The mussels didn't taste that fresh for some reason.  And perhaps it just didn't seem as good because the pot pie was so phenomenal.   The service is friendly, the decor is really cute.  I can't wait to go back.  I think it will be my new neighborhood stop.
