Review for delivery: DON'T DO IT! DON'T. The quoted delivery time was a little over an hour, but the food took *over* two hours to get.  They were impossible to contact (not to mention they did not call us to warn of the late delivery and if they did I would have a better opinion of them).  I've honestly never had such a bad delivery experience - the driver even had the nerve to complain about the location of my house after arriving.  This of course had nothing to do with the wait, because they would only even leave the restaurant with the food once a delivery service intervened on our behalf.  The food was really stale once it arrived - potatoes that tasted old, etc. Nope - not getting food from here ever again.
