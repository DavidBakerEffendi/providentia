Not worth it.  Just another tourist spot.  If I "HAD" to choose one between the two "TOURIST" cheesesteaks then I would pick Geno's.  If I  had to choose, there would be so many others within downtown or other places I would go to before these 2 tourist cheesesteaks.  Don't know how they got famous, but I wouldn't go there again.
