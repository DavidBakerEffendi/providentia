I went here for brunch for a friends birthday. I made an open table reservation stating is a birthday and the individual was gluten-free. We were seated quickly, and we had out food quickly. The breakfast burrito and the gluten free ricotta pancakes were both extremely delicious. They do have a tofu scramble and vegan bacon if you looking for vegan options. I highly recommend this restaurant for those with food restrictions since they seem to be willing to work with you. Â  The food is decently priced and you get an decent portion. However, the drinks especially the brunch drinks are insanely expensive. 10 dollars for a mimosa or a bloody mary? What in the world is in them?! My Bloody Mary was almost the same amount as my breakfast. The services was unremarkably poor. Within two minutes of sitting down the waitress asked us if we were ready to order...umm no. She also never told us the specials. It's like there is an expectation that we are regulars. I also made an open table reservation stating is a birthday. Nothing was done. No cake, no happy birthday from the wait staff.. Nothing. Not even asking the birthday girl if she wanted a dessert. I was shocked. Most restaurants either provide a cake or at least say happy birthday. Also, just a weird incident. When my friend provided her ID to get a bloody mary. The waitress was like is this even real?!.... I am sorry my friend was from out of state. Next time I will only bring people from Pennsylvania.
