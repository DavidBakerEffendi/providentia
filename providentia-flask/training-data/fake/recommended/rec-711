After a year of living in Philly I promised to break my Vegetarian fast only to eat at Genos Steaks because of the fame, and notoriety from the Boyz II Men MowtownPhilly video in the 1990's.  The service was kind, and the steak sandwich tasted like a steak sandwich.  It had Cheese, Steak, Beef and bread the end. I felt good having gone to 9th street and Passyunk on a nice day. The worker even let me take a photo of him after I asked.
