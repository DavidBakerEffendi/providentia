Great spot for Ethiopian! Get the sambussas -- they're crispy, flaky, salty deliciousness. Â  If you can't decide, try the combo platter. It's an enormous amount of great food. Things tend to be spicy, which I love. Great service that's super friendly. And it's open late! Note: it's Amex or cash only here.
