This is by far the best kept secret in the Glastonbury area. The food is incredible and there is never a wait. Portions are large and prices are reasonable. The beer and wine selection is small but very inexpensive. If you are not concerned about atmosphere but want authentic Italian, this is your place. Takeout is also available if you live nearby. Like the previous reviewer mentioned - their chicken parm is outstanding. The small chicken parm grinder is made from the same recipe and is only $5.25 for the 8".
