I love this place! The outdoor seating in the summer makes this the perfect place to enjoy some margaritas outside in the warm weather with friends. Their food is great and me and a friend have come to the conclusion that it's impossible to leave this place without that "food baby" feeling. They also serve a variety of different margaritas such as my favorite flavor, blood orange. They are normally crowded during the weekend but that's to be expected. I've never tried their sister location in Northern Liberties but Cantina is worth checking out!
