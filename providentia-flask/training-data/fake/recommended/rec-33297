Came here to meet a friend for dinner. The ambience as others have noted is top notch. I had the paella. It wasn't the best I had ever had, but passable. Everyone else at the table really enjoyed their meal. My friend had the arctic char - she says it was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The bartender was very friendly and cool, rarely had to wait long for drinks. All in all, it was a very good experience.
