Formerly Caffe Rosso, this space has been transformed into a great little boite in the heart of the west village.  Be for-warned to book a reservation in advance; while dining there I saw many people just pop in hoping to score a table.  Instead, they scored a large bar tab for over a hour waiting for a vacancy. Yes this is owned by the Odeon folk - but far far better and more sophisticated is the kitchen.  I had the frisee with lardon and poach egg and the short ribs with a side of mash potatoes. ORDER A SIDE OF MASH - they are hands down the best in new york made with truffle oil..... The short ribs is a excellent choice as we are heading into the colder weather (forget the fact is has been so unseasonal at the moment) it is a VERY rich dish with a generous portion of hudson valley foie gras on top.......did not have the room for dessert however, it looked promising.  Give it a go, you won't be disappointed.
