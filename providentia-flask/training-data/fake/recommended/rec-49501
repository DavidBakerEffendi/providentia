I do not usually eat sushi, but I couldn't resist trying it after seeing the beautiful presentations.  It was not only delicious, it was healthy!  I especially want to thank one of the employees, Paul, who was very personable and was very informative about the menu when I asked.  He was so passionate about all the menu items and knew exactly what I would like!
