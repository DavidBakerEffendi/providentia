During my latest visit to the Big Apple (oh, how I miss you!), my bestie and I decided to find an Italian place to lay a good base for the evening.  We chose Uva as it is near her place.  We walked in and while it looked pretty busy, we were seated within seconds.   We got a table in the back corner, near a gaggle of girls, so I figured the service was not about to be good, but I was wrong.  It did take a few minutes for the unhurried waitress to stop by with menus, but she treated us well.  She even took my friend's phone to the bar because it needed charging and we couldn't find a plug near the table.   They did not have Red Bull, so my bestie ordered Captain and Coke and I ordered a red wine--it was good, I just don't remember it.  Hey, it was a long night!   Gnocchi was deemed the best base of the night, and behold: 2 gnocchis from which to choose!  So, we didn't choose, we ordered both and split them.  There was a parmesan truffle with chives gnocchi.  There was a red beet fingerling gnocchi in a gorgonzola cream sauce.  Both were amazing!  The food alone would make me come back for more, regardless of the thousands of other restaurants in NYC. Beyond the food, the service was very good as well.  The waitress knew that we were going to split the gnocchis, so she brought extra plates and helped us split the dishes as the table had limited space.   The atmosphere of the place was very warm and inviting too.  It was kidn of loud, but I liked the low lighting and the warmth of the extensive amount of wood in the place.  There is also a private room in the back and we agreed it would be a great place to have a rehearsal dinner.   Over all, this was a good experience and I have already recommended it to another friend of mine.  It was all about $60, which I thought was reasonable in NYC for this level of restaurant.
