It's probably for the best that I live outwith the delivery boundaries for this place or else I would be broke ordering all my lunches and dinners from here. I absolutely love the Nutty Buddy and the black bean and sweet potato brownies! Everything else I've had here is also fantastic but those are definitely at the top. Love Beyond Sushi for delicious guiltless eating!
