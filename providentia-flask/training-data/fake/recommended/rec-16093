Ok, seriously, this review isn't even needed because most everyone else has already told you the same thing: this place is SO GOOD! I'm always on the lookout for a Middle Eastern place that makes legit lamb shawarma (none that gyro meat business) and I think I've found the best one outside of the Middle East (and even better than some IN the Middle East). The falafel is good--damn good--but it's the shawarma that haunts me in my hungriest moments. And you get SO much for like $5...whaat?! Are we still in NY?? Skip the street vendor and hit up Mamoun's for some legit Arabic fast food!
