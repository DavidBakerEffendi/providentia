Came here on a Friday evening two weeks ago. Surprisingly at 630pm is when they open up the upstairs tables to accommodate even more people. Downstairs looked like it was catered to two people seaters. It was my first time dining at umami which was fairly easy to get to. ACE to west 4th and walk like 4 blocks. My two friends and I ordered the sweet potato fries and the truffle fries. I got the Especiale which was a truffle burger with a fried egg of top, my friend got the Royale which was topped with short ribs and my other friend just for the regular truffle burger. My especial came in at the same time as everyone else's burger with a U marking on top of the bun. The first bite was taken and the oozing of the egg was delicious with every bite. With the sides of sweet potato fries and truffle fries. My friend said the Royale with the short rib burger was kinda too greasy. For a girl who loves food, but not so much burgers. This was was an okay burger. We all left satisfied and full. I just couldn't manage to finish that last corner of the burger!
