I never had Japanese Ramen so a friend suggested we go to Ippudo two days ago.  And I'm glad she did. We met around 7pm on a Monday and had to wait about 20 minutes.. on a Monday.  It's pretty packed inside as are most places worth eating in NYC.  We ordered an appetizer of deep-fried pork belly wrapped around asparagus.  I don't know what the dipping sauce was made of but it was delicious. We both ordered ramen, my friend had the Shiromaru which had a slightly cloudy broth (maybe had a little miso).  I tried some and it was pretty good.  I had the Tori which is a clear broth with pork loin, spinach, bamboo, and some daikon.  I loved the Tori Ramen.  We topped both ramen soups with a poached egg (I grew up eating ramen with a poached egg), egg with ramen is nostalgic for me so I consider it standard fare- unless you don't like eggs, of course.  I also ordered the kakuni topping (braised pork belly, another nostalgic flavor for me) which actually came on the side (more on that later). The service was great, the staff was courteous and on top of things (in a good way).  Going back to the kakuni- when my food came out, the chef came over to tell me why it was in a side dish.  He explained that the Tori had a lighter flavor than the heavier kakuni so he didn't want to mix them.  He wanted me to be able to try the Tori first to get its flavor and leave it up to me whether I wanted to mix them.  I'm glad he did that because I wound up keeping them separate since they each had different distinct flavors.  Had he mixed them, the original Tori flavor would've been overpowered by the kakuni and been lost.  The Tori was amazingly light yet very flavorful. My mouth is watering a little writing this review, it's a good thing I'm heading back down to NYC this weekend.  I will definitely head to Ippudo for one of the meals. Highly recommend this place if you like noodles in soup.
