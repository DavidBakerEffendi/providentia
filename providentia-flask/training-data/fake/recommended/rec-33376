me and my waspy boyfriend love to come here and eat like 4 dozens of oysters with some sparkling bottle of white colors. strongly recommend, everything on the menu is always good. a nice willisburgy ambience, plus the little shop they have where you can buy The Innocence Mission uniform, which you can wear to look relevant in organic stores and the like.
