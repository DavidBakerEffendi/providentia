Ate at the bar during the weird lull between lunch and dinner (to avoid the crazy wait I'd heard about). The bartenders were nice, though not the most attentive servers. I had the Hatch Burger which is GREAT for a Hatch lover. Lots of chiles that meld with deliciously melty cheese. The burger was a little under medium in my opinion. Also had the shoestring fries with the four dipping sauces (I saw other people with sauces, but I had to ask). The garlic aioli was definitely the best. The zesty orange one and the jalapeno were disappointing. The biggest drawback of this place for me in the decor/vibe. It's such a "buzzy" burger joint right now and If I'm going to pay $12 for a burger, I'd kind of like to enjoy it in a restaurant that has better tables and chairs than my local Arby's. There was just something off about the "look." I'd come back to try the Truffle Burger, but frankly, I'd rather pay a little less and eat a Shack Burger in Madison Square Park with a pigeon as a dining companion.
