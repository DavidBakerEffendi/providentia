I've been looking for a great green juice place for a while (Claire's is just not adequate and the prices?! no thank you!) and I stumbled in after my early morning hair appointment in the area. I had the chance to meet the owner who was super friendly and helpful. I got their all green juice (can't remember the name) with an apple added and sandwich - I honestly can't remember which I had but it was very good. The juice was everything I wanted! I tried them again a week later and was met with the same friendliness by the guys working. A sucker for anything citrus and/or ginger I tried the Cold Fighter (I think that's the name) and the Pink Magic wrap - both were pretty damn tasty. My only complaint is that they aren't closer to me!
