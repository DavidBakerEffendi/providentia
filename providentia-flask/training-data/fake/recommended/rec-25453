I stuck to the basics just to try Maddy's out. I ordered via delivery. Very polite on the phone and great customer service. They forgot my chips and promptly delivered them and some extras upon me notifying them of the error. I ate the chicken tacos and some guacamole with chips. The guac was great, chips a little bland but appeared to be home made, which is always a great thing. They were not greasy, which is a positive. The tacos were really good. They were the real deal with slices of grilled meat and soft shells. The shells were not fried. For $7 you get four tacos. I could have eaten more. I do wish i had the option to add a few toppings like cheese and shredded lettuce. Some authentic tacos come like that, some do not. I will try Maddy's again.
