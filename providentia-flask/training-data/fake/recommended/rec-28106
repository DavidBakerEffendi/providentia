I looooove this place! The kimchi grilled cheese is out of this world. Like legit... It's a party in your mouth! Tomato soup is delicious! My only complaint is that I didn't find this place sooner!! Staff is wonderful, food is great, atmosphere is amazing and the music is phenomenal. If you haven't been here... There is something wrong with you!!!!!
