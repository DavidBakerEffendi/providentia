Ordered all things chorizo. It was all delicious. Overall we enjoyed everything we had. We split all the paninis and crostinis between the adults, they cut the paninis into fours for us. We went as a group of five, which included a two year old. Â They accommodated well with a high chair. We had to wait twenty minutes for a table, it was 7:30 on a Saturday evening. The staff was friendly and offered great recommendations.
