Good food, really really filling, even though I was starving when I got there, nice service too, really can't complain about anything. I had the Akamaru, the soup was really satisfying! We also had the pork Hirata buns, really good, a little overpriced though. Line took a little while, but that's to be expected. Luckily my party got there a little earlier than most, around noon, and by the time we came out around 2:30-3:00pm, the bar/waiting area was packed.
