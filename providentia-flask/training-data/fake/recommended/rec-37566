Best Sichuan food I've had in Chinatown.  Was in town last night and found the other place I planned to go had closed.  E Mei is one I had not tried yet.  Just looking at their menu got me hooked. I knew it would be very authentic when I noticed that I was the only non-Asian person in the restautant. Stay away from the "American Chinese" dishes. They are available anywhere.  Go for the more traditional Chinese dishes.  As always, be warned that some of them can be really spicy and oily, so if you have a sensitive stomach proceed with caution. I ordered the dandan noodles and they are the best I've had anywhere. I also ordered the fuqifeipian (tripe and cold beef in chili oil), the sea cucumber, and the sweet rice ball soup. All were excellent. This was the first time I had Sichuan style sea cucumber. I've had it at Shanghai style before but liked this more. This will be my new regular spot. I found several other items on the menu I will go back for and the Sichuan hotpot  looks great but is a very large portion.
