I always get the extra spicy here, and while it certainly packs a punch it is far from an obnoxious test of  fortitude.  In short, it might be the most perfectly seasoned piece of chicken I've ever eaten.  It's also nicely brined, so it's always perfectly moist and meaty. Points off only for: 1)  Mac & cheese that's fair at best.  Skip it, get the excellent butterbeans instead. 2)  Service that's often haphazard, which is fine at a place like this as long as it's always is upbeat and friendly, which it is 80% of the time, but 20% of the time it can be attitude-y.  (Probably if you go here a lot, or work here, you know exactly who I'm talking about...) 3) Portion size is small: you're charging $13, give me half a chicken, not 3/8ths of a chicken!
