Misery Loves Co. is an old-school red truck that you might find parked at Burton, Maglianero Cafe or in front of the Champlain Mill in Winooski. The food that is created in this vehicle is simply amazing. On any given day you may find on offer a delicious burger, The Saltie (with salt cod fritters), Porchetta, and the best fries to be had in Chittenden County. They are served with an old bay aioli and fried with fresh sage leaves - amazing and addictive. The people behind Misery Loves Co. have done stints at various local restaurants, and are obviously too talented to not eventually find their way to their own brick & mortar place. But for now keep an eye out for the red Winnebago and enjoy the delicious stuff being handed through the window.
