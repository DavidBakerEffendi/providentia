My boyfriend and I have been here a couple of times. This past weekend, we stopped in for a beer and a snack on a Saturday afternoon. The drafts are reasonably priced. I think the Kenzinger is $3 and my bf and I each had drafts that were $4 and bangin'. Â I drank the Saucony Creek Cucumber Kolsch. Both the grilled and sauteed sardines ($4 each) were delicious, and we also tried the fried ribs appetizer (also $4) OMG. Total drool moment thinking about those right now. They are basically two little deep fried pork chops served with some excellent pickles. Fantastic place.
