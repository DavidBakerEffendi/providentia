I got the Pad Thai here because that's really the only thing I get at Thai places. It was really good I must admit. Went with my friends about a month ago randomly. Now that I think of it, my friend got the pad thai too, I showed him how to sprinkle the peanuts. He also greatly enjoyed it and would like to go back sometime before our social securities expire. My other friend got some big plate with a bunch of different things going on but he said he enjoyed it. Very nice decor too.
