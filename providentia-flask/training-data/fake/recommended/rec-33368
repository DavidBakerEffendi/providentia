By far the best Italian I've had in as long as I can remember. The cheeses are So delicious, the veggie appetizers as well.very good wines, concise list. The summer squash pesto pasta was so incredible. Amazing flavor and so light- not a heavy pesto pasta that sits for ever in your stomach. I could've eaten another plate. The prices are not bad- it's well worth it, and the service was very good. The space is also so beautiful! I can't help but write a highly positive review. The one thing I didn't love was the Honey pie- it had a weird taste and was not as good as other honey pies I've had (like the one at smile to go in soho which is incredible). Either way, I Â can't wait to go again.
