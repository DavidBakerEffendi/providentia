Wish I can say better since the food is amazing. But the service is super slow, spotty and not the friendliest. Used to come here a few years ago, somehow think it was better. Waitress was bitchy about everything, including us asking about our order that taking 45+ minutes. Their brunch is "all-inclusive" which means like it or not, you're going to drink a cup of coffee and a mimosa and shell out a few extra $. Meh just about sums it up. Great food + shitty experience = I'd rather go elsewhere.
