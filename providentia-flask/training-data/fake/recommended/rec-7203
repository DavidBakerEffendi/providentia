I went to Red Hook Lobster Pound on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon and really enjoyed the meal we had. I ordered the Connecticut style lobster roll and also had sweet potato fries and potato salad. The lobster was delicious as was the potato salad. Everything was seasoned very well. The sweet potato fries were ok - i would have loved some type of dipping sauce that wasn't ketchup. The only thing i would change would be the temperature of the roll. It's advertised as a warm roll but it seemed like the lobster had actually been cold with warm butter poured over it. It would have definitely been a five star meal for me had the entire sandwich been warm. I definitely will be back! The lobster salad looked incredible and I also want to try the corn.
