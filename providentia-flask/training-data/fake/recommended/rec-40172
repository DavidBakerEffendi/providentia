My experience at this Honey Grow location is much more positive. Â  The food at both locations is great, but the Rittenhouse location has a better energy and the team seems genuinely happy to be there and to see you. It makes a huge difference. Four stars and not 5 because the waits are, while inevitable, a pain in the neck!
