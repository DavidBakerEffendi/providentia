Their chocolate creme brulee was delicious. I love all things chocolate and this was like a dense chocolate mousse with that creme brulee finish on top. The caramelized top wasn't great though, but it didn't really matter since the inside was good. Really great beer selection too if you like beer. Good place to hang out with friends.
