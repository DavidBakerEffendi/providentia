Went here for brunch this morning. Although there was a wait, the eggs Benedict with bacon were well worth the wait! For dessert I had the Nutella-Banana crepe and its was literally out of this world. Im afraid to think about the amount of calories I consumed...but it was well worth it! Don't expect to be seated here right away for weekend brunch. It seems to be a popular spot & there was a wait. However, the hostess who takes down names is incredibly sweet & gives an approximate wait time along with options for accommodation. Service was great. Definitely will be back.
