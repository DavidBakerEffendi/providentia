The food is bad. The chicken tacos were gross. They were overly sweet with no complex flavors what-so-ever, which is super disappointing for a restaurant with the word "taco" in the name. The tacos even made the most delicious cheese ever, cotija, rendered nearly useless, as there was nothing savory or salty to bring out the full cotija deliciousness. The meat was also cubed instead of shred...weird. I get tacos 100x better from a Boston taco truck. Think about that, bartaco, and add some flavor to your food! The corn was also meh, but not as confusing as the tacos. The guacamole was great. The margaritas were out of this world delicious. I will come back for guac and margs, but there is no way I could subject myself to another meal here.
