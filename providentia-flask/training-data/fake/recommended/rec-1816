Awful. Clear contempt for the customer. Terrible people working here - just the worst service I have seen. I felt I was doing them a favor by patronizing their shop. After ordering 4 cheesesteaks - 2 prov/2 American, "with" (onions) I went to order fries and sodas at the next window. Lady didn't want to help, asked me "is that all you want?", "are you sure now?" with attitude like woahhh. Another patron was told not to use napkins from the stall b/c he was carrying a pats steak, although he also had one from Geno's in hand. Staff is not customer-friendly, especially for a place that considers itself (or should) a tourist spot. The food itself is garbage. Tepid meat, greasy, greasy onions. Nothing else offered. To give you an idea of the kind of place this is, flyers on the window read: "Speak English, this is America"     and "I want my country back!" I didn't like this place.
