4 stars for their happy hour, which is the best I have seen. This place should be packed every evening from 4 to 7. All martinis, even top shelf, are four dollars and for a very nice sized drink. Not your every day 4oz martini glass. Also $2 to $3 beers, in the bottle, make this place a steal. The bartender is nice, pleasant and mixes a good drink and you dont need to speak Portugese. The tapas menu on Tuesdays are two for one which makes it an even better place to be on this day. Not all shine like the sun, but at least like a nice full moon on a cloudless night. Try the sliced apples with manchego cheese and olive oil. Out of this world for a simple dish. Shrimp and garlic, which is offered in like only a thousand places in Newark is very good. The garlic is roasted first and then combined with the shrimp. Pure garlic heaven. If they offer Rock and Roll Shrimp as a special, it is a must order. These are the highlights but nothing is not at least good. And two for one makes a great bargain.
