Came here after trying to go to Little Owl and finding out it was closed for an event. Typical NY brunch spot except no wait at 11:30 on a Saturday! Amazing! I got the pancakes which were delightful and received high praises from the waitress. Bill came out to ~$70 for a side of fruit, 2 entrees, and 2 glasses of mimosas.
