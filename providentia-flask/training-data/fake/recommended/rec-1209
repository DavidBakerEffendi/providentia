The best part of any Mexican restaurant is the guac. El Camino's guac and chips are horrendus. The chips are spicy due to whatever spice they sprinkle on it and on top that it's too salty Their guac is watered down and the texture isn't that great. It's mush. They do have great HH Margarita specials although I tend to shy away from them because they're very VERY very strong. Great hang out spot in the summer but gets too crowded.
