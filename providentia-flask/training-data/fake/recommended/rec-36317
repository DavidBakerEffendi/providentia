I have been wanting to try these donuts ever since I heard about them on Roadfood.  There were 4-5 options the morning I went (Mounds, Turtle, Butter Crunch, Glazed and maybe another chocolate).  I was hoping for one with some sort of fruit or vanilla flavor and ended up getting the butter crunch. The butter crunch was super sweet - one bite and you can feel the sugar melting in your mouth.  I was worried about going into sugar shock it was that sweet.   One donut can easily be enough for 2 people. Since the reviews on the coffee are not that great  - I went with tea - they have 5-6 options with tea - Stash and other brands.  I was happy with the raspberry pomegranate. Service was 5 stars - they were so kind - the service makes me want to come back and try something else that will not be as sweet.
