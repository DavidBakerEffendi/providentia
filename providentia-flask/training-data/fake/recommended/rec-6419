We had no reservation in a saturday night and we waited 10 minutes to be seated at the corner of the main bar. This is a total spectacle. It's like watching the Cirque du Soleil in a japanese bar. You should make a reservation in the counter bar, in front of the food. The concept in Robataya is yakinuku, a Japanese grill, real japanese food.   Food becomes theater, it's show business made japanese grill. The place is the show, to seat at the bar and hear all the staff screaming. it's definitely a Sakagura in the East Village.  The beef was vey good, the sake was ok. The total for two was $265 including tip, not so pricey next to the midtown japanese joints.  The two chefs exchange places every hour or so, and they seat in a very special way while they cook, very original. There was Lucy Liu, there was a surreal moment when a german group in the bar started singing in german all together. I would recommend it for a first time dinner. i'll come back after eating in the other 10 japanese places that are around 9th and 10th streets, between 2nd and 1st.   Original and entertaining. Once your food is ready, it is delivered to you on this really long paddle by the kneeling chefs.  It's full of energy, it doesn't disappoints,   The food is simple: a grilled shrimp and king crab with salt and lemon. Nothing special, overpriced. Yakiniku rocks.
