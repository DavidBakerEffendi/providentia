Grabbed a quick lunch here, based upon Yelp.  The place is a friendly sushi environment, with good service.  The food was excellent.  We had a couple of rolls to start (spicy tuna and sweet potato tempura).  The spicy tuna was ample, but could have been a bit spicier for my taste.  The sweet potato tempura roll was excellent.  I then had the bento box lunch - teriyaki salmon - which came with an excellent miso soup and a nice salad with carrot ginger dressing.  The salmon was great, though a bit thin for my tastes - but the california roll, shumai, rice and orange slices were great.  Excellent lunch, quick service, good value.  Nice job!
