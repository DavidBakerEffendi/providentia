Everyone knows bones are flavor, that's why we COOK with them. But, we don't serve them in most things. I asked about bones in the soup, because I've been served Mexican soups with lots of bones in them before. They told me I'd get all breast. I did, but with bones. Then, to my dismay, I bit into a big chunk of bone in a tamale, hurting my tooth. Apparently this style of tamale gets bones because two out of three had them. I imagine that's traditional, but people want to enjoy their food without being on the lookout for bones constantly.
