If you're going for drinks, you should be fine, just expect to overpay for the location (right across from Union Transfer). They have a decent beer list, too. Unfortunately, that's not what my party did. The food was overpriced and not especially edible. I ordered the chicken gyro--the pita bread was so dry it crumbled apart when I tried to pick the gyro up, and the chicken was dry, overcooked, and tasteless. I sent it back and ordered the truffle mac & cheese instead, which was good but overpriced. My friend got a side of sweet potato fries, and instead of being sliced to the expected size of french fries, they looked like the chef had haphazardly quartered a whole sweet potato and dropped the chunks into batter--the entire side order consisted of 4-5 fries, and they didn't taste good. The service was slow, and I had to argue with the waitress and a manager who wanted me to pay for the gyro (which I sent back) and the mac & cheese, even though the waitress had offered to replace the gyro without extra charge, as it was so poorly cooked.
