The sauce, the sauce, the sauce.  I start there because that is what my taste buds and soul fell in love with right away.  However, if you appreciate good brick oven pies, you soon focus on the finely developed crust...they say its the NYC water...i say its years of dedication. Decided to order the standard Margherita and added sausage and olives.  The sausage is mild and subtle but the olives provided a nice saltiness that only added to the sweet yet tangy sauce.   Great place, solid service.  NYC staple.
