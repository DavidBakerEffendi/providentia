It's been a while since I took my Top-Chef-crazed hubby here, but the memory of an incredible meal is difficult to erase with time. Perilla does an exquisite job creating an atmosphere that is both upscale classy and relaxed, with food that is artfully prepared and oh-so-satisfying. It is truly an experience to enjoy a meal here. While I will admit that some of our dishes were saltier than we'd have liked, the overall presentation, originality, and TASTE make this place a definite win. Of course we went for the highly celebrated duck meatballs (with a poached quail egg on top, because, why not?). I don't even like spicy foods, and found these to have just perfect flavor. We also opted for the edamame falafel. I love edamame, and I love falafel, but who on earth other than Harold Dieterle would think to combine the two?! Genius. The entrees we ordered don't appear to be on the current menu. I had the braised elk osso bucco (I remember ordering it because a) I had never had elk before and b) I had no idea what on earth osso bucco was). So tender, so rich. My husband had some amazing stuffed pork loin dish (also not on the menu anymore). We were so completely stuffed from dinner that we couldn't muster the strength for dessert. The wine list is pretty solid as well. And if you feel unsure of what to order, the waiters can make good recommendations. It was suggested to us to get a Cotes du Rhone by Petit Chapeau - it paired perfectly with our food. Can't wait to think up an excuse to come back again soon!
