I made a quick lunch stop in philly and was told to try this place instead of johns roast pork.  While i cant speak on how good johns roast pork is, this burger was definitely a good decision. Their burgers are huge, 1/2lbers.  It was juicy and not dry.  I got the cyclops burger which had bacon and a fried egg...love the runny yolk.  I put ketchup on the burger, but i felt it didnt do it justice.  I probably shouldve asked for one of their sauces, like the aoli to give it a little kick.  My mistake. I was a little dissapointed with the fries though.  They were thick cut, but not really crispy.  We got it with green chili cheese, so it was definitely tasty, but I definitely wouldve prefered crispier fries. Overall the place was really good and with their multiple burger combinations its worth a repeat visit.
