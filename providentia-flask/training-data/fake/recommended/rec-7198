100% Lobster. No non-sense, no gimmicks. Actual conversation (verbatim) between my friend, the owner, and the cute girl at the counter: Owner: What brings you guys into town? Friend: We're visiting from out of town, I kind of do this every year. Owner: Well, happy holidays, man. You plan on getting merry sometime later? Friend: Yeah, probably later on in the evening. *Owner pours us a cup of cider from the back table* Owner: Why don't I get you all started early? Friend: Hey, that's pretty good! Owner: Yeah? *points to the cider* I MADE this shit. Counter Girl: *glares at owner somewhat sheepishly* ...Good for you! Everything about this establishment is real, and what you see is definitely what you get here. I split a Connecticut and a Maine with my buddy, and each bite was exactly what you'd expect from a beautifully constructed lobster roll; I loved each and every warm, zesty, buttery bite of the Connecticut--The succulent and creamy bite that the lobsters piled to heaven on the Maine roll is also a foodgasm that's hard to beat. We also tried their lobster bisque and clam chowder, both every bit as amazing as their sandwich counterparts; I'm going to have to try their hot dog offerings the next time I'm back on this side of the city.
