I'm surprised they listed this restaurant as Korean. It's not Korean just because it's run by someone who's Korean. It's more asian-fusion. Either way, their pork belly is obviously amazing and drool-worthy. But everything else was somewhat mediocre. Their dessert was interesting - and definitely enjoyable. We got the 3 course Lunch menu and didn't leave feeling fully satisfied or fully disappointed. Kind of a mediocre review, for a mediocre restaurant.
