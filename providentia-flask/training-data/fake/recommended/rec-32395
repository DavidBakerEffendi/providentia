After moving in the area I decided to check out The Venice. Staff is extremely friendly and so is the crowd. I go there with my husband and daughter on Wednesdays (half price bar menu) for a quick delicious bite to eat at a great price! I also have gone here with my parents and/or friends when a band is playing. Crowd is mixed which allows any individual at any age a great night out!
