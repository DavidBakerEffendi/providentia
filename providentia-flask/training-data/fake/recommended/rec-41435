Went to Noodies again on October 5th and had another great experience. Was a little suspect because of the reviews stating that things went downhill after an ownership change.  In any event, service was very nice and attentive. Food was quick and fresh.  The Thai fried rice and drunken noodles were the favorites. Also tried the soft shell crab in basil sauce, and have to say it was real tasty.  Will definitely go back to Noodies.
