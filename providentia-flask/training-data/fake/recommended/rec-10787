Brooklyn Star is one of those places that reminds me why I started eating meat again. Holy goodness. I ordered the whole roasted trout. It was prepared so well...with a very spicy tomato chutney and roasted redskin potatoes. It was really hearty, but so incredibly fresh. It was uncomplicated food, done simply, appreciating all the correct flavors and textures that compliment each other well. I also tried some of the pork chop, which I have to say, was one of the best I've ever tried. Bonus: they serve things like kool-aid and dr. pepper. They were also playing some killer tunes while I was there. All around, an amazing spot.
