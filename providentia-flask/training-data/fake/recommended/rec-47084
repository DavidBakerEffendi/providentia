Oh man, I love this place! All you need to rustle up is a ten dollar bill from your wallet and a bottle of wine stashed in your fridge somewhere (BYOB) and you can expect an awesome, satisfying, authentic Malaysian cuisine experience.  Did I mention it's cheap? I've had the Thai basil noodles (love me some wide noodles, see pic another review posted) and the pad thai, both are first rate.  (Although, have you ever had *bad* pad thai?  Neither have I.) The service is fast which makes it a good choice for working peeps on their lunch breaks.  Also, it might have been a coincidence, but I've been here 3x and each time it was crawling with large groups of men...so single ladies take note.  (Although, if I'm there I'm pretty much engrossed in my bowl of noodles--not exactly a man magnet situation.  Oh well.)
