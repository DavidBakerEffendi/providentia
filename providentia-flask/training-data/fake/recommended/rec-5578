I visited Philadelphia for the first time this weekend, and for our first night out we decided to eat at the Continental Midtown.  A close friend recommended this restaurant to us.   My sister and I could not get over how amazing this experience was.  Not only was the staff very sweet and polite, but the ambiance and decor was impecable. I absolutely loved the retro/contemporary decor but the swinging chairs were fabulous! The serving size was perfect for sharing, the food was absolutely delicious and the special cocktails were out of this world!!!  I thought the night couldn't get any better, then we ordered desert.  We ordered multiple dishes and I couldn't get enough.  This restaurant receives 5 stars in my book. Definitely recommend the Continental Midtown!
