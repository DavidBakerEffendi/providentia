The only reason why I'm giving this place four stars instead of five is because of the wait, and because it is cash only. I refuse to wait 2+ hours for anything. A friend and I were searching for a good place to have late brunch. We called Clinton St Bakery and like a christmas miracle the host said that there was no wait but brunch would be ending in 30 minutes. One hectic cab ride from mid town to les that took a total of 8 minutes and we were there. We were seated quickly, my friend had some intense french toast confection, I went with potato fritters and eggs with cheese grits. The portions are great, service was friendly and I would love to be lucky enough to catch this place on the weekend without an insane wait.
