Let me start off by saying the staff was great, however, if you're looking for a good meal this is NOT the place. WASTE of money....I had 2 glasses of beer n my girlfiend had 2 glasses of wine, we did not order appetizers or desert, and our bill came in at $140 and I left hungry. Hit McDonalds on girard and called it a night. Never will I go back
