Some of the best food I've ever had and like nothing I've tried before (and I'm a very well-rounded eater). I ordered the Spicy Mang roll per the friendly owners recommendation. Black rice, avocado, mango, cucumber, spicy veggies, and toasted cayenne sauce. Colorful and delicious. So, 5 for food and 5 for service. Needless to say I recommend this place. Pick the Spicy Mang roll, you won't be disappointed.
