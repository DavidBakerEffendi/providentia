Yes, I'm definitely a fan of this hole in a wall located in Olde City! I love this area of Philly too. So much history and oozing with character! Anyway, only had 2 cheese steaks in Philly. In the airport (big mistake, bleh!) and Sonny's... The cheese steak (classic) here is pretty darn good if you ask me. Bread was fresh and soft, meat was tender and not dry, and grilled to order! Flavor was great! My brother couldn't get enough of their fries too! Crunchy, very good! So, when you're in Olde City to soak up some history... drop by here. You wont be disappointed!
