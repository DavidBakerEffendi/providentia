This place used to be reliably fantastic but the food has gone WAY down hill in the last few months.  Tasteless chicken (NO flavor), luke warm food, and, at one point, corn that tasted canned.  The service is hit or miss, mostly miss with a staff that seems genuinely confused by what the words "customer service" actually mean.  My friends and I used to go at least once a week, but after a long string of bad service and worse meals, we've stopped going.  Too bad because the space is great, and it's close to the C train.
