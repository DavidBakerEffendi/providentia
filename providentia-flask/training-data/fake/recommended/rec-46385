Great decor and excellent service. I really enjoyed the beet appetizer. The chicken was juicy and perfectly cooked; unfortunately it was so salty it was inedible. My one regret is I didn't send the dish back to the kitchen. The recommended bread pudding dessert was just so-so. No alcohol was consumed and the meal was around 58/person. It might have been worth it if the chicken wasn't so salty.
