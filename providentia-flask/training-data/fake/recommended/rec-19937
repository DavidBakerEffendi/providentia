Wow, everything I ate was amazing.  I had the roasted pumpkin and sweet potato soup appetizer (amazing, the rosemary and apple butter toast was the perfect pairing for the soup).  Then I had the fried chicken.  The second best fried chicken I have ever had and the sauce made the chicken absolutely perfect.  I'm usually not a fan of pecans, but the pecan pie sunday was gone before I knew what happened.  Extraordinary dinner!  The service was great too, whenever my drink started getting low I had a new drink at my elbow.  I even loved the decor.  This place is amazing, you have to go.
