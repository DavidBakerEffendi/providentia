Don't expect cleanliness in the dining area, a premium location or service with a smile. It's a hole-in-the-wall. Duh. Ok now onto the undeniable facts about this place. The pork fried dumplings ar 5/$1 and taste like heaven. Literally give the man at the counter $1, and he hands you dumplings. The Sesame pancake with peking duck is killer as well. They're fresh and the bread is super soft. Think fried pizza dough. And they peak out at a whopping $1.75. Do it. If you're stumped at where to grab a quick bite, hop on the subway and hit this place up. You won't regret it.
