Amazing atmosphere... Went there for dinner w/ my boyfriend on a sat. nite. We had a reservation for 10.15pm and we got a cute table right next to the performers! I really enjoyed the show - the performers passion was almost touchable and it filled the small busy space! In terns of food, the seafood platter was great (octopus was amazing)! Other things, the shrimp in garlic sauce was great! Highly recommend this spot!
