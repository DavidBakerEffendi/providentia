I heard that this place was just as fun for adults as it is for kids....so I'm guessing kids must be having 0 fun here! Ive wanted to visit Nomads for a long time now so I brought my boyfriend in to escape the heat for a bit and was extremely disappointed. First off we decided to play black light mini golf which was set up terribly, there is a gap in both sides of each hole so balls get lost constantly. Then we moved on to the arcade where our "quest cards" rarely worked on the machines that weren't broken...... We ended up leaving with plenty of money left on our cards (which we through away). Cool idea but seriously bad follow through!
