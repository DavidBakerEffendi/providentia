I dined at Dish for the first time on Monday night. Headed back from the Big E and surprisingly not full from the food, it was late night and quite quiet, but the bartender didn't hesitate to make us feel comfortable and offered us the menu as he told us about some of their specialty drinks. I ordered a watermelon-basil (I believe) cocktail and it was very fresh and sweet, I enjoyed it. I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant, and the layout of the big bar that was very uniquely designed. I ordered the Caesar salad and calamari appetizer, and my boyfriend ordered a little cheese pizza and sweet potato fries. My calamari was PERFECT, and I try calamari almost everywhere. It was served with a marinara with a kick, drizzled with a creamy sauce on top of the marinara. Caesar salad was tasty too, perfect amount of dressing and croutons. The bartender was very friendly and made us feel like regulars, he did a great job. We will definitely be back.
