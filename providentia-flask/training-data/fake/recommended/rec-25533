What can one say about Maggie. Â As a veteran of the Yale food carts, I can clearly say that Peking Edo is the best food they have to offer. Maggie, the cook, always greats you with a smile. My typical meal is the $3 dumplings and Asian BBQ pork soup. The food, which is obviously cooked with a lot of heart and soul, is very tasty every time I have gone to this cart. Never has Maggie let me down. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone trying out the carts!
