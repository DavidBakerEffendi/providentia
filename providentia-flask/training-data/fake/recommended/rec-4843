Offensively bad service.  They definitely cater to the "table of 10 undergrads who are allegedly 21, but judging from the plastic handle of vodka and case of orangina i have my doubts" kind of crowd.  There used to be a very sweet hostess who was great, but this month there is a vile young lady at the door who has literally zero respect for anyone.  It used to be worth it to go to this place with friends because if you have enough bottles of wine the food starts tasting average, but the service has gone downhill so badly (a lot of the waitstaff has swapped out) that it's not even worth it anymore.  Protip: Go to Melograno on Sansom.  It's an Italian BYO that does everything 10 times better.  Unless you're 20 and with 14 of your closest friends from your dorm hall.  Then go to La Viola after pregaming.
