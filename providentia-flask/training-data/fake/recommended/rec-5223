the service was excellent. the atmosphere was good enough although too dimly lit. the meals were very tasty, the pricing was overboard. it's simply too expensive. like most places in princeton. does affluence make people stupid? apparently. these same people own the fish market that adjoins the restaurant. i went in one day and got 1 swordfish steak and 1 cod fillet, the guy at the counter told me my total was $48. are they smoking crack in the walk in? i told him to unwrap it and put it back on display i went to the shop rite and purchased comparable (i swear) goods for $23. jersey fresh farm market on rt. 1 south in south brunswick, by the old j&j plant, has EXCELLENT quality fresh fish and decent prices.
