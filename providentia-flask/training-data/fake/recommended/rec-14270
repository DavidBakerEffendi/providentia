Some people think this place is overrated (Chris, my boyfriend, is one of those people).  I think it's worth the wait, especially since it's literally a block down from Chris' house.  Their burgers are juicy and delivered really quickly (which is a good thing because you most likely waited an hour to get a table).  The best day to go is probably Sunday...if you go around brunch time, it's absolutely empty and you can get in and out within half an hour.  Their fries are unsalted, so don't be surprised if they're super plain.
