The cabbage. No one ever talks about cabbage, why would they? But seriously the cabbage served with boar belly bacon and scallion pur√©e made my night. The wine list is interesting (all organic & additive free). I found the staff to be knowledgeable and super friendly. Really cool spot for a night of epicurean delights. Also they aren't cash only anymore! Go eat there now.
