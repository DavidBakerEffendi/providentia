Do not be fooled by the banal scribbling on the menu board: "pork sandwich" is the best pork sandwich of your life, and "shrimp torta" is a fresh hoagie with poached shrimp.  All for around $12 or less. Also: these are the best Bloody Marys in the city.  Done.  I'm not going to fight anyone about this, because if you try to, you'll lose and look stupid.  And your dad will be disappointed in yet ANOTHER loss. I like this place because I can take absolutely anyone here and it's a perfect fit.  I was able to take each of my parents (at separate times--divorced, hate each other, differing personalities, standard dramedy fare) and they raved about the food, atmosphere, location. Because the drinks are just stupid good, I was able to enjoy conversations with them about...god anything really, they're so high maintenance.  I was also able to discuss finances with my husband over the incredible brunch.   Thanks, ASB.
