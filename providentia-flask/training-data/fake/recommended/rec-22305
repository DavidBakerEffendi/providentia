The food is pretty good at this place. We went recently after a long break from Caseus (and New Haven) and got a table for 2 after waiting for 30 minutes as we didn't have reservations. We tried the specials for the day which were nicely prepared - pork chop and a very fresh salad with bacon. The pork chops were very juicy with a nice side of mashed potatoes, and the salad was very good although the bacon lardons were overcooked to the point that they were crisp. Better to have taken them out of the pan a minute earlier and add a chewy/soft texture to the dish which largely consisted of fresh and crisp pieces of fruit and vegetable. Service was a little slow in the beginning (the place was packed) although they were very quick to recognizing this fact. Caseus was generous in picking up our drinks as we had to wait for some time for our bread & butter starter to arrive. All in all, it was a pleasant experience with good service.
