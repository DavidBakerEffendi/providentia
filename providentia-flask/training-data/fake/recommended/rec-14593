My friend and I had just eaten a rather filling dinner a few blocks north. He said he wanted tea. Since I'm no native New Yorker, I pulled out my iPhone and its Yelp application to find a nice place to get tea. Luckily, it was on the way to an ice cream parlor I wanted to try. And how glad I am that we tried it. I got very high-quality matcha tea; a nice portion of it. The price, though a bit steep, was definitely worth the experience. My friend got a black tea, complete with its associated tea ceremony. The hot water is poured into the very miniature teapot that contains the leaves; the water is left in for 15-20 seconds, then strained; this strained water is put into an aroma cup and then dumped immediately into the drinking cup. I think this is actually a Chinese tea ceremony (Wikipedia leads me to believe that it's Gongfu), but since I'm no expert, I make no strong claims. This whole ceremony-aspect made the experience a five-star one. The tea was delicious, as was my accompanying mochi. If you're looking for a high-quality tea-drinking experience, this is definitely the place in NYC. And I think it's worth every penny one might spend there.
