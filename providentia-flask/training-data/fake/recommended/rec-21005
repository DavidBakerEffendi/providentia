I did some research for wine bars around Penn Station as I was meeting a friend. I wanted something interesting, especially where the wine was concerned. I'm so glad I picked OCabanon. I booked my 6pm reservation on OpenTable and arrived early. I wanted to make sure I got a nice quiet spot. The room at the back of the restaurant is great. All the wooden bookcases are filled with wine bottle standing up. While I was there mainly to meet a new friend, we concentrated on wines and the really nice wine plate for 3 - yes there was only two of us but between conversation and several glasses of wine it was more than enough. Although next time I go it will be for a full fledged dinner. The wait staff was attentive and while I didn't need any wine assistance (I've been in the wine business a long time) I noticed they did a very nice job with the other customers. I would trust them to make a suggestion for sure. Before I left for the evening I had a chance to speak with the owner Armel Joly. A really nice guy who also is the chef but not the night we were there. The space at the ground floor is great but he took us on a tour of the upstairs. What a delight! A really cozy loft is upstairs for up to 50 people. But the real surprise was the wine vault down a narrow walkway that was directly over the wine bar below us. Not a huge space but certainly a really interesting location for an intimate dinner for up to 10 people max. This is definitely someplace I'm coming back to with no hesitation, and I highly recommend a try. Tucked away on W29th between 7th & 8th (closer to the 8th side and right across the street from the Holiday Inn Express). Looking for a nice place away from the crowded MSG/Penn Station area this is a gem.
