My gf brought me here during one of my visits to see her. Originally we were going to head to another place in town but each time i have been up Burlington this place always catches my eye. The big sign is kind of hard to miss and this time she saw caught me looking at this place and she basically decided with her eyes that you need to experience this place, i agreed! We sat inside and our waitress brought us our menu's which were in the form of a newspaper, telling us about the history of the place as well as news and obviously the food and drinks they offered. (nice concept) Â We both decided on having some drinks with our food and what a great idea that was, the gf got the Forbidden Fruit and i got the Irish Mick's IPA Stout. I thought both drinks were superb, the Forbidden Fruit tasted like beer but with a cherry crisp flavor which i have never encountered before and IPA had that dark taste like Guinness but smooth finish and coffee like aftertaste of perfection. We proceeded to order our food and from what i can remember we had the Mozzarella Sticks and Cajun Fried Calamari to start off with which both were extremely tasty, i honestly can't remember what my gf but she loved it and myself had the Teriyaki Chicken. The only way i can describe the Teriyaki Chicken was i bit into the burger and literally closed my eyes and the taste put me into a state of pure bliss and enjoyment. Yes the sauce plus the way the chicken was cooked, plus the cheese all melted into my mouth and it was perfect. Also the beers are so good your going to get a second maybe even third round. This place is great for any type of outing. Also major props to our waitress she was extremely nice, informative when we had our questions about the beer and just and overall nice lady to speak to, def will coming back.
