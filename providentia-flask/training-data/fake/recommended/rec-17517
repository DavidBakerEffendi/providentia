I tried both the sushi and hibachi.  The sushi melted in your mouth.  It was fresh and tasty.  The hibachi was on point.  Tasty but not salty.  The steak was tender and cooked to perfection.   I appreciated the choice between rice or noodles.  I've been to places that charge extra for noodles. I was shocked to see this place completely empty.  If I lived closer I would be a weekly customer.  The only thing I found weird was the waitresses stared at us the entire time we ate.  I thought great they are being attentive.  That wasn't the case our drinks were left empty.  Just a bit weird.
