Got the Shiromaru Hakata Classic with an added the poached egg, which was amazing.  Ippudo definitely does Japanese ramen right! It is a tad pricey for ramen (especially when there are many other places nearby), but the portion is huge and 1 bowl is enough.   The only downfall to this place is that it gets crowded and could potentially end up waiting for an hour or so.  Regardless, it is worth the wait for this ramen.
