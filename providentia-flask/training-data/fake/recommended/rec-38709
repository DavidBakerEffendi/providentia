This is one of my favorite places in Hartford.  It is a down and dirty great italian eatery.   The grinders (subs) are delicious.  I am not an eggplant parm fan but theirs is pretty yummy.  I also like the italian comb ALOT. For pasta- and I get serious cravings for this- the pasta with pancetta and peas is out of this world. The guys who work there have been there forever and are super nice.  It's just a great place.  A must try.  Thank god they aren't open past 7 at night or I would be there all the time.  Go early if you're going to lunch.  It is packed by 12:10.
