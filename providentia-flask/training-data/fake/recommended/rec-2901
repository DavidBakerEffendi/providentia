I live around the corner from Cedar Point and I'd love to make it my go-to spot, but the food is simply not good enough to make that happen. The prices are extremely high for the quality and quantity - much like how I felt about the few times I ate at A Full Plate, the kitchen's execution just can't seem to match its ambition. Last night I ordered the Caesar salad which costs $13.  A bit $$$ compared to most Caesars but it includes blackened shrimp so I went with it.  What was delivered to me was a colorless pile of iceberg lettuce, some croutons, and 4 smallish shrimp.  The shrimp were decent enough but the iceberg was just plain insulting at that price (all legit Caesars are made with romaine).  It was a $6-$7 dish at best.  Had they used the correct lettuce, maybe some proper hints of lemon and anchovy in the dressing, and some substantially-sized shrimp, it would've been reasonable at that price point. Like most of my other visits there, I left completely underwhelmed.
