I've been a regular here since they've opened. I've almost eaten everything on the menu now. The pizza is amazing and find if I crave pizza I can't go anywhere else but here anymore. The salads are amazing and fresh. All the food for that matter taste amazing. Can't beat this place. Waiters and waitresses are great, love the atmosphere and the outdoor addition is wonderful.
