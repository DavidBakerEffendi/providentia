Delicious & convenient!  It was after 10pm when I finished at work and wanted to pick up dinner on the way back to my hotel.  Not many places were open other than bars and their typical fare.  I strolled past this place and was delighted with their food. I love indian and spicy food.  But don't recall ever having indian in a flatbread wrap until Kati Roll.  The Shami Kabob roll (minced lamb) and the Chana Masala (lentils) roll.  Both were equally delicious in my book. The restaurant looks as though it as at one time some sort of fast-food joint.  So, it ain't much.  It probably could have been cleaner, too.  But you're able to see the kitchen, where they prepare the rolls, and also can see the cooks.  I had no worries about cleanliness in the kitchen.   I'd definitely eat here again and look forward to it during my future trips.
