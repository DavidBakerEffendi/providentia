I had been looking for delicious pizza since coming to Brooklyn and finally found it at Barboncino.  But pizza was only the beginning.  We sat on the patio, which was lined by vines with a beautiful vegetable garden next door.  The service was very friendly with excellent recommendations.  We had the smoked panchetta and artichoke pizza, and the margherita with pepperoni and extra garlic (which was recommended by the waiter). The atmosphere was great, pizza delicious, with thirst quenching microbrews.  This is definitely a great neighborhood spot I will continue to revisit over and over!
