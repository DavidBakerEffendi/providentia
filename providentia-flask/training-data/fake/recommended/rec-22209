This is your typical blue-collar, hole-in-the wall type of bar.  They sometimes have musical acts on the weekends.  The frites are very good and there is a large selection of frite sauces.  Unfortunately, the more substantial food (e.g. burgers and sandwiches) are just OK.  The beer selection could be better.
