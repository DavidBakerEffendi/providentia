First time in Philly! This place was awesome! I ordered the fish ball noodle soup. The best fish balls I have ever tasted. My husband got the oxtail soup. You can really tell the difference in these noodles. I also ordered pan fried pork dumplings, which were so good! $20 meal for a cold day, filled me up, warmed me up, happy me!
