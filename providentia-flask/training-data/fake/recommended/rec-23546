I think this might be the best restaurant I have been to in Burlington.  The decor is clean and has an American theme and it's located right off Church street.  We sat at the bar and had drinks and shared some small plates.  I got some drink with lychee drink that was so good I ordered 3!  The food was delicious and the service couldn't have been more friendly.  They have the standards and also some different food options for more adventurous eaters.  Next time I am visiting family I will be back!
