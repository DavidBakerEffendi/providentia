this place sucks.  you'd think for the money they charge and the reviews they've received that they'd be pretty darn good but it is completely overrated.   and to make matters worse, the service absolutely sucked.   the kids menu does  not cost any less than the main menu either- $12 for kid's chicken fingers, are you serious? my other kid didn't even want to finish her butter noodles.  c'mon- how easy is it to make that? i tried it and it was completely flavorless. oh yeah, best part f all- when they delivered my kid's bowl of noodles, the bowl had a big chip in it.  i told the waitress that was really not safe and she simply turned the bowl around so the chip was facing away from my daughter. i dont give a rat's ass about this wanna-be fancy, shmancy joke of a high end restaurant.   i will say that the sculpture gardens surrounding the restaurant are amazing though.  that calmed me down after wasting my hard earned money on this p.o.s. place. i highly recommend the gardens but avoid this money pit, average diner.
