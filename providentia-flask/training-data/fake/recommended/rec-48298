I came here for dinner because I heard they have awesome margaritas and they def do!  I got quinoa burger and it was pretty good but the cucumber margarita on the rocks with a chili salt rim was perfectly refreshing and not too sweet.  I can easily say it's one of the best margaritas I've ever had. I got a Paloma and it was awesome too. Also a plus, I came here with a group of 4 on a Friday around 7 and there was no wait.  I had to go back about a week later for drinks and the bartender lady was super sweet and adorable. I tried my friends' pineapple and hibiscus margaritas and pretty sure every flavor rules.  I will def be back for the drinks!
