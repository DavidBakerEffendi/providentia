Sometimes the food is great, and sometimes it is just ok.  The bread is wonderful.  The view is fabulous.  The drinks are way too small for the price.  The menu really doesn't change which I think is a downside.  Some of the mains are very good, and some are not.  The size of the portions are fine.  Give it a try for yourself.
