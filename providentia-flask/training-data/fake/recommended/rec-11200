I would give this place 5 stars if it weren't for their douchey employees. Everytime I go there there's one slice or another that looks delicious but I can't tell what the hell it is because it kind of looks like 3 other types of slices. So naturally, I ask one of the guys behind the counter, who always acts like I'm an idiot as if I were asking him if they sell pizza or not. If you don't want people asking you "what's that slice?" 17 times in a row why don't you label the pies so you don't have to engage with customers. I'm trying to spend money at your establishment, don't make it so hard for me!
