So whenever I pop the cherry of taking someone to Ippudo for the first time, I always tell them the following: "I don't want hype this place up.  Usually when I eat at places that have so much hype, I'm always disappointed.   Its like I expect this meal that makes me want to say I could just die right now and be happy, but its never the case.  However, this is one place where there was so much hype and when I left the restaurant, I felt like it lived up to it" Now the review of the dishes: The ramen is of course what you need to get.  The presentation in the variety of bowls is a nice touch but you came here to satisfy your 2000% daily intake of sodium and you shall receive.  The noodles are what really makes the dish though.  Its perfectly chewy, and hand made!  The pork slices are just fatty enough and literally melts in your mouth.  I had both the tonkotsu flavored soup and the salt flavor.  The tonkotsu is a real hearty and thick broth that is perfect for a post-hangover meal.  The salt flavor isn't that sallty as one would think and has more of a light, broth.  If i were to use an analogy for you americans on consistency: tonkotsu = campbells chunky soup salt = chicken stock The appetizers are great as well.  The steamed pork buns are a must order.   The prices are expensive but I think its worth it and not too unreasonable.  Skip on alcohol, wine, all of that.  Go to saint marks for that.  Just eat a nice satisfying meal and spread the hype!
