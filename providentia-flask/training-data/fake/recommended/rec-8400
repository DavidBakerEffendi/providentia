We went there for lunch and we were treated like royalty. The owner and his wife were gracious hosts and the food was off the hook delicious. Never mind the bright orange walls and the tv playing Indian westerns. I had the Saag with Lamb, awesome, The Chicken Tika  appetizer was fresh , tender and yummy. The Naan bread is heavenly and he kept bringing us more condiments. I highly recommend this fare in a far out place...Like east flatbush. It's right off the 2 or 5  subway line ( winthrop) ave exit from Manhattan
