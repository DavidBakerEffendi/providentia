Osteria Morini was great!  I loved the cafeteria-like, yet homey feel of the place.  I felt very comfortable and thought it was a nice change from a lot of the slightly pretentious-feeling restaurants you can find in New York.   We ordered the pan-seared calamari with kale appetizer special and the fresh mozzarella.  Both were excellent, and I loved the fresh grapes with the mozzarella.  My boyfriend and I wanted pasta and only pasta, so we ordered the stracci and the cappelletti.  The cappelletti was pretty good, a bit too rich with butter for me that day, so I was happy we split both dishes.  I loved the stracci, the flavor of the mushrooms with the rosemary oil was perfect. The Budino di Noce dessert - walnut custard with lemon sorbetto - was amazing! I had a very pleasant experience and thought the food was delicious.  I would definitely come back.
