The hostesses were EXTREMELY rude. I had a reservation (I was really early and told them so). They claimed they didn't see my reservation, and I had to literally show them my open table email, as WELL as my call log showing them that they called me to confirm a day before. I was so fed up with the hostesses that I ate at the bar. But the bartnender was wonderful as usual, and the food was outstanding! Eggs benedict and creme brulee french toast are like no other.
