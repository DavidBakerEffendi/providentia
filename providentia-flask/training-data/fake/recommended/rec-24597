Absolutely fantastic Greek food and wine in a airy dining room with windows opening on to the sidewalk. After a summer vacation to Greece last month, I was really missing the cuisine, so I decided to check out this place after the great New York Times review, and to branch out of Manhattan. My husband and another couple went on a Saturday and the place was packed with diners and people hanging out at the bar, with good pop music playing in the background. I'm a vegetarian, but everyone in our group loved the meat/seafood that they ordered. I got the combination of dips and the fusilli with feta and tomatoes, which was delicious, and all of us split the intense black currant and mango sorbet. The service was attentive and friendly. I'm writing this as I eat my leftover pasta and think about when I can go to MP Taverna again!
