Ah home of the hipster.....I asked the writer of Supernews if they could land that sneaker spaceship on the roof in an episode to explain everything. Otherwise great beer selection, Food changes on the daily and they won't post it online kind of annoying. About 4-5 years ago they had a super rocking portabella sandwich that they took away. From what I hear you can still find it at their way cooler sister restaurant Stand Tap. I'd say best place in the area to catch some music at, if you can stomach some of the hipster music but every now and again they throw ya a bone. The bartender on Sundays she is cool stop in then.
