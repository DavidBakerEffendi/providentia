I've been here 2 times, however the last time is what is causing me to write this review.  My first experience was for brunch, which I remember as being good food, however it was a while ago.  My last time back to Stone Park Cafe really makes me question going back.  My wife and I both ordered appetizers, a bottle of wine, dinner, and a desert to share.  The appetizers were great.  My wife enjoyed her Corn soup and I my Frisee Salad.  For dinner I ordered the Pan seared cod, and my wife a vegitable lasagne.  My cod was very salty and as a cod goes, had little flavor, even with the light sauce they used.  Under the cod was a Bok Choy which was overly spiced and also tasted salty.  The lasagna my wife had was not at all what she expected and also was too salty for her.  There was too much cheese and not enough vegetable (a common problem with any "vegetable" dish).   For wine I ordered a 2009 Beaujolais, however what I got was a 2007 bottle that cost me $12 extra.  Unfortunately I didn't notice the mistake until I got the bill.  Looking at the wine list off their website I'm not sure how the mistake occured given the two wines are not even next to eachother.   For desert we ordered a chocolate pudding which I felt was decent, a little dry if I was too be picky, but decent. Overall, I'd say the atmosphere was ok.  This is not a restaurant where I would go in with high expectations as some of the reviews suggest.  As destinguished by my two stars, there's definitely better in the neighborhood.
