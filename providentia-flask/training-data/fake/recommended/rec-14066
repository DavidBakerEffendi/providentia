Food was great! We had the Mac three ways for which the place is famous for. We found the place after seeing it on Cash Cab, when everyone was raving about the food. Well worth the raves. Someone we were sitting next to just had to share their fries with us, and the table next to us because he said they were so great. It was the dipping sauce that was making them a hit. Of course that made us share our mac and cheese with him and the other table to brag about how good it was and the other table shared some of his calamari. It was all wonderful. I wish I had more meals in the day to eat so I could try everything, but alas we had other places we wanted to eat at as well during our short stay in NY. This place feels like a night club, but we were there at 10pm so that may have something to do with it. Very crowded and there was a bit of a wait that felt like waiting at a night club. Service was good.
