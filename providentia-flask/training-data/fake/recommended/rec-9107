This place was pretty decent. I came here on the day the World Cup was showing Mexico vs Argentina (I think) so it was pretty packed and loud. We ordered a chili cheeseburger, bistro burger with cheese, fries, and two sodas. The chili cheeseburger was pretty good but I regretted ordering it. It came completely smothered in chili, and though I love chili, I came here to try their burgers! There was a big chunk of burger under all the chili mess but the taste just didn't come through. The bistro burger was super fresh though, especially the onions. I think to have a good burger you've got to have onions, plentiful and fresh. Three things stand out in my mind that I didn't like: 1) No refills on sodas 2) Cash only 3) When we got our bill, I didn't look at it too closely, but my bf noticed that they charged us for THREE burgers rather than two. When we pointed it out, the waiter said, the # on the receipt matches your table. And I said, there's only two of us, we only ordered 3 burgers. And he said, sigh, ooookay. Otherwise I would have given 4! For shame.....
