I've only been to Cookshop for brunch and its always de-lish. Â They make THE BEST bloody marys I have had in NYC, hands down. The best is just to bring a friend, sit at the bar and people watch and chat with the bartender. I always end up ordering the same thing (because its so damn good). Cookshop scramble with salmon.. mmmm. Oh, the Huevos Rancheros is pretty amazing as well. They put it all in a giant bowl and its enormous! A great place to take friends, family, etc.. but if your party is more then 2, a reservation is a must.
