Fried chicken is good. Just in life, it's a good good thing. At peaches? It's AWESOME. The batter is perfect - just the right crunch, with a bit of sugar, and salt and pepper. Ordered the Hot and was hoping it would be hotter than it was. This would probably qualify as a medium, especially in a place that's known for its hotness! But nevertheless, well played peaches. Side of kale was good. Side of Mac and cheese was good. Appetizer of fried catfish balls, so so. Appetizer of shrimps and crispy grits, pretty good but not amazing. Overall- just order the chicken and make sure it's hot!!
