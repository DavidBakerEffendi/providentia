I came here for dinner the other night because I was craving sushi. The restaurant is tiny. Mostly bar seating with a table that squeezed a party of 6 like a can of sardines. It was entertaining listening to their conversation. It looked like a girl with her parents and the bf/spouse with his parents. Apparently the girl and her parents knew the owners because they were talking to each other (in Chinese) and the girl's father was giving the female owner a neck/shoulder massage. Kind of awkward. I ordered salmon sashimi, tiger maki and red and white maki. The salmon sashimi only came in 2 pieces and were tiny. It wasn't bad but not worth the $5-6. The makis were just okay. They were falling apart and there was just a lack of flavor. I also got some bones in the eel which was very surprising. I enjoy mom-and-pop type of restaurants, but unfortunately I won't be back for the sushi.
