Our friends were here visting and when they lived in the area Mo's was their regular breakfast spot.They spoke about the place and really wanted to go so I was very excited and starving too. The place is super small so naturally there was a line. I was thinking it must be worth the wait. Since we were a party of four the only seats available were the counter seats so we sat there. I ordered pancakes as did another member of our party. Pancakes were crazy heavy and there was so much spice in them that was all I could taste. My husband got his order which was wrong, but he ate it anyways since we had waited so long. Since he had ordered sausage and he got bacon...which is no big deal...they brought him this hockey puck side sausage. It was so over cooked that he could even cut into it not mention when the waitress saw this happening she said to him "WOW looks like that is pretty over done" and walked away. She didn't offer a replacement or even concern it was like ha whatever too bad. The orange juice was from concentrate and served over ice. The coffee was also disgusting. The whole meal was not good at all. I'm baffled that there was a line for this place. Not worth the wait.
