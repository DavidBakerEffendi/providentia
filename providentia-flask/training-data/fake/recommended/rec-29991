Great Seafood, great location, and a friendly staff. Been here many times and the quality of food and service has always been very good. It's not cheap although it's a good value for what you get. These people know fish. The fish market next door is associated with the restaurant so what more can you ask for. It all adds up to high quality, fresh fish cooked to perfection. I like my fish plain with out a bunch of other stuff piled on top and that's what they do best. You may see types of fish on the menu that don't recognize, it's a good idea to ask a lot of questions. The fish they offer changes every day. It's a fun place to try new types of fish that other places don't offer. If the server can't answer your fish questions ask for the manager, this guy is a seafood know it all and has been there since the restaurant first opened. Keep in mind it's BYOB with liquor store located on the next block. They now take reservations, make them well in advance.
