Aiight before I start let me say im all for black own companies.. To me Unlimited Sandwiches is more a whole bunch of ingredients with no flavor. I mean don't get me wrong  when it comes to sandwiches, I always thought I want more for my money, well in this case I would rather have some flavor then a pound of meat!  And its over priced..  I would rather hit up subways because 1. Its cheaper! 2). it looks some what cleaner (the store on central ave needs some tlc) 3). At least I know what im tasting.
