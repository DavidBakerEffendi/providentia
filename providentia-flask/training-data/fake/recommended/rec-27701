I liked to call this "Cafe on Main Â - FROM HELL!" I wouldn't give their food to a homeless person! From their breakfast to lunch the food sucks! They have wanna be chefs that puts all the food in the microwave instead of the mini grill they have. The prices are sky high for food that is microwaved - ALL OF THE TIME. I highly wouldn't recommend any one to this place. I advise to bring food from home or if you have a car - to drive any get food else where. If you can honestly say that this food is delicious you probably never tasted good food! RATED 0-
