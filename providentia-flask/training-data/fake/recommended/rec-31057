I hosted a pizza making party for my clients a few weeks ago and I gotta say, it was one of the coolest things I've done in a while.  The staff was beyond amazing with educating my group on the ins & outs of making perfect pizza dough, along tutoring us on the science of toppings and pairing our entire experience with wonderful flights of wine (almost bottomless glasses!), it impressed everyone that attended.  I can't wait to come back and have the pizza again, it was amazing.  Every side dish and appetizer we were served was better than the last.  The employees took pictures of our party while we were crafting our masterpieces and I got to spend more time with my clients.  Overall, A+++ evening.  Can't wait to come in the spring/summer and sit on the back patio.  Bonus?  They have a side patio for our four legged friends!
