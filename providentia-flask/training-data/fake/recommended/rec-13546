My fiancee has raved about this place for years. We finally got around to eating there yesterday and after hearing the hype for so long, it still did not disappoint! We ordered the blueberry pancakes and the southern breakfast, and each had a cup of the mulled apple cider. The blueberry pancakes were excellent. Fluffy and golden brown with blueberries inside and on top. The flavor and texture of the pancakes are great but the maple butter is really what makes these pancakes complete. It adds a wonderful finish to each bite, some sort of toasted butter flavor. The southern breakfast is fantastic. It comes with fried green tomatoes, two eggs  cheese grits, and four strips of candied bacon. The other three parts are very good,  but the bacon is insane. They cook it so that it's easy to cut, not extra crispy, and you can see the great translucence of the meat and the fat. And the flavor is heavenly. Not overly salted like most bacon when eaten alone. The sugar content perfectly compliments the salty, fatty pork flavors. Anyway, please go and eat the pancakes and the bacon.
