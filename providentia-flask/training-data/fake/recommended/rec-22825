I went to Crêpes Du Nord with my wife and daughter on a Sunday evening, when the restaurant was almost empty. All of us have fond memories of a terrific French style crêperie in Toronto that kept drawing us back from early in the morning to late at night. Crêpes Du Nord is a back closet of a Scandinavian style crêperie with seating mostly for parties of one or two. It's the illegitimate sister to another restaurant that's just down a dark hallway at the back of the small dining area. The decor features a minimalist birch tree design painted in dark colors on the wall. However, what it lacks in atmosphere it makes up for with relatively inexpensive savory and sweet crêpes that really hit the spot when you're in the mood. The savory entree crêpes range from $10 to $12, while the sweet crêpes range from $7 to $9. I was disappointed to learn that the short rib crêpes mentioned in some yelp* reviews have been off the menu for over a year. We had the prosciutto and arugula crêpe, the smoked salmon and egg (aka Crêpes Du Nord) crêpe, and the fried egg and ham crêpe. All were made with dark brown buckwheat flour crêpes, and all were simply made and delicious. For dessert, we had the lemon crêpe, and the pear and brie crêpe, which were both made with more familiar light yellow wheat flour crêpes. Again, all were simply made and delicious. We didn't sample any of the non-crêpe entrees, but why would you at a crêperie? If you ever find yourself in the mood for crêpes, Crêpes Du Nord is worthy of your consideration.
