Have you have ever had fresh sashimi?  Sashimi that's so fresh that the texture is perfect, sashimi that melts in your mouth, sashimi where the fish feel like it was just freshly caught that morning?  Sushi Yasuda is place to go if that's what you are looking for. It's salmon season right now, so there were 9 types of salmon.  Is that even possible?  There are fish that are only in season for 2 weeks at a time, so that they aren't over-fished.  I tried salmon from the Copper River? I also had fluke, Tazmanian trout, blue fin fatty tuna, hamachi, Spanish mackerel.   Highly recommend making a reservation at the sushi bar.  You get your own personal sushi chef (maybe shared with another couple).  It's an educational experience - they are serious about their craft and sushi eating etiquette.  You will get disciplined if you eat it the wrong way. If you aren't sure what to get or feeling open-minded, just ask the chef for his choices...he'll keep going until you say stop.  And you never want him to stop! If my wallet had never ending supply of money, I'd sit and eat all night.  It's actually good that we save this place for special occasions.
