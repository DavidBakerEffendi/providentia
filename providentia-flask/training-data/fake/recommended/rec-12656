Date Night!!! We went there because Zagat said it was all that + tax. Well they only take cash. They have no drink menu (where they do that at?) And the mojito I ordered was huge and wasn't all that. The food is good. I am in love with they curry puffs which are huge! I had the crispy duck with jasmine rice my date had the whole red snapper. He liked it.  The place is too loud!!! It is a restaurant it shouldn't be that loud! They need some acoustic foam in there.  There is no place to hang your coat or purse..maybe they should get rid of the bar since they don't do cocktails use that space for seating.  No coat hooks to be found in the bathroom either. They have a wall of candles where not a candle was lit... I might have to stick with Qi and ThaiNY the search for more amazing Thai continues.....
