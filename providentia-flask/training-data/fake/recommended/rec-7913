Fogo De Chao always provides higher class service with great rodizio service.  My girlfriend and I went here recently for dinner and had a good experience.  This was the first time she has been there but I have been there many other times and always loved this place.  The rodizio service is probably my favorite way to eat steak as you can eat as much as you like and choose from many different cuts rather than one heavy duty steak.  Don't get me wrong as I love a nice one pound steak cooked to medium rare at a steakhouse but having an opportunity to select from such a vast variety of meats is amazing.   For the start, I can't describe how much I enjoy the cheesy bread provided at this restaurant.  It is always fresh from the oven and tastes amazing.  As for the other sides, I enjoy the plantains the most.  I tend to skip the salad bar but since my girlfriend went up I decided to eat some cheese and olives from there which seemed fresh.  As for the rodizio meats, they were mostly very good except the filet mignon wrapped in bacon wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be.  The bacon should've been cooked more in my perspective.  The picanha was absolutely delicious as well as the other cuts such as bottom sirloin and ribeye. Overall,  I definitely recommend this place to anybody looking to eat a lot of meat and have a great experience while having high class service.
