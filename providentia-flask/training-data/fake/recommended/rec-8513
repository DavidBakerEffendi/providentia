After my second visit i figured it was time to draft a review of this Ramen spot. The price point is spot on and variety in multiple forms of quick Japanese fare makes Terakawa a delight to visit. What i enjoy most is the thoughtful and friendly service as well as the special small plates they offer. The Chasu buns and chasu onigiri are delightful. On my first visit i was in a rice mood and had the chasudon. flavorful and perfect portion made it a winner. Upon my second visit it was time to try the Ramen. I ordered the Terakawa special Ramen and found it delicate and flavorful. overall, Terakawa will continue to claim my business.
