Very sophisticated and gorgeous d√©cor!! Wow, impressive. Large open dining room able to accommodate large parties. Food was pretty good, I am of Peruvian descent and have eaten and many Peruvian restaurants in the US.The whole chicken was extremely tasty and large enough to share. Fried rice, perfect. Yucca frita nice. Platanos or Maduros, they needed to be a bit more ripe. Then the staple of Peruvian foods, the green aji sauce...have tasted better, you could taste the mayonnaise and lettuce in it, I think they need to work on that one. The Sangria roja was very tasty and "strong". I would definitely recommend this restaurant.
