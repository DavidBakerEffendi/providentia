Nope. - Confusing and awkward layout - Wicked overpriced - Bread...I appreciate places offering gluten free as an option, but those of us who can process gluten and love bread would like a side of gluten-full bread with our overpriced soup, maybe?  Does the owner have Celiac Disease?  I didn't see anything on the website explaining why they don't use gluten, just a bunch of "healthy food" blabber.  Great, healthy "fast casual" options are great if they're priced well and I can have wheat if I want it. - Soup was just OK, at best Just, nope...even if you are gluten intolerant or have Celiac, I'm sure there are better and more affordable options.
