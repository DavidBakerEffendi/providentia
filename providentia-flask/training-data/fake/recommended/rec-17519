Don't let Bloomfield location fool you.. The minute you walk in, you are in a fine dining restaurant, but at normal prices.  The chef is a French Cul grad, and it shows.. The food is delicious, service friendly & impeccable, and it's a BYO, so even better!! We had pretty much everythign on the menu, as we were a group of 5.  The only disappointment was the mussels needed a touch of salt.  Other than that, food was absolutely perfect.  The Foie Gras was delicious, and the Skate was out of this world.  Def worth the trip for a transporting experience of a fine dining NY style restaurant but in New Jersey....
