I found this place just okay. I expected more from the reviews and reputation, but the food was okay, not amazing (dessert was amazing). And there aren't loads of options for vegetarians on the current menu at least, so be warned about that. (I don't blame them for this, it's just something to be aware of.) Service was also just okay, but not exemplary. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but might give it another chance if I was in the neighborhood.
