Decided to pop in for lunch today and figured I'd try one of the specials.  JB's is known more for it's music scene, but the food didn't disappoint.  The draft list isn't bad, mostly represented by local breweries like Flying Fish and Yards.  I ended up going with the Smoked Pork Hash. The description was, "Hollandaise, Red Bell Peppers, Eggs".  It was that, and a little more.  My plate was bordered by two halves of buttered wheat toast and the heart of it was a mess of home fries, sautéed onion with red pepper, smoked pork, a heavy drizzle of hollandaise, then topped with two sunny side up eggs.  Bottom line, this wasn't anything fancy, it wasn't unique in its flavor, but my belly is happy.  If this were on the menu again, I'd do it all over.
