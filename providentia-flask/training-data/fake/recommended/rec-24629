My girlfriend and I came here for dinner last night for Valentines day - and we will go back any day.  The service was impeccable, the drinks were amazing, and the food was delicious.  We had met bartender Courtney and his buddy behind the bar who were the most passionate bartenders I've seen in NYC, and theyre almost 'mixology' type drinks were amazing and strong.  They truly made this a fun experience and will definitely be back there soon.
