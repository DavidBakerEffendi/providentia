I came here with a friend mainly to get drinks, but we also wanted to snack on something and sit.  I was pleasantly surprised that they let us just order sweet potato fries (which were delicious) with our drinks because a lot of places expect you to buy a meal.  The atmosphere was great, although it did start to get a bit crowded as the the night went on.  I'll definitely come back here again.
