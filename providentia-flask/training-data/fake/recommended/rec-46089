I work very close by and walk over there at least once a week. Good food, good atmosphere - kind of an old school place but the food is served quickly and is relatively cheap. You can have a full lunch meal for under $10.00 Waitstaff are awesome! Daily specials posted right by the door when you walk in. Parking is tight since there is a liquor store next door, a Subway in the same building, and the seediest hotel you've ever seen out back and beside - stay away from there.
