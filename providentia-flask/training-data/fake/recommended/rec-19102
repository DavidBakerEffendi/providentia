I am envious of my friend who lives within walking distance from here. The ambiance is swanky modern, but unexpectedly unpretentious. We both shared the caprese salad which was basically a basil leaf on top of a huge slice of fresh mozzarella on top of a hunky piece of tomato, drizzled with olive oil. It was good, but I had to ask for the balsamic vinegar (faux pax on this coast?). Then came the old fashioned mushroom & sausage pizza - to my surprise - served in a cookie pan. Rectangular and HUGE and yummy. I know NY is known for its pizza and this wasn't the traditional pizza people always talk about - but I can settle with this... It was perfectly cooked. We basically ate a third of it and had to pack the rest for many meals of leftover pizza (and none of us are complaining about it). Total bill was $40 w/ tip.
