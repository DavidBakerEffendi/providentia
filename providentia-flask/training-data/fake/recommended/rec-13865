Everyone knows the brunch at Clinton St. Bakery is to die for - just thinking about the brioche french toast literally makes my mouth water. The only thing that is not great about Clinton St. is the wait - if the weather is crappy expect to wait about an hour outside but if the weather is gorgeous you can expect to be waiting 90 minutes or more. This would normally be a deal breaker for me BUT i learned of a great trick - take-out. Call in a take-out order and it will be ready for pick-up within 15 minutes, even during their busiest brunch rush. Just remember to check your order before you leave, we've had several incidents were an item was missing from our take-out bag but I assume this is due to how busy they are.
