I'm a big bruncher. That is to say, I've been to a lot of brunch spots all over the country. The experience I had at Olea was by far the best I have ever had. Service: Our waiter was incredibly professional and courteous the whole time. 2 of us changed our minds about our food/drink order and he changed it right away without complaint. Drinks: they have an entire array of mimosa flavors, from mango to pomegranate! They also have brunch drink specials - I got the Aperol spritzer which they make with mango pur√©e. That was my favorite! Food: best for last. I ordered the Brioche French toast, which melts in your mouth and is a welcome sweet treat next to all of the incredible savory dishes they have. Speaking of, though I didn't order this, I demolished the LAMB HASH. I literally almost fell over when I tried this. Hands down, the BEST brunch entree my mouth ever tasted! It was presented in a very authentically Moroccan style with the food in the pan. Each egg had an incredible white cheese and was topped with a Muhammara sauce that added a little spice. It's not until you get to the bottom of this masterpiece where you have the real treat - mounds of tender, juicy spiced lamb mixed with this cheese and seasoned potatoes. We all nearly abandoned our own meals so we can have more of the lamb hash. I would come back to NYC just to have another brunch at Olea!
