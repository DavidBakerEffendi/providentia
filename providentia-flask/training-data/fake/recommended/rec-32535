Woody's is the best! Â Love the Southern Slaw dog, although it was a little better before they changed the slaw to a more finely chopped variety. Never can go wrong there. The owners are great too. The place doesn't seem to be as crowded as it used to be at lunch, but I only go there a few times a year so I can't speak from authority. I hope business is good as Woodys is a Hartford institution.
