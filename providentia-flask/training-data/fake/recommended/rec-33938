It's Â been a while folks, but I'm back on yelp and ready to review. I have to start with Do or Dine. I have been here at least ten times and have never been disappointed. In the last year, I have made Do or Dine my go to restaurant. I have tried almost everything on their frequently changing menu and have very few complaints. The steak tartare is by far my favorite, but I have never had anything that wasn't amazing. I would recommend Do or Dine to anyone looking for a great meal in an energetic atmosphere.
