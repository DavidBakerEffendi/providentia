Upon sitting down at the sushi bar, we were offered up an appetizer of a whitefish tempura as a treat from Alex, the lead sushi chef and a part owner if I understood him correctly.  My wife asked what it was, and knowing she wouldn't eat it if it was a fish other than tuna or shrimp, I didn't tell her what it was. She loved it, as did I.  It was a whitefish tempura served over cucumber with a spicy sauce.  I then ordered a Chirashi platter and and an "AK47 Roll," which was shrimp tempura rolled in rice and nori, topped with lobster meat and spicy tuna... both the platter and roll were delicious. The fish was incredibly fresh.  My wife had a Spicy Maki combo, Spicy Tuna, California Roll and she subbed a spicy cucumber roll for the salmon. She enjoyed her entire meal as well.  We finished with green tea ice cream.  While it wasn't crowded for a Saturday evening, we were there at 6pm... and they've just opened, but it was about a third full.  A few Hibachi tables were full with what appeared to be very happy satisfied customers.  I've got a good vibe about this place. I know we will return.
