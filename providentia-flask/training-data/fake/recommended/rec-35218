Open 24 hours?! Now, I KNOW I can get my cravings fulfilled anytime! When I come here, I always order 4-5 empanadas and their homemade Iced Tea. If you don't come here and order empanadas then you deserve to eat burnt toast every morning. My Top Fave Empanadas: -Spicy Chicken -TJC (tuna, jalapeno, cheese) -Viagra (shrimps, scallops and crab meat) -Pepperoni pizza Don't worry if you don't know which empanada is which because they come out in individual paper bags with their names stamped to it. They are hot and drip so I like to hold on to the paper bags as I eat them. Also, if they have cheese, it's melted to perfection! Make sure you dip the empanadas with the complimentary green & red sauces. Green is cilantro goodness and red is spicy. It's more like Tabasco spicy, not habanero, burn your tongue spicy. Also, I like that their guacamole comes with lightly salted plantain chips, which is a change from the usual corn chips. They have great frozen margaritas, but I'm a huge tea person. Definitely try their homemade iced tea! (honey, lime and tea in every sip! It compliments the spicy!
