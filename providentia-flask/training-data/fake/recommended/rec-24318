I am more than happy to give this place 5 stars. The owners work their butts off every day to provide high quality, delicious and healthy food. I have eaten here now over a dozen times and have never been disappointed.  Tonight I got a craving for their quinoa salad with sliced chicken breast (which is RIDICULOUSLY good btw!) and although they were already closed and in the process of cleaning up, they INSISTED on making me the dish. I really didn't want to put them out, but since they went that extra mile, I decided I had to return the favor by writing this review.  Thank you guys.  It was delicious as usual!
