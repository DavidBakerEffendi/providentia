It's funny that I have passed by this place a trillion times and never checked it out..... I ended up here today after a friend sent a midday text.  It actually worked out perfect.  It finally stopped raining and the sun was out.  I popped in around 3:30pm and was surprised how bumpin' it was but then was quickly reminded that it IS Memorial Day weekend. I could not help but immediately fall in love with the Latin tunes they were playing and the fact that they had outdoor seating.  Again - it finally stopped raining! I was only there for drinks so I really can not comment on food although from what I saw of what my friends ordered it looked very good.  I actually stopped at a table where two women were seating.  They looked like they were eating a sort of tapas sampler.  I immediately shouted, "Hey, now that looks good and they agreed it was. Yucca starts you off with chips, plantains, guacamole, and salsa which is really freakin good, I must admit.  The sangria rocked and was perfect for a Friday post work drink. I found the staff to be friendly and exceptionally attentive.  I plan on taking some friends here tomorrow for a little girls night.  I guess the true test though is when I order one of their dishes....but for now I am sold on Yucca Bar.
