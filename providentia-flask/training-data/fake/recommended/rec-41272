The ramen at Ippudo is fine, but not spectacular.  What makes this place terrible, though, is their sneaky policy that you cannot take home leftovers.  Apparently this is the chef's rule because eating ramen the next day "ruins the dish."  Supposedly this is listed on the menu, but it must be in mighty fine print because I certainly did not see it.  My fiance and I each ordered a bowl of ramen even though it was early in the evening with the expectation that we would take half home.  After eating half and asking to take the rest to go, the waitress informed us that we would not be permitted to do this.  After arguing with the waitress and the manager, and even asking if I could go purchase my own tupperware from Duane Reade in order to take the ramen home, we got nowhere.  The manager was not even apologetic about this absurd rule, and refused to do anything for us.  I will never come back here.  Momofuku Noodle Bar is only a few blocks away, and is far superior, with impeccable service to boot.
