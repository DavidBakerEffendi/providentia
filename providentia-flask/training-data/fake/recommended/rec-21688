Four stars for the service, complimentary plantain chips, and the entrana tacu tacu. I came here to try the ceviches as the reviews have been mainly positive. we ordered the cervice tasting and tried three different types (decent sized serving) - tuna belly, pineapple tuna, and mussels. mussel ceviche was really good. a bit overly sour but I liked it. the pineapple tuna was a bit disappointing after all the great reviews. The pineapple was good but the texture of the tuna was not very smooth and felt grainy. I think the tuna belly was my favorite. it tasted very fresh and loved the texture along with the avocado mousse. we also ordered the mussels and fish tacos (3pcs). the mussels were flavorful in the broth but the mussels itself were on the smaller side. the fish tacos were good with a good amount of fish but nothing amazing. For entree the tacu tacu hit the spot. the beef was very tasty and seasoned perfectly served with some sauce from the steak. it came with plantains, rice and beans topped with a tiny quail egg and a few leaves of greens and tomato for a salad. i would go back if i were in the neighborhood looking for a dinner spot. they have some seating in the backyard but was not able to experience that this time.
