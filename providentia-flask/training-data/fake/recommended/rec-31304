Every day during lunchtime, 100's of hungry Philadelphians and tourist alike line up around Tommy DiNic's lunch counter in hopes of getting a taste of old-world Philadelphia Hoagies.  Voted in 2013, Food Networks "Best Sandwich in America".  The lunch counter is crowded, loud, fast paced but once you bite into the sandwich it's well worth the wait.  If you are lucky enough to get a seat on the counter, you are transported to a pork induced oasis in this old converted train station.   The Roast Pork, Beef Brisket and the Meatballs Hoagies are amazing.  Come hungry, add some horseradish, eat and leave with a dogie bag.
