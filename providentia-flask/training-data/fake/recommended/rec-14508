For me, this is the place to compare all fried seafood to.  The worst thing I can say is the food is so hot when you get it and so delicious that it is almost impossible to wait for it to cool down and resist eating it without burning your mouth.   I almost always get the shrimp and chips.  The shrimp, wow are they fresh and cooked perfectly.  They are battered right when you order them.  For me, the chips are also worth the drive.  These are steak fries, and even better, krinkle cut steak fries.  They are nice and crisp, and always freshly fried.   Clam chowder, also very good.  Hot lobster roll, nothing to complain about here!   You order cafeteria style and there is a dining room to eat in.  They offer beer in the dining room.  Very clean.   Beware on Fridays during Lent!  But, still worth the wait.
