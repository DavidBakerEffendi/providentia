Caveat: I was completely sober when I came here, but was also famished. Given that... it looks like I'm in the minority when I say that Halal Guys was okay, but certainly not the orgasmically fantastic street food that everyone from friends to TVs and movies have made them out to be. Having become such a iconic NYC food establishment, there's no real need to describe the chicken plate itself, but here it is anyway: shredded chicken, veggies, and pita bread, over rice, with some yogurt and spicy red sauces available on the side. Certainly not bad, but it is, at its heart, simple, average, street food. My friend said it best when she expressed a desire to suddenly eat Hainan chicken rice while digging in: it reminded us, at least, of much tastier alternatives. So, if you're here, hungry, and/or drunk, by all means! It's certainly a viable and affordable option. I would by no means go out of my way to come here though! ***Accessibility Info*** Venue - It's a cart, where everybody is on the same level as you (versus a food truck), so, this is about as accessible as street food can get. Bathroom - None available.
