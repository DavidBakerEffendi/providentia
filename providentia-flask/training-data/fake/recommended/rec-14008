the wait: we lucked out and didn't have one, though most of the time there will be. the food: good, though the bacon peanut brittle and desserts were definitely the highlights. the setting: brick-walled neighborhood restaurant with a welcoming bar. service: totally fine. in short: might be better for drinks and dessert than a full meal. i got there at 7:00 on a tuesday night to find plenty of empty tables.  the rest of my party arrived about fifteen minutes later, just in time for us to snag what was by then the last one.  by the time we left at around 9 the place was packed.   lined with the brick walls and velvet banquets, the restaurant is a nice addition to the lower east side restaurant scene. filled with neighbors and regulars, the place is lively but not overwhelming. the menu is, for the most part, a foodie's take on pub food, with a few more interesting additions.  the fresh soft pretzels were good, but would have been a nice replacement to the dinner rolls instead of a sharing dish unto itself.  the bowl of bacon peanut brittle was fantastic - really, really fantastic. as for the entrees, i made the mistake of ordering the grilled lamb t-bone with black eyed pea and mushroom succotash and fried onion rings.  the lamb was charred and the onion rings were greasy, but the succotash was good.  i tried the buttermilk fried chicken which was very good, and my friend who ordered the burger said it was great (though full disclosure it was the first he'd had in 6 months). the highlight of the meal - short of the bacon peanut brittle, was the dessert.  the german chocolate cake with toasted pecan was perfect, the caramel banana pudding was amazing, and the hot chocolate car bomb topped with bailey's marshmallows was original. while i'd definitely come back, and probably order the fried chicken, i'd really recommend the place for drinks and dessert, and a bowl of bacon peanut brittle, before i'd mandate that one go for a full dining experience.
