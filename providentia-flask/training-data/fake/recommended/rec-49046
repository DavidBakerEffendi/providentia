Wow. New Haven needs a new Korean food haven asap bc this place is not it. Went in with the bf and found it completely empty. Placed orders, waited 20 mins for water. 47 mins for food. 48 mins for side dishes. 49 mins for utensils. Too much oil and sides are below average. Think soggy beansprouts, store bought kimchi, burnt odeng. Owners, good people. Opening up a restaurant business, not the greatest idea. Go elsewhere...
