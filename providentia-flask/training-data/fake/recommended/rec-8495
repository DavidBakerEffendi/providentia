The staff is friendly, the bagels and coffee are fresh, and those combine with atmosphere to make me feel very much at home. Another plus for this place is that it's also a pet friendly spot, Not that I would subject the other patrons to my pup for extended amounts of time. I appreciate that if I'm taking my dog on a long walk he can come in with me while I grab a quick drink and I don't have to leave him tied up outside in the cold. They're a bit of a walk from house but when me and my dog are on a mission B2 is usually a short stop I have to make.
