This place is a tourist trap. It's extremely overrated and overpriced. I've never paid $18 dollars for french toast. Not to mention the service was terrible. We hadn't even finished our meal and the waiter was already cleaning up the table. If you want to go to a great brunch restaurant, try Aurora.
