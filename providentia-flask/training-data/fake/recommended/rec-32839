We frequent Chengdu 1 about once a week. It is our son's favorite restaurant. We find it to be the most authentic chinese food in the area and this is after spending significant time in Asia. The menu is extremely varied and has something for any palette. If you like your basic orange chicken, pepper steak or sesame chicken they have that. If you are more adventuresome and want tripe, kidney or rabbit they have that. If you want something that they don't have on the menu they will prepare it for you. And everything they serve is excellent. The only word of caution is when they menu says hot and spicy it is really hot and spicy. if you typically order your food "hot" in other restaurants we suggest "medium" at Chengdu 1. Also do not be put off by the location (in the Pilgrim center next to the closed cinema 23 or the decor which is spartan at best. The food is outstanding and not to be missed.
