With all these great reviews, we set our hope probably way too high... It was our 10th anniversary, so we decided to come here to celebrate. Our reservation was at 8:30p, and when we arrived, they said we had to wait a few mins, and pointed us to the bar. The place was packed. After we sat down, it took the server a while to take our order. Since we didn't want to rush, we didn't mind the slow service. We ordered a pizza, which was delicious. We had the pork rib pasta, which was amazing. The two courses were so great that we anxiously waited for our secondi-leg of lamb with a side of artichoke. After waiting for what seemed liked an eternity, the entree was a big disappointment. For $38, we got a few tiny pieces of lamb, rare, season less, and chewy. The artichoke was undercooked, tasteless, and burnt on the outside (we overheard later that the couple next to us didn't like their artichoke either.) it was such a great let down. For dessert, we got the beignet...big mistake. If we only had the pizza and pasta, we would give this place 5 stars. but the main course was Â simply a 1 sta. if we ever go bk, I would never get any secondi from them
