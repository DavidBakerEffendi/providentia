My 2 brothers, 2 sisters and I had dinner at Franklin few weeks ago and the 5 of us enjoyed a great meal, service, atmosphere.  My bro had an awesome steak, I had the tuna that was out of this world.  We just made plans to go back.  Casual, fun atmosphere, cordial accommodating staff and good food.  Prices were medium and well worth it.
