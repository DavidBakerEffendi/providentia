Prosperity Dumpling is one of those places that I definitely crave to eat at, for both value, and flavor.  With the plethora of dumpling houses and carts throughout New York (and I've tried most), I find this place to be my favorite in value and taste.  The mixture of pork and fresh chives in a home made dumpling wrap equates to a simple yet truly flavorful balance that hits home for me every time. There shouldn't be any hesitation to try this place.  At worst, you are out of a dollar for 5 pieces.  If you are ordering to go, make sure to pour on some sauce before you leave.  They don't give sauce packets for to-go like others.
