Again I was not too impressed with a Steven Starr endeavor. The interior of the place were great. I love how they kept the diner seats from Midtown IV and the overall dinner vibe, but the food was just ok. Nothing really too special and extremely small portions. The margaritas were pretty good, not too over priced. I ordered the Camarones, which were delicious, but only 5 came on the plate and that was it. I still had my appetite in tack when I left. bummer. Note: The order of guacamole comes with 7 chips. An order of chips will cost you. Not Cool Mr. Starr. Overall I guess I was a bit underwhelmed. I would go back for the atmosphere and a margarita.
