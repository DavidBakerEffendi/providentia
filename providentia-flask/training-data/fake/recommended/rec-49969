I love this place! If you like mussels this is a score because they give every customer who dines there free muscles. You can taste that the sushi is fresh. The sushi really has to be fresh by default considering this place is always packed with a wait. Inside they only can seat maybe 20-25. We went last week and had to wait about 30 minutes but we did because we feel the food is worth it. Another thing is their rolls are bigger than most places. Some sushi places are here make smaller rolls. They also give you a free mini drink that helps digestion. There is a nice big TV in there and they usually always have good stuff on- If there is a yankee game, or something going on they will have it on. It provides a nice background ambience.
