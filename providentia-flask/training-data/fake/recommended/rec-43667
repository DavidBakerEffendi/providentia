Don't let the cheap prices fool you, this food is anything but cheap. Great flavors, huge portions, what more can you ask for. Even bottles of wine are cheap compared to other restaurants. Big fan of the kang massaman, fried calamari with that spicy tangy sauce and their fried rice dishes are excellent as well. Service can be a bit slow especially on busy nights but overall a must place to try, it won't disappoint. By the way, CASH ONLY
