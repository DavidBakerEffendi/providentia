So decided to stop in and try a cheese steak at pats king of steaks, what a disappointment figured coming from NYC it would be better than anything I could find back home. NOT!! First off the meat is sliced not chopped, had no flavor, the bread was weak and really didn't stand up to the steak, not even toasted, the onions , tasted like they came outa a can , the cheese ( got provolone ) again no flavor and not even melted, Oh and where are the peppers man, cant have a cheese steak without peppers! All in all very poor , I can get a better tasting cheese steak from papaya king on the corner of 42nd and 9th for $7.50 with fries and a drink. And to be fair I went across the street to try Gino' same crap! Final word can get a better cheese stake for half the price in NYC
