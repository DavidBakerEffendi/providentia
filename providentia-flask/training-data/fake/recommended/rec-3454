"They are who we thought they were." You can't look at a list for best burgers in NYC without seeing this establishment on it. I was prepared to be amazed! Came here on a Monday afternoon during lunch hour and was surprised that the place was empty after reading all the reviews about having to wait in line much like the DMV. The place had this cool, quiet, old bar feel to it and the service was quick. The menu is on the wall because the menu is just that simple. Only about 6 items. I ordered the Bistro Burger which was a bacon cheeseburger. My initial reaction is that this is the type of burger you can get from anybody's backyard BBQ. Nothing wrong with that but I expected a little more than a burger you can make at home from any ingredients you buy at a supermarket. The bun was pretty much your standard bun you can buy anywhere that comes 4 in a bag. I don't know if this had anything to do with eating on a Monday but the bun was really stale. It crumbled a bit. The burger was cooked at the proper temperature that I had specified, I will say that. It had a nice pink inside but the outer edges were a little too hard and blackened for my taste. Again, much like a backyard BBQ burger. Nothing wrong with that. The bacon quality really stood out and you could tell it was very freshly cooked. The place had this really chill West Village vibe to it and I'm sure, to a lot of the patrons, this joint is like an old friend that doesn't go changing on you every 5 years. I have an old buddy that will occasionally invite me over for a BBQ but I don't go over there because the burgers. This is kind of like that.
