This is place is great. The food is really good. We got 4 tapas for 2 people. The tapas did not come all together but one after the other one. I don't know if they do this on purpose, but it improved the experience a lot. I guess it works if you are sharing all the tapas. If you are not sharing, you might end up eating at different times. We got the following: Gambas En Salsa Verde: delicious and good size. Croquetas De Bacalao: tasty, but somehow small. Only 3 little pieces. Patatas Bravas: Good amount of potatoes. Pulpo A La Gallega: Nice ending to a great dinner. Along all this food, you get (unlimited?) amount of bread will olive oil. The waiter tried to convince us to order one more tapa at the beginning, but these 4 tapas + half a pitcher of sangria (with red wine) was the perfect amount of food. At least for us two. Service is also really good. An on top of this, if you go say a Saturday around 8.30 or 10.30, you get a flamenco show. Pretty entertaining. I wouldn't go there for my birthday, unless prepared to dance flamenco. The place is a little pricey, but taking into account that you get a show and good food, it worth the experience. I'm glad my girlfriend took me here, hehe.
