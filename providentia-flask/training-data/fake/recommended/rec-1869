5 stars but reducing 1 star for lack of seating and allowing people to loiter during lunch. Cool trendy coffee shop and cafe with great Austrailian inspired food (yes, they have Vegemite). I ordered the Turkey Confit sandwich for $10, which was shredded turkey with and apple relish mixed in.  It was served with a small side salad of greens and cranberries. I enjoyed the sandwich but there was no place to sit. There are only about 10-12 seats and most were occupied by college kids studying or chatting, instead of eating.  The age-old issue of "do you let people hang out at the coffee shop or push them out so others can sit and eat."  I stood and ate in two locations in the cafe, hoping that someone would leave. The service was great, friendly and courteous. I will go back.....but early enough to get a seat!
