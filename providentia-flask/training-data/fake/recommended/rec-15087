I'll admit I haven't ventured far in the menu, but the bánh mì is my favorite around. The service is extremely friendly, and Khan genuinely cares what you think of his food. recognizing my husband and I as regulars, when he changed the sauce on the bánh mì he implored us to call him when we got home with our take out and let him know how it was. Everything here has a freshness to it- crisp veggies, flavorful sauces, and the prices are incredibly cheap.
