Drop off luggage.  Check into conference.  Head straight for hand drawn noodle house.  That's basically how my first 4 hours in Philadelphia went.  Even though I only had a sketchy mental map, I was able to find the restaurant easily by it's bright yellow awning.  It was cold and wet outside which made the small, warm dining room even more inviting.  Every seat in the house has a view of the noodles being made in the kitchen.  No doubt about authenticity here! On my first trip, I ordered noodle soup with no toppings. (The veggie tummy can handle the broth, but not the meat!)  The noodles were soft and tender but had a snap to them at the same time.  The pickled veggies on top were a perfect contrast to the fatty richness of the broth. Second trip I ordered peanut noodles.  Hand drawn noodles with a sweet, salty, spicy peanut sauce.  Heaven!  Heaven of a dish!  And for only $3, I could eat it for every meal.  Nanzhou is now my destination of choice when I'm in Philadelphia!
