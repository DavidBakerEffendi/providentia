Randomly ended up at Ear the other night on the reco of 2 awesome ladies we were seated with at a John Waters show at city winery. I absolutely love this place! One of the oldest bars in the city, so eclectic and a really great vibe. There was a live jazz quartet tucked in the corner, playing amazing music, and some stranger sat at our table and let us share his burger (don't worry he cut it in half first;), and I can honestly say it was the best burger I have ever had. I mean I can't stop thinking about it (and I rarely ever eat burgers). There are some tables in the front near the bar and a section of tables in the back if you're there for more of a dinner with a group. Overall just a really chill place with a warm inviting vibe. Great place to just stop for a beer and listen to some music. If I had a bar stool, it's the type of place you could sit at all day!
