We love Indian food! And moving here from DC which has a plethora of India food choices has been hard... so I was so excited to check out this new Indian restaurant! It did not disappoint! Owned and managed by the same people of Tiffin this is a more contemporary twist on Indian cuisine, with of course some of the "traditional favorites" such as Tandoori Butter Chicken. Ordinarily I can't have Indian food without a extra spicy helping of Lamb Vindaloo, but I traded that for the Kashmiri Lamb Shank and it was amazing!!! I asked for it extra spicy, so it was a good thing that I got the Goat Cheese Naan to help cool it down. Yum! We thought that the prices were very reasonable, especially given how large the portions were. We ended up taking home leftovers after ordering too much, which was not an issue, because just like Chinese food--- Indian makes great leftovers! The interior space was beautiful and the staff was so nice. They had several large tables set up with big groups, so we will need to bring our families back here soon!
