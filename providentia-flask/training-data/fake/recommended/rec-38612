I was pleasantly surprised at Rex 1516. I'm not generally one for southern food, but I came in with my boyfriend on a quiet Sunday evening. We were the only ones there for most of our meal, but it was really relaxing and calm. Sitting by the window was a nice treat. Service was truly excellent - they selected a really great wine to go with my boyfriend's chicken. Not at all overbearing considering we were the only ones there, either. Portions are large. As comfort food can go, the food is very rich, so be prepared for a food coma after!
