I stopped by Gueros today for some tacos. Usually I get off the Franklin shuttle and pass by because the place is so packed. Now I understand why! I tried two tacos, the fried avocado and jalapeno taco and the chorizo taco. I loved the fried avocado and jalapeno taco! It was amazing! I loved the chorizo taco, but it was too oily and my taco fell apart. Overall, they make great tacos. Tacos were pretty big too (I was full after two tacos). The service was good and the cashier was very friendly. Seeing as it was my first time, she recommended the tacos and gave me a general summary of the restaurant. The tacos didn't take to long (about 3-4 minutes). I picked the right time to go too! Happy hour just started and their tacos were $1 off. I will definitely stop by Gueros more often or get something delivered soon!
