Please, please, Where is the delicious cream of crab for the crab fries. I was so , so, disappointed with the food from this restaurant. Nothing is what you would expect. Don't fall for the freshly made each order bull sh*t. The famous crab fries are minus crab and hard as rocks,loaded with salt and old bay so,  don't risk your health , trust me! This place is way over priced for the food and the drinks are watered down but, if your here for the game and a few shots they have great screens and so,so music. They are so sticking it to every one whom gets served here! You'd be better off going to red lobster to sea food differently....which up until my visit to chickies was a joke about there small portions, but if you really want small portions just order chickies & peas 3 crab cake entree ( not served with fries or salad) for $21.00  and awful tasting. Bone petite! Not!
