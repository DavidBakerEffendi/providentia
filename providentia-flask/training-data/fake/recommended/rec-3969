Thought we would try it out for restaurant week.  The food was good.  The zucchini app was light and refreshing.  I tried Hake (white fish) for the first time and it was cooked in a citrus sauce and seared lightly.  The flavor was a little salty with hints of citrus,  mushroom and onion it was delightful! The chocolate mousse was airy and divine!  This was a lively atmosphere with attentitive wait staff.
