I had the pumpkin ale which was delish! we ordered nachos & mussels in white. the nachos were huge, crunchy, and covered with melted cheese. They had guacamole and sour cream on top and both were really good! The mussels in white were spicy but just enough and super tasty. We will def be returning!
