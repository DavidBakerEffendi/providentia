My boyfriend insisted that we try this place out because he had heard all this hype about it. After having had the food, I do have to agree that it really is too hyped up. Not to say that the food wasn't good, but it wasn't "OMG I must have that all the time!" type of great. Not bad for a street vendor though, and the prices were decent. We each got a plate of the lamb/chicken combination with rice and beans or something, and I have to admit, the portions were very generous. We probably should have ordered one plate and shared, because neither of us could finish ours. The lamb was juicy and moist, and the pita bread and rice were quite good as well. But not a fan of the chicken, although my boyfriend seemed to prefer the chicken over lamb. In their defense, I usually only like chicken when it's crispy and super unhealthy. Yes, there was quite a line, but I didn't think it was particularly long. Maybe it's because we arrived early and missed the lunch crowd, but it's not any longer than I normally wait at a food truck. For people who complain their food was ready too quickly, I don't see how that's a valid complaint. It's not as if they had frozen meat that was microwaved and ready in five seconds. They simply had a lot of meat cooked at once, and it was staying warm on the grill. And really, I like that my food didn't take over 10 minutes to get ready because I was starving. Overall the food was good, but nothing super special. If I happened to be walking by and wanted something cheaper to eat, I wouldn't be opposed to coming here again. But I am definitely not walking 10 blocks again just to have some of this.
