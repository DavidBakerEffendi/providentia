Is there anything one can say about Village Whiskey that hasn't already been said? Probably not. But I'm gonna say some stuff anyway. There is very little I don't love about this place. The speakeasy atmosphere, the tufted leather booths, the old-fashioned cocktails (if they ever stop making the Ginger Rogers, I'll be the saddest girl in the world), the burger (one of the -- possibly the -- best in the city), the pickles... And the bartenders! This seems to be a theme in all Garces joints, but I can't say enough about these men and women. They are unfailingly friendly, professional, and strikingly knowledgeable. They've patiently answered all of my inane questions in impressive detail, from "what are bitters?" to "what's that thing that looks like a baby brain in that bottle of brandy?" I've brought many a date here (so many, in fact, that I fear the bartenders would begin to judge me, if not for their eminent professionalism, as noted above). But I realize now that the object of my affection has always been you, Village Whiskey. You're everything I want. You exude sex appeal and quiet confidence. You're smart but not pretentious; manly but not macho. You comfort as well as intoxicate. Sigh. You complete me. Caveats... it's small. It's crowded. It's pricey. But hey, this is Rittenhouse, you know the drill. (And it's totally worth it!)
