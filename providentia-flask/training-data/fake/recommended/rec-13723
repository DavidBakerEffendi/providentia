Not bad for 6.95. I was a bit sad because the medium rare burger looked more like a medium-well burger. Maybe I should have asked for raw? It was really good but I would have liked it better if it was more... red. Just a note to those who like their meat bleeding. But this is perfect for those who like theirs well done. I'm definitely coming back for a revisit. I feel like i need to justify it.
