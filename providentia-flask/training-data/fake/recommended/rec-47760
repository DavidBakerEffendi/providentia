The clam pizza is reallllllly, really good! Especially if you like thin crust pizza! :) The medium size is quite large, so just a heads up. Also got a sausage and anchovy pizza with mushrooms-- yummy!! Real crowded, so go early. Also, if you park in their lot, there's a dude there with a Pepe's shirt on that says he will watch your car. We felt the need to tip him, but I did think that was odd!
