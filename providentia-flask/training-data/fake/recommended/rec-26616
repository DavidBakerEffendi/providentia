Don't be put off by the sign that says "50% off Sushi everyday". They have very fresh, tasty sushi! I've never eaten there, I always get take out so I cannot comment on the wait service, but everyone I have dealt with was always pleasant and spoke English well. They have a wide variety of specialty rolls, my favorite is the Fire Island roll. If you like sushi, you will not be disappointed and you can't beat the prices!
