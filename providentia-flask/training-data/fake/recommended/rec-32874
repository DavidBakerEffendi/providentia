Used to be our go-to place for take-out dinner.  However, in the past year or so has gone downhill considerably.  Looks like there was a management and service turnover which has not been advantageous.  Tried to order a wrap that is on the lunch menu for dinner and was told "NO!".  I don't see why as all of the items are on the dinner menu in some form or another.  Skip and head to Fortes who have upped its game and consistently puts out great food and service. The thin-crust wheat is really good, though.  But still not worth the BS.
