I love this place! My italian boyfriend can't get enough, the platano relleno is our favorite appetizer and they have this cocunut breaded thing which is also good. Last time we went we had a few glasses of red sangria (so good!) and the steak. He had the pork dish and OMG AMAZING! The music, people, servers, drinks, food..its all worth it! There is usually a wait on weekends but nothing too crazy.
