Red Eye is a great addition to what is now a micro food and drink paradise blossoming on Walnut Street. Farm Market + Le Salbuen + Montclair Bread + Gina's + Halcyon! The coffee is Intelligentsia and the owner came from the old mainstay Cafe Eclectic. Try the Highlander Banh Mi, it rocks so hard. The Chorizo Frittata is also delicious. Â  A few times the food and service were under par, but it's a rarity. With plentiful WiFi and a great vibe, it's always worth a visit.
