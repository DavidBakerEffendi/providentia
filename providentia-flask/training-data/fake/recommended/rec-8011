This hole in the wall joint has some of the best Chinese food I've ever had. We got the noodles with peanut sauce as a side, and I got the Roast Duck with hand-drawn noodles. The broth was delicious and fragrant, the noodles were amazing and the roast duck was the best I've ever had; crispy on the outside and moist and delicious on the inside. Wife got the egg and vegetable, which she also declared excellent. We've gone there twice now and walked 3-4 miles for the meal, and it was totally worth it.
