I just love Sabrina's.  The food is excellent!  I tend to order the same things (since they are what I look forward to)... barking chihuahua and Challah french toast (stuff or unstuffed).  I have had other things like pancakes, veggies, tofu scramble, etc.  I don't think you can go wrong with whatever you order. Service is quick BUT it'll take you forever to get a seat during the weekend brunch hours (which is when I tend to go).  There is a call ahead service though.  The restaurant is kinda small and the tables are close together but the music (there's always a variety), good food, and atmosphere are great distractions.
