What more can I say...really went out my way to find this place! Frjtz(S.F.) you got to try harder to win my heart. A small order w/ mushroom mayo hit the spot, hole in the wall, very limited seating. You even get to sample of different sauces. Wish they opened one in San Francisco. Fast service for what it is. See you next time!
