Ive  had Boardwalk Fries twice for lunch in Olio Lounge and they are to die for, french fries with melted cheese, bacon, and ranch!! Love, love, love!!! I also had dinner in the lounge a few days ago the calamari is delicious with the dipping sauce they serve it with and my shrimp & penne with Lobster-marinara was excellant! Not to mention the the hotel/Olio' s design and decor make you feel like your at a boutique-y NYC hotel!  I Highly reccomend Olio to anyone in the area...
