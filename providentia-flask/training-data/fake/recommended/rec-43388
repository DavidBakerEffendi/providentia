Easily overlooked, Brooklyn Star is tucked away on a residential corner very close to the Lorimer/Metropolitan L stop.  Its' spacious dining room and charming bar area offers a fantastic take on traditional soul food at reasonable prices.  Come hungry: the portions are huge, often very rich, and quite filling.  The vibe is comfortable, relaxed, and refreshingly free of the neighborhood's foodie pretensions and cramped interiors.  Standouts include the mac and cheese, meatloaf and steak.  My single complaint is that Brooklyn Star unabashedly commits the nearly unforgivable sin of putting BBQ vinaigrette directly onto its' fantastic oysters without warning.  Oyster garnishes should always be optional, no matter how adventurous they happen to be.
