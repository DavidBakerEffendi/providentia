I could eat here every night of the week.  If you're seeking comfort food, look no further.  The menu is diverse in that is has something for everyone: beef, chicken, and fish.  My favorites include the Corvina com Vatapa (grilled pollack with a seafood flavored bread puddling that has a consistency of mashed potatoes - my favorite) and the Moqueca de Camarao (shrimp stew) is heavenly.  Definitely a treat for your taste buds!  Cheers!
