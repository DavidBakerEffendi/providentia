I discovered this taco joint back in October after being displaced from Hurricane Sandy. Theres a reason why I gained so much weight this winter, I was eating at Five Tacos about 5 times a week haha. Not only is the food on point, but the service was even better. The workers there make the place worthwhile! I highly recommend getting on their good side, you'll soon be benefited with extra chips and bigger tacos! Tip them - they DESERVE IT! Also, they have about every sauce in the book, whether you like mild, medium, tangy or extremely hot, they GOT it! Highly recommend testing the Devil Sauce there. Keep in mind, you'll need about 2 beers to quench your thirst ;) All in all, best taco spot around!
