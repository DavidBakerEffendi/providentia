Been dying to come here to try there well presented Thai food.. I was so excited first time stepping In..the place looked nice...there was a lot of people dining...the area was packed...so i thought the food must be amazing...i had to wait for about five mins in until I  got seated ....finally the waitress came and got me seated... the people work there was caring and attentive...the seating sucks...it was so tight I felt like I moved alittle and everything would just fall down... Went to the bathroom and was really hard to get up and walk there since the tables were so close together It just made the whole process of getting up such a pain in the ass... There was only one bathroom for men/women...so I  had to wait for awhile that was kind if frustrating... They have quick service...there was a good amount of people working there...the menu is a good size...a lot to chose from ..I got the room service pad Thai it was good but the seafood inside the pad Thai can be overwhelming...the pineapple with rice was well season but the proration was really not that big it was just a small cone shape fried rice which I didn't really care for... My appetizer was the best! I got the tuna tar tar... I was moist and tastefully..loved the decor was nice... Really dark so you can't really see what you are really eating...the seatings is what really pissed me off... I hate eating in restaurants in tight spaces make the whole dining experience horrible... I might come back for lunch just to check out other stuff...but for dinner was a disaster!
