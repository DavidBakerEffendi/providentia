Amazing bar. You can't find a bar in Bayonne with a better tap selection and an even bigger bottled selection. If you love craft beers this is the place to go. Their menu is even more impressive making "bar food" a thing of the past and serving up amazing dishes. From local beers to the local grassfed meats they use it becomes difficult to find some place as locally sourced as they are. It's great to finally see someone get a bar right in this town for once. It does not get better than this.
