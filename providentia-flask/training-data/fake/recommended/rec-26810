Customer service: I had dinner here yesterday and left my credit card. I called this morning and was advised that it was in the safe. I came immediately after work and the manager Suzy gave me a hard time. Â She said she was too busy to get my card from the safe and I should come back or wait around until she's free. When I asked how long, she said she doesn't know. Really bad service. Their servers don't even smile. For a restaurant with a Southern theme, they lack that Southern hospitality. She did ask me to come back, that's only after I got home and called the restaurant. Food: While the brisket and Carolina chopped pork are ACCEPTABLE, they lack that tenderness. The smoke was good though. Forget about the ribs and wings. They're tough and dry. If you really want some good Southern BBQ and wouldn't mind going to the city, try Hill Country BBQ at 26th street and 6th ave. It is worth the travel. I would have given this restaurant another shot but the customer service is just horrible.
