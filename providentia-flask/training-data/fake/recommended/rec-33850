My girlfriend and I were lucky enough to dine at Marrakesh yesterday on a tuesday where you don't need reservations. It was my first time there, and inspite of all the hype that surrounded the restaurant, my dining experience surpassed my expectations on virtually all levels. When you walk into the restaurant, you feel immediately as if you were in a different world. The restaurant is a converted two story house, and the walls are lined with different types of tapestry. The ambiance is superb- a light arabic soundtrack in the background and great mood lighting. Of the various dishes I had, I was most pleased with the spicy chicken in cumin sauce, the meat comes right off the bone and the sauce is out of this world. The eggplant from the first appetizer is awesome as well. I've never tried anything like the bstella before, and it was a very interesting and savory combination of sweets bread and meat. If you are looking for a pleasant dining experience that you can build your weekday or weekend night around, i strongly recommend that you try Marrakesh, its a staple of clinary excellence in philadelphia, and it will be celebrating its 30th anniversary soon. CALL WEEKS in advance if you want a weekend appointment, weekdays tend to be less crowded and more forgiving if you call the restaurant before you head out to see availability.
