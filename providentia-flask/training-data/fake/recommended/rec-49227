Service was OK (we sat at the bar - that makes it easy enough) and while I like the idea of smaller glasses of water to avoid waste, keep them full if your customer is drinking it!! We had four bottles of wine but had to ask for more water repeatedly. Everything we tried was good, but not earth shattering. We ordered the boeuf bourguignon for two but the portion was really more appropriate for one person. Served in a copper pot and then plated, the carrots and onions were few and far between, and the accompaniment of egg noodles was totally sparse. Serve it with bread or something, anything! There were six of us in the party and two couples ordered the dish - truly it felt like they ran out and split the order for all four of us! Was an okay experience but I feel like we were humoring this 'new neighborhood hot spot'. Â And mostly, I'm still hungry!
