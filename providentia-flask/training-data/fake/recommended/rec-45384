I would rather go to a restaurant, that has a small menu and has perfected each dish, rather then a restaurant that has a large menu and the dishes are ok. Rucola is definitely the ladder. Rucola has perfected their dishes and every part of my meal was delicious. The atmosphere was so much fun, the service was great and the staff was very knowledgeable and had great recommendations. I will definitely be back!
