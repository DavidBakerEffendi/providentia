After being a long time patron, maybe I'm just getting spoiled but I feel like the quality of this place has gone downhill in the last couple years. Some of the workers are also pretty rude sometimes. I mean the food is not bad and it's still a great value but a lot of times it's just hype. I'll bring my friends when they come from out of town but for me, I prefer other carts in the city.
