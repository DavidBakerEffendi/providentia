Although a few businesses have occupied this location, they've always been bagel places as far as I could remember.  If I ever go out for breakfast, I usually go to big chain restaurants.  However, I decided to try something else for a change. I decided to eat local and support the businesses here in Bayonne.  I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised by this place.   They really seem committed to being successful in Bayonne.  They're on GrubHub, Accept PayPal, use Square for card payments, and are a member of the Bayonne Town Center.  I really wish more businesses in Bayonne embraced technology since it would make them more appealing and convenient to the tech-savvy consumer.  Their commitment to the community has definitely won me over as a customer.   Now, the place itself isn't exactly fancy by most standards: it's very casual.  The decor is sufficient, but it's not impeccable. The staff is friendly and very quick.  People kept coming through the door.  The place seemed to be enjoying regular, good business.   The food was decent, I would say.  Don't expect much on presentation. Styrofoam and plastic and paper products are ubiquitous.  Understandably, it's perhaps to keep prices low.  Perhaps they'll upgrade it after the profits really start to roll in.   I had a sausage, egg, and cheese on a poppy seed bagel. The person I was with had the French toast platter.  I admit that I've had better in other places, but I also suspect other places to use artificial products whereas this place kept it simple which I really appreciated.   All in all, I would return and recommend this place.
