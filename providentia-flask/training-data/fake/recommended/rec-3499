Read on here "best 'california style Mexican burrito' & def had to try it out since I'm a Cali girl living in NYC now.... & absolutely NOT. It's not like Cali-Mex food (which I miss so much). It a little more expensive than Chipotle too. It ok. May come back if I'm in union square wanting a burrito & not by chipotle.
