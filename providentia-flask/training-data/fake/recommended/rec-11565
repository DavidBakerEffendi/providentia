This place was a real hit. My kids really enjoy southern cooking, so grits with cheese and biscuits and gravy were spot on. The guy (Tony) taking care of seating was annoying and sat people ahead of us and we got stuck at the table right at the door. Good food and good company made up for Tony being a jack ass.
