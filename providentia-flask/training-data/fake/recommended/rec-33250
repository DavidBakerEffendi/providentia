I came here for a birthday dinner with a friend because I read great reviews and the menu options sounded yummy. I started the night with their Oyster special. I love oysters and these went down the hatch wonderfully with all the right fixings! For my meal, I ordered the patatas bravas and the sangria marinated steak. I've had better patatas bravas at Boqueria in the city (you must try them). These were ok, but the dish was heavy on the sauce which overpowered the potatoes. I asked for my steak to be cooked medium. It was definitely well done. I was too hungry to have them try it again, but I was disappointed that it didn't come out properly the first time. I also had one cup of their mango white Sangria and as someone else mentioned, it didn't taste like mango at all. I also don't know what it was made with, but I had the worst headache the next morning and that usually only happens if I have cheap vodka (I blame my college years). Â Anyway, I might try this spot again to have other dishes because a few of my friends have had really positive experiences. Unfortunately, it won't be a priority when I'm in Fort Greene.
