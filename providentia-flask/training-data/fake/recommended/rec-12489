Went around lunch time on a rainy Friday. Wasn't a wait probably bc it was raining hard that day but heard there could be long waits. Really friendly staff as soon as you go inside. There's a lot more space once you really enter and love how everyone working greets you in japanese. Heard so many good things about the pork buns so that was a must for me and my friends. Went there with 3 other people so we got 2 orders of them (pork buns come in servings of 2). Asked our waitress what the most popular ramen was and she told us the Akamaru Modern so we got 2 orders to share between the 4 of us. We weren't too hungry but all had an appetite and we were all satisfied by the end of the meal. Pork buns: Really good, highly recommend people to get. Can't really get this many places so would definitely come again and order this Akamaru Modern: Pretty good. I'm not a huge ramen person but it was good. Would probably get something else next time just to try out the different ramens but think everyone should try this. Pricey ramen place so I recommend people share and split things.
