Jalapeno margarita!!! It's not for the faint of heart... pair it with the super spicy salsa and you'll find yourself in an endorphin-rushed spicy paradise :) Guacamole and (homemade) chips were the perfect appetizer. I got fish tacos for my main course and was VERY pleased. I'm from Texas and have eaten a lot of good Mexican food but would have to say this is the best I've had on the east coast, hands down. The only complaint I would have is the long wait. One of our friends was very late and they won't seat you until your whole party is there so we ended up going somewhere else.. but we left the other restaurant (too loud) and came back to this place because my friend said it would be worth it. It sure was!!!
