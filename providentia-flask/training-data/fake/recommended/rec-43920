My go to brunch spot from now on. I live just down the way on the other side of Atlantic. I Â hardly venture that way because Atlantic gets crazy for crossing over,but had cabin fever from the storm. Price was great no complaints, portions were perfect , left full. My Bloody Mary was delicious and tasted fresh and was pretty strong. I ordered the steak and eggs through other yelp reviews and you can't beat it for the neighborhood and $$$. They cooked everything great perfect medium on the meat, eggs, and French fries tasted fresh extra crispy. My coffee was standard but not bitter tasted fresh from the pot ( not like tis been sitting all afternoon). Service was GREAT! Friendly,kind and accommodating. Couldn't of had a prettier atmosphere. I'm already ready planning next weeks visit with friends for happy hour 1$ oysters !!!! Great addition to the budding neighborhood.
