Short: If you stop in Burlington, you have to check this place out. Great local/farm-to-table food with a great craft beer selection. Long: We stopped by for lunch when we first got into Burlington. There seems to always been a wait to get a table, but thankfully we got there right before the lunch rush. My wife and I each got our own burger. Both were excellent. Fries with the homemade(?) sauce was great. I had a local craft beer on draft which was also awesome. For local craft beer, this isn't the best in the area, but it is definitely up there. Great locals like Hill Farmstead, Lawsons, and Fiddlehead. You can also get a can of Heady Topper if you ask. We shopped around Burlington for the afternoon and found that for dinner, we wanted to go back to try something else from them. Wife had the chicken and I had the meatloaf. Again, we were blown away. We sat at the bar this time for dinner since the wait for dinner was crazy long. Also had dessert which again was spot on. Like I said earlier, if you don't stop by here when in town, you down like good food. This was our favorite spot in all of Vermont and will definitely be going back when we're in the area again.
