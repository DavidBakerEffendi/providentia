Pros: modern Thai place, cheap lunch/brunch deals Cons: unimpressive food My review is limited to the brunch menu ONLY. As I walked in, I liked the ambiance very much; modern Thai vibe. Going through the menu, I was excited to see so many good options, especially the brunch deal looked very nice! For less than $10, you get the appetizer and the entree. I ordered; - Spring rolls: Ummmm... straight up micro waved ones... I don't know what to say... - Shrimp Pad Thai: This is NOT the authentic Pad Thai... To top it off, Â I felt like the spice lid popped open by accident while the cook was cooking... It was SOOOOOO freaking salty!!!!!!!!!! I fished out the shrimps and stopped eating... I ended up paying $10 including tax and 15% gratuity... I ate what I paid for I guess... I am not coming back here for sure... I've been to way better Thai restaurants in the city and this ain't one of them.
