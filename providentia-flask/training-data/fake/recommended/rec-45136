(Editing this review due to owner reaching out to my sister and apologizing on behalf of management. He also sent a gift card to my parents house to come back to Lucas) Poor management tonight. It was a disappointing evening because I drove all the way from Passaic County to meet my family for an 8:30 pm reservation to eat great Italian food but left after waiting almost an hour with no apologies from the manager. I felt really bad for my parents who have never been there before and never eat out late, but my sister actually convinced them to go because this was her favorite Italian restaurant and she even called back to confirm. After 20 minutes of waiting, the manager let my sister know that he was trying to get the guests to leave and that it would be another 2 minutes. Sitting and waiting, I look down at my phone and another 20 minutes pass by...Also another note - you shouldn't say that you're trying to get the guests to leave... What's the point of making a reservation? I get that the restaurant is small and only serves about 50 people at a time, Â but please have the decency to let us know that the restaurant is overbooked or show us that you care just a little bit that we've been waiting almost an hour.
