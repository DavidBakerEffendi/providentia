The first time I was there, days after it was first opened, everything was great. Good sushi, good miso soup, good service. The second time I came back, a couple of months later, I was very disappointed. First of all, they raised their prices A LOT! Secondly, their $15 square roll: 80% rice! I mean, come on! At least be fair about it. They have it under their signature special rolls but all you pay for is the rice. The other rolls, I will say are quite delish, but this one really unnerved me, especially for the price. I don't think I will be coming back there any time soon.
