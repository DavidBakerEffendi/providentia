It may be a mistake that I didn't eat a cheesesteak during my visit to Philly, but I think I can say Tommy DiNic's just about makes up for it.  An American sandwich shop located in the Reading Terminal Market, Tommy DiNic's claim to fame is their roast pork sandwich, traditionally topped with broccoli rabe and sharp provolone.  I say American, because this place is listed as "traditional American," but they're really an Italian sandwich shop well into their fourth generation serving up meatball, Italian sausage, and roasted meat sandwiches to the lucky denizens of Philadelphia. Unfortunately for me, I was traveling alone and already had a meal at the Dutch Eating House, so I wasn't too hungry when I sat down to order that classic sandwich of theirs.  Nevertheless, the roast pork sandwich with the ultra-garlicky broccoli rabe and mound of provolone was the most glorious sandwich I've ever had.  The meat was juicy and flavorful, but not too salty, and that broccoli rabe was perfection!  That is, if you're a fan of your breath smelling garlic fresh.  Fortunately for me - I was traveling alone.  Hah.  I'm someone who doesn't usually go for sandwiches for a meal, so it's quite a statement when I say this was possibly one of the best decisions that I made on my trip to Philly. Yes, I'm talking big.  So next time you're in the city, have a taste yourself!
