always delicioso! get the fish tacos. get the margaritas! get the guacamole. so good so good. i had to take a star off bc its so tiny and cramped and the barstools were rickety. thought i was going to eat floor a couple times... great food and great service and strong margaritas! i always come here for tacos. next time i wont sit on an unstable barstool.
