My dinner date ordered a glass of house red wine. Believe it or not: The glass of wine had a chewed up chicken bone IN THE WINE GLASS!!     I repeat: A chicken bone in the glass of red wine!! Obviously my female dinner companion was completely grossed out. The Maitre D was most apologetic but only complemented us our drinks and desert. He should have complemented us the whole meal and then some. Last time I take a date there.
