Have never had a bad meal here. Entrees are always deftly handled, with good attention to transparency of distinct flavors. The only drawbacks are the sometimes long wait for a table on weekends (no reservations) and the decibel level, which can mount to a disconcerting clamor with the tables so close to one another and no soft surfaces to dampen the noise. Nice, friendly service, though.
