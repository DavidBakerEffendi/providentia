Great place. We didn't try the wings. (I was on a date and they get sloppy haha) But the waitress is so spunky and fun. She was talking to us about how young we looked. My date got a burger and I got a grilled chicken sandwich. It was really good. Chicken was big and juicy. Typical bar food. They also have that extra room down the hall. I will say the bathrooms are the cleanest I've seen in a public restaurant let alone a bar.
