El Camino might be the best thing that has happened to my life. The veggie wings make me insanely happy...I order them all the time.  My favorite servers and bartenders (Jill, Jamie, Regina, and Cracky) are always so friendly and make it so fun to be there.  They find time, even when their busy, to ask how my day is going and make sure I get home safe.  Good food and good people=El Camino!
