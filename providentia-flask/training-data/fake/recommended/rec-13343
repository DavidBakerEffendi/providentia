I live for their steak and eggs brunch dish. Also, great sides, cocktails and overall awesome vibe. I was turned off by the mass outside but since I live so close, I had to give it a try eventually. The line outside is somewhat deceiving - the restaurant is really spacious with lots of tables so they turn over fast. I've never waiting longer than 20 minutes. Everything on their menu is great, you really can't go wrong. I love their omelettes and egg dishes. Friendly, efficient staff too. Solid neighborhood brunch place!
