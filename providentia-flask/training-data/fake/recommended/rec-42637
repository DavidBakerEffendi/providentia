Went for dinner with the Husband. Nice atmosphere, business/classy place. It wasn't too busy since it was a weekday night. We were sat right away. Ordered our drinks with calamari for an app which was good. Going on to entree, we had heard about the lamb burger but didn't see it on the menu. Since our waiter hadn't come back, we asked the waitress refilling our water. When asked about the lamb burger she said it was only available on the bar side of the restaurant and that we could not get it on this side of the restaurant. Ok? Somewhat weird since it was the same restaurant. When our waiter came back we asked again and he mentioned the same thing and that we could move to the bar. But we didn't want to sit at the bar. After some bantering he said he would make an exception for us.The lamb burger was good, I had the lamb meatloaf which was also decent. Overall good food, good atmosphere. Just a little weird the way the restaurant is divided.
