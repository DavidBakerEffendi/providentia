Tried the brunch buffet this morning. Not as many choices of food as I expected, but the food are good. I like the French waffle the most, it is so dense. Tried it with with chocolate chip and a scoop of blueberries, it is the best waffle I ever ate. The smoke salmon with onion also taste great. I can only tried a piece of the dessert as I am so full. Even I am so full, it is still taste delicious. I wish I have space to try more. Don't forget to ask for your cappuccino or espresso that come free with the brunch. I tried the cappuccino, it was way better than the one I had from Starbucks. The services was friendly, although the server greeted us "Have a Good Night" at 11:30am, but he did does a good job. He stopped by to check us out more than five times within our one hour meal time. Couple pull back are the restaurant is not big enough to accommodate big group and many kids during the brunch time. So need to be-careful with the hot food, when the space is small and many kids walking around you.
