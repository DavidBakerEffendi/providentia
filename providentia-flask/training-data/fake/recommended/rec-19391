Went there for dinner. Very nice for a ship! Ambiance is great, romantic. Be sure to go with someone who is not cheap, can appreciate something totally different from the norm & not afraid to try what's on the menu. The menu try must change occasionally, there are some things listed on the Yelp menu that were not on the menu. They also have specials not listed on the menu. Enjoyed!! Will return. Be sure to look at the drink menu, had the Ship Wreck & St Jamison Lemonade, uuummm!!!! Only thing parking is $15 & if you park on the street you have to feed the meter until midnight.
