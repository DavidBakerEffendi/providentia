I am sitting at my desk day dreaming about a Tommy DiNic's roasted pork sandwich with provolone and broccoli rabe... and Philly seems like a do' able drive from DC to get one. I'd seen on Food Network that this little sandwich shop counter located in Reading Terminal Market in Philly had the best sandwich in the country.  Doubtful right?   No, whoever had the authority to issue that label... WAS DEAD ON! Reading Terminal Market is packed with counters and little shops of just about anything your little heart desires... and that Saturday afternoon, Leah S. and I were on a mission for the best sandwich in the country.  The line at Tommy DiNic's was wrapped around the counter.  There were people seated and behind every stool, was another person anxiously waiting for that roll stuffed full of heaven!  Two people finished up and offered us their stools... and that long line became a thing of the past. The pork was roasted perfectly; we had our choice of greens, spinach or broccoli rabe.  We chose the broccoli rabe... added a little provolone and we were set.  I basically inhaled that sandwich, and I am not even a sandwich sorta person.  This was truly one of the best things I had ever eaten.   Seriously... we can be there and back in 7 hours, road trip anyone?
