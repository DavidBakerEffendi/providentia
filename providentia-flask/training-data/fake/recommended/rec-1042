The food really was outstanding.  No complaints whatsoever .. Everything was very fresh and insanely tasty!  Only 3 stars though because a friend who felt her dish was too spicy for her wanted to order something else instead because she didn't like it and they wouldn't take the dish off her bill..or even discount it.  That bothered me and for that reason alone, I will not dine there again.
