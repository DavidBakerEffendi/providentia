Figs is delicious! The ambiance is fantastic and the service is competent although laughably brusk (we asked the boy who poured our water what the spread was that came with our bread and he said 'white beans' and then we asked what it was called, and with not a little annoyance he said 'white beans' - it was hilareous...my father asked for bread before we ordered and our waitress treated him like a naughty child - 'no bread until you have ordered your dinner!'). Regardless, I ordered the apple, walnut salad, the baked brie and a lemonade. I have been drinking lemonade for years, and nothing has ever come close to being this delicious! The baked bried was made with honey, almonds and lavendar, and while I normally hate flower flavored food, this was spectacular. Â My salad was lack luster, it tasted like apples, plain walnuts, a slight sprinkle of blue cheese and ranch (?! Yuck) dressing. I wont order the salad again, but who cares! My mothers bday is next week and we will be returning again for brunch!
