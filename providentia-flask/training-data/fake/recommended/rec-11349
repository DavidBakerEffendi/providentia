Two words...Veggie Wings! HOORAY! So great that this place has a vegetarian option that will be fun to eat during football season. I don't see myself craving the wings or anything like that but they are good and a lot of fun to eat for a lifelong vegetarian who has never had the hot sauce all over your fingers experience. I also had the grilled corn which I think was really yummy! I will be back to try more things on the menu and possibly add some more stars...
