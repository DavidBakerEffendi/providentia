A lot of the positive reviews of this place begin with "best Chinese place in the area". I cringe while I type this, but....that could be true. Which is too bad, because this place is pretty awful. Don't get me wrong, when me moved to the Middle of Nowhere, NH we knew the quality of food was gonna take a hit. I mean, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the fact that there are literally zero Chinese places in the town that we live in. How is that even possible? Anyways...I hate to sound like the city boy complaining about country Â living so I'll just get to the actual review. The wife called to place the order and they said it'd take 25 minutes. I used to Chinese food being prepared so fast that I wonder if they have access to a time machine, so 25 minutes was a bit of a shock. Turns out it didn't take 25 minutes. It took 35. And the place was nearly empty. That's pretty much strikes 1, 2, and 3 right there when it comes to Chinese take-out. The beef teriyaki was kinda chewy, the lo mein was kinda gummy, and the duck sauce came in packets and was the consistency of grape jelly. We're not going back. If this is the best Chinese food in the area then we'll just satisfy our Chinese cravings when we visit the family back in southern New England.
