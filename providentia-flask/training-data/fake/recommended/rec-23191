I give it a 3-star, not because it is not good, it is, but it is nothing special and I was more surprised by minor defects than by nice surprises. I was there for a celebration with my husband and although we loved the food: hummus, meatballs, 2-way lamb, shrimp & chorizo, house salad; we were not blown away to give a 4-star or 5-star. Let's see, here is what we thinking you should keep in mind: 1. The raising bread you get at the beginning is good, but it would be nice to have more than a slice cut into 2 pieces 2. Hummus: we are used to a more firm texture and although the hummus was great, it seemed watered down. You also barely get enough hummus for 2 people and like 8 small pieces of Pita 3. The meatballs were awesome, I really did like this new dish in my list of Mediterranean food. The best part of it was the yogurt that came with it as it really adds this delicious distinct taste 4. The House Salad is really good, but at $9, it is a bit small, perhaps $6 would be a better price 5. 2-way lamb was very nice because it was accompanied by a little salad, hummus, mashed pot, and roasted peppers and onions 6. The Shrimp & chorizo had like 3 small shrimps and a round cut of chorizo here and there, so I was not impressed Overall, I think the place is pricy, but would give it another shot in the future. I guess if I had not been to other Mediterranean restaurants, I would say this is the best, but it is not. It also kindda bothered me that I felt the waitstaff was constantly looking our way most likely because we were one of two couples in the place, but this just added to the discomfort. I also realize now that this is more of a TAPAS place; expensive tapas place.
