I went here today for lunch and was so surprised that they've been here for over a year. How did I not know this? My super Mexican food powers must be failing me somehow. But alas I was most definitely recharged once I left. I had a pork taco and a few appetizers (guacamole, taquito's). My friend had the fish taco and was very pleased and energized as well! Do go here if you love Mexican / Cuban food. Everyone was nice the place was clean, Just Do It!!!
