This place was hands down my favorite place in New York. The staff is ridiculously friendly and the food is delicious! They were really welcoming and we ate here 4/9 days. You know the food is good when you keep going back even though your visiting a new city that has countless options! They were also incredibly kind as they let me park myself and my two huge pieces of luggage inside while we waited for a few hours until it was time to go to the airport. Recommendations: Challah French Toast and a Latte (seriously best latte in New York, and I'm picky!).
