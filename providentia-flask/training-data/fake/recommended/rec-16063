On the recommendation of the concierge at the Surrey (she said it was a favorite of the staff--how can you go wrong?) I marched my 21 yr old son through the rain for a casual dinner.  The place was busy, but had a table for two (reservations only for tables of six or more).  The staff there are friendly, helpful.  Service is spot on, despite busy night on a rainy Sunday. Food was excellent, chosen from a menu that tries to be authentic and yet accommodate the American palate.  My only criticism is that tables for two are smacked against a wall and the place is LOUD.  Aside from that, I will come back each visit because there is still much to try on that wonderful menu!  Loved it!
