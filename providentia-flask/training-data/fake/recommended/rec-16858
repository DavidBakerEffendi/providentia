So let me just say, there is barely a sign. It is a small window sign but nothing you could see down the block, so look carefully. I went with my mother and sister (who doesn't eat seafood). My sister ordered their awesomely priced lunch special (6 bucks?) (mixed veggies with tofu instead of shrimp), with egg drop soup and the meal which COULD have been a bit more flavorful but the portions were great. I ordered eggplant in garlic sauce, my fobby mom liked it but I needed a bit of a better spice kick and WAY too much visible oil for my liking. If you are going to make it oily, HIDE the fat up, dont make me feel horrible for eating it... I stared at my thighs the entire time, hoping it wasn't going straight there.. My mom ordered one of the "box" meals they offer (which is pretty good). She ordered a shrimp teriyaki after glaring at the woman next to us trying to figure out what her dish was...It comes with chicken dumplings that our horrible waiter didn't tell us about before even though we told him we don't eat meat which he could have replaced with one of the veggie dumplings they have ALREADY made (and we ordered).. it comes with 4 pieces of California roll, a pea size dessert and three pieces of jumbo teriyaki shrimp, she wasn't full but liked it.. Â  Everything COULD have had a LITTLE more flavor.. Also service was BAD.. I mean our waiter was a douche and should be fired but I am better than that so I will not disclose his name but if management is reading this, good food- crap service (he wears glasses and has long hair, oops)...
