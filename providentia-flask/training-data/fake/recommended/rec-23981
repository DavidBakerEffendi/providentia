Great atmosphere, great food, great service, great prices. I loved my mimosa, and took a chance on the tofu scramble (I'm not ordinarily interested in tofu scrambles) which totally paid off. The vegetarian sausage served on the side was incredible! And the jelly was really good too- it tasted homemade. My friend had the quiche, and she gave me a bite- great flavor in the roasted vegetables. Our only complaint was the inconsistent portion size. Our meals were about the same price, but she had about half the amount of food as I had. I'm not sure why the buzz about Rex 1516 hasn't taken off- right now I feel like I'm in on a huge secret!
