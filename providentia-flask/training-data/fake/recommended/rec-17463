We did the prix fixe for a friend's milestone birthday. On the upside, if it wasn't for the rain, the restaurant had beautiful views of the East River, and I really liked the design scheme - very modern, open, comfortable and maintaining a sense of intimacy - and I liked the fact that you can actually hear yourself speak in there! The Prix Fixe menus went for $65 - my choices were the Avocado and Hamachi Salad, the Sirloin & Brisket and the Cheesecake. I was not a big fan of the Avocado and Hamachi salad, which was basically a ton of sliced avocado, a a tiny morsel of Hamachi, and was drizzled with this substance that reminded me of vegemite (an extremely salty spread which tastes like concentrated soy sauce) - was a tad unpleasant. The sirloin and brisket was decent, but not great - the black radish consomme was surprisingly pleasant and mellow and offered an extra wetness to the meat outwith overpowering the beef. Finally came the dessert - again, on the disappointing side. The custard-consistency cheesecake was too tart and served on a impossible to cut crust which completely mismatched in textures. The cocktails were decent as well, AGAIN, not mind-blowing, I had the Pisco Watermelon cocktail which was refreshing, but that's about all I can say about it. The place has the potential to be great, but the food was just a bit of a let-down and that was kind of agreed across the table. Service was ok at best, it was hard to flag down a waiter, but on the other hand, you'll be permitted a long, leisurely dinner. My main issue with this place is that if you are spending this much money, I expect to leave really impressed with the food, else it's going to be a single visit.
