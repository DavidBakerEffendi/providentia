Took an overnight trip to Philly and an associate recommended Sabrina's for Saturday brunch.  We did not call ahead to put our names on the list as instructed, but arrived to find an empty table inside.  So we did not have a wait at all.  I ordered the huevos rancheros with a side of homies and they were incredible.  Almost too much food to finish in one sitting. The staff was fast and friendly and our waiter checked on us often. I absolutely recommend and will return on my next trip.
