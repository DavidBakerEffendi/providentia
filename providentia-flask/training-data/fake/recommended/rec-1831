I found this place on Yelp before I headed for NYC.  I was so exicited to go and realized it was some blocks away from my friend's apartment.  I trekked there by myself in anticipation of the sweet Japanese desserts (since Kyotofu failed to satisfy the night before).  I got there at noon and I was the first in the restaurant-traditional Japanese decor.  I was only planning on ordering the whole menu of dessert but since I hadn't eaten yet, so I settled on the lunch set.  First came the egg, mushroom quiche which was pretty good, except it was lukewarm.  Then came the potato and this one thing that I don't really know what it's called in English.  Both were ok, but disappointing because it's something I eat at home.  Then came the main tray with string beans, tea marinated salmon, rice and soup.  The rice, beans and soup (tomato and egg) are things my mom makes at home.  Tastes exactly the same.  Then the fish, I didn't expect it to be raw for some reason and I don't eat raw fish.  I was pissed because I forced two slices down my throat because I hate wasting food.  It was actually marinated fairly well, I could have imagined liking it if I liked raw fish.  Everything came in cute traditional Japanese plates/bowls but it was all too disappointing.  Then my hopes were brought up again at the thought of the black sesame creme brulee which came with the set.  It had really mild sesame taste which was unique to any other brulee's I've had (the best was a lychee creme brulee in Vegas..sounds weird but SO DELICIOUS) but not the best.   My meal also came with a tea which I requested cold chrysanthemum tea but it was really watered down and had no flavor to it.  I think I was just expecting alittle too much maybe, and it all just fell short.  I would love to come back though and try the other desserts, especially the toast.  I almost ordered it but I was so full.  Oh, and this is a cash only place so make sure you bring plenty.
