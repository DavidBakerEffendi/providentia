Yep, I'm an out of towner trying to do the whole tourist thing while on business.  I think people are expecting way too much from this shop.  I came here looking for incredibly gut wretching heart hurting food.  And boy, this place really satisfied my need for it.  In fact, they should put a surgeon warning on this place that you should probably be an athlete to handle the potential artery clogging food that they serve here.  After scoffing one of these sandwiches down and dousing it with a side of cheese fries, I was KO'ed in a coma back at my hotel room. If you're obese or have high cholesterol, think twice about going here, unless you're looking for a happy mouth watering suicide. I'm sure I could run my car with the table top kitchen grease of this place.   Otherwise indulge in your thousands of years of human evolution to seek out fatty food. :( and -star for sign, but I'm not going to get all butt hurt and cry about it.
