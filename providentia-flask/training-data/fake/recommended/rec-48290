The saddest part isn't the drop in quality or service over the last year or two.  The saddest part is that Da Andrea used to be our go-to restaurant when out-of-town friends or family came to visit.  No-brainer.  If you need a solid, well located restaurant with amazing, authentic Italian, good prices, and great atmosphere...Da Andrea.  Duh. But that's no longer the case.  We ate there last night with out-of-town family and decided after that, we need a new go-to.  The food is good, but a little overpriced, even by Manhattan standards.  Started with calamari appetizer and the tomato, basil, mozzarella dish.  Just good.  But for the price you'd expect at least one whole tomato on the platter.  It just feels like they skimped.  And the calamari, like other people noted in their reviews, is a bit chewy; definitely not close to the best we've ever had. Entrees were also...just good.  Ravioli special with butternut squash and pancetta...very good.  But the other staples on the menu from regular ravioli to spaghetti...just average and not memorable.  One person at the table didn't even finish their dinner, though they were still hungry. And the olives they serve on the side with bread are still out of this world.  But come on, at this point, they're practically decoration.  I think we got a small dish with 3 olives and a tablespoon of oil for a table of four.  Again, just feels like they're skimping more and more. Finally, the atmosphere is still great but the service is more and more pushy and less friendly than they used to be.  Everyone left feeling like our waiter and the servers were really brusque and unfriendly.  Again, even by Manhattan standards. So Da Andrea is still good, but after this last visit, we're definitely over it.  Looking for the next great go-to...
