Part of the German and Austrian (?) museum, we came because it's between the Guggenheim and MET, and we wanted to grab a bite. Don't wait in the museum line, as there is a separate line for the cafe. Also, if you don't are to eat in the finer ambience of the polished woodwork of the main floor cafe, with it's stunning views, you can skip the line and instead eat downstairs in the other cafe that has the exact same food (with a much shorter - or nonexistent - line) Great German sausages, good sides and fabulous coffee. They make Viennese hot chocolate, but if you ask for a mocha (which is not on the menu) they will make that with shots of coffee; it was delicious. There is a partial view of central park across the street, so excellent as a tourist. If you don't care about the view and just want the eats, head downstairs for a shorter wait. The staff told me the food was identical, but we waited for the nice room.
