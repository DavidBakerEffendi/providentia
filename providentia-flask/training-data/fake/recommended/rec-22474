Amazing atmosphere. Fantastic cuisine concept and wonderfully executed. Standout dishes are Dee's Nuts (appetizer), Collard Greens and Quinoa Salad and Nasi Ulam Rice (plates) and my favorite was the Yakamein Soup (for sharing). Wine, cocktail and beer selection was also well complimented to the flavors of the food. Will be back again for sure!!
