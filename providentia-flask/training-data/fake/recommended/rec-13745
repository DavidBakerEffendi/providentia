I had passed before this place many times before I actually decided to try it. I finally went in, late one weeknight, seeing as it was one of the only places open at the hour. Really, besides its dirt cheap prices, its hours are all its got going for it. The food left much to be desired and while the service was curt and swift, my bubble tea was not near the best I've ever had. Yet, I'll probably be going back. Where else am I going to get some sort of 'good' fast food at one in the morning?
