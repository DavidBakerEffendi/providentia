not that authentic...  flavors in the soups have always been really bland and watery.  Ive only dined here 3 times but I've never been really satisfied.   in a good location, and caters primarily to students in the area. unfortunately,  the truth is.... all the best Korean restaurants are all in not so great areas. =T
