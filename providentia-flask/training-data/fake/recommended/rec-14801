My boyfriend and I decided to try Mood Cafe after all the excellent Yelp reviews.   Neither of us had chaat before and weren't familiar.  The man (the owner, perhaps? ) running it explained it well and fixed us something tailored to our liking.  We both enjoyed our meals.  It was very fresh and the chicken was amazing.  My boyfriend tried the mango lassi and enjoyed it so much he got 1 to go.  The customer service here is what customer service is all about!  A rare gem any place!
