This is, and continues to be my favorite restaurant in Philadelphia.  Was just there on Thursday evening for dinner, capping my 4th Osteria experience.  It should be reserved for a special occasion, as the cuisine is pricey, and a bit rich.  However, always well, well worth it. I wasn't responsible for the tab so could be a bit more adventurous in what I ordered.  There were 5 of us, which made sharing a lot of the appetizers and primi plates easy.  The place prides itself on its artisan pizzas, which are delicious.  But this time, I was intent on trying as much of the menu as possible.  The pastas (like previously mentioned) tend to be fortified with rich meats (rabbit, chicken liver, and wild boar).  Taken in small quantities and shared across the table helps to keep your stomach settled, and taste buds more than satisfied.  The octopus, which is my favorite thing in the restaurant, came slightly more well done than I would have liked.  It was marinated and spiced perfectly though. I had the venison for a main dish.  She never asked how I wanted it cooked.  I only assume that the restaurant recommends medium to medium rare.  At first it arrived undercooked- in my opinion.  When it returned, it was overcooked.  Despite those issues, the dish was very well spiced and roasted, and paired with cranberry and cabbage.   Definitely worth a return visit, but I'd just caution you to make requests around what temps you would like your dishes done- rare, med, well, etc. RG
