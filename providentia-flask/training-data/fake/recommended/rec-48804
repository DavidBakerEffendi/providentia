The Boil over The Boiling Crab. Yes, I said it. I'm from California and even lived in San Jose for a few years (ate at Boiling Crab regularly). This place definitely tops Boiling Crab. First, their sauce (the Boiling Special) was super tasty. Very creamy. Comparable to The Boiling Crab's "Shabang" except less oily. We (accidentally) ended up trying their catfish basket - fried catfish and Cajun fries - and that was also very delicious and I'm normally not a fan of catfish. Food was overall great! I must mention that the service was also equally great. Our server, Asa, was awesome! Super friendly and on top of everything. Shoot, our busboy was even on top of his game (constantly replacing our garbage tin, refilling waters, cleaning our mess etc)! Definitely recommend and most definitely coming back!
