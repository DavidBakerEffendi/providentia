Prices are fair, food is good, ambiance is what it is. They didn't bat an eye when I wanted to order the chilaquiles with chorizo and a couple of eggs over. Yes, they are usually out of something or the daily special won't be ready until later but that's ok. I'm hoping for horchata and an outdoor patio come summer.... Stay away you Groupon hipsters!
