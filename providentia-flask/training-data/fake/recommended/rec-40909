My roommate wouldn't STFU about this place so I finally decided to try... Got the 'Pressed Chicken Sandwich' and after one bite I was like DAAAMN!! Even the fries and mixed greens salad that came with it were deliciously perfect. You can tell everything is made with high quality ingredients and is even presented beautifully. The girl who works the counter (who always seems to be there) is always friendly and helpful in her suggestions if I'm looking to try something new. Everything that I've ordered so far has been on point!! ..and very affordable! You can always taste the love put into each dish. I sometimes get a little sad when I finish my food. This is a perfect addition to the neighborhood--they've made a regular out of me. 5 STARS!
