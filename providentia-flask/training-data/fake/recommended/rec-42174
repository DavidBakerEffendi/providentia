This is the kind of place we need to see more of in Manhattan and certainly the financial district. They use real quality ingredients. Everything is fresh and flavorful. The bread, the cheese and the cold cuts. Friendly service. I highly recommend this place as an authentic Italian deli. It is so odd to find it on Nassau Street. It is the kind of place that you see in the Italian hoods in the boroughs. I'm glad it's here on Nassau St. Highly recommended!
