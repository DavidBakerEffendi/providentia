Basically the best Japanese noodle house I've ever been outside of Japan. We went there around 830pm but still waited for some minutes, then got seats at the bar. Following recommendations from my friend I tried the Pork Bun (or in Chinese we say 日本肉夹馍, lol). Bun was tendering, totally different feeling like Chinese Mo. Seemed they used pork belly (in Chinese:五花肉), with a little bit spicy and sweet, interesting. Then came the ramen noodles. I ordered the spicy flavor, which turned out to be wrong choice - it was not as tasty as the original soup. The spicy seasoning kinda covered the aroma from stewing the ribs. If you want another bowl of original soup, they would charge you another $5. What also impressed me was the infrastructure of the room - the bar was totally facing the kitchen - you could see the whole process of cooking the noodles. Only one drawback was CASH ONLY.
