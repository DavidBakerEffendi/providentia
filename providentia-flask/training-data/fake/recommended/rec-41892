Not sure why everyone bashes this place.  I hate stephen starr too but jeez.. philly isn't exactly paris when it comes to outdoor drinking joints.  I think it's a great place to have a beer, and no, you don't have to come with ten people.  I went with one chick tonight and it was really nice. BE WARNED: The vegetarian sausage tastes and feels like a nerf football.  Avoid at all costs.  Bad, even for starr standards...
