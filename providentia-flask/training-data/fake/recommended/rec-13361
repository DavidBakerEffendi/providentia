Yup....its true....6 bucks and in heaven. Probably the most popular food cart in NYC (3 food carts actually- Â one on the south west, south east corners and west side between 53rd and 52nd.) If you're hungry, this is quality delicious chicken/lamb and rice. A strangely satisfying and savory white sauce with a kickin hot sauce. You can just park it on the steps and chow down. It is a good portion, best shared for two. Just line up at the cart (there is always a line) and place your order. They pack it up and you go. Sometimes in life, the simple things are best.
