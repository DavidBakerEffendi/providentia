It is too commercial... yea.. but it is still very good!  I have plenty of Philly Friends that LOVE and HATE this place.  I happen to be one that loves it.  Anyone that hates this place is just from another neighborhood.  Sure Jim's is great, Dalessandro's is legit, but Pat's is as good as both of them. I love this place.  The sandwiches are very  good and the service sucks... what more can you ask for!  Anyone that says it sucks and only tourists come here... explain the line around the corner at 2 AM on a Saturday.
