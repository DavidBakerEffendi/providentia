Fantastic restaurant!  YUM!  Had a sampling of a variety of apps, including the guac (with appples!), some flatbread pizzas (mushroom was my favorite), duck meatballs (outta this world). Excellent salsas, be sure to try the habernero!  the black Bass was amazing. Make sure you save room for dessert, the ice cream sundae with Carmel corn will blow your mind! Awesome ambience. Can't wait till greenhouse is built outside with additional seating. Great service   Will be back very soon! Go here!!!
