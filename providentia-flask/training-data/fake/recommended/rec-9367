It was a rainy day last Saturday. Me and 3 friends came out from the Backroom around 10.30pm and looking for a place to have some food and more drinks. We found this Taqueria in Yelp and walked all the way in the rain to it. It was certainly worth the long walk. It was full when we got there, though we only waited for around 5 mins for our table. We got some candy while we were waiting. That was a sweet touch. Food was delicious and price was extremely reasonable. The classic margarita was good as well. We all loved vibe there. Feel like in Mexico! Even though I have never been to Mexico yet. lol. Will go back to try more food and drinks!
