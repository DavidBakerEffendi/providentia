Monday night dinner - fried chicken may as well come from KFC. I got rolls deepen in honey before dinner - it was a wrong thing as I expected some rolls and butter or olive oil - PRETENTIOUS!!! My husband got coleslaw with lost of onions (it was not mentioned in the menu) which he is allergic to. When we sent them back, the server didn't offer anything to replace it with. Very disappointing for a place with such a good reputation!
