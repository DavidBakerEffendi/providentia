I long for a decent Chinese/Japanese buffet place. I have yet to find one. The original place that was here some 10 years ago was actually pretty good. Those owners were Taiwanese as opposed to Chinese. That basically means they weren't as cheap as some Chinese owners are. Sorry but true. The Taiwanese and Japanese take much more pride in their food. Overall, the food here is what I would call cheap Chinese fast food. Nothing, and I mean nothing stood out at all. The fried calamari which is typically a somewhat safe bet, while cooked ok, was extremely salty! The "hibachi" grill was my other safe choice. You pick the ingredients and the chef cooks it fresh. It lacked any flavorful seasonings and was mediocre at best. The pre-made sushi was not good at all, though I didn't expect it to be good. For good buffet sushi you must go across the street to Sushi Village. Made fresh to order there and far superior. The General Tso's was not good, beef and broccoli (a staple) was bad. The beef was tough and chewy with no seasoning. Truly inedible. Soups looked horrible. Desserts what one would expect. Note: I saw mayo/tartar sauce sitting in a hot chaffing dish next to the fried fish!! Big health violation!! I love food, date an Asian girl and I know good Asian food....this ain't it. If I could find a good, decent Asian buffet, I would pay up for it. I guess we'll have to await the next owners and new name. I guarantee this place will go under in a year max. Oh well....
