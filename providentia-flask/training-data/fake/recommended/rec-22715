Yes, there were a few service miscues, but all in all I am looking forward to going back here again soon. As others have said, they have a HUGE menu.  This restaurant is where Houlihans used to be, and luckily they have kept the same family-friendly, but not madhouse, vibe that Houlihans had.  They also have a separate bar area and an extensive wine and cocktail list. There was a martini that I had my eye on, but I decided to wait until next time to try it.  The burger I had was good, and the fries were very good. The kids pizza easily served to little ones. And get the table side s'mores for dessert. They come with real Hershey bars.
