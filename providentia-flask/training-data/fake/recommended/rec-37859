great place! probably one of my favorite restaurants on my recent visit to new york. if you love wine (particularly riesling), this is your go-to place. i came here with three others for a lazy late afternoon wine and tapas lunch. we ordered several small plates for the table and each of us had a different wine flight. the servers know their wines so just tell them what you prefer, and they'll put together a perfect flight. the small plates were solid. you can order just about anything. we had an obscene amount of meat, some cheese, and a couple of other plates. i only wish there were more gluten-free options that were more filling than meat and cheese. i did order the duck salad which was ridiculously good. it was basically frisee drowned in duck fat and vinegar and topped with crispy duck. for the cost, this was a steal. while this place isn't cheap, i feel that the quality and ambiance are worth paying some $$.
