I organized my girl friend's birthday party here last weekend. Open table didn't allow me a reservation at this place for a party of 14, not sure why. But, I had no problem getting a reservation on the phone two weeks in advance. It was one of those rainy New York days with no cabs and heavy traffic, none of us were on time. They had a lot of people waiting for a table, still the owner was kind enough to understand our situation and hold the table for us for 40 extra minutes. Considering that they were losing business by doing so, that was nothing but great customer service. We were very pleased with our server as well. She handled the group so large without any panic or hesitation. She was on top of things throughout, gave us some great wine and food recommendations. We ordered few bottles of wine for the table, the Argentinian Malbec was spot on. Definitely ordering a couple of bottles for home. Similarly we ordered few appetizers to share. The African Mussels were my favorite. For entree, I went with 'Poisson Yassa', I have never had branzino so delicious in my life. Trust me, I eat quite a lot of branzino when I go out. The fish was cooked just right, there was so much flavor in the fish and in the topping. I highly recommend it. Another popular item from the menu was my husband's Lamb Tagine. After he had a bite of it, he was a happy man. More than he ate, he probably shared most to the rest of us cause he wanted to show what a great choice he had made. :) We had brought a cake for the birthday girl from Paris Baguette. Ponty Bistro charged us absolutely no fee to cut it and serve it. Also, unlike most restaurants do it, they didn't include gratuity in our final bill. We paid with 7 Credit Cards and remaining cash, there was no difficulty. Overall, it was a great night and an amazing experience.
