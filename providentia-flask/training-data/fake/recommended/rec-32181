Went on a sunday for lunch.  Miraculously got in right away in front of the line of families...they only had a table big enough for 2. So lucky us.   Had the veggie pizza (our second choice) as we were told we couldn't get our 1st choice (fresh tomatoes/basil/moz) because they only use fresh ingredients and didn't have fresh tomatoes....uh, that was really really strange to hear.  Should we have brought some tomatoes from the grocery store for them?  Anyways, the pizza was good, but not great.  So much for "only fresh ingredients", the mushrooms were definitely canned, so were the spinach!  Crust was only crunchy at the very periphery (a two inch rim), but soft in center.   Smoky flavor from the coal was good.  The black tar on your finger and under your nails is definitely not...especially if you're a physician. So  4 starts for service and historic nature of the place. but only 3 for pizza.
