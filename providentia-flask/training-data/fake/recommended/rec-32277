Perfect. Yet 4 stars, only because I hold out hope for something comparable to west-coast-pho. That being as it may, so good. No non-sense service. I mean, you ask for 'veggie pho' and its what you get minus the snooty/ dumbfounded attitude. Also, they got booze, booze plus coursed options w/ suggestions. This is the sort of place that if I were single would bring a date AND get lucky. Not in the heart of China town, between it and the highway, so, you know, no where to run. Moreorless at the center of that whole 'north 8th - 12th' center city scene. Date spot, great broth, booze, helpful service/menu!
