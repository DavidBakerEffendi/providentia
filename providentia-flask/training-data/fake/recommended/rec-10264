Has always been a treat for me. Barkeeps are very cordial. Don't know quite what occurred this past week. Monday I stopped in for a fabulous happy hour apizz, some oysters & shrimp & one drink. Beyond perfect, the pizza was ecstasy. Shown on FB to all my friends. Remarkably thin crusted as always and topped with scrumptious 'basic' flavours. On Friday, after being verbally 'solicited' in the carpark across the street, I admit I was a little rattled. Nevertheless, while the shrimp & oysters were good, I wondered if the pizza-maker had not left for a vacation in Palermo. Unlike any pizza I ever had at DISH cocktail hour, this was a bland crusted tortilla barely toasted. I asked for it to be well done and they took it back. It returned well done but tasting like a 'cracker'. Now, I know Passover. If I want matzoh, I know where to find it. Disappointed that they allowed it to happen. Hope it was just a Memorial Day cover! All the best.
