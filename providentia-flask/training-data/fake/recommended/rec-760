The experience of the all you can eat meat is a great concept. The service however was awful. I went there to celebrate 2 years with my boyfriend and we were treated like criminals. My boyfriend heard the bussers talking about us and making rude comments in Spanish. They even followed me to the women's room which felt extremely invasive. At the end of the meal they stood above us until I handed them my credit card. There are better places for the same meal up in the Northeast. Never again.
