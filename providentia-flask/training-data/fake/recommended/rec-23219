I find many of these chain restuarants to be hit or miss, but I must say Ruby  Tuesday continues to reinvent themselves.  The salad bar has a large selection and always looks inviting.  The dishes are fairly priced and the selection is vast.  Their burgers are really tasty and go well with their fresh home lemonade.
