I struggle to satisfy my serious seafood cravings in this city.  Like to feel really satisfied as if you just ate blue claws down the shore for hours and you can barely move.  Summertime satisfaction. I felt that at Luke's. I basically had one of everything. I was still a tiny bit hungry after the Taste of Maine so I got some lobster bisque and a couple more crab claws. Roll me out the door. It's pricey but worth it. I convinced a woman outside to go in and try it out basically by using one word sentences and with the fat/happy expression on my face. Thoughts: I do not need the shrimp roll in the Taste of Maine, the crab and lobster are far superior.  Although delish, I did not need the chips. I do need to try to crab bisque.  Oh and they need to change the music. I felt like they were still playing weird european edm from someone's after party the night before.
