Went today with my sister and a friend. I LOVED it! Had the Seafood Malafemina and it was AMAZING! It was light and tasty, plentiful as well. The server was attentive but not overly so. The ambiance was wonderful, the whole experience was great! The appz we had were superb! The pulpo (octopus) was just perfect and so was the fig and Gorgonzola appetizer. The lava cake was everything I wanted and then some but then came the Tartufo and I just fell in love! I could marry it and Â have its babies, that's how good that Tartufo was! Can't wait to go back again! :)
