Meh... The ketchup is amazing?? Seemed like it was straight up Heinz.  These are not the local ingredients you are looking for... Especially at these prices. It seems like it would be a nice place, but honestly I wasn't feeling it.  For LA prices, I expect a certain level of food quality, and frankly it just wasn't there for what I ordered.  One of my drinks was from a 'can'?  This place either needs to go gastropub and drop the prices or step their game up and deliver higher quality with real local homemade ingredients.  The staff were nice, so I bumped it an extra star for that.
