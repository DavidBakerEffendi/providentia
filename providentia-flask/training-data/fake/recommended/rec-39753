I believe I have written a review about Room Service in the past, but this place is soo good that it deserves 2 great reviews!  Went here with a friend and shared a couple dishes (soup, green curry, spicy basil noodles)  All were superb and I believe this place has the best green curry in town!  I usually don't get dessert at Thai restaurants but we tried the pumpkin flan.  Delish!!  This has become my new thai staple.  Love it!
