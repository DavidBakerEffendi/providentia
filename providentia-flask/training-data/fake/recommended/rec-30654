Love the atmosphere - warm cozy. Friendly inviting staff. Would be a great place for drinks/ light apps. But we were disappointed with our meals ( actually even the apps were not very good ( we didn't order the cauliflower which people rave about) We had the meatballs (ugh), eggplant ( just ok) and the artichoke ( tough but ok). The fish stew ( which 3 of us order was very impressive at presentation. It is covered in an herbed baked topping ( similar to a pot pie) however underneath was only one prawn, 2 rings of calamari, 2 tentacles , 4 clams , 6 muscles all in a tomato broth that wasn't that great. The other entree was a special ravioli which I was told was "good". The gelato for dessert was also not great. The garden in the back is extremely charming but not enough to make up for the food! Maybe we just choose all the wrong items! I really wanted to like this place but the food ( even at the most basic -the tomato sauce on the meatball was just terrible)
