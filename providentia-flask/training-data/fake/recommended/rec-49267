I was skeptical. Because I am from New Orleans I rarely eat at a restaurant that claims to serve food from our region. But I did not leave when I saw po boys and catfish on the menu. Instead I ordered the ribs, greens and red beans. The corn bread came out first and I said "oh my" if this is an indication of what is to come I may leave happy. The cornbread was hot and melt in your mouth. And it was a harbinger of more good food. The ribs were well seasoned an could be cut with a fork. The greens were maybe the best I have had (and I order greens frequently). They weren't mushy and had a great texture. Same for the red beans, they had a little crunch to them. Service was pleasant and efficient. Even the background music was so nice I pulled out my IPhone to identify the artist and put the cd on my Amazon wish list. Â And did I mention that everything is reasonably priced. I left happy and I will return.
