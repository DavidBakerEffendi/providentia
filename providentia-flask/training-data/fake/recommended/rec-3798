Solid pizza. Not the best I've had, not the 2nd best I've had. Maybe in the top 10. Maybe. I'd say it wasn't worth the wait. Came here with my girlfriend on a Thursday night and waited about an hour outside with the smell of rotting garbage. When we finally got seated, they packed us into a table with some folks, not a horrible thing I guess. We got the white pizza and it was good. Not great, just good. Worth it to check out the hype? Maybe. I probably won't come back. It did give me a reason to walk the Brooklyn Bridge and check the Brooklyn Ice Cream company though.
