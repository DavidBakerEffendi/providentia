I make the worst decisions when I'm drunk. Coming to Pommes Frites is definitely not one of them. Somehow I always stumble into this place late at night and always leave feeling great. The fries here are addictive, that's for sure. They are crispy, warm, twice-fried potato wedges of goodness. I've tried a lot of their sauces but my absolute favorite sauce is the Mango Chutney sauce. If you're not sure which sauce you want, feel free to sample them! You'll never know until you ask.
