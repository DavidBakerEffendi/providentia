I go here every once and awhile..last cpl times the food was good but this time really grossed me out...I called ahead to pick up and when I arrived I noticed Â at the corner of my eyes was 2 roaches walking around near the cash register ..I'm guessing the guy seen it and pushed it aside hoping I didn't see it. And then when I got my food and tasted it , it was so bland , over cooked chicken and watery sauce... I got the vodka rigatoni with chicken ... This will be my last visit ...
