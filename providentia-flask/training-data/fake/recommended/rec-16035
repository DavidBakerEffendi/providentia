GREAT, authentic, tapas. Was a little skeptical at first, before I got there, because from the pictures, it looks tiny. I'm not great with small restaurant spaces where there is not enough room to enjoy yourself... But beyond the crowded bar, there are some tables, and I believe, even a larger room in back. Phew! We had to wait a little longer than we thought we would on a Tuesday night, but it was fine since my friend and I had a lot to catch up on, and it was better because then we could spend more time eating our food then talking later on! When we finally sat, 30 min or so later, we ordered some dishes immediately because we were both starving: fried chickpeas, spinach and manchego croquettes (a special), and one of the larger plate specials, bass with mussels and fingerling potaotes, and the potatoes with aioli... All were awesome, especially those little croquettes. I wish there were more on the plate! The chickpeas were a great starter, spicy and crunchy and yum. The bass was tender and flaky, and the broth was tasty with the mussels alongside. The potatoes were, um let me think of a good word, DELICIOUS. I couldn't stop eating them. Then we decided to order more, because we were still hungry and we wanted to try more off the menu, so we ordered the fava bean spread and a mixed salad. The salad was just ok, but the spread was fantastic. It was like hummus, but made with fava beans instead of chickpeas. Totally delicious, one of my fav parts of the meal. This is a great place to meet a friend after work for a drink and a bite, although its a little off the beaten path on 10th avenue....I can't wait to try the other restaurants that the chef has (El Quino Pino and Txikito)!
