this review has been a long time comin'. Xe May is hands down my favorite banh mi in manhattan, or at least that I've tried. It's better quality than places in chinatown, and cheaper than Num Pang (plus bigger sandwiches). I've tried almost everything on the menu and it's all super fresh, delicious, and made-to-order. Their $8 sandwich+drink+snack weekday lunch special is KILLER and their stamp cards are da' bomb (I've gone through at least three, hehe). My personal favorite is the Lam'bretta, unique and so freaking good...try it!
