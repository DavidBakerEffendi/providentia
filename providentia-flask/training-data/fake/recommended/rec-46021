Fantastic food and warm, friendly service.  We came by last night for dessert, but we ended up having their delicious margarita pizza with zucchini and zucchini blossoms.  It was a wood-fired pizza, perfectly seasoned with a crisp but still chewy crust.  We devoured it. We also had two flavors of their tartufo - pistachio enrobed in dark chocolate and raspberry sorbet in white chocolate.  Both were amazing and well-executed.   Rob the host and Arnold the server went out of their way to welcome us and make sure we had a wonderful time.  They really made our night! I understand Campania opened only a year ago.  It is a gem, and we are so glad we came last night.  Highly recommend.
