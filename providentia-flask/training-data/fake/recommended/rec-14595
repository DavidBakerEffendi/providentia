I grew up in southern New Mexico and have eaten at my fair share of K-mart parking lot taco trucks, so I do know what a good taco tastes like. The tacos here were OK, but the tortillas were extremely greasy. You'd barely pick up the taco and your fingers would be covered in oil. I also wish they had al pastor tacos. On Saturday night the ambiance was crowded, noisy bar - which is par for the area, but I wouldn't put the noise level at "Average" which Yelp has. It's more of a hipster joint rather than an old school Mexican mom and pop restaurant. I guess I was kind of hoping for the latter from some of the reviews here. It's the kind of place where there's a faux-vintage video loop of a bunch of bearded hipsters in a noodle eating competition. The only thing I really have to complain about is the attitude of some of the too cool for school waitstaff. I asked this one waitress if we could get some water, and she just apathetically stared at me while mumbling something. Is this a Misshapes gig or a taco restaurant? Of course the water never came. It seemed like the one guy bussing plates and cutlery from the kitchen was the only one interested in doing anything.
