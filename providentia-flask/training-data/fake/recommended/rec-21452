What's all the hype about? The music is good if you enjoy dancing to top 40s; the layout for the club section is narrow and cramped. And the bartender appeared to hate her life. I had a great time though, cheers to that! I'll have to check out the diner part of it sometime, but it's cramped there as well and there are like 23198 people for one ladies room.
