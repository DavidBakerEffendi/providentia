Some friends introduced me to Joe's a few years ago and I fell in love.  Now its a must visit on a NYC trip, despite the long waits.  The soup dumplings are to die for - steamed fish, sauteed veges, pan-fried noodles were all great too.  Don't be surprised if you end up sharing a table with strangers or if you're bumped up against the guy at the next table.  I found the service pleasant, but definitely not super friendly.
