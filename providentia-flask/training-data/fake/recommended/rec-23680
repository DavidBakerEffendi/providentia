There's something different about you, Nan Zhou.  I'm not just talking about the change in scenery. I'm talking about the quiet.  The lack of bustle.  The missing pickled mustard greens in my broth.   Don't get me wrong, Nan Zhou, you're still delicious.  Your beef tendon is chewy, gelatinous, salty goodness. Your noodles are soft, chewy, and flavorful.  The broth. Oh, the broth, full of beefy goodness and topped with fistfuls of cilantro and greens. But, Nan Zhou, where is the rhythmic heartbeat that is La Mian in the making?  Tons of dough pounded into its stringy submission?  Still your La Mian is delicious, but the atmosphere is missing.  Where is the tang and balance of flavors in your broth? Though different from when I first knew you, you're still wonderful. I guess I'll have to adjust.
