I went to Perilla with one other friend without any reservation. We only waited approx. 15 minutes on a Friday night. We each had a glass of red wine. One thing that stood out was that the waiter brought both bottles of wine to our table and made sure we liked it. The waitstaff from beginning to end was very attentive and satisfying. For appetizers we had the spicy duck meatballs and the Baby Lola Salad. They were both very tasty. The meatballs had an interesting taste (first time I've ever eaten duck meatballs) and i enjoyed it with the quail egg. The salad was pretty good and i enjoyed the manchego cheese even though I'm not a cheese lover nor a salad lover. For entrees we shared the rib-eye for two (special of the day) which was surprisingly very good. I usually don't expect much from a steak because I've been disappointed too many times. We ordered the rib-eye medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. Some people might not enjoy the steak because there was alot of fat around the steak but it made the steak have so much flavor (just cut the fat off!). The rib-eye for two also came with 2 sides. We ordered the risotto which was forgettable and the potato croquettes which were amazing! Worst part of the meal was the dessert. We ordered the chocolate souffle and it was partially dry and wasn't anything special. I would definitely come back again! I wanted to try the rabbit but my friend gave me disgusted looks when i mentioned it =\
