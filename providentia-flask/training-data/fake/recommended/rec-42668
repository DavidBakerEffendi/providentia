I feel as though this place just came from out of nowhere and blew me away. Situated on Prospect Ave, driving by you can't miss the huge plasma TVs peeking through the windows. The interior is really neat and clean. I feel as though every square inch is covered by a TV screen, which is what a sports bar should be. To add to the beauty, the menu has a wide selection and the food is great. Everything you could ask for is on tap and the staff is exceptionally friendly. Definitely the spot to catch up with friends or watch a game. This place is slowly becoming my man- cave:)
