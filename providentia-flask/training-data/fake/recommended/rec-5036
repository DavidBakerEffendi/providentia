Love the products and I love the store. The wines are divine and they've got it figured out. HOWEVER -- the servers serving the gelato just passed the Broadway entrance of the store always seem to be having a bad day. Can this be addressed? Each and every time, they're pissed off, they don't make eye contact, and they treat everyone as if they were robots. That's my only gripe :) Eddie
