It is nice having a place like Monk's in Fairmount. The beer, mussels, burgers, and frites are great as expected from the same proprietors. When it's warm, you can sit outside (max 4 people). I think it falls short of the original, but for the neighborhood, it's the best place to go for a belgian draft.
