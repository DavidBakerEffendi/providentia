I had the spicy pork bibimbap for $7. Pretty sure I want to try everything on Jung's menu. Servings were huge and most importantly, delicious! I'm glad that there's something besides Midori, Yamadora, or Seoul BBQ that I can add to my list of go-to Korean eats when I feel the itch and don't want to cook it myself!
