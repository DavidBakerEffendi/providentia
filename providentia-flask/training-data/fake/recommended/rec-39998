Randomly stopped in here for a few drinks and a quick meal with my boyfriend while we were staying in town for the night. The service was incredible, and staff was extremely attentive and friendly. Jen, our server was super sweet and made us feel right at home. Even the gentlemen behind the bar went out of their way to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. We will most definitely be stopping by again on any future trips into the area. Thank you guys for providing us with such a great evening!
