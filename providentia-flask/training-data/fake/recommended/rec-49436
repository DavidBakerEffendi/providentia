I am going to ignore the crazy long waiting line and impatient waiters in the rating because the pancakes here were SO good, and those are what I had come here for. I had ricotta pancakes with fresh fruit, honeycomb butter and maple syrup on top -- oh my word. This is definitely on my list of favorite brunch spots.
