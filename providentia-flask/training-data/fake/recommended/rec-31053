Came here with the family. All in all, I thought the food was pretty good but the prices were a bit high. Excellent appetizers, we ordered: -Finocchiona -Prosciutto -La Tur Most of the table ordered pizzas and pastas. The husband ordered the Polpette Diavolo; aka pizza with meatball, pistachio, and hot pepper. I ate a slice and thought the crust were pretty good. A little on the burned side but I guess it was suppose to be that way since all the pizza's came out that way. The rest of the pizza kind of just flopped over.. wasn't crispy. I ordered the Garganelli, aka homemade pasta with rock shrimp, spicy sausage, and basil. I can't imagined the "to share" portion since the individual portion was small. I wasn't that hungry so I'm glad it was just the right size. I would say it's about a little less then a cup size. The pasta was very flavorful but  I wish there was more of it and not for $14. The service was decent. Although, we were waiting for Grandpa's pizza to come out and it took them three times to get it right. He had ordered the broccoli pizza. The first, they made the pizza with no cheese. The second, dropped on the floor, I am thankful they didn't serve it to him. They were very accommodating, had updated us what had happened to the food and took it off the bill.   All in all, if we are in town we would visit again but this time I will stick to the pizza's to get my money's worth.
