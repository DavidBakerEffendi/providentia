Very yummy dinner!! Was it the best Italian I've ever had? No. But it was very good with yummy bread to start. The portions are huge and meant to be shared by several. The atmosphere is super fun, and the prices are great, especially for what you get. Wait staff was super friendly and helpful. Crazy busy, so if you know you're going, get reservations. We had to sit at the bar after a long wait. But worth it!! Would definitely come back again!
