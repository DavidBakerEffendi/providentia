I was a visitor on 9/12 looking for some good Philly Cheese Steaks, and came to here hoping for the best. The food overall was good (4/5 stars), but I'm giving 1 star because of the cashier whose rudeness and insensitivity towards me, my girlfriend, AND her coworkers, has ruined my experience. To give you a better idea, look at Joe C's review and Jason P's first picture - you will see the picture of the cashier I am talking about. Without naming the cashier, I will proceed to tell you what happened - she was very impatient and became irritated when I said I wanted the same order my girlfriend ordered. Upon realizing that she noticed I was upset with her unacceptable attitude, she then tries to rescue herself by saying my name was unique and cool. But no, that did not work unfortunately... it only led me to feel insulted. Afterwards, she ranged me up and threw the receipt in my direction expecting me to catch it, but fell to the ground. She said something along the lines "Looks like we're not working okay today, haha". She did not apologize. While I normally brush off experiences like this, what especially disturbed me was the damaged morale of her employees. I noticed she would give them a hard time. Again, Look at Joe C's review and Jason P's first picture to see the cashier I'm talking about. Please brace yourself for the incredible rudeness if you do encounter the same person. Good luck. **Management, please do not hesitate to contact me for more information regarding this transaction and incident, I'll be happy to provide more info. I will adjust my review accordingly. Thank you.
