I wanted to try this but I read it opened at 7pm. As we were walking along the streets of NY, we see Halal Guys and went into line. Even though we've been Eating since the Morning, we Didn't want to pass the opportunity. Â The Wait was about Ten minutes. The guys are Super Nice and the food was stacked. We got the combo and only $6. We had to try it when it was hot, So Yummy. It even taste good the next day without heating up (stayed in hotel). I wish They have one in Boston, we do, but doesn't compare.
