E Mei Goodness! Came to Philly for the Cheesesteaks, but this was amazing Szechuan! As a person of German and Mexican ancestry, I don't look like I would be able to appreciate good Szechuan, let alone handle a pair of chopsticks. But coming from Los Angeles, where we have incredible Mexican food, I can appreciate delicious food with a little kick to it. There were only 3 of us, and we didn't think we were that hungry, but the dishes just seemed so delicious right off the menu: Hot and Sour Soup, Jumbo Shrimp in garlic sauce, Chow Fun, Broccoli Beef, and Griddle Cooked Chicken. What an explosion of flavor! And just enough of a kick without being overpowering. Service was excellent as well. We decided on this place using Yelp, so we thought we'd return the favor.
