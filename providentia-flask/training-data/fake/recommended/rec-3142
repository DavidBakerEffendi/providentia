Today I checked off this nice little spot in Queens, Salt & Fat. The place scores points for decor and atmosphere, but I have to admit, I was not blown away by the food here. The menu had a good range of options (at least 20 if I remember correctly)and the prices were decent. I purchased 3 of the restaurant's offerings during my visit. I had the Korean BBQ wraps, Oxtail Terrine and the Fried Chicken. I'm not going to hang this place out to dry and I'm sure some of the other offerings I did not have are good, but I did not leave the place saying to myself "Can't wait to go back". As the old saying goes, first impressions are lasting ones. The food Korean BBQ Wraps: The wraps were ok. It came with a piece of steak,a little spicy and sweet sauce, crispy shavings wrapped in Boston lettuce. Truly nothing to die for but not bad either. Oxtail Terrine: The first time I ate Oxtail in the shape of a cube! This dish actually was the best amongst what I had. Most flavor, unique presentation and a decent portion of tender Oxtail with two nice sauces to compliment it. At first I thought I was given a piece of chocolate cake by accident. Fried Chicken: Some fellow Yelpers touted this spot as having the best Fried Chicken. I gladly wanted to see if it was Indeed the case. Frankly, I left wanting more. The overall flavor just wasn't mind-blowing. However, the breast portion of the chicken was extremely tender. It was impressive being that the dish was fried. Overall: Inexpensive, nice ambience, but more hype than great to die for food. Well, I'm glad I got this one in the stat book. I look forward to my next adventure on the town!
