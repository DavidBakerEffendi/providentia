I can't say enough about this place! My in-laws were in town and wanted to try something different. Sometimes this can be a challenge, because as a vegetarian, I prefer having something more than just a salad. I called ahead and just so happened to speak with the owner. I asked if they had any vegetarian options; he informed me that they had a grilled vegetable sandwich, but would be willing to make me anything! I responded that I was happy with whatever and that we would be there in about a half an hour. We walked in (and I just assumed that this conversation would be forgotten) sat down and ordered drinks - AMAZING drinks by the way. I asked the server if there were any other options for a vegetarian. She let me know that the owner was expecting us and he had created a vegetable pasta primavera in a garlic sauce if I'd like. She said that as a vegetarian herself, it was amazing! I couldn't believe the service!! Not only did I order this, but after our entrees arrived and we were able to enjoy some, the owner himself came out to be sure that I was enjoying it! It was soooo so good! I have never felt more taken care of! I recommend this establishment to anyone! The ambiance is impeccable and the service phenomenal!! Thank you!!
