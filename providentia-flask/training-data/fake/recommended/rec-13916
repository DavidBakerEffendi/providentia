Went back again for lunch. Had the grilled cheese with swiss, fontina, and white american on sourdough with fries ($8.50). The combination of cheeses was alright, but it was not completely melted throughout the entire sandwich. Was looking forward to the fries since I had heard they were really good. They were alright. It was an average sandwich with average fries. Even during weekday lunch, it's crowded and noisy here.
