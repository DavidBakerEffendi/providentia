From a great selection of seafood to an eclectic mix of Southern and other Americana food, Blue Ribbon is one of the very best restaurants in Brooklyn. Their raw bar is compares favorably to top raw bars in Manhattan. They always have at least 4 different oysters and also have sea urchins, Louisiana shrimp and scallops. All extremely fresh and market priced. Then, for the meat lovers, you can't go wrong with their Hanger Steak. Truly one of the tastiest steaks around and if you love mushrooms, you'll love the mushrooms on this steak 9ask for extra, they will be happy to give these to you). You can dine very expensively or very inexpensively at Blue Ribbon. They have a diverse menu that meets most budgets. If you love Wine, they have a wonderful wine menu and stayed the course offering wine lovers premium choices from Spain, France and the USA. I have been a Blue Ribbom customer for a very long time and highly recommend this restaurant to anyone living in or visiting Park Slope.
