This is by far my favorite Mexican place in the city, and I LOVE Mexican food. I've taken most of my friends who come from out of town to this place, and they've all loved it. I've tried most of their margaritas - though the pineapple one is my favorite. The macho nachos and original guac are both winners. Seriously, I'd skip getting entrees and just split some nachos and guac. Not that their entrees are bad. Just that their entrees don't hold a candle to their nachos and guac.
