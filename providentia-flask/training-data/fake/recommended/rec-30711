Chimay, a variety of cheeses and meats and great paninis - on a beautiful sunny day (they have a patio) = heaven. Now I'm not a Brooklyn girl, although I admit I am willing to cross the bridge for DiFara, Peter Lugars, Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory, Grimaldi's and Harvest (which is now gone, how sad). Â Marlow and Sons may soon join this long list!
