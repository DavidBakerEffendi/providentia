A group of 10 went there to celebrate birthdays.  Fascino did a fabulous job accommodating us. Terrific service and good food. We all had the taste menu. Tjere were a number of  good choices for each of the courses. My choices were Tuna tartare for 1st course. Terrific. Sort of like spicy tuna.  2nd course antipasta crab cakes were very good. 3rd course marsala glazed duck was excellent. I tried my wife's short ribs and it was also excellent. Can't go wrong with these 2. A dessert sampler consisted of 3 desserts. Excellent. Very enjoyable meal.
