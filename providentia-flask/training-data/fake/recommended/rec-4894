Wonderful, authentic upscale Mexican!! the service and ambiance is great, the drinks are very reasonably priced, and the food is wonderful! This is truly a gem! You can find many authentic taqueria's in Philly (la lupe, veracruzano), and there are also a number of very nice upscale locations (Lolita, Tequilas, Xochitl), but this is the ONLY upscale AUTHENTIC Mexican. Las Bugambilias is wonderful. It is hard to find a favorite dish. There are multiple grouper dishes that are wonderful, the chicken is great, as is the mole and plantains. You will not be disappointed.
