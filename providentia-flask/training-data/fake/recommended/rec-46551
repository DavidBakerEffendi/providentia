Forge gets an A+ for atmosphere.  It's a great space that is well-designed.  If you are there with good friends and order some good wine, you are sure to have a delightful time. Forge gets a C+ for food.  For the prices, it was, sadly, nothing to write home about.  My "halibut en croute" should have been called "hunk of bland whitefish".  The foie-gras came with five different kinds of salt-why would I want to put volcanic salt on something that is already so rich, three of us had trouble finishing it?  The best thing we had all night was the pumpkin creme brulee-a great mix of innovation and taste. Overall, I'd give it a B+.  Great location, great space, good (not great) food, a little too pricey.
