I stopped in the Khyber Pass Pub to grab dinner and a beer while watching the Phillies game. The bar staff was nice, though not always the most attentive. The atmosphere was laid back; good for having a chat. Beer selection is varied (~$5 pint) and the BBQ was good (~$10 for pulled pork sandwich & a side). I would go back again!
