My friends know that when I die  I will go straight to an Italian Heaven, where "we" (my fellow diseased Italian food lovers) will enjoy rustic cucina Italiana...and never gain weight...well who cares.....we will be dead!  OK, so back to Osteria....I was extremely impressed by the wait staff's delivery of the "today's menu" (at least a 10 minute rant of deliciousness and an elaborated description of each plate....with finesse and confidence) Every dish here is artfully crafted...all their pastas are homemade, and it seems as if the Chef is saying a story ...each ingredient plays a protagonist part, in which each of them have a precise moment to act and shine....from the garlic to the basil....every ingredient used screams at you with taste and aroma...I have never had such a sensory-stimulating-culinary experience...visually/beautiful, scent is redolent and unforgettable, taste is fresh....a treat to your palette. Crème Brule here is flawless, torched to perfection (sugar never bitter), and the crème, well it's airy, whipped and almost angelic.  In conclusion, this sounds like my hypothetical Italian Heaven. Please visit Osteria and allow yourself to be surprised.
