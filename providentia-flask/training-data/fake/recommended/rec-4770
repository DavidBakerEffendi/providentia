Ah the smell of stale beer soaked wood floors... I thought I left you in my college house?!   This place looks exactly the same as it did when it was Dark Horse.  It is like a maze, with uneven floors and random steps.  I believe I counted 6 rooms upstairs.  I could see this place being a nightmare to navigate on a crowded weekend night, and I imagine you could lose your friends quickly. On the bright side, they have a decent selection of draft beers and our bartender was great.  I only sampled a few bar apps, but the food seems about on par with the Dark Horse cuisine as well.  It is nothing special and typical bar fare. I wouldn't really recommend going here for anything other than beer, if you can get over the smell and dated decor, it could be a nice pre-game spot.  When it was Dark Horse, it attracted a huge soccer crowd, I imagine that is still the case.
