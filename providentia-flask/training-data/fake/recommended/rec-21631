Just what I thought was thought was not needed in the South St. area is Â yet another Middle Eastern restaurant. But the S&H Kebab House proved me worng! It specialises in mostly Turkish cuisine, which does set it apart from the others. Plus their lunch special can't be beat for the price....a very large kebab platter and full appetizer for $8. I ordered the baba appetizer and shrimp kebab which was great. And they have sour cherry nectar, my favorite turkish treat.
