I Love El Vez...they deliver...it's like $6.00 delivery charge but so worth it!! The Mahi Mahi fish tacos are the best with so much flavor and the perfect amount of heat and pickled red radishes ..like heaven in a soft taco shell! There two sides that I love the most aside from the beefy Macho Nachos...they are the grilled corn on the cob which just really makes me happy and the Creamy Poblano rice with corn! Literally....just creamy cheese over white rice with corn...but it's like a Mexican comfort food! The Churro's were perfect..we got about 4 or 5 with a cup of warm chocolate..what a great way to end the meal! Oh...and the Margaritas are a plus!!
