I would highly recommend Mausam (in Montclair) if you like delicious Indian food. Their menu has a vast selection to accommodate any diet (vegan/vegetarian as well). I highly recommend the veg biryani. It comes with yogurt on the side and it adds a different delicious taste to the dish. The Veg biryani is considered spicy without the yogurt. The mushroom saag is also very delicious. Â At first I thought I wouldn't be able to taste the mushrooms, but I was wrong. The mushroom in this dish remained its own natural fresh taste. The spices did not take away from the mushroom. The malai kofta, there were a decent amount of dumplings in one order. The sauce is absolutely delicious. The service was good. The prices for each dish were average and reasonable. The ambience was relaxing.
