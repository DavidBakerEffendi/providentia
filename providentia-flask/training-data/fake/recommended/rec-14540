New to the neighborhood, I was excited to check this place out after reading all the good reviews so I stopped on my way home for a pizza.   I got the Bufala... 12''.  Walked home (I live a block away).  Looked good... but was soggy.  I know steam builds up and yeah, but this was a little much.  It hadn't been five minutes.  The edges of the pie were crispy but that's it. The crust was so so, the cheese good, sauce... so so.  I wasn't really impressed.  It was okay overall.  But when you factor in $17... plus tip, lets say $1... it's take out after all... and you're almost at $20 for a personal pizza.  I don't think so. Will I be back?  Maybe one more time, eat in.  I have a hard time believing that many people don't know what they're talking about.  hrm. But really... there are too many good to great pizza places within a six block radius. BTW I'm from Naples.  =)
