Consistently delicious and always friendly. Have only tried about half the menu because I keep going back to the Pickle Me. My favorite so far. It gets pricy if you are famished and order a lot including a beverage, but good value due to quality and freshness of products. A small little joint to pop in and share a table, okay to show up with a mate, but don't show up with a gang, it's not that kind of a place. They do cater.
