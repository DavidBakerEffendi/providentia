A bit pricy, I'll admit but definitely an experience you have to have at least once.  They say everything taste better deep fried, and boy does this place prove that to be true.  I came here to see for myself the concept of a burger that was deep fried and had the meat within the bun.  I was not disappointed, the burger was cooked to a perfect medium rare, which by itself is an amazing accomplishment, but the bun also managed to not be soggy.  I also loved their unique beet ketchup, and was much nicer than traditional ketchup.  The service was also very nice, the waiter filled our cups regularly with water and made sure we were happy, which we were.  Definitely try this for yourself, this is one bandwagon you want to hop on.
