This is the same review as what I gave for Geno's. We stopped by and got one from each Pat's and Geno's. Long story short: If you gave me sliced beef, cheese, and some long bread, I can make a cheesesteak as good as Pat's. I'm not kidding at all. There are some basic, simple foods that various restaurants have proclaimed to have the "best" or "original" and, whenever I have tried, I have responded with a big "meh". The reality is the gap between "good" and "world's best" for relatively simple foods like burgers, cheesesteaks, ramen, grilled cheese sandwich, mac and cheese, etc. is just not that huge. Sure, someone can use USDA prime aged ribeye for the sliced meat in their cheesesteak and it would be better, but why would you slice $15-20/lb prime aged ribeye to use in a cheesesteak? Why wouldn't you eat it as a ribeye steak? Likewise, you can use prime aged ribeye ground up for a burger, but what kind of nutbag would you be to do that? As another reviewer noted, the generic cheesesteak chain you see in the food courts offer cheesesteak that's as good as Pat's, and maybe better in many cases. Don't buy the hype.
