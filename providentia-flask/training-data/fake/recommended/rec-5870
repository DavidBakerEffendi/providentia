Simply put:  I don't particularly crave fried chicken or biscuits but somehow this place has completely rewired my natural inclinations. Easily the best biscuits I've had.  The pie?  Don't be a fool and walk out without having some. And a special note to the servers... you guys are amazing!  Small place with lots of people smashed in there but you all remain very friendly and accommodating.  Thanks for consistently great service!
