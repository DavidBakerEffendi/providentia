So it was a snowy night and I went to a Korean fried chicken place around the corner and was looking for kimchi to go with my chicken they didn't have any but the nice cashier referred me to this place and said they have a yummy Kimchi stew with pork. So I walked over and got it and it was sooo yummy. They have a wide array of Pre packaged foods that I want to try next time. Will come back!
