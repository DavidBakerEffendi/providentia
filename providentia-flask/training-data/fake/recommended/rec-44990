the food was amazing! the host, despite the restaurant being very busy, took excellent care in seating us as promptly as possible. i ate the lamb t bones and they were incredible. the gravy was so light and delicious and the whole thing was served over a little salad and gnocchi. the lamb was perfectly cooked, medium rare just like i asked. the people at my table also got the pork and chicken dishes and they loved them as well. we shared the meatball slider appetizer and that too was fantastic. busy little restaurant that i'd love to eat at again!
