Is this place better than any cheesesteak place outside the city?  Sure.  Is it worth all the hype?  NOPE.  I am a NE Philly native and there's a reason Pat's and Geno's were both rated in the bottom 5 in the 2009 610 WIP Best Cheesesteaks in Philly contest. I'm big on American over Wiz and I can't stand when places just put a slice of cheese on top to melt after they put it on the bun.  Come on!  I know it sounds picky but these are the things you look for. If you're an out-of-towner, drive 10 minutes up 95 to Steve's Steaks.  Best in the city!
