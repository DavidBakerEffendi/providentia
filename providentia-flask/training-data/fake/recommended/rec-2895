I've been here a few times now, both with friends and for dates.  It definitely has a fun atmosphere, as evidenced by the bike in the middle of the bar and the photo booth. The food is delicious, but I wouldn't say that the portions are large by any stretch of the imagination.  I leave satisfied, but with room for more.  The drinks are strong and have the perfect balance every time.  Usually I get so drunk off of one or two that I forget that I'm still a little hungry. I've visited a few times, and plan on visiting again in the future.
