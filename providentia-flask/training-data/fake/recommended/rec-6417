My Mom and I enjoyed such a wonderful dinner at Pylos together! The food, service, and atmosphere was great. This restaurant is pretty expensive, but worth it. I highly recommend going here on a date, with friends, or family. Since this place is very small make sure to call ahead for a reservation! We had to wait an hour to be seated without one. We almost didn't wait, but I'm very happy we did. If you'd like a taste of authentic delicious greek food you should try Pylos!
