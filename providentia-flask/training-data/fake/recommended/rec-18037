Since moving to West Philly, I have been spoiled by the fine array of Ethiopian food in my neighborhood. Almaz is the sole outpost of this delicious cuisine in Center City, and they do it quite well. The service was efficient and attentive while remaining unobtrusive. The tiny space manages to be airy and intimate, as fresh as the delicious veggie platter. Almaz proves that all Ethopian food doesn't have to be simmered to the consistency of Gerber's. Each time I took a bite of a new dish, I thought "This is my favorite," until I got back to the first one and started the loop all over again.
