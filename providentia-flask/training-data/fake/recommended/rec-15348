Cheesesteaks, and that's about it.  Yeah, you can get fries and onion rings, and chicken steaks, and I think they do burgers.  But basically - it's just cheesesteak. The steak is thin-sliced on the spot (you get to watch the machine do the slicing while you wait in line, soaking in the greasy air), and is high-quality and very lean.  You've got your choice of whiz, american, or provalone, sauteed onions are free (and clearly required) and you gotta throw in the extra for the sweet peppers. Steaks are big, juicy, and damn tasty. It ain't especially clean or pretty, but when you want a cheesesteak, they serve it up right (though not necessarily efficiently).  There are also 2 tables outside if you catch them on a nice day. Oh, and there's pretty much always a line.
