I was hesitant to come to this place because it's so close to Times Square, so I expected it to be a tourist trap. However, after winning Book of Mormon tickets (yay!) my friend and I wanted to have brunch but were too lazy to go too far. They have a $14 brunch menu that includes coffee and a mimosa. The food was pretty average, the service was friendly, and the place was pretty cozy. They are literally next door to BoM and let you pre-order drinks for intermission
