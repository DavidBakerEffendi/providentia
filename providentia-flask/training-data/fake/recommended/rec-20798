My family and I came up from Virginia to visit good friends and, thankfully, they brought us here for brunch. Inside, the lay out is simple, spacious, clean and inviting; making for a perfect venue for breakfast, lunch, or a hot cup of coffee. Being from the south, several of the comfort inspired dishes were enticing. But my dad and I had to go for the Shrimp and Grits. The combination of a milky cream over shrimp, spiced chorizo, and jalape√±o infused cornbread was easily one of my favorite breakfasts... Ever. During our meal, a brilliant chef named Chris, who served in the Marine Corps., came out to greet us and hear what we thought. We were quick to ask him how he was able to put together such flavorful dishes and he was happy to share some of his secrets with us. Between the tastes, quality, aesthetic, environment and staff, I couldn't be happier with a humble hole in the wall.
