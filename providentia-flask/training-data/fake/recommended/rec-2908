Sketch is one of my favorite spots in Fishtown! I've been here with my partner 3 times and we've never been let down. The atmosphere is cool and low key, and the people are super friendly. The burgers are incredible!! I haven't explored most of the menu because i'm hooked on the burger. They are tasty and big. Most of the sauces are good too, and the bun is outstanding. My girlfriend gets the black bean burger, and loves it. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone interested in some local, non-pretensious eats. The chipotle and aioli sauces are our favorites.
