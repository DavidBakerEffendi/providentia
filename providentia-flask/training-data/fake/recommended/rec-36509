A solid French eatery & SoHo institution, no doubt. I pass this place all the time and it always seems constantly bustling on every day of the week.  I live right around the corner and had to give it a try.   We were able to simply walk in on a Monday evening without reservations.  They didn't have any tables available in the main dining room... the place was PACKED of course, and I'm sure everyone had made reservations much earlier.  But alas the hostess sat us at a small table in the cafe area, which was perfectly adequate. The waiter was quick to serve me an excellent glass of Bordeaux and dished out some tasty bread soon after.  I ordered the Steak Frites, which came out fresh & prompt.  The steak was tender, juicy, and cooked perfectly (between medium rare to medium, just as I ordered).  My side of fries were crisp & wonderful.  The accompanying Bernaise sauce was lovely, but then I asked for an additional slab of butter, which was delivered immediately.  I melted that creamy goodness right into my beef, and guiltlessly indulged in my sins. Overall, the meal was an absolute joy to nosh on.  The place is honestly a mad house- more bustling brasserie than intimate cafe.  Wouldn't bring a date here... but I'll certainly be back to spoil friends, family, & myself! Oh, and apparently this place has some hype- My dad: "Did you go out to eat this week?" Me: "Yeah, I went to Balthazar on Monday.  It was nice!" My dad: "BALTHAZAR?!  ...and I was afraid you weren't eating well enough"
