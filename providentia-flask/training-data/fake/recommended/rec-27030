Big Fan of Joe Allen after my 1st visit today with the family. Went there after a rare 11a show. Arrived a full 45 minutes early from my reservation time. Told the host and he said, well. lets see what we can do about that. 3 minutes later we Â were brought to our table. VERY accommodating indeed. Our server was prompt and lovely. Drink order was taken and delivered quick. This was lunch time so 4 of us had burgers which were perfect. Wife had a chicken salad which she enjoyed. We had the lentil soup and some hummus. All in all a perfect post theatre meal. I am sure we will be back. Don't hesitate to bring your family there!
