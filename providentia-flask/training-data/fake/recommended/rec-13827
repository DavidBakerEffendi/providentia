i think the place is overrated, we went there around 2pm on Monday and there were lines outside the door. it took them 30 minutes for a french toast and omelet, i don't really like the omelet though, it is kinda stiff and sort of tasteless. I prefer french toast to pancake. the butter maple syrup is ok, but not as good as i expected. the table was tiny but the ppl are really really nice, one of the plus.
