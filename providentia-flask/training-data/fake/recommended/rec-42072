What a bummer. This place really impressed me the first time around. I had the meatloaf and the boyfriend had the nashville hot chicken. They were both delicious, sides included. Granted, the boyfriend was red-faced by the end of the meal, but serves him right for wanting to show off and getting the hottest option. But it's been diminishing returns every trip since. The last will be our final one for a while. What a nightmare of a night. The service wasn't just slow, it was a nashville hot MESS. Our first server peaced out halfway through our meal, and the waitress that was left was almost in tears she was so overwhelmed. The kitchen didn't make it any better. The food was cold, bland, the bread was dry as a bone and tasted stale. We didn't even bother to complain the service was that slow we just wanted to leave. Shame. I'd love to go back. But which Peaches am I going to get? Will it be the one that won me over with that first fried-spicy-delicious bite? Or will it be a disappointing mess? Better question: do I want to waste my time and money finding out?
