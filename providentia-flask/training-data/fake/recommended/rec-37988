What a GREAT dinning experience. We started with the ceviche and the lobster tacos, both outstanding. The tacos could have been a bigger portion, left me wanting more. The sangria braised short ribs are spectacular and succulent. We also had the special Mezcal Chipolte infused ribs....wow!!!! The only thing that left me a little disappointed was the dessert menu, nothing really exciting. We decided to try the chocolate polenta, I think I'll skip this the next time. Otherwise two thumbs up!!
