I visit this restaurant by using yelp, it listed with 4 or 4.5 stars in most of the review. At some point, I have a little bit disappointed on certain dishes which I really expect a bit more. However this restaurant is nice and clean, out door sits are also available, very simply but nice looking restaurant. (at least I think it is). I just like the environment. Although the food is pricy and small, I will still give a 4 stars rating since the services from the waitress/waiter, they are extremely nice and professional. The octopus is really salty and that's why 1 star is gone from my review. Hope this help.
