Love this place. This is my go-to joint whenever I'm in town. Love their selection of sandwiches, burgers, drinks...u name it! Only complaint I have is that the quality of the food can be somewhat inconsistent, but really can't complain with their relatively inexpensive prices - especially in a lavish place like Princeton!
