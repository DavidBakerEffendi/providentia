This. Place. Is. AMAZING.  The service is absolutely wonderful and the food is possibly the best Italian I've had in the City. Recommended for any small birthday affair as well.   a.) if you sign up for their birthday list, you'll receive a free bottle of wine within the month of your birthday. b.) your entire party will receive complimentary double shots of their homemade limoncello - which is like none I've ever had.
