I love the $55 five course lunch deal at Bouley! Although there are other great lunch deals in the city, such as those at Jean-Georges and Boulud Sud, Bouley's tasting menu is definitely top notch. When you first walk into the restaurant, you'll enter a beautiful room with shelves that are lined with red and green apples. I love the decor! While I love everything on their menu, if I had to pick one, my favorite would be the Porcini Flan with Alaska Live Dungeness Crab and Black Truffle Dashi. I got it on my first visit to the restaurant and I have to admit that I thought it looked kind of strange because the flan was covered in black broth. However, once you take that first bite, you'll fall in love with it. I try to get something new every time I go back to Bouley, but this one is a must. The bread service is also outstanding. They serve bread that they actually make at the restaurant every morning and the butter that comes with the bread just melts in your mouth. There are a lot more servers than at most restaurants and all of them are very attentive. The sommelier is also knowledgeable. On my last trip to Bouley, he recommended a bottle of chardonnay that was exactly what we were looking for. I would definitely recommend Bouley to anyone looking to go to a restaurant that serves contemporary French cuisine.
