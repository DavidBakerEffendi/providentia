We were excited to try Lucky Lou's after the other Tavern that used to be there closed, however we were disappointed that it is the same crap service with a new name.  It took entirely too long to get our first beers, and on a Friday night, first beers are VERY important.  The menu is large, but the quality is pretty poor.  For a spot with a bunch of burgers on the menu the fries should have been better.  They were with out a doubt frozen.  The calamari appetizer was also frozen, and the fish was mush.  The flavors aren't bad, but the frozen and pre-prepped quality really shows in a bad light.  The main issue is the slow, slow service, I don't mind waiting for a great product, but we waited for a poor product.  We will not be going back, there are way to many good burger joints/bars in the area to waste our time here.  Disappoint.
