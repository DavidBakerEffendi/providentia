I came here for lunch one day with a friend. The decor was nice, but they played elevator music, which didn't match the theme of the restaurant at all.  I ordered the big box, which came with a fried dumpling, spring roll, fried banana, salad, rice, and entree (I ordered the red curry with tofu). Our lunches were served in metal cafeteria like trays. We also had a coupon for a free Thai iced tea.  The tea was sweet, as expected, but I didn't care much for it. I'm not sure if it was because it wasn't good or because I'm not much of a tea drinker. It was my first time having Thai tea. The salad was swimming in water. It looked like they had rinsed the veggies in the tray and just left them there. And it was warm, like it had been microwaved and then left out. Not crunchy at all. The spring roll, dumpling, and banana were very good, but you can't really mess up fried food. The red curry was the worst red curry I've ever had. Not authentic at all. It tasted like they had gone to a local supermarket and heated up a boxed meal you get in one of the aisles. It was just as watery as the salad, didn't taste like curry at all, and was way too salty. There were also big chunks of wilted lettuce in it. Disgusting.  While I really enjoyed the appetizers, I would not eat here again. There are too many other good options nearby.
