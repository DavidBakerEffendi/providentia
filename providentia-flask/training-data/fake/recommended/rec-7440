While Baoburg is a newcomer to the neighborhood, Chef Bao Bao is no stranger to N. 6th St. with experience at both Ramen Yebisu and Chai Thai next door. However, Baoburg brings her cooking skills to the next level in a very intimate venue. I decided to try out the new spot with a friend and we shared several different dishes (all affordably priced as well!). Definitely try the Seared Duck Breast Noodle with perfectly cooked duck and an amazing, rich broth. I would also recommend the Chicken Pate dish, which was not on the menu but definitely showcased an Asian fusion style with the spring roll-like serving. The side of Roasted Brussels Sprouts was also amazing, with a blend of potatoes and apple slices as well. Finally, the oysters and Roasted Octopus Legs rounded out the meal nicely. Just be aware that this location is cash only for now!
