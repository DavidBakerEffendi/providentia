This place is dynamite.  I wish I remembered the bartender's name, but he introduced me to wine after wine.  The world really needs more wine bars like this. You know you've found a solid wine joint when the wines by the glass are not just interesting, but they're fantastic.  So much for the boring, flat, simple stuff. Go here; you won't be disappointed.
