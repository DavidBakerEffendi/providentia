Best hummus I've ever had in my life. The salmon here is also absolute perfection. I lived on the upper east side last year and could not get enough of this place. Even now that I live in brooklyn, I still plan to keep beyoglu in my life. I will say that the service can sometimes be just "ok," but the food is so good I don't even notice the occasional mediocre waitress.
