Their extended happy hour makes me happy. Their food is not the best, and its usually quiet busy so you may have to wait a while for service and all of that. Their Korean food sounds good on the menu but its not the best, though they do have a large menu (not the happy hour one). It's very rare to find a place with a happy hour going on after 7 or 8pm. Sun-Wed this place runs till 10pm and Thurs-Sat 9pm. HH prices are also good.
