Traif means serious business. This place is one of my favorite I have been to. I have been to Traif five times with my boyfriend and I leave full and happy every time. The first time I came here we ordered different platters such as the frog legs, soft shell crab, muenster cheese dip, strawberry cinnamon glazed ribs, sliders and finally the bacon donuts. I was impressed with everything the first time especially the muenster cheese and the ribs. The next four times that we came I made sure to order the ribs and muenster cheese again. They are by far my favorite thing on the menu. I used to hate BBQ ribs but when I tried the strawberry cinnamon glazed ribs from Traif I could not get enough. I could eat two orders on my own. The service at Traif is great as well everytime we came, except for the last. We came with a group of 12 people about two weeks ago and they told us they can seat 8 people at one table and 4 people at another table, but they tried to get us to do the chefs tasting menu. We wanted to sit at the table of 4 with two of our friends and have a separate check because we wanted to order what we like. Â When we asked our waiter to do a separate check for the four of us instead of combined with the other 8 people that came with us. The waiter had a bit of an attitude because we wanted our own check. It did not make much sense for us to pay the tasting menu when there is only four of us. The waiter then went to the manager and told her what we wanted and she was not too pleased, In fact she said a rude remark loud enough behind us so that we could hear her. Other than that night, our service was always great. I was a little surprised about how the acted towards us, but that won't stop me from coming back to Traif and eating again. I most definitely recommend everyone try this place. The food is out of this world!!
