I am such a potato addict. I can't stop eating them. Doesn't matter if they are boiled, mashed, shredded, fried, pancaked? They are so yummy. French fries, forget about it. I will eat them till I am bloated and sick. This place has amazing fries, Â and the variety of sauces is awesome. So what if you will have grease flowing from your veins? It is so worth it at Pommes Frites.
