I've been to Sorella 4 or 5 times now, mostly for lunch, but once for cocktails/apps and once for dinner and have been really pleased overall. I love the "top of the menu" - the variety of appetizers and options for veggie-lovers is great, and yes - those Brussels sprouts are to die for! For the most part, the service has been friendly, knowledgeable and attentive, save for one delayed soda order, so I do think that some of the poorer experiences by people in that realm were probably due to the typical kinks you find with new restaurant openings. The atmosphere (and menu) strikes a balance between upscale and casual, but the "personality" of the place, while professional, has been on the slightly more casual side of that balance, which is fine with me. Everything we've tried so far has been great and well-prepared; the salads, while slightly over-dressed are delicious: Caesar with baby kale is something I find myself craving; the Quattro Colore salad is also great with the slight sweetness in the lemon vinaigrette and dried cherries and the burrata?? Yummmmmm. The soup and sandwich specials we've tried have been excellent, and the recent veal chop addition (pounded out but left on the bone, then breaded and pan fried and topped with a little arugula salad with red onion to balance out the richness) was awesome - fork tender and reminded me of my grandmother's veal cutlets. My husband is a mussel lover, but wasn't crazy about the oven roasted dish because it didn't yield the juice he so loves to sop up with his bread. Prices are pretty typical, I think, for another nice, but not super-high-end dining option in Hartford, and I'm thrilled to have it!
