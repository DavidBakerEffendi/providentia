Honeygrow was just what Philadelphia needed.  PLEASE open more center city locations.  The lines keep people (like me) from visiting more regularly.  The salads are wonderful, the options plentiful, the quality great and the staff friendly. Plus - the order system is awesome. Super easy. If you are a tofu fan, be sure to try theirs.  It is by far my favorite salad topping. More Honeygrow please!
