This place is a tourist trap.  I have to admit that I fell for it too after watching Adam Richman gorge himself on roast pork w/ broccoli rabe.  The food is good, but if you must go plan closer to 5 during the weekdays.  Any other time and you'll be waiting in line for 45 minutes taking photos and buying t-shirts with the other suckers.
