Arrived in NY around 9pm on a Tuesday, after dumping my stuff at the apartment, we strolled around looking for dinner. Opted to go to Momofuku Ssam Bar and were initially put off with only beer and sake as options for drinks (we wanted to relax over some wine). After the meal, we figured out that there is indeed a wine list that we weren't given, and with only 1 other table occupied (it was probably 1030/11pm at this point) it started things off on a bad note. We split the pork buns ($9) and a "large plate" of lamb prepared two ways, crispy belly and loin I think. The pork buns were tasty and a pretty good value at $9. While the lamb loin was good, the crispy belly tasted strangely reminiscent of lamb fish sticks. There was no starch or garnish on the $30 plate and as much as I hate to use the word, the serving was quite precious. Â Service was rather nonchalant and spent most of the time chatting near the kitchen or trying to look busy behind the bar. Even though we like a good time, we were deterred by the loud music when we arrived but it seemed to quite down a notch as we ate. Overall, I was really disappointed by our meal and it did not live up to the hype. The manfriend has been back for the super pork butt and oyster ssam and enjoyed it, but I'm still bitter about my experience.
