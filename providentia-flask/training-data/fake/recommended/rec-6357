A fair choice, but considering the caliber of comparable meals at nearby $$-$$$ Mediterranean restaurants, I'll likely go elsewhere next time.  We started with the octopus (very tender and flavorful), the merguez sausage (dry and relatively under-seasoned) and the combination platter (a terrible deal, considering it's $17 for what you get from a street cart anywhere in the city for $2.99).  For dinner, we split the chicken tagine, which was a highlight (we loved the fact that the couscous is cooked into the dish), but the portion of meat was miniscule, and the two way lamb, which was tasty but forgettable.  Overall, not an offensive meal by any means, but not a repeat either.
