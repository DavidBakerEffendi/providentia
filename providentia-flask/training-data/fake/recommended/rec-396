I want to give 4 but the service seems to be working through some kinks. Coat check is awkwardly right upon entering the place-- and yet, the woman and hostess both failed to ask for our coats until I took initiative. Mirrors in the main dining room were dirty (perhaps I'm too OCD). Random employee lurking around the bathrooms to make sure the stalls were clear (because a bunch of them didn't have a bucket to dispose towels) kinda weirded me out. Our waiter was such a bro and rather aloof/ hard to wave down. Order a ton of meze (2-3 per person) and you're bound to love something. I'd recommend the sardines and beef kebab. And the kibbeh bi laban is a must! Next time I'd pass on the baba ghannouj, sweetbreads, and thyme salad. Would rather come here for late night drinks/ snacks at the lounge area rather than a full-on dinner. If you want more elegant atmo-- sit in the main dining room, which is quieter and actually has table cloths! Otherwise, if you want to be "hip" sit in the other room with admittedly gorgeous wood paneling but loud club music.
