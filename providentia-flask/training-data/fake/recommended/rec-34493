The chicken banh mi was amazing. I went during lunch hour for takeout. The line was pretty long, and we had to wait a little bit for our food. It was worth it, though. They forgot to put jalapenos on my banh mi, but were quick to add them when I mentioned it. They were out of kale chips, which was a disappointment because I've heard good things about them. My friend got a chicken caesar salad, which looked so good because of the fresh, moist rotisserie chicken on top. The chicken in the banh mi was super tender too, and the crispy chicken skin added a perfect crunch. I loved the togarashi dressing. Definitely drench the sandwich in sriracha for the extra spice! Can't wait to go back and try the mac and cheese/kale chips/chicken caesar. And of course have the banh mi again! They really make amazing chicken here.
