I really like supporting black owned businesses, especially here in Harlem. I'd go back if they worked on the adjusting the prices or the serving sizes. $20 for brunch is okay if the plates are shareable or pretty large in size. They're not -- beware! You won't leave hungry but you won't leave happy either. Also, the service, while extremely friendly and warm, was a bit slow, if you're in a rush, better try another spot.
