The Ants Pants cafe was good for breakfast.  The coffee wasn't very good, but the orange juice was fresh squeezed and my ham, brie, tomato, avacado egg sandwich on toasted bread was excellent.  The bacon stack and plain old egg sandwich were also very good.  The Creme Brulee french toast was good french toast, but don't expect much in the way of "brulee".  All in all a very good place, do try!
