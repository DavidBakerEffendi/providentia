Outstanding. My go-to place for dinner when friends are in town. You can comfortably eat with wine for $60 a head (inc tax and tip). Salmon (w truffle potatoes) is my favorite entree, with Creme Brulee to finish off. Service is always very attentive and host polite given how busy it usually is for dinner.
