One of my favorite restaurants in the city so far.  Went for Meatball Mondays and had the spaghetti and meatballs, which were absolutely divine, down to each hand made thick noodle.  The meatballs were perfectly moist and well seasoned, the bread was delicious, and the warm buzz in the room didn't prevent us from hearing each other easily.  There is a downstairs area that looks like it can be booked for larger parties too - which I may do in the future.  Love this place.
