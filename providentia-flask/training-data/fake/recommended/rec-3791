i need to tell everyone in the world how amazing Palo Santo's mushroom and dumpling dish is... so rich and complex. the mushrooms might be the best i've had anywhere (Q: whoa, whoa, hold it there, have you been to Oregon? A: yes, yes i have, and I stand by my declaration). the dumplings are really riding on the back of the other elements, namely the greens and super herby pesto... everything comes together so mind-meltingly well... fantastic! my date had the pork mole. the sauce is a little spicy and sweeter than most mole's, but the pork was cooked perfectly and was quite tasty. the lovely inlaid tables and open kitchen make for a charming atmosphere. i'm always shocked at how empty this place is.
