The pig sandwich is awesome and very reasonably priced, I try to stop here at least once a week for my pork fix. Prior to trying Jake's pig, I felt that no pork sanwich in the city could live up to the GOAT of pork from the little shack on Synder Ave.  Well, I still feel that no pork sandwich is better but Jake's is pretty close, and its not always easy to go to the little shack on Snyder but Jakes is right on the corner of where I work.  Go get the pig on a Monday and experience reverse sticker shock, they have a monday special on the pig that makes me feel like I am robbing from them.
