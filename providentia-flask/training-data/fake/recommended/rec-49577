The only reason I can't give Robata-ya 5 stars is price -- $30 simply won't fill you up here.  But it's an impressive place.  When you walk in, the first thing you'll see is traditional bar seating, with chefs in the center.  80% of the customers seated there were speaking Japanese. As at most restaurants in Japan, you don't order an entree and then say goodbye to your server.  Instead, start with several small dishes, and then keep placing more rounds of orders until you're satisfied. The grilled fish in particular was very delicious, but you can't go wrong.
