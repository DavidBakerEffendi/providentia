Myth debunked: you DO NOT have to go into all the way into the city to find delicious Sushi! Come to this cute cafe for an amazing meal at a fantastic price. I ordered a Shrimp Tempura roll & a Cucumber roll as part of the Two-Roll Lunch Special. My boyfriend ordered the Chicken Teriyaki Bento lunch special. The waitress asked if we wanted our Miso Soups, which were complimentary with our lunch orders. (I love that she asked first, because I don't like soup & I always feel embarrassed to waste it!) Check out my pictures, because this lunch was a feast for the tummy AND the eyes! My boyfriend's Bento was overflowing with delicious food. He really enjoyed the chicken teriyaki & the dumplings. My two rolls were so fresh -- the shrimp tempura was still warm, & the texture was delicious next to the soft, fluffy sticky rice. My only complaint is that the rolls (especially the Cucumber roll) could've been a little bit tighter, because some of the filling fell out as I picked them up. The sauce on top of the tempura roll was to die for, & there was enough on the plate to use for dipping! My two rolls were beautifully presented, even at 1:30pm on a Wednesday afternoon! All in all, we spent just a hair over $20 for a great lunch. Even the decor was traditional, with tables and a sushi bar ... and they even had 90s alternative music playing softly in the background! It's like they knew I was coming :) The main menu looks promising, so I'll have to come back for dinner sometime. Thumbs up for this little sushi powerhouse!
