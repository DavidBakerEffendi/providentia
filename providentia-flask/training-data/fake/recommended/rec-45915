I had no idea I had such an amazing Japanese restaurant right in the town I grew up in. The food was delicious! Their menu is diverse but not overwhelming. To those who don't like sushi like my fianc√©, there are numerous alternative options to explore. The decor is a little strange with the artificial trees but everything else looks top notch. That being said you overlook trees for the food. The staff also accepted our yelp discount with no questions asked which was great! I definitely will be returning to taste test more from their menu.
