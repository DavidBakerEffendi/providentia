I'm sorry, did somebody just say @umamiburger is now in New York!? Yes, it's real & yes, it's happening. Right on 6th avenue, so you can't miss it. - not that I would miss it, being that I smelled the bacon frying from several blocks away - haha.  Anyway, back to important stuff - the burgers! Manly Burger or the Truffle? Either way - Both were #Fabulous! They're tiny, they're great, they're gooey, THEY ARE PERFECT - and they come in several different varieties of deliciousness which is even better. Grab some friends (the non-vegetarian ones) & share a fabulous burger, or two, or three, or you get the point. #yum #burger #UmamiBurger. Go here, eat food.
