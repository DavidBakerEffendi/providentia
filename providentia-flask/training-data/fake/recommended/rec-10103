Ended up at this pizza bar in the middle of a warm weekday afternoon after helping a friend set up her new apartment- needless to say we were starving and thirsty. This place had a great patio section on Stone Street and a comfortable indoor dining space. I felt the price was extremely high, especially considering the multitude of delicious pizza options in New York. The way it works is you pick a base combination of sauce and cheese (all 3 cost around $17) and then add toppings of your choice: basil costs $2, most veggies are $3, and meats are between $5 and $6 ON TOP OF the $17 base cost. I don't usually nitpick on price when it comes to food, but come on...create any usual combination of pizza toppings and you can easily arrive at a pie that costs $30+. That being said, the pizza was delicious and I liked the presentation and they have Peroni on draft which is a perfect compliment to the big squares of pizza. The pizza is different enough that I think I would go back, but it's definitely not the type of place that becomes your "go-to".
