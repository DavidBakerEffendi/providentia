Service at this restuarant was spot on, even on a busy New Year's evening. The staff was attentive, easy going and knowledgable. The food was interesting and delicious. The large majority does have pork of some kind in each dish. Lots of old favorites with tasty twists -- cheese curds (e.g., fried cheese with a pemento dipping sauce).
