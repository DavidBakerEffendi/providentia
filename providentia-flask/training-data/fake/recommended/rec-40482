Come hungry.  The food was excellent quality.  I had the Brisket Meal, which was perfectly cooked.  Sides were French Fries, which were cooked to order, and coleslaw.   The Brisket and fries were some of the best I have EVER tasted.  What lost 1 point for me was the coleslaw which had too much vinegar in it, and the fountain drinks... these were of a brand I have never heard!  Get Coke in! My wife had the Mac N Cheese which was to die for, with pulled pork. We talked with the company owner.  We complimented him on his friendly staff, and awesome food.  We will be back again soon. Well done guys.  Keep up the good work!
