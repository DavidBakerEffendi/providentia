Great burgers and cheap beer! I love it. I went here at a fairly good time, so the wait wasn't that long. Although, it seems people have a pretty good time while in line. They grab a beer at the bar and chat it up with friends over a pint while they wait...not bad. The day I went the ENTIRE place was being handled by one man. Well, there was a bartender and a couple of cooks, but he was handling all the table service. Granted he was huffing and puffing and running around like a chicken with his head cut off, but that is understandable. We ordered 2 beers and 2 burgers. The beers were delivered in less than 2 minutes and the burgers about 3 minutes after that!! What service??? I was very impressed. The food was good, fries were addicting, service was crazy fast. I'm a fan and I will be going back.
