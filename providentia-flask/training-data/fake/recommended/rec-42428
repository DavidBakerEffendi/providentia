I would give this place 5 stars just for the Fig Vinaigrette topping.  It is possilby the best thing I have ever had on a Pita and it goes with everything.  I should probably review the rest of the place too.  The concept is cool...they have menu items, but I always go for the "build it yourself" pita.  The veggies and the meats are always fresh, and the owners are really dedicated and very nice.
