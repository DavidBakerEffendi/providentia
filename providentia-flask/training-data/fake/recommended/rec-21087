5 years ago this was my go to Mexican spot...despite being on the pricy side. However it's gone down hill, delivery is $3 and it takes on average over an hour to get it delivered, there is a glitch on their website with online ordering, so I have to order to delivery.com or call it in. The portions are fairly large, but still expensive. The salsa used to be fantastic! I would order quarts of it for parties, no it too has gotten bland...the beans are loaded with salt now. Still a fun place to go and get some appys and drinks for happy hour though
