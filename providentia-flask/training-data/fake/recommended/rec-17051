I have to agree with the previous review...how can anyone give this place a poor review?? I've been here twice already and I love it! The atmosphere/structure is nice, dim lighting and dark glossed wood. Love the big fancy antique mirrors. Â The weekend crowd is pretty young though, mostly college students, although i did see a slightly more older crowd to between 30-40 as well. They play music by the bar, huge selection of beer! Mostly craft beers ranging anywhere from $5-$12. Best bar pizza I have ever had! I ordered the David Beckham which had Arugula, dried cherries, goat cheese, and pecans on top. There is also a patio area in the back, very cozy and elegant at the same time. Nicest & prettiest Pub I have ever been to.
