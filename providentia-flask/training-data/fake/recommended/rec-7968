Went to White Dog Cafe since it was one of my friends favorite places, and we were celebrating his life. I had a great time here, I enjoyed the unlimited mimosas with brunch. All of the staff was very courteous and attentive. Our waitress Joan was sweet, informative, and attentive. Seemed like she was an old friend! We had a party of 15 as well so I'm surprised we didn't drive her crazy. We sat in the back on the lower level in a cozy comfortable room. The one thing I didn't like was the citrusy taste to my White Dog Salad, but the Spicy Bolognese was excellent, so creamy! I would come back here again, but I'd have to admit I probably couldn't afford it Â if I was a college student. So not too many of them here, great ambience too, not noisy.
