I really tried to give this place a try this time around, but it was the second time on a Saturday night. It is horrible because the bartenders are horrible with how quick they are to respond to the customer. I tried to close out and the bartender completely ignored me for a whole 15 minutes. I am a strong believer in tips for bartenders because that is the base of their income for their shift, so I left her a tip. It will be a while until I return to this place. POSITIVE: their drinks are pretty good and strong.
