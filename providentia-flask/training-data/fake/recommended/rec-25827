This was some of the best ramen I've ever had! In fact, after getting home to the Bay Area, I visited my favorite ramen place and I found myself wishing I was back eating at Totto Ramen again! I had the Totto Spicy Ramen with Pork and it was amazing. The broth was delicious, the pork was tender and flavorful and the noodles were perfect! I only wished there was a hard boiled egg in my ramen... that would've made it perfect. The wait to get in was long, as the place is tiny. I think there were six 2-seat tables and about 8 or 10 seats at the counter. I enjoyed that when it was time to order, the cook asked me what I'd like and offered suggestions. Staff is extremely inviting, friendly and attentive. I can't wait to go back here again on my next trip to NY!
