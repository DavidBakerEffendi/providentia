I've only been here for functions and for after dinner drinks/desserts, however Dish has always shined. The food quality is superior. The atmosphere is modern and fun. The drinks specials are unique and the desserts even more. Special shout out to the creator of the "deconstructed candy bar" dessert... Amazing.
