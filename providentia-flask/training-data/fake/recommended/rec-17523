Went to have something cold and meet a friend, this ended up being a meal. I had the Ham and Brie Wrap, which was great, tasty, hot and plenty of cheese and my ice tea was good too. Peach IT. There was music that night and it wasn't too loud that we couldn't talk. Honestly, I wished there wasn't a live performer, because i wanted to talk to my friend but the music was good. The service was adequate, but i think our waitress was somewhat of a rookie and had no knowledge of the food or knowledge of waiting on people. Prices were reasonable so i have to give it four stars for quality of food/drink, atmosphere and pricing.
