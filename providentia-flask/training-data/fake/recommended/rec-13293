I went with a couple other ladies and we shared the chicken and waffles, the special pancake (raspberry and chocolate) and the banana walnut pancake.  There was not a meal that disappointed.  There was also not a meal that was finished.  (Except the bottle of sparkling wine split between two of us.  Half price wine Mondays and Tuesdays!)  Everything was delicious and the portions were huge.   Chicken and Waffles.  The chicken was really tasty.  It was really well seasoned, but could have been crunchier for my taste.  The waffles were perfectly tender and not too sweet. Banana pancake:  Cut the sides away and dive right into the center.  That's where all the glorious fruit chunks are hiding.  Don't forget a generous dunk in the amazeballs maple butter! Chocolate raspberry pancake:  We've located perfection. If you want to walk right in for dinner, get there around 15-20 minutes before they open.  If you have to wait though, it might be worth it.  I saw a creme fraiche cheese cake in the case.  I'd stand in line for that.
