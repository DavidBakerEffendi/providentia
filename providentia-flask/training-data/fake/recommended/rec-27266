everything here is very tasty we tried the artichoke salad, artichoke ravioli, and seafood spaghetti, all off of the specials menu I always think it's cool when you can tell that all the waiters in an Italian place are actually Italian anyways, the artichoke salad was unexpected and refreshingly good - the artichoke is pretty crunchy and flavorful, and complemented by the bitter arugula the artichoke ravioli was also very flavorful and delicious, in a buttery sauce seafood spaghetti is good and simple - they are very generous with the mussels the one let down was that the water they served us wasn't cold enough, especially since there is no air con as it is an al fresco place and don't forget it's cash only!
