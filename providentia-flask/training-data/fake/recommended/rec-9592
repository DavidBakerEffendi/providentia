There are not enough words to express my love for Pio Pio. I heard about this place before I even moved to New York and knew I had to try it. The location in Hell's Kitchen is huge and so cute and trendy. The food is so simple yet so delicious - I always order the Matador combo, a pitcher of sangria, and I always leave satisfied.
