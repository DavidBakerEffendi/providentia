I've only been here for brunch, and it is totally fab. Everything that my friends and I have ever ordered has been nothing less than awesomely delicious. The coffee is also very good, and my cup is always kept full (this is very important to me). The staff is super friendly, and I've never had a wait (but I do tend to go earlier than the average human). I really like the generally feel and look of the restaurant. It's very aesthetically Â pleasing and comfortable place, and when it's warm out, they open the doors and put tables outside. As opposed to a lot of other places (esp on 5th Ave), you look out onto a park, not the main drag.
