Guacamole already had one strike on it before I entered the place. Reading a review in City Paper, I headed there on a Saturday morning for brunch. Seeing that the hours were 9 AM, I got there around 10 and it wasn't open. A guy popped his head out and said they were opening at 11. Not a good start for a new place that just got a decent CP review. I ate there today, ordered a veg gordita- which was delicious. My qualms: no hot sauce (in the restaurant!) and no guacamole included at Guacamole. My friend ordered a tasty-looking veg. burrito, and devoured it- adding guac on the side for an additional 50 cents. Just ironic since the establishment's namesake is an extra cost. Anyway, all in all a decent experience, they didn't end up charging her for the guac as it was (oversight?) and we walked out of there for two lunches and sodas for under $17. It's a nice new option for West Philly, but I'm interested to see how Honest Tom's stacks up.
