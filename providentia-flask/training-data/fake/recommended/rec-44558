I used to frequent this place a lot but ever since the staff rudely attempted to rush us out of our table after our main course right as my friend was going to order a dessert to celebrate her birthday I have been a little reluctant to go back. Now if I go its only because I'm in the neighborhood and I'm looking for a classy place to eat. I love how they remodeled their restrooms!! Cafeteria's Fried Calamari and Mac Attack always hits the spot however.
