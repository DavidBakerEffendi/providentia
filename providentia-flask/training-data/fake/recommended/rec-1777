When I think Italian food in the US I think of Carmines in NYC. My sister went to Columbia so we often eat here when visiting with the family. I have had Italian in countless cities including many in Italy and this is one of the best and maintains the Italian family style tradition. I won't say its better than in Italy where eating is an all day event and a very memorable experience but its sure close. Everything including the desserts is very good and fresh.
