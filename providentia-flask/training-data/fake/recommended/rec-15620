Great restaurant. I came here for work for lunch, and it was a prefix 3 course lunch. We only had an hour and before we had to leave and we got all of our food within that time. I had the lamb shank and it was so tender it was falling off the bone. The sauce it was in was great as well. Very cool, modern atmosphere overlooking the river.
