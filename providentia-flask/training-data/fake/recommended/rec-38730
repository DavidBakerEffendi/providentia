We went in for lunch and spent $24 (plus tip!) on two cups of coffee, a tiny egg and tofu scramble, and an anemic egg and cheese sandwich.  Both also came with a teeny salad.  We are not big eaters at all, but really?  The food was also very unremarkable.  Also, there were specials available until 2 PM.  We were in at 2:10 and they wouldn't make them for us.  Finally, just try to flag down the inattentive service for your check...  (An observation:  The coffee on the bill was $3.00 for a pretty small mug.  It said BRUNCH on the receipt next to the coffee price.  Hmmm - is it more or less at other times of the day?)
