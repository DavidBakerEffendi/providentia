Very nice place.  I love the interior.  The service is spectacular and the food delicious.  The cod is cooked to perfection and the sea urchin are fresh and creamy.  The dinner menu has plenty more options than lunch though both are fabulous.  Do try the baby squid and the different potato appetizers they offer.  The green tea ice cream is dense and creamy. Delicious!  We are returning soon.
