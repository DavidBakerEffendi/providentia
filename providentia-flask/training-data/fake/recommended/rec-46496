Omg this place is an experience in flavor and variety and I can't wait to go back!! Sandwiches here are the bomb and the corn... THE CORN. The corn is the best part. Corn on the cob roasted and smothered in chili mayo and coconut flakes - seriously to die for and though everything else was delicious as well, the corn completely sold me on the place. It is a whole piece of corn so you can share it with someone else. Friend and I split the pork belly and the pulled pork sandwich, but pretty much every other sandwich sounded flavorful too (tiger shrimp, mackeral, Japanese yam) Â - I need to go back and try all of them!! The sesame panna cotta is totally delicious too - you can really taste the sesame. The whole cup is a little too sweet and too much of a good thing if you try to eat it all by yourself, but a couple of spoonfuls of this is a great way to top off your already flavorful lunch. Seating upstairs. Reasonable portions - sandwiches look to be on the small side, but are filling anyways. Line to order can get long if you go at prime lunch hour - I suspect this is because people who work in the area come during lunch since the sandwiches are so reasonably priced.
