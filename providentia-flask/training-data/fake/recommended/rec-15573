Came here for restaurant week and the menu had a great selection. Every course was very well done and the atmosphere was quite eclectic. Would be great for a night out with done friends or a date. Has a very nice bar area too and the buzz nicely spills over into the dining room. We sat upstairs which was quieter but I would recommend sitting in the main dining room to soak Â up the buzz. Seriously, this is a really good restaurant and the normal menu prices were pretty reasonable too. Go try it.....
