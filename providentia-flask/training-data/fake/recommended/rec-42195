I wish I could have taken pics but my phone batt died.  I went with my daughter after a long day.  The men in there are so nice and attentive.  I ordered tilapia and mash potatoes and for my daughter I ordered grill chicken and fries (servers choice for a kids meal).  The mash potato came out and it was green  I was caught by surprise so I asked the server why my mash potato was green and not white.  He told me it was bc they put a certain spice in it (I forgot exactly what) anyways MY MASH POTATO WAS SOOOOOOOO GOOD ! No exaggeration ..I ate all my off that plate ! This restaurant deserved that grade A they got.  My daughter loved the French fries and the grill chicken ..everything was perfect.  They also serve the orange juice I ordered for my daughter in a wine glass and my daughter loved that instead of a regular cup bc it made her feel like a princess.  I'd definitely recommend this restaurant.  I really wanna try there brunch.
