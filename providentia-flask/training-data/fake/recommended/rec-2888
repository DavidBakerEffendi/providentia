Beautiful interior.  Arrived for a very late lunch about 2:30 on a Friday.  Only about three other tables occupied plus a few people at the bar.  We were given a great table right by the window.  Service was very attentive and the food was delicious.  I went with a Greek salad topped with fried calamari.  The salad was huge.  My husband got the fix priced lunch.  He chose the soup, which was a light tomato base with pieces of halibut and veggies.  He loved it.  He picked the fish of the day which was sea bass.  Very reasonable lunch for $17.  Wonderful experience for lunch!
