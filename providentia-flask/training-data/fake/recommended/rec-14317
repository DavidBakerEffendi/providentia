I've had my fair share of chicken and rice cart platters around the city and this one really is the best. Yes, the lines are long and yes you can easily go around the corner to another halal cart but you'll be missing out. They just do it right: the portions, the price, the service -- it's all great. Get EXTRA white sauce and just enjoy the chicken and rice goodness. I've waited and eaten this in the freezing cold and it was worth the wait and my $6. If you want to try great halal food for extremely cheap, don't waste your money on the other billion chicken and rice carts in the city and just try The Halal Guys.
