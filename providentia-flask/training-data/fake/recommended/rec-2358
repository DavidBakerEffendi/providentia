The employee's are too busy swearing at each other and acting like comedians to be running a place that makes food that you actually consume.   It's dirty, dingy, and did not live up to expectations.  I don't know if they really invented it, but for crying out loud, it's a sandwich, you really have to "invent" it??  Give me a break. It's bread, meat, and cheese.  Wow. This just wasn't everything they crack it up to be.  Over-rated in my book.
