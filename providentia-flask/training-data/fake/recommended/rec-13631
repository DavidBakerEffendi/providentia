FANTASTIC!  My bf and I came in without a reservation, around 5:30pm during the New Year's/Christmas week.  The host offered us a nice table within 5 minutes as his other reservation was a no show.  The dinner was great and the service was excellent.  After 1 week in NY, this was my favorite dinner place.  Cozy, romantic, and simply delicious. LOVED IT!
