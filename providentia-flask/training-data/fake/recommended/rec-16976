Went there on a Friday night and the place was jamming. The atmosphere and decor is great. The menu is pretty unique which is refreshing to see. The Kale salad was very nice, the slushies were great we had one of each flavor and added our on tequila. We had 5 different tacos which ranged from OK to excellent. The carnitas was my favorite. Lastly, the chocolate churro was really damn good. This place is definitely worth a visit for something new for a change . One suggestion would be to skip the plantnos as they were the low of the meal.
