I visited Murphy's thinking it was just a bar. After sitting down at the bar, I was handed a menu. At 7PM, the bar was half full and seating was filling up. The place peaked around 9:30 and died out after that to the people who only are there to drink. The beer selection rocked. Great selection of local and imported beer. Bartender was friendly, nice and super gracious with my beer tasting before committing to one I wanted. I ordered the Albacore Tuna Salad which was pricey for Hanover but nothing compared to what you pay in big cities. It was THE BEST SALAD I've ever consumed. It's been 2 weeks since I've had it and I want that salad again. In fact, I'll let you in on a secret...I was there for a job interview and part of the reason I took the job and moved across country from San Francisco is so I can have that salad again every night of the week. Okay, that's not completely true but wow was this salad amazing! The home made croutons dipped in butter. OMG! Yeah, this place was amazing! Stop by, get a pint and order the albacore tuna salad w/ croutons. DO IT!
