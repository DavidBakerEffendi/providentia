It's fine dining with a rustic urban twist.  The menu though limited was very exact and well thought out with interesting ingredients and preparations. The flavors were dense and layered while still remaining balanced. And despite my restrained laughter at their over the top adherence to presentation and procedure (the serious tone and delivery of the bread guy was priceless) both my date and I really did love it.  It's a great place to go to impress a date or your NYC friends when they come to town.
