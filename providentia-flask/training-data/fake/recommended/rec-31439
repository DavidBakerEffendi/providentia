I've been to Anella for dinner a couple of times, and I've been very happy. It's a cute, cozy place with a big salvaged wood bar that is both charming and also oh-so-typical Brooklyn these days. They also have a garden with outdoor seating, herbs everywhere, but sometimes conflicting musical choices from the neighbors. The bread is fantastic, the burrata is like heaven on earth, and their drinks are pretty solid. From what I've ordered and what I've sampled from those I've gone with, their pasta dishes are the most consistently good, though the other choices on their rotating menu can also be delicious.
