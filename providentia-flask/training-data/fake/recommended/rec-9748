The hands down best sandwich and best value In the city that never sleeps..  No matter what time you crave it's open..  24/7 365!   If you like falafel this is the spot to go 1st always... There's always a line but these guys are very very fast!!!  It used to be 2$ .... Then jumped to 2.50... Now 3 bucks but still the best value in nyc for taste size and price! Amazing snack or meal anytime!!!
