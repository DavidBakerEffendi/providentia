Went with our kids for breakfast.  Service was really good, but that is how is should be because they went not busy and we were early.  Some highlights, homemade jam and great baked goods for the Mediterranean breakfast.   The staff rolled out the awning and wiped off our table so we could eat outside but be protected from the random rain drops. Most menu items were in the $7-$10 range for breakfast.  The menu is limited if you get the breakfast platter you will not be disappointed.  The decor is top notch, you can see into the kitchen and it is spotless.  The owner came over to our table and spoke about the food, a nice touch.  The menu is a bit small and you would think a restaurant in this area would be producing a hipster menu, but maybe this un-hispter menu will be the new hipster trend...  In you live in Slope, Gowanus area you should check this place out.
