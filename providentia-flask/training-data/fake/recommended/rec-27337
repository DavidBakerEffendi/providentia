The boobs on the default picture for this restaurant are apparently not on the menu.  Fortunately, the food is probably the best sit-down restaurant mexican food FOR THE PRICE I've had in the city.  I was really surprised.  I had the scallops and they were DELICIOUS.  Seriously reasonably priced and really good food.   Would definitely be a regular if I was closer to this neighborhood and that's saying a lot because I'm an ass when it comes to mexican food.
