Came here the other night for takeout to bring to Brooklyn Bridge Park for a little evening picnic. Me and my boyfriend ordered 4 rolls: the spicy veggie, the fancy spicy tuna, the monkey roll, and the 2008 roll. I don't usually even like shrimp, but the monkey roll was amazing. The veggie roll was good although I was wishing for some crunchy asparagus to balance the softness. I liked the texture of the 2008 roll (I think because of the multiple layers of rice paper), but the flavor was a bit bland. The spicy tuna was solid. We also got the Pork Shumai, which was delicious. Luckily we had four other people at our picnic, because these rolls were so rich and filling that we couldn't even come close to finishing them. Everything was packed beautifully and was easy to eat on our blanket.
