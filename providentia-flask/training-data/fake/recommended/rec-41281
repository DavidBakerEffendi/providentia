I've been to a lot of different ramen joints in NYC and in LA(waited in line an hour at a few - that's how good they supposedly are) and Chuko is by far one of the best.  Definitely my favorite.  Every time I go to another ramen place I am always disappointed The broth is rich and flavorful.  The homemade, garlic hot sauce is killer - they should bottle that up and sell it on the side.  My favorite is the miso-pork with the poached egg - melt in your mouth goodness! The brussel sprouts are the bomb!   And we are so thrilled that they finally got their beer license so we can have a drink with our tasty ramen.
