Went there with my wife today (Tuesday) at approx. 4;45.  The place wasn't busy, matter a fact we were 4th customers.  Place is amazing inside, lightning, décor and all spectacular.  We ordered cocktails (forgot the names) my wife's was very good, mine was ok.  For appetizers we had calamari and some beef skewers.  Portions were rather small comparing what you get in other places specially the calamari.  However, presentation was amazing.  It looks like they do waste a lot of fruits and veggies just on presentations.  Then we went with sushi, I was very skeptical about their sushi since I've read all reviews for this restaurant and I think only one or two reviews were positive as far as sushi goes.  It turns out that their sushi is actually very good just like sushi from Yummy Sushi in Robbinsville.  We ordered 6 rolls (phila, 2 Alaskan, 2 spicy salmon and Geisha and it was all very good. Is this place pricey?  Yes, it is.  You guys can purchase on groupon a $70 credit for $35 which is great deal obviously. Also as far as sushi goes all prices around here (sushi places) are much cheaper and give you 8 pc in a roll vs Pure's 6 pc in a roll.  Overall, B+.
