Great food and ambience, but awful service! Tearfully slow, aloof, and uninterested. Our waiter acted like he was working, but he never offered a 2nd round of drinks and we had to beg beg BEG for water. I wish that Management would read their Yelp reviews so they could improve the service. It's not impossible to turn the place around, but it's been YEARS since they opened and it has only gotten worse. Why patronize a place that won't listen to its diners? Shame on you, Peaches. This is NYC. We know when something sucks.
