Took the long train trip from Harlem to Buttermilk channel on a weekend, which means train service was at its worst. The LONG train ride was worth the trip. The food is creative and the ambiance is amazing. The service was great and the dessert was way too good that I considered trying to walk back to Harlem. Menu: Duck Meatloaf + Chicken Waffle + Pecan Pie = :-) Excellent texture, flavor, and presentation. Can't give it 5 stars because I believe $18 for fried chicken is a bit pricey especially, since I'm coming from the "HOME of Fried Chicken", HARLEM.....
