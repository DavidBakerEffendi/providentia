Was in the mood for Cuban and sadly had already left West New York. Heard about this place and decided to give it a try. Nice, comfy decor and music in the background. Menu and lunch specials were good. Typical Cuban specialties: ropa vieja, picadillo, croquettes, empanadas, arroz y frijoles Â of a couple varieties. Cuban salads and drinks. The plaintain chips with mojo dip was good and a Yelp promo! The lunch special (Cuban sandwich and sweet potato fries) was delicious and an excellent value. Excellent iced tea. Great, friendly service. Would love to return on Thursday nights for live music.
