There are so many good things I could list about Dos Segundos, including the $4 special (Tecate and a shot of tequila), the tasty margaritas, the nachos, a certain cute server I know, etc., but I'm afraid I'd be here forever. And ever. And ever. Anyway, you're catching my drift, right? Just go to Cantina. Experience it. Drink some tequila. Eat a taco. Have a time. Call out of work the next day (you might have to). Go back for more once you sober up. Smoochies to you, Cantina! You're my BFF.
