My meal was delicious, I had the beef wellington and it was perfectly cooked and I really enjoyed it. They had some excellent scotch on hand too which I very much enjoyed and the bartender was knowledgeable and friendly. Unfortunately my partner had a terrible meal. She ordered the scallops which at best were bland and unremarkable but worse than that they were full of grit and shell fragments, she spent more time picking grit out of her mouth than she did eating. She also got the brussel sprouts which were pretty good taste-wise but overcooked and kinda soggy. The waitress was bad though, she never once asked us if we needed anything or if everything was OK (clearly it wasn't) and she left us unattended for very long periods of time despite a mostly empty restaurant. Even when it was obvious we just wanted to pay and get the hell outta there it was like pulling teeth to get our check. Its a cute, cozy place with lots of potential but there were at least half a dozen big flaws in our experience and you simply can't do that kinda thing in that neighborhood when you've got so many excellent restaurants to compete with. We wanted to like this place but we will definitely not be returning.
