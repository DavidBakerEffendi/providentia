Exceptional ambiance with a traditional fine dining experience. I have been going for years and tried many different dishes however, throughout the years I have come to the conclusion that their "meaty lasagna" is by far the best dish they have. In fact I posted a picture and they decided to use it as their main picture and it also is delicious. Drinks are made with due diligence and executed to a tee. Deserts are also great if you have room to eat !
