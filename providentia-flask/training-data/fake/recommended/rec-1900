After some recent high-end disappointments in regards to price:quality ratio (Eleven Madison Park, Daniel), the streak was finally broken at Atera. Friendly staff who don't have a stick up their ass, reasonable wine mark-ups, and the food make the $150 price tag worth it. Every course was good, with about 3 being truly memorable.... maybe only 1 I'd call "perfect" but the quantity of near-perfect compensating for it. Probably my best overall high-end meal in NYC since Per Se a few years ago. I agree with a previous poster about being slightly pushy on drink refills - trying to push a 2nd glass of red while we are halfway through our final savory course??  Lame.  However, you will "like" the staff better than at other similarly priced restaurants as they aren't afraid to show some personality.
