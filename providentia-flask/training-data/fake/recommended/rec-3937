Here is my review from when it was on Classon. Somethings have changed-- its bigger, has alcohol and sometimes its not quite as amazing as it used to be.  But the service is slightly better-- they have a big waitstaff so they are a little less over whelmed.   As close to real mexican as you can get in NY, and very good mexican too.  This is not tex mex and it's (mostly) not Northern Mexican food.  That means those from Arizona who say it's not authentic --i say, well not to you; but its very close to food in Mexico city.   Has some days where the food is better than others; but it's never, ever bad; somedays it's just spectacular.  The fish in plaintain leaves is great, Plato Don is perfect for two and so affordable.  Tacos are uniformly lovely.  Waitstaff isn't always attentive; they are usually very busy--they aren't checking to see if everything is ok. But if you ask for something they get it quickly.   Its only flaw is that its crowded. It's a small space so it can be a wait and uncomfortably packed at peak hours.
