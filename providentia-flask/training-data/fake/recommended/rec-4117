I live nearby, but never really stopped in until this weekend. Service really is horrible. Waiter took forever to greet us and barely understood our drink orders (drinks are very watered down), appetizer took more than 30 minutes to come out and was extremely salty. The waiter also didn't bring a pen with him for us to sign our check. I guess they don't like money... Won't be going back.
