Argyle Fish and Chip restaurant has been in Kearny for as long as my family can remember. They used to have to compete with the Thistle, but the family got out of the business a few years ago. When you walk in, you immediately smell the fish and malted vinegar- that is how you know that you are in a true fish and chips shop. Service is nothing spectacular, but when you go and get fish and chips, you are not going for the service. When the fish comes out, the smell of the fish instantly hits you and you are instantly transported to the cobbled streets of Edinburgh. As is standard with fish and chips, you have malted vinegar to put on your fish and chips. The fish is extremely tender and extremely flakey. I will admit that my family was a Thistle family, but this is a good substitute. The beer batter is excellent and nice and buttery tasting. The chips are standard chips. They are not trying to be innovative here! My last meal on this earth is going to be fish and chips and if I am all the way in California, I will get on a plane and make the trip to Jersey to get these fish and chips (since it is exponentially less money than going to Scotland!)
