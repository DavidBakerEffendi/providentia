These piggies here bring me to heaven. I love places that fill me up with pork done right. I'm normally a beef only kind of person when it comes to hotpot, but Hakata Tonton is the exception. From the moment you call in to make your reservation, you are taken care of by people who know what they are doing. No overbooking, no extreme lateness tolerated (come on, be courteous and give them a call if you're stuck in traffic), just people who want you to experience a glorious meal. Our servers always ask if anyone has any food allergies and are happy to suggest more of the menu we've yet to explore. Their muscat cider and hot sauce are unanimously coveted by my circle of friends. BTW, there is milk in their collagen soup gyoza and their desserts aren't very lactose friendly. I'd save the trouble of reiterating the recommended dishes here since many others have already touched base with those kinda things. The chef sometimes comes out personally to introduce a dish or do things like wish his patrons a happy birthday. (Thanks for making my last birthday incredibly special, for making my every visit so delicious and for feeding a dozen ravenous pigs) My friends and I always come out stuffed like pigs, eagerly awaiting our sever to run out after us with a pig PEZ candy dispenser to mark the end of our memorable nights here.
