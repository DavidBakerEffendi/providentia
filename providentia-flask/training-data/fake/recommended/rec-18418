I like the idea but it didn't do it for me. I have celiac so I had to pick a gluten free item. I went with the lemon chicken (Lemon Chicken Grilled chicken breast, roasted fennel and mushrooms, spinach, broccoli rabe, green olives and brown basmati rice in a light lemon sauce, finished with toasted almonds and parsley) The chicken portion was very small and the rest of it just didn't do it for me. I threw most of it away. Granted, I'm not a huge vegetable person but I just didn't like it at all.
