I was able to get a seat straight away at the bar, probably went in during the inbetween period as it started building up as I was leaving. Bartender was lovely and it was great seeing her make all the delicious drinks. The chicken: So crispy it ticked all my boxes! Might try to the super hot chicken option next time, it can't be that Â hot, can it? Overall great atmosphere and a bed-stuy must!
