Fantastic and authentic Peruvian in the heart of Hell's Kitchen ... finally! This location is apparently much more upscale than other Pio Pio's in NYC. The small, dim entrance gives the illusion that you are walking into another tiny restaurant with only room for a few tables. But, as the hostess walks you passed the long underlit bar you enter into a cavernous modern space that emulates a feel of being in the mountains of Peru. The food is absolutely fantastic, with one exception the side dish of beans is a bit underwhelming. Everything else we ordered (and we ordered waaaaaay too much) was perfectly cooked. Some of the best Lomo Saltado I've ever had and a very large portion for this type of restaurant. The service was friendly and attentive and willing to indulge our multiple order changes and overzealous excitement to be in the space. If you're looking for a dive joint with dirt cheap food, this isn't it. Pio Pio 8 is a new and modern experience that won't break your wallet.
