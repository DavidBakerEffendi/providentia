LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! I took my brother and his new wife here for lunch after they got married at the court house. They gave us a fabulous table and were super-attentive (without being overbearing). The food was delicious and the bill was reasonable considering the feast we enjoyed. Perfect for a special occasion! Just don't expect it to be quiet...
