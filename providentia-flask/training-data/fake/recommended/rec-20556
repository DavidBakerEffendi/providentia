I'll start off with the positives: The decor of Aroma is beautiful! It feels very authentic, even down to the gold-plated silverware. I've never been to Thailand, but I imagine that restaurants in Thailand would look like this. The prices were good and the portions of food were moderately sized. I also saw a sign that said that students can get half priced meals on Thursdays. So I guess that's a huge plus! Now with the negatives: Red curry has recently become my favorite Thai dish. This red curry was a little disappointing. The plating of it is very inviting; it comes out in a ceramic clay pot with a small candle underneath to keep the curry warm. The rice comes on the side, as usual. Unfortunately, the rice was a little overdone and the curry itself was too soupy for my taste. I like curries a little bit on the thicker side. The other downside of the curry is that it was VERY spicy. I normally like spicy and I also like how this was "Thai" spicy, but it was all I could taste. There was barely any coconut or kaffir lime flavor. I ordered the mild and am thankful I didn't get the medium..... I think my head would've blown off! I'd definitely go back to Aroma on a Thursday (and maybe order something else...) but I've had better Thai food.
