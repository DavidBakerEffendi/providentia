Of the two tourist Meccas pats is my favorite, is it my ideal cheesesteak... Probably not. Is it my ideal cheesesteak joint... Definitely not. Pats and Genos are both open pretty late which is a big plus. But the downside to that is you gotta wait in a long line outside for a decent Philly cheesesteak and you need cash to get it. So wit wiz is the cheesesteak I got after waiting 10 minutes in the cold, and it was smaller and a little more rubbery than I remember. In a pretty shady part of town, long lines, for just a decent cheesesteak make Pats a 3.5 at best, but still better than Genos. Sonnys famous steaks has so far been my favorite next up on my list is tony Luke's.
