Apparently, in three days and two nights, one can make three trips to the cart because if you stand in line, this cart just keeps on giving!  While waiting the first time, as I hauled around my, literally, frozen ass (I'm from California, we get cold when weather is in the 50s/60s), I thought, "The things I do for food."  Honestly, I could not feel my feet and I exhaled clouds of chill.  Finally, it was my turn and I stretched out my gloved hands like a Charles Dickens orphan.  My eyes eagerly surveyed the platter of moist, tenderized chicken, and lettuce, bed of seasoned rice, and glistening sauces.  Oh man, the food was warm and wicked delicious.  I returned two more times with friends and we wolfed it all down each time, though truth be told, I was getting tired of it, but I bore of stuff rather quickly.  But, everyone needs to try the white sauce before they meet their maker.  It is unbelievably tasty.  It tastes like creamy garlic with some other spices, but that's just a description.  It must be consumed.  It is lipsmacking tasty.  The spicy sauce, on the other hand, is a crazy ninja.  It is a tad evil because on one night, I thought my mouth was on fire.  But, it was cool since the rest of me was an Asian popsicle.  They must load that bastard up with "hot damn" spices because it essentially tastes like harissa, but harissa does not normally have that flay-your-tongue whipping kick to it.  There is no seating, obviously.  Do your best to huddle and feed yourself or some folks do the Asian crouch, like my grams does when she is making kimchi.  Finally, the line is insane.  At all hours.  I walked by the cart during the day and people lined up just as they would after a long night of booze, dancing, and naughtiness, or in my case, hungry in hotel thus prowling the streets for food.
