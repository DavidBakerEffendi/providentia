Went here with 2 friends on a Friday night in December. Food was some of the best I have had in all of 2013 and it was absolutely delicious. We each picked 3 dishes that we would like, and we then all shared it when served. We got one dish at a time and just digged in when served - absolutely great way to share a meal at this spot. Drinks was out of this world as well.
