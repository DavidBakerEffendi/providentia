I've been working at Elmhurst Hospital and Joju is a godsend! They deliver very quickly (~20 min), are super affordable, and have great food. Disclaimer: I haven't gone to the restaurant, only ordered delivery. So far I've had 3 kinds of Banh Mi (~$5) -- Classic, Bulgogi, and Pork Belly -- and their Kimchi fries. The banh mi are great but could be a little spicier for my taste and perhaps have some more mayo/aioli. The pork belly especially is deliciously fatty and is perfect with the pickled veggies. Also I have found that ordering in the late afternoon, the bread is a little tougher than when I have ordered at lunch time. The kimchi fries are out of this world, covered in not-too-funky kimchi, jalape√±os, scallions, and spicy aioli. As for drinks, I've had their classic milk tea and Vietnamese coffee as well, which are solid and hit the spot but not amazing. They do give you a free drink if you buy 5 sandwiches too! Highly recommended.
