I ordered the salmon sushi on a bed of rice for $17.99.  There was a good portion of salmon, as well as some crab, cucumber and two generous portions of different pickles.  I had to order an extra bowl of white rice to get full mileage out of the pickles.  Server very courteous.  Had a good experience and pricing is the same as equivalent in manhattan.
