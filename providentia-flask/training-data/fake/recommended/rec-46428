A very good meal with the family last Friday night.  Between the 6 of us, we tasted A LOT of dishes. Although Morini is known for its pasta dishes, I actually enjoyed the other dishes more.  The  Prosciutto and Mortadella Meatballs, Lamb Blade w/ Fried Peppers and Porchetta were all very good to excellent. As was the sample of prosciutto, salmi and chesse.  Of the 4 pasta dishes we split, the Creste, w/ Shrimp, Fava Beans and a Seppia ragu and the Garganelli w/ truffle butter, prosciutto, peas and cream, stood out the most.  The wine list is very affordable and pairs well with all of the Italian fair.  The restaurant itself is small, casual and loud and was PACKED!  They are looking to expand next door. Service was very good. Really a good place to go with lots of people, as the menu lends itself to sharing lots of dishes. Overall a very fine meal.
