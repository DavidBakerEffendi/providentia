I ordered the oxtail & fried chicken chunks. BOTH plates had hair in them! Threw out the food and called and asked to speak to the manager who did not understand me. Finally she got what I was saying and all she could say was send it back I don't know if it's your hair or my hair? I said I threw the food out, work and live in the area and I will not eat from there again. She just kept saying send me the hair! I explained I do not want credit, I am positive it is not my hair and the only reason for the call is to make her aware of the food she is sending out and lost a customer. She did not apologize or sound concerned at all! Disgusting!
