I have never seen so many delicious varieties of fresh as well as homemade, frozen pastas! I wish that I lived in Philadelphia so I could come here all the time to purchase their pastas and sauces. The shop itself is quite tiny, but even then, they have an olive bar that basically takes up the center. And there are a few chafing trays of other ready made foods as well, including non-pasta entrees like chicken cutlets. Definitely a great place to check out for your next "homemade" Italian meal!
