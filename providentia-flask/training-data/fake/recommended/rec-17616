I had my first Ethiopian food experience here...and I LOVED it!!  The food was great. I went for lunch in the middle of the week (I believe it was a Tuesday), so it wasn't crowded at all and we were able to pick where we wanted to sit.  This is definately a place to go with a group of friends because everything is shared and you eat with your hands. Also, be sure to give the coffee a try. They roast the coffee beans there and bring it out to the table for you to get a smell of the roasting beans before they make your coffee.
