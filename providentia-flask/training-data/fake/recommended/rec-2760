Love metro! I live around the corner so we go probably 2-3 times a month. It is on the pricier side - but we always have a good meal here (except once I ordered Fish Tacos...they were awful!). I LOVE the cobb salad, walnut chicken, and any of the pasta dishes. They are so good and the service is always great. Sometimes there is a wait on a Friday/Saturday night, but we've never waited more than 10-15 minutes. I highly recommend!
