I grew up in Vermont and had visited the Country Girl fairly regularly without incident. Love the food. And then... .. on a trip home from college, I went with my partner to Country Girl and ordered cheese sticks and chicken fingers. The owner admonished me personally and then, as if that weren't enough insult, turned to my partner and said "Are you sure you want to let her eat that? You gotta watch her figure." Only time in my life I have ever left a restaurant without tipping and I will never, ever go back.
