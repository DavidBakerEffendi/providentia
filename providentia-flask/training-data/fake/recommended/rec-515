Its a New York City-esque bar that suburban JerZ kids get dressed up for and drive on rt 3/rt 46 to go drink at. The wine was nice, the tatted-up bartender was quick and the decor was comfy cool. Unfortunately, the patrons were all...like cheesy suburbanites. I'm glad I don't have to get all dressed up and drive to get to dope bars. Ahhh...the 'burbs
