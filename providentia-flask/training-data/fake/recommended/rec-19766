Had a great romantic evening with the hubster at Malatesta. Arrived around 8pm on a Saturday night. Waiting about 30 minutes before being seated in the corner by the window. Ordered a bottle of wine and enjoyed some yummy bread before our appetizers arrived. We started our dinner off with the artichoke and wedge salad - both were good, not great. However, our entrees were everything we expected! Â I ordered the cheese ravioli and my husband got the crab fettuccine special. Both of which were delish. Perfectly cooked and great flavors. For dessert we ordered the chocolate mouse - which was more like a fudge - but still very very good. It was a bit rich though - not light and fluffy like you might expect. Overall, we will definitely be back and looking forward to dining al fresco this spring :)
