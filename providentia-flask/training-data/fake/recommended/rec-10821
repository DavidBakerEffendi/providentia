A really happening place at this great location in the West Village.  Sat at the communal table for brunch which was comfortable and I felt the better table in the house.   The bloody mary was so-so, and the service was aloof.   Tasty breads and jams to start the meal.   The combination plate of all sorts of tempting mediterranean treats was killer, as was the fresh hot sauce that we ordered on the side.   The chopped salad was incredibly boring and i was underwhelmed.   Absolutely nothing to write home about and very disappointing.  TIny pieces of grocery store romaine that was hard to put onto the board, tiny flakes of feta, unimpressive chicken.  Saw someone who had 3 eggs any way (they got poached) with a side chopped salad.  I pitied them for their poor choice for a $15 brunch entree.   I went home and had a snack.   Wanted it to be awesome and it wasn't.  However, I would totally go back for dinner to see if it as good as people are making it out to be.
