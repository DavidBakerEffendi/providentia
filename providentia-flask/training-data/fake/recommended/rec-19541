Lets face it, fries are in tough competition in NYC. This is a great concept. If you're a true foodie, like you say you are, then you have to check this place out at least once. Fries are served in a paper cone shaped container. Atmosphere is tight but cozy. Its as close as I have yet to get to France, so that was another added plus. The fries are fresh, so the taste is well you know, nothing like the over greased, lard drenched stuff in NYC. With that being said, the taste isn't as striking or different, still very tasty. If the fries don't get you in, then the multi sauce variety menu will. This definitely makes up for the missing flavor of extra grease/trans fat in the fries.
