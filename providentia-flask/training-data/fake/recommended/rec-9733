Fresh and great tasting ingredients, best falafel in town! The falafel sandwich is a must get ($6.25).  You can choose your level of spiciness from none, mild, to very spicy. The platters ($11+) are very big and can probably be shared between two people.  If you are hungry, just order a platter and your stomach will be more than full. Smoothies are very refreshing.  Ordered a Cantaloupe ginger smoothie.  The ginger taste gave it an extra kick but yet still sweet and so satisfying. Seating on the sides of the place, or you can stand in the middle and eat.
