Used to come here all the time, especially in the summer after going out since they were open late. Food was great, a lot of the staff speaks good English too for all us non Spanish speaking Latinos lol. However, I haven't been back since summer '11. That whole summer every time I went there, there was always a cat running in and out of the kitchen... huuuge turn off smh... But I still think about their food every time I'm in the area.
