You'd expect  good service for that many dollar signs...not always so.. but at Balthazar service was excellent!!! Our server, Michel was his name I believe, was patient, it was my first time having escargot, if he didn't help, shells would have definitely been flying across the restaurant!! Escargot may be an acquired taste, but the base sauce for the snails was to die for, served with yummy bread to sop it up, ohh foodgasm... okay  I'm done! We were never rushed, even though the place was packed. So far Balthazar has the best chocolate pudding/Chocolate Pot De crème I have tasted, I'm not a big fan of chocolate pudding...as so I was sad to find the  Bakery didn't sell the pudding in wholesale bucket form for easy transport!!
