It's a really fun place with some excellent elements, but our main courses were disappointing and our server was more tolerant than amenable.  Actually the hosts are wonderful and polished, but the server and bus staff   were a sour note.  Our server actually looked offended when we decided to celebrate my husband's birthday elsewhere after a little stroll.  I won't belabor that pt, because we did love our appetizers.  I think we would stick to the seafood platter if we go again.  The frites and spinach were perfection, but the steak au poivre overpowered the taste of the beef.  The monkfish was a bit under salted and the bacon was a bit limp.
