Excellent service and great, friendly people, nice atmosphere. I have to be honest, I've had a hard time finding good and/or eating Indian food here since I had been spoiled overseas (if you're ever in Amsterdam, check out Koh-I-Nor). But Cross Culture has brought me back. I've tried EVERY place in Princeton, and they can't hold a candle to CC. Very flavorful dishes all around, and well made breads. The Malai Chicken Kabobs are OFF THE HOOK! It's nice to have well balanced (spicy but not too spicy that you can't taste the food) Indian food here in Princeton. Thank you Cross Culture, we are big fans.
