Came here for anniversary dinnner.  Reservations for 7PM on a Saturday, finally sat about 7:30.   Bartender was excellent, completely aware of his patrons, hardly needed to talk.     Dinner was pretty good.  The Antipasta special was okay, but not amazing. I was disappointed with the mushroom pizza as it was olive oil only, the next dish was a short rib pasta which was amazing, epic, finished off with pig, which was good but perhaps too much after the pizza and pasta.   I asked the waitress if we were mis-ordering, and she wasn't much help to guide us to their best dishes.   I would come here again with a large group and order one of every pizza, that short rib pasta, and stay for desert.
