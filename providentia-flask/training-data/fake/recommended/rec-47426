Awful and unhelpful! We were put on the list and told it would be thirty minutes.  The two (yes I said two) hostesses did not know how to work together and forgot about our party multiple times.  One told us we weren't on the list and she didn't know who we were when the other told us they were waiting for a table to get up and leave before they could seat us.  We checked out the list and we figured out that they forgot about us because they had crossed us out and then seated many parties that came in after us.   Then we were firmly told we would get the next table but they clearly did not communicate with each other because the other hostess sat another group at OUR table.  Instead of apologizing for forgetting us- at this point we had waited one hour- they completely ignored us.   Finally, a gentleman passed out multiple times at the bar- it was very scary- and one hostess disappeared while the other freaked out and couldn't decide whether to call 911 or not- HOT MESS!! At this point we were so frustrated that we just left.  It was so ridiculous.
