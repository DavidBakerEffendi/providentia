Duck fat fries, meh... They're fine. But the real shining star of this place is the burger. Truffled mushrooms? Check. Cheddar? Check. The next day's obligatory 2 hour session at the gym? Check. Also, order a whiskey sour. They make real ones, and oh are they to die for. Especially those cherries they put in. They aren't just your typical bar cherries; they're sweet and tart and so much more. -1 star for the occasional long wait and cramped seating. But it's worth it.
