My wife and I use to live right around the corner from this place, and we were frequent visitors!! If you ever want to try fresh hand-drawn noodles, this is the place to go. The decor of the restaurant is a little run down...only a few tables and bar seats. As for the cleanliness, its so-so. The tables and seats are a bit sticky and I have seen an occasional bug, but we always take the food to go. As for the food, the noodles are delicious. Once you place the order, the chef will then began to make your order. You get to watch him pull your noodles from a ball of dough. They do have a selection of noodles on their menu, but we tend to stick to our favorites: black bean sauce noodle, beef noodle soup, and Chinese preserved veggies noodle soup. Besides their noodles, the dumplings (steamed or fried) are excellent. The dough is nice and thick, which is an indication that they hand-make the dumplings themselves. The price is also cheap!  Two noodles and two order of dumplings is less than $15!!!  You can't find a deal like this in NY.
