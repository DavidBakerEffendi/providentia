It's an overhyped & overpriced tourist trap. I lived in Philly for years before heading to Seattle. I've had a few cheesesteaks in those days but never hit Geno's. So, this time when we were back with the kids we thought we'd give it a go. Wow, what a mistake. The sandwiches had virtually no meat yet cost 9 bucks each. The staff was typical South Philly...short and impersonal. There was nothing "special" at all. There is way better available out there. I won't recommend Pats across the street because we didn't eat there. But, we did walk by. I saw that their sandwiches were way meatier. I don't know how they taste or what they cost but they looked a a whole lot better.
