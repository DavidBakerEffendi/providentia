I give the 3 star rating for a diner - not for a general restaurant. Staff is friendly and caring. Owner is often there making the rounds to see if everyone is satisfied. Portions are huge. Quantity does not equal quality and I sometimes wish I had stopped with the soup. While they offer a good variety of dishes, it is still somewhat overcooked diner food. They have breakfast all day and night, and I think this is the best choice.
