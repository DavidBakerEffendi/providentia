If you want cheap and easy sushi, try this place.  50% off for basic rolls and 20% off for specialty rolls.  You get what you pay for, they're a little on the small side but I don't think you'd be complaining about the price once you realize how much you can order.  Doesn't seem to be that busy, so you can find a seat pretty quickly. Also, they deliver and you can hit that $20 minimum quickly, a plus.
