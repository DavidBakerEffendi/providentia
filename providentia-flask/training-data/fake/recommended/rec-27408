I've never had a bad thing here.  In fact, everything has been quite exceptional.  This is an awesome dive bar tucked in a special little area.  Their carnitas tacos are very authentic (I've eaten tacos in Mexico, and they're comparable).  I've also eaten their burger (delicious, but super messyyyyyy mmmm) and the romaine salad is badass!  As a lover of brussels sprouts, they're also deliciously prepared here.  Tried their cookies and loved those too!  Great service and just overall great vibes here.  Happy that I have such a great place to drunk and grub within walking distance of my home.  :)
