My family and I have been going to Noodle Chu for 15-20 years, but after today ARE NEVER COMING BACK. We had a horrible experience during Dim Sum involving one of the cart ladies.  She has bangs and wore her hair in a bun.  She erroneously marked our bill for an extra dish.  We told the waiter, and he corrected it.  When she came around again, she saw the correction and yelled at us for why we changed our bill.  We told the waiter to come and explain to her, but she demanded that we were "supposed" to only find her to correct her mistake.  She was very rude to us and pretty much accused us of cheating on our bill.  NO EMPLOYEE should yell at a paying customer and embarrass them in public, especially if they are the ones at fault.   The other employees pretty much told us that she claims she is a relative of the owner, so therefore she cannot be reprimanded.  They've received numerous complaints about this lady, and they can't do anything. I can't stand for nepotism and I believe that a restaurant should have at least SOME customer service.  The fact that nothing can be done about a RUDE employee leaves a horrible taste in my mouth.  As we were leaving, I told her that we won't be coming back because she is very rude, and she then yelled "SPEAK IN CHINESE!"  I refused, and then she added, "WHY YOU NOT SPEAK IN CHINESE?  YOU DON'T KNOW CHINESE?! HA HA HA!"  This is the kind of attitude we were dealing with. Her co-worker then asked her to borrow the food scissors, which she then dropped on the floor.  She picked them up and gave them to the co-worker.  I am resisting the urge to call the Health Inspector. It's sad that this bad apple ruined this place for us.  What's even worse is that this restaurant doesn't care and bad apples are not punished.
