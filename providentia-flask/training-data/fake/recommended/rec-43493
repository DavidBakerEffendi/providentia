Who knew?  What a wonderful surprise Fiorino's is!  As others have said, it's charming, cozy, and I would say joyful.  Everyone at my table enjoyed their meals...from the pasta, the eggplant special, scallops and veal, the dishes were all en pointe.  I found 2 challenges, the first is simply the volume in the room.  As the space is small, and perhaps the B in BYO was a culprit, the decibel levels got increasing high.  Toward the end of the evening, I had a great deal of trouble hearing my own table's conversation (not a common complaint for me).  The second was the size of the tables themselves.  They were a bit too small for plates they were trying to accommodate.  We used the floor as a fall-back for our wine bottle (which was white and not offered to keep chilled----just remembered that).   Are these 2 challenges enough to keep me from returning or thinking poorly of Fiorino's?  Absolutely not, but it is enough to withhold a 5th star.  It's a terrific place with a great solid menu and well executed dishes.  It's a place you will be happy you patronized, but it's not a place you will be dreaming about when you leave.  A solid 4 star without any grade inflation for reasonable pricing.
