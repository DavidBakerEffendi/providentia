I was aware of the great reputation of this place. One can't also ignore the long line outside the place on a Sunday morning. We tried it on a Sunday and after a 2.5 hours wait time we finally got in. We tried the mushrooms omelet and the pancakes. It's not that it wasn't good. It was good just like as any other fair brunch place in the city but taking the buzz, the wait, the small sizes and the pricing into consideration it's just not a good deal at all. It's more of an highly overrated and overpriced place. The only reason I gave them a second star was their really good maple butter (but even for that they charge $2.5 - if I remember correctly - if you want some extra with your pancakes). Btw, service wasn't top notch (understatement) as well (except for the host who was lovely).
