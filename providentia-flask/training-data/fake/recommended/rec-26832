yum!  My first time at this diner despite how  popular it is.  Decor's really cute.   I ordered a pesto omelet - mozzarella, fresh basil and tomatoes.  It's so fragrant you can smell the fresh basil.  Delicious but not bursting w/flavor, but you feel healthy eating it.  Coffee's pretty decent here too.   I shared a plate of mozzarella sticks that came w/freshly crushed tomato marinara I'll def be back for more.
