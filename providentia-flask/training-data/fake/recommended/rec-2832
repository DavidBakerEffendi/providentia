For diners, great food can elevate a lackluster environment (think an amazing lobster roll at a crappy little lobster pound in Maine, great dim sum in a basement in Chinatown, or even Le Bernardin before its recent makeover) and a unique environment can elivate a lackluster meal (think Tavern on the Green), but it is when high quality and creative food comes together with a unique environment that fireworks fly and diners are treated to an "experience," rather than just a meal.  That is what dining at the Pig & Prince is... an experience. As others have mentioned, the owners have taken an architectural diamond in the rough and made it shine.  No detail was overlooked. Likewise, the food and drink menus (both at the bar and in the main dining area) are, despite the fact that this restaurant just opened last week, highly refined, creative, approachable, and exciting.   My favorites so far: the Cod, the pork belly pizza, the venison, the cured meats (all of them), the mac and cheese fries and pretzel bombs at the bar, and the key lime pie.   On the drink menu: The cucumber drink special and the blitzkrieg are fantastic and I look forward to many more Sorachi Aces served in glasses etched with the P&P logo (another nice touch). With free parking, outstanding food, a liquor license (and fantastic drink menu), and a beautiful space, P&P is a great addition the crowded Montclair dining scene.
