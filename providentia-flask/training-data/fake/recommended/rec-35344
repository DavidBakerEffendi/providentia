c'mon people, you can make this burger at home! in the broiler even! yeah, it was good. but it really wasn't anything special. service is hilariously surly, with rude busboy types who throw plastic plates down in front of you. you stand in line in the middle of the bar to wait for Â table. kinda awkward. but hey, its very NY.
