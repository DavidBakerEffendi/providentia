The bad news first:  the booths are a little too close together, so unless you're a toothpick-sized person, you might feel squished and want to request a table instead of a booth.  And the service was slow-ish. Now the good... and there's a lot of good!  The atmosphere and decor are warm and welcoming, feels a little like a Tuscan village (if you look too close, it looks more plastic and tacky, so don't do that!).  The dim lighting and Italian tenor music in the background made us forget we were in a Glastonbury strip mall. The food was quite good.  The bread was warm, obviously freshly baked.  The shrimp scampi had perfectly-cooked pasta, and was delicious.  The white pizza was also excellent.   The owners clearly pay alot of attention to detail.  Everything in the restaurant was clean (especially the glasses - they looked like they had never been used before).  The wine and beer menus were nicely printed, which is unusual for a pizza place.  And when the waitress/owner thanked us for coming in, it seemed that she truly appreciated our business.   I wish this restaurant were a little closer to my house, so I could go more often...
