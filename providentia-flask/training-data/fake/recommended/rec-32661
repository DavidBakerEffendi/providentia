I have been to Perilla twice, once for dinner and once for brunch.  Loved the experience both times!  Delicious and nicely presented dishes.  The ambiance is also condusive - chic yet casual.  I remembered having pork belly as appetizer and the fish special as entree.  I thought the pork belly was just superb.  Brunch was equally enjoyable - the grits were awesome.  I am already planning my next visit, either dinner or brunch. Update: I did go for another dinner... this time around, I think the food is just ok.  Some inconsistencies.  I got the pig tasting - a bit on the bland side.  I missed the pork belly they used to offer as appetizer.
