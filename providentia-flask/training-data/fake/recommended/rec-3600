This was my birthday meal to myself.  I wanted to get into ABC Kitchen/Cocina, but since I planned the day before, there was no availability.  I wanted to try Market Table, as well, and the food and experience did not disappoint! I made a rez for one.  When I arrived, the hostess asked if I wanted a table or the bar.  I chose the bar.  The bartender was super nice.  As a few people came and sat at the bar, it seemed that he knew a few of them. Based on their chats, I deduced that they were regular patrons.  I had two of the mixed drinks and had the bartender choose what to give me.  Both were so good.  One of them had hot peppers and it was spicy!!!!  Woohooo!  Never had a spicy and delicious drink before. They brought out bread, olive oil, and sea salt.  The olive oil was nutty and delicious and, with the sea salt, made the bread taste earthy and pungent at the same time.   I ordered the pan roasted chicken for entree with a side of carrots.  The chicken was a half-chicken.  The first few bites did not seem that interesting or spectacular - just basic chicken.  But, as I continued to eat bite after bite, the flavors began to reveal themselves.  The chicken was juicy, tender, and succulent.  It had the right amount of faint saltiness and mild spice (maybe pepper), that I was able to taste a layering of flavors on the chicken.  The chicken was placed atop the spring pea risotto, which was creamy and delicious.  I wish they served a bit more of the risotto, but otherwise I can't complain.  The carrots were really good - spicy. The bartender asked me if I wanted to order dessert - and I said yes, because it's my birthday today.  A few minutes later my dessert arrives with a candle on top and the bartender and server saying happy birthday.  He then got me and the couple next to me some shots to celebrate.  And the lovely couple then ordered me a glass of port to go along with my dessert!   Just a great experience!
