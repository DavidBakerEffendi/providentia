The Dapper Dog on 86th Street & Third Avenue is the best hot dog stand in Manhattan.Grey's on Broadway and 72nd St. runs a mighty close second.They both use the same all beef, natural casing hot dogs that they grill so they snap when you bite into them.I don't put anything on these hot dogs.I like the hot dogs.
