I loved it so I decided to go twice this past Christmas :) Michael White's casual eatery has got some serious cred. At brunch, my friend and I decided to order 4 of their divine cured meats (sopressata, speck, mortadella, and the duck liver mousse) and some cheese. It had us at hello. I'm not even kidding you. The first taste of all of them with their bread was absolutely fantastic. One of the day's specials was pureed cauliflower soup and that was seriously one of the best soups I'd ever tasted. Magic. Soup. Onto brunch: try the raviolo!! a giant fresh pillow of ricotta, spinach and egg yolk, with mushrooms & brussel sprouts to top it off. I couldn't get over just how delicious it was. The second visit I made, I had the truffled ravioli and it was like comparatively eating little clouds. Exaggeration? maybe, but that's the best way I can describe it. No other ravioli I've had has been able to compare. Topped it all off with their dessert of chocolate hazelnut cake with their tiny scoop of olive oil gelato. There is much, much to be excited about with all of these things to finish your meal. Trust me. Thank you, Michael White! Your heart is truly in your food! I'm budgeting just to make it out to Ai Fiori next!!!
