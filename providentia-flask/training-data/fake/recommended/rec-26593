What amazing sandwiches!  Discovered this place by accident last night (Friday) and it pains me that I have to wait the entire weekend to go back.  As others have mentioned the Fuego sandwich had layers of flavors and textures that worked really well together.  The bread was perfectly pressed.  Warm and fresh.  Awesome. Coworker had the grilled cheese and it was equally satisfying.  Thick buttery delicious toast, gooey cheese and perfectly cooked bacon.   Additionally, our delivery man went above and beyond.  Not only did he suffer through the rain, but I was unfortunately on a work call when he came.  It killed me that I couldn't come down immediately as it's disrespectful to make delivery people wait.  They work in volume, and I imagine they were busy with the weather.  To add salt to the wound, the security people in my building wouldn't take the bag from him.   ANYWAY, when I finally made it down, the delivery man was extremely friendly and understanding.  He had every right to be in a poor mood, but it was just the opposite.  Really set a pleasant tone for our dinner.  And remember, this was BEFORE I got to eye up the fantastic sandwiches. Had the best dinner last night and I'm very excited to try their other items.  The pictures of the salad by other yelpers has my heart skipping a beat.  I actually swung by the storefront after I was done with work and it looks great inside.  They need to hang a sign out front so people can discover it! Finally, love that it's open late.  If you need to grab a meal (or coffee!) before hitting the PATH, this is the place to go.
