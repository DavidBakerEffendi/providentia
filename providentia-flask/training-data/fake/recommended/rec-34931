Indian food is my dirty little secret. I love this stuff! I was super excited when my boyfriend's mother decided to take me here (Indian boyfriend). I was definitely not disappointed. The food was delicious, the service was great, and I left a happy camper. I've gone here several times since and they've recently added a fusion Chinese-Indian menu. We tried one dish from here, the Manchurian Chicken. Good effort, but not good enough. Definitely stick to the Indian food! With that said, I beg my boyfriend to bring me here every time I visit NJ! A must try if you're in the area and looking for some delicious Indian food.
