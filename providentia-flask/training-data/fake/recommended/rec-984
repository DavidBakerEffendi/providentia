Forget Pats, Genos, and Tony Lukes.  I've tried them all The best cheesesteak in Philly, hands down, is Johns Roast Pork.  I had the cheesesteak with onions and mild provologne.  The meat is tender and flavorful, the roll has just the right amount of crispity crunch, and it all goes together so well.  I also tried their roast pork with sharp provologne and spinach.  Great sandwich too.  You really can't go wrong here.  Friendly staff.  You can park across the street in the strip mall.  Only negative is they close early, around 4 I believe.  Oh and cash only.  Enjoy!
