This review is for take out but I can't help comment on how cool this place looks. While I waited for my food, I hung out. Great bar, trendy vibe. Food - got the curry puffs, the spicy basil noodle both dishes very very good, especially the curry puff. I also go soup, forgot the name, but I remember it being tasty as well. Good prices too - very reasonable for what you get (quality & portions)
