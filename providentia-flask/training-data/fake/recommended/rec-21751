My friend visiting from my home country and I walked into the restaurant for dinner and other group of people who also didn't have a reservation came in right after us. The chef  told all of us that all tables had been reserved, so I asked him if we could eat at a bar but was told that even the bar table had been reserved.. When we were about to leave the restaurant, a couple asked him the same question and he let them seat at the bar.. I wanted to say something but did not because I didn't want to ruin a great time with my friend. I guess we were not his preferred customers but feel better after I read an article about his mistreatment of his staff ..  We went to Stone Park Café and were treated very nicely and the food was delicious as usual.  There are many other nice restaurants in Park Slope and cant wait to see a new one opening soon :)
