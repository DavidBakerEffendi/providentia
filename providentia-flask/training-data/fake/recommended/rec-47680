The Cask Republic has a wide selection of beers, wine, and other spirits to suit almost anyone.  Moreover, the atmosphere and decor are great, although it can get a bit loud during happy hour or at busier times of the evening.  The food is hit or miss.  I usually get a burger and fries, which are always good.  I have had the salmon, which was a bit undercooked and over-seasoned for my taste.  Service is pretty standard...no complaints.  All-in-all, I like the Cask Republic and would definitely recommend it with 4/5, which could be bumped up to a perfect score if they could match the quality and variety of the food menu with their beer menu.
