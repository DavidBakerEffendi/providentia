First and only bar on Staten Island! I was pleasantly surprised. Definitely a dive, and cash only. However it is what I consider cheap. My buddy and I were drinking Coors Light pints and they were $3 normal price, $2 for happy hour. The bartender was friendly and made conversation with us. She was about 40 I'd say and seemed to be an "islander." The crowd seemed, um, eclectic. Lots of interesting people, I'll put it that way, but everyone seemed nice and we chatted a bit with the gentleman seated next to us. We didn't eat but we did see they have food, which is good to know. Overall a good experience that rests almost completely on our bartender and the cheap beers. Side note: I struggle a bit with reviewing dive bars because really they're all 1 or 2 stars. However, most of what makes me like a bar is the people, and we had a nice time here. The service was good, the beer was cold and cheap. Four stars and I'd come back if I was in the area.
