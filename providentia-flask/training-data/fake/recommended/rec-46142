Food is meh. I come here for karaoke. Some nights are packed, some nights are empty - doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to that. They usually manage to get you in to sing a few times at least so my friends and I like it here. The categories need to have karaoke/bar on the description (couldn't add it) it is hard enough to find connecticut stuff on here without having pertinent things not come up in your search :(
