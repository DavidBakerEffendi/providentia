First stop after dropping off our luggage at our hotel, where else but to lunch?! Walking in I thought I just stepped foot in a cute little cottage on Fire Island.  Worn wooden floors.  Comfy over-sized leather couch complete with a coffee table for those looking for a truly casual experience.  A fresh raw bar with oysters ready to be devoured.  Bring on the linen pants & flip flops! We went al fresco on their short wooden front deck and enjoyed some people watching as we went over our menus. Service was so so.  You know how sometimes the bus boys get more points than the servers?  That was the case here.  Our server was inattentive and seemed annoyed every time he had to ask us how things were.  Our bus boy on the other hand was always coming around with a smile.  Refilling water.  Fixing our wobbly table (we had tried to do it ourselves with a hard piece of bread.  Fail).  He even recommended a few places to check out during our weekend in the Big Apple. On to the food... Almond offers a weekday prix fixe 2 course lunch for $21 that includes either a glass of wine or a local beer.  What a deal! Starter:  bite sized aranchini balls filled with cheese.  Mmm...they had a delicious crunch paired with a light cilantro olive oil drizzle. Entree:  Pork milanese that engulfed my entire plate.  Engulfed.  As in was bigger than my head.  Nothing I couldn't handle, especially with my appetite.   Drinky drink:  They offered a local beer, can't think of the name for the life of me.  Get the beer.  Not the wine. This one's definitely going in the repeat list.
