My boyfriend and I came before the dinner rush and were seated right away. We ordered the hand drawn Beef Brisket Noodle Soup and Beef Tendon Noodle Soup. They have sriracha, soy sauce, and hot sauce at every table for customers who need more flavor but i personally dont think it's necessary. Both bowls were super delicious and the broth were very flavorful. I was pleasantly surprised at the portion of meat in my noodle soup. Be careful, soup comes out really hot! AND....$8.50 per bowl! Great deal! Wish there was a Nan Zhou in MD!
