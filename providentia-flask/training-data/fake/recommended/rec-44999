AWESOME I really feel bad for the people that feel the need to scrutinize a new restaurant to the point of trashing it.  I work in the business and this is a great place.   We are Queens, we're not stuffy and pretentious.  We like good people and we enjoy some good food.  This is exactly what they have here. Some people forget that Queens Comfort is not trying to be the next 3 or even 4 star restaurant.  They are awesome people just trying to bring something cool and exciting to my neighborhood and for that they have made me a regular!  I have a very serious gluten allergy and usually stay away from menus like there's since it uses a lot of stuff I can't eat but I still go anyway, why? Because they are AWESOME!   All the haters can go somewhere else cause trust me, we don't want your kind here anyway! Queens Comfort.... keep doing your thing!!  I'll see you tomorrow :)
