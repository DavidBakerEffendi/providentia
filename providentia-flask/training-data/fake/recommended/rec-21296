Dropped in this little place sometime last year by accident as we were walking around thinking about ramen. Never heard of the place, we walked in and were told a reservation is necessary but luckily a cancellation allowed us to sit down for a wonderful hearty meal! We ordered the sashimi platter which was very refreshing on a hot summer day... And as it's been a long while since I had a traditional pig feet noodle soup (Taiwanese/Chinese dish), we went for the hakata tonton hot pot. Â I would say it was a bit salty, but the flavor was definitely good... Loved everything that was in it but the addition of extra noodles at the end of the stew got us a bit too full. Black sesame was a nice finish for a hot meal during summer time... Good, rich and creamy. Would go back to try other dishes.
