I gave Trios a 4 star review back in 2012 but have to revise it in 2014 to a 2 star review. The food has gone down hill slowly over time in both consistency and quality, and the level of service has plummeted from folks genuinely trying to help you to folks who don't care and are argumentative with customers. The staff are repeatedly way too involved with their friends (drivers? other?) in the seating area than taking orders or providing service. Trios also are seems to be Â occasionally randomly closed with no sort of "hey we are closed" message when you call, the phone just rings and rings. Trios is now in indefinite time out with me due to my latest failed interaction with them. While my frustration level is high right now, they are still not in the oh-mai-gawd terrible category that one star places get.
