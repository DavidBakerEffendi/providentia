Went here last night with my husband for dinner in celebration of my birthday and Restaurant Week. It was a bit of a hike for us, since we live deep in the heart of Hells Kitchen, but it was easy enough to get here. We just took the E to the 6 and enjoyed to 10ish minute walk to Riverpark. I would love to come back to this restaurant once it's nice out. It's located right along the East River with a beautiful view of the Queens skyline. The inside of the restaurant was very nice. The lights were dimmed, the colors were subdued. It created a relaxing, casual but still elegant atmosphere. We arrived about 20 minutes early for our reservation and had a glass of wine at the bar. The viognier was delicious if you like crisp, sweet wines. We were seated right at the time of our reservation. Our server was pleasant and knowledgeable of the menu. Here is the rundown of what we ordered: mushroom consumee-mild but with a tangy, earthy pop. It was nice and light. A perfect first course. Buckwheat spaghetti with cauliflower-so very good! A pretty decent-sized portion for a first course. My husband was afraid he'd be full after eating it. We both had the Berkshire pork chop-can I please eat this everyday?! Ordered medium, it was perfectly seasoned, the brussel sprout-apple hash was it of this world, especially considering brussel sprouts are my favorite veggie and in my opinion, underutilized in most cuisine. Cereal & milk-worth the $3 upcharge. Hard to explain, it's one of those desserts you just need to experience. Overall, we had a fantastic meal, drinks, and service at Riverpark. I can't wait to return! I only wish it were closer to me.
