Came here tonight after reading the reviews, very disappointed. First we had the tom yum soup with ribs. The soup base was good, but the ribs were not fresh. It has the freezer smell like it has been in freezer for 6 months, i was shocked by the poor quality. Then came the famous crispy pork. At first I could not see the dish because it was dark, so I picked up by blind trust. The sauce was good, so the vegetable taste good, Â a bit salty for me. Then i picked up the famous pork. OMG! I did not expect people eat this kind of fat meat TODAY! It was cube of pork with very large portion of pure fat and very thin layer of lean meat, then deep fry it till it's dark. The whole dish spells heart attach, hypertension and stroke. I have to carefully exam each piece, remove the fat, then eat the lean part. The part being removed is more than the part consumed. I wonder if those people recommended this dish really know what's inside? I also ordered their signature fish dish. Once again the sauce was very good, but the fish was deep fried so dry that it bears no taste. So, woody texture with lemon taste sauce, I tried to be in good spirit but the mission failed. Even my companion, a hungry 17 years old after walking all day could not swallow the food. He gave up the soup, had some pork and said no to the fish. Ended up eating the white rice alone. I don't care the price tag of each dish, but when you don't enjoy the food, or even bare to eat it, no matter how low the price is, it's TOO EXPENSIVE! Will never return.
