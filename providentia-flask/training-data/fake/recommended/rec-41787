This is a great little spot, very cozy with a great atmosphere. The food was good, nothing special and the service was not the greatest. Not to say the server wasn't good, just clearly over worked, waiting on the entire restaurant without a busser or hostess. Great potential just needs more staff to accommodate the customers. Would go back
