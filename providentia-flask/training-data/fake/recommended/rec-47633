Pizza was delicious as always but service left a lot to be desired. Our waitress took food and drink orders right away and brought our first round over fairly quickly. After that, she was more interested in taking shots with the table of college aged boys than attending to us at all. Our pizza was brought out by another waitress who placed the pizza down and left. We had no plates or napkins and had to go and find someone after failing to get our waitresses attention (still tending to/taking shots with the boys). So after fetching our own plates (still no napkins) we enjoyed our pizza (mashed potato bacon). Waitress stopped by quickly and we requested napkins and a few ordered more drinks. She brought our order and we never saw her again. We had to flag down the hostess in order to get and pay for our meal, which had an 18% gratuity already added to it. We were only a party of 6 and our waitress was far from deserving of the 18%. May be back for the pizza if we are ever close enough but will be getting take out.
