One of my go to places whenever I'm in the city. The food is superb, well made, quick, and does not disappoint. The service is amazing--I tipped way more than I anticipated in doing and was really happy that I did. This should easily be on your list of places to go. Plus those breadsticks make my mouth water thinking about them.
