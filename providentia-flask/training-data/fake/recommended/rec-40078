Honestly - this place presents as a serious brew pub in a wonderful historic building.  One doesn't necessarily have high expectations of the food fare.  Fantastic, then, that I had one of my best lunches ever here - perfect breaded/fried wahoo fish tacos.  Great friendly relaxed but attentive service.  My absolute go to from now on in historic Philly district. Oh, and a great beer selection, naturally!  Bonus: fast, free, wifi.  Someone has the right idea here...
