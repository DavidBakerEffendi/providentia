This place was a surprise to find one of the first times I came to Philly and now I try to come back every time I'm in town to explore more of their many vegan-friendly options. You haven't lived if you haven't tried their Coconut Club. Tofu in exchange for turkey and crispy smoky coconut instead of bacon. The texture is spot on and the flavor profile is fantastic. Also a solid veggie burger! Next up on my list to try? The "Veal" Parmesan (it's just portobello mushrooms, don't fret animal loving friends). As a fan of good beer/wine, their selection also gets the thumbs up. The quality of food you get for the cost puts most Boston equivalents to shame. Great staff, cool customers, and awesome bar-talk eavesdropping. Check it out.
