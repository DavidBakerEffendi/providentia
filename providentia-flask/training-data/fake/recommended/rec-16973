What a fun place filled with people and great food smells. My friend and I walked nearly all of it and while we didn't dine here, it was such a fun place. There is something for everyone and all ages. Meats, seafood, cheese steaks, ice cream and cookies. Tourists and locals are welcomed here. I liked the live music too.
