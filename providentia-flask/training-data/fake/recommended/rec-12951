Pretty good food. Not too many choices for lunch special but a lot of options on the regular menu and appetizers. Place is small but clean and comfortable. Ordered the shabu shabu lunch special with the beef and it comes with salad, rice and ice cream plus a complimentary plate of veggies and noodles.
