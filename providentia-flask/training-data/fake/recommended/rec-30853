Finally I worked up the courage to give Chavela's another try. It's been almost a year after my not so good experience that turned me off. I had a craving for Spanish food and was in the area so I said why not. I say at the bar, place was pretty much at capacity. It took a little longer than I liked for the bartender to acknowledge me but as I said they were packed. Ordered a classic Rita and chicken enchiladas with salsa verde. Food was amazing, definitely made me add Chavela's back to my list of lovely food spots. Nice date spot. Even tho it may seem cramped and a bit loud, sitting at tables is actually really intimate and allows for close convos!!
