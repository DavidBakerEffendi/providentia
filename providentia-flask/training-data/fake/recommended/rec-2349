Just got back from Philly where I ate at Pat's and Geno's AND Dinic's. While I love cheesesteaks, the pork sandwich here was the stand-out flavor-fest of the trip. I can't believe I've never had one before. I got mine with the hot peppers (don't worry, they're not hot, just full of goodness) and broccoli rabe. Nothing else was needed on this sandwich - even though the hubs got cheese on his half. The flavor and juiciness of the pork paired well with the peppers and rabe. The bread was the perfect backdrop to it all. While I split one sandwich, I could have easily eaten a whole one. I thought about the sandwich for the rest of my trip. When I went to do the taste-test of Pat's and Geno's, all I really wanted to do was go back and get another pork sandwich.
