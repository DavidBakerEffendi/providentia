This place has great food. The ground beef taco is simply amazing, and the fried chicken taco is great too. I have to knock a couple of stars off though, because the English lady that answers the phone is the rudest order taker I have ever come across in the great city of New York. She has no concept of customer service.  My rate of actually getting an order in with her hovers at around 50%. She has hung up on me before, told me that, yes, they take credit cards, but no she won't take mine because she's busy and doesn't need to, and generally copped an attitude literally every time I've spoken to her.  She left my wife on hold forever and then came back on the line and called her a bitch when my wife asked if she was going to be able to order. In short, the great food has this lady getting too big for her britches. She does her job astoundingly poorly. She should be fired. We don't order from Gueros anymore. After all, it's just Mexican food. There are other options that won't leave me feeling like they're doing me the favor of letting me order from them.
