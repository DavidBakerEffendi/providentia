As many times we have visited Petite Abeille, we've only had coffee there. But whenever we come in, service is absolutely great, and the restaurant is just beautiful. The reason why I keep coming back is there espresso drinks are the best in the whole area. Better then waiting in line at the crowded starbucks down the street and for sludge they call coffee. Next time I'm in town ill make it a point to eat a full meal here so i can write a full review!
