I have lived in New York for over 15 years and have dined in many "upscale" restaurants, but Juni really takes the cake. Not only is the food beautifully plated, it is also amazingly delicious and surprisingly filling. My boyfriend and I both knew that we would be doing the four course tasting menu, but after looking at photos of the portion sizes, I was convinced that I would need to stop at a McDonalds afterwards in order to feel satiated. I was wrong. Everything was prepared to perfection and the service was incredible. Very friendly and knowledgeable waiters. Would recommend many times over.
