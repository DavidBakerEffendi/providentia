I really, really, really love this place for brunch. The service is prompt, friendly, and don't appear to be rushing even considering the place is packed. Everything I have ordered comes out correct and seemingly perfectly seasoned. This weekend I had the tofu scramble and had the bottle of hot sauce ready to go, but there was no need! This will be on the list of places to go when I don't feel like cooking at home.
