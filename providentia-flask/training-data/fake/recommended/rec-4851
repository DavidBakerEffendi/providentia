I ended up going to Almaz only because it was Restaurant Week and I didn't feel like spending a small fortune for dinner. Though i was annoyed I ended up there by default, in the end it turned out to be serendipitous  because I otherwise would have overlooked this gem. The food was absolutely  delicious- full of flavor and since everything's stewed in spices it's relatively healthy. The service was also prompt and wonderful. I definitely will definitely be back there again.
