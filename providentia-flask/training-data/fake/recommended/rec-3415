This place is tiny, but SO worth it. The food was absolutely wonderful...three different toppings (plus syrup) came with the divine Sweet Potato Pancakes. My sweetie and I shared and there was no issue made of it. Not to mention the service...it was totally on point. I felt like a princess. We'll DEFINITELY be back.
