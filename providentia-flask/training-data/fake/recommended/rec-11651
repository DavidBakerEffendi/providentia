Came here with my work team, I think it is hard to get a reservation, and the place isn't that big; however, the food was excellent, service is good, and prices are reasonable for NYC.  Will definitely return.  Its kinda in a touristy area, but the atmosphere is nice and they have a list of different wines for $25 a bottle which is great.
