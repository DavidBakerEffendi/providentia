I have visited Elbow Room twice since coming to the area. The first time was a Tuesday and the roof top bar had quick service and was enjoyable.  The second time was a Friday and the roof top bar was overcrowded and too loud, which is understandable for a Friday evening.  The service at the bar was also slow and they could add an extra bar tended. I tried to make a reservation for the roof deck seating.  When I made it I was told the roof top seating was only listed as a preference and not guaranteed, but that there are rarely waits with reservations.  To my surprise, the wait for our roof top preference seating was 45 minutes to an hour and a half.  We chose to sit out front instead. The food was solid but I have gotten just appetizers both times.
