Alas...I just went there a few days ago and I was sorely disappointed.  Something was definitely wrong. Been coming here for countless times in the last 7 years or so, and not as often since I moved away in the last 2 years.  My husband is from Malaysia and I really really enjoy authentic Malaysian food.  We decided long time ago that Nyonya was the most authentic, most all-around malaysian restaurants in the US that we've tried (which includes places in NY, philadelphia, DC, and SF bay area.)  Cleanliness of the place seemed always questionable but I forgave you because I really liked your food! I was happy to pay a visit again while I was on my business trip to NY, and the food was not the same.   AT ALL.  I ordered my favorites, char kway teow and lady finger belachan (yes, they are mismatched but i had to have them.)  I asked for kway teow extra spicy; but it came super mild and bland (did they even put any kechap manis?).  The only flavor it had was white pepper which was waaaaaaaay too much.  It tasted like a fried noodle from a bad chinese restaurant.  Belachan was much less spicy and oily compared to what it used to be.  Why water down?  I thought New Yorkers can appreciate the true, authentic flavors? I used to love you, nyonya.  Why the change??  Why???  I hope you'll get your act together to bring the amazing cuisine of malaysia to america like you used to.
