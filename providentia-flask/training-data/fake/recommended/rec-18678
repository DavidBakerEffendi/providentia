The fantastic The noodles: definitely authentic hand pulled awesomeness. Chewy, perfect! I tried the knife cut and the hand pulled. Tiny amount of meat, but it's nyc, can't expect something this cheap to have even a reasonable amount of meat. The not so fantastic The dumplings: doubt the skin is handmade because it doesn't have that chewy biteness to it. The price is totally cheap but so is purchasing a bag from the freezer of the nearest Asian grocery store. The dumplings from Prosperity are way better. I tried the stir fried version of their noodles, very good wok hei! Had a spoonful of a friend's beef stew. Definitely rich and very beefy, like a good pho broth, but since I don't like that fatty beef taste I will not be trying it again. edit (1/29/11): adding half a star for allowing the option of stir frying their noodles. Realised after trying Super Taste's noodles tonight that the way to keep your hand pulled / knife cut noodles chewy is by keeping them out of soup!
