My first visit to Fare was on a rainy Saturday, competing with the house of horrors at Eastern State Penitentiary for nearby parking. We eventually found a spot not too far away. The doorman took our umbrellas and remembered which ours were on the way out. Nice. They have done a good job with the decor - modern fixtures, earth tones, accented by pops of color - very now. Instead of bread a small serving of hummus with tasty green olives and pita was delivered to our table - for the amount of hummus they could provide twice as much pita, but it is a nice way to whet the appetite. As for what we ordered - the farmhouse flatbread was delicious, if overpriced for what you get. The pasta bolognese with wild boar and dark chocolate was a bit of a letdown - the pasta had a nice texture, but there was no trace of chocolate that I could tell. For entrees, the avocado crab cakes were as good as everyone has said, with a sweet and spicy chili glaze on top. The bison was really not a burger, served open faced on top of thin slices of bread and tomato - with lemon herb yogurt that made me feel it was closer to a "bison gyro" in the end. Delicious nonetheless, served with potatoes cooked in a tomato sauce, and tasty green beans with onion. The french fries with truffle oil and parmesan were a hit, also a large enough portion to share. For desert (see pics) it was the dessert trio, which changes regularly - tonight a combination of the dark chocolate torte, apple cake, and cr√®me brulee. Also the special, a goat cheese cheesecake in a caramelized sugar shell with ice cream and port wine soaked pears. Very good. This is the kind of restaurant that Philly needs, and the food was inventive and tasty, hence the five stars. I'm not sure it provided for me the exceptional experience that 5 stars should require, but 4.5 is not an option. Definitely a place worth returning to nonetheless. No complaints about service, and my kind of fare.
