Just to let people know I love their sorbet and their sweets, but not so much in everything else.  The place is too cramp, and I wasn't happy with the foie gras.  It was already spread on top of my toast.  I was expecting a slice of terrine.  I ordered a pan bagnat because Im still hungry, but it was just a tuna sandwich without mayo--what a huge ripoff.  At least could have put some herbs, shallots and lemon juice, and instead it was just tuna from a jar.  I have had a better pan bagnat elsewhere, and I spent less than what they have charge me.
