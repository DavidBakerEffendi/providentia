This is for service only as we didn't stay for the food (yeah -- I hate it when people rate for service only, but it has to be done). My boyfriend's parents are in town so we decide to head to Clinton St Baking for dinner.  We show up at 7:45 on a friday.  As they don't take reservations, we knew there would be a wait. The hostess takes our name and says it should be about 30 minutes.  The place was already packed with people standing around -- but luckily when we came in, the people standing by the counter leave so we have room to wait without being in the way. After about 30 minutes, my boyfriend asks how much longer.  The hostess responds she doesn't know as people are still eating (which is very helpful.  And by "very helpful" I mean not helpful at all).  She then tells him that she can't have us standing around.  She asks us to wait outside or across the street --- she will text us when our table is ready.  A few things to note:  1) Had she told us we could be texted when our table was ready we would have given her our number when we walked in 2) We were the only people standing in the restaurant and very much out of the way 3)  we were told we couldn't stand 30 minutes after -- well -- after standing around waiting for a table. We left -- and we obviously went to one of the 50 other restaurants that are in a 5 block radius of this place.  I'm not sure how to manager can be OK with the hostess suggesting that two people in their 60s stand outside in the cold. Anyway -- I heard their pancakes are amazing, but I will sooner bust out the Ms. Butterworth's.
