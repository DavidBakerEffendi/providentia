Great find. ...con't from my Whole foods review. After being pretty much disgusted with my visit to whole foods, and really longing for some sushi after my police run in, I drove the two blocks and found a spot right outside the front door. Bonus. I ordered the the tartare trio but was disappointed I couldn't get it to go. So I ordered it there and sat while they made the rest of my order - salmon carpaccio and hamachi crudo. While I loved all of my dishes, I was disappointed that I had to ask for sriracha to add to the spicy tuna. I'm really never a fan of this way of making spicy tuna/salmon/etc, theirs was way underspiced. Â However when I added my desired amt of sriracha to it, it made it one of the best I'd had. I'll definitely drive past Whole Foods to get to this gem.
