Review for coffee and dessert only After a long day of walking, shopping and drinking, we made our way into MB's to get a cappuccino. Id never been into a MB before but the place was really neat and packed on a Saturday around 330pm. The cappuccino was very good and came with pieces of chocolate. We saw this other couple order a smores plate and decided we would come back the following day and try it out. Next day arrives and we ordered the smores plate which arrived with its own iron firepit, 4 dipping sauces, marshmallows and graham crackers. This is the best restaurant smores ive had by far. Other places that ive seen try and do this just didnt impress me. This was very good and the chocolate syrup and peanut butter sauces went great with the finished sandwich. Id definitely try this place out if you have a sweet tooth!
