The pulled pork is really delicious and the cornbread is excellent and they have a lot of interesting side dishes ... and I happen to be in a good mood, so let's say it's a 4. Now if you ask me about the pricing, color me confused.  I'm partial to the pulled pork and that is probably a good thing because if I wanted to sample the other barbecue stuff I might be pulled to their 2 or 3 or 4 meat combinations, each of which must just add on another full meal at an escalating price.  All of their combo and family-style stuff looks to be cheaper if you just went after the components.  That and the small dessert portions scare me.
