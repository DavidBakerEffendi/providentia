terrible customer service, rude cashiers, long lines, no parking, I got a "whiz wit" and it was terrible, no flavor, TOO EXPENSIVE! $9 who are they kidding! seriously we got three sandwiches two fries and two drinks for like $45 WTF! definitely will not eat here again, it's just minute steak on a bun I can make that at home!
