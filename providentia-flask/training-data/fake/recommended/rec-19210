Using a touch screen to order? Genius! I'm a picky eater so being able to choose exactly what I wanted and not having to worry about anything unwanted in there was a plus. Also, for those who gets flustered when being asked too many questions at the cashier, you're okay! Everything seemed fresh and healthy, wasn't a heavy lunch overall. Great concept, good food. Finally glad I got to taste this place!
