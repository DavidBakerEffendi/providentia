I was here for the first time last Thursday for a Brew & Chew event, and I really enjoyed myself. First of all, this place is way bigger than it looks from the outside. And it's not just one bar, it's a whole bunch of little bars in this neat little maze- sort of like a fun house, but with bars. The food was good. I also appreciated how accommodating they were to my food allergy by making me an item different from the one on the already set menu for the event. As always, the beers they featured were of course delicious. The staff I encountered here were all very pleasant and professional. I will definitely plan on coming to more Brew & Chews here as well as stopping in for a drink when I'm in the neighborhood.
