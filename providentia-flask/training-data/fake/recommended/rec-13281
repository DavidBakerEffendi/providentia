I have always seen the line at this cart on any given night, but never had the opportunity to try it. After a big lunch, the fiancee and I weren't really in the mood for dinner until later in the evening. Then the hunger it and there was only one thing I wanted. Halal. The line for this stuff should be twice as long around the clock. Had the chicken and gyro over rice. We got it to go and the fiancee had the audacity to question the amount of white sauce I loaded into our bag. Minutes later, she literally ate her words as she was dumping the last of the white sauce onto her meat and rice. The hot sauce is not to be trifled with. A little will do you good, unless you're a psychopath who likes to be chemically burned by your food. Then by all means, load up on it. For $6, this stuff is so delicious and so filling, that it would be hard to find a better value in the City.
