Back in town visiting friends since leaving Burlington a few years ago, and must say that Mirabelle's just never fails to disappoint!  This place is amazing, their food is delicious, their coffee delightful (maple latte anyone?), and I took about 4 million baked goods to go at the end to bring back to friends in DC.... who hear so much about Burlington's amazing food scene without being able to taste it for themselves. Just go to Mirabelle's, and enjoy every second.  It's impossible not to love.
