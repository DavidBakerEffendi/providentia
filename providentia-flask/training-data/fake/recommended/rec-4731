Went here today on the way back to the plant from a meeting. I was hungry and have passed by this place numerous times. It is not much to look at from the street but I thought it might be one of those places that "knocks your socks off" with the food. Wrong!! My cheese steak was small (compared to the roll) and they used some kind of cheese sauce in a Â squeeze bottle. On a positive note, the lettuce and tomato were fresh as well as the onion rings. Fair warning - the ketchup and hot sauce are both in identical containers and you should have no difficulty in figuring out which one ended up on my sandwich. Unless you are really hungry and don't mind being crowded into a small space (5 or 6 seats at counters - tops) you can pass this place by the next time you are in town.
