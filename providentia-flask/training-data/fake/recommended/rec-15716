Ate here for dinner. Intimate atmosphere with a romantic feel. I had the duck breast which was good but not the best I've had (prefer duck breast at French restaurants). Boyfriend had the pappardelle al ragu which was delicious! Would definitely recommend this dish. The ragu sauce had a tomato cream base and another flavor I just could not put my finger on! Really tasty!
