This is a great Italian market and a great experience.  It can be on the pricey side at the restaurants, however, an easy way around that is to order from the mini stations that serve focaccia (bothy meat and veggie) that ranged about $3.00 for a huge piece or their is a place that serves sandwiches for an average of $7-8 a pice.  Also, try the gelato.  ( the gelato cone is $1 cheaper then the single scoop, so I went with the cone and was very happy). The only thing I was unhappy about, is they do not give samples of the gelato and I was torn between 2 flavors (pistachio or hazelnut) and the service counter was not very helpful. I went with the hazelnut and was very happy with the creamy texture and richness of the gelato.   This was my second visit, and the first visit was very good as well, however definitely pricey.  I had the pizza and a pasta dish, both done very well.  I wouldn't go there out of my way to eat  an $18 pasta dish, which is about standard there.  If local, possibly pick up some fresh made pasta and sauce and make it yourself at home.
