Remember in 'My Best Friend's Wedding' when Rupert Everett's George flamboyantly declared, "Love the bag, love the shoes, love everything"?  I sure do, and I'd like to edit the exuberant phrase for Yorkside thus: Love the pizza, love the service, love everything.  Ok, obviously I'm not feeling particularly creative (I'm just so full from York Street Noodle House, cf. review), but hopefully you'll take away from this review that I positively love Yorkside Pizza.  The pizza is some of the best I've ever had, and the atmosphere is comfy-casual, perfect for a nice group outing.  The service was impeccable, so the whole experience was truly enjoyable.
