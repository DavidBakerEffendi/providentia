Corner Bistro - where basic betches go for basic burgers.  Really basic burgers is just about the perfect description for the burgers at Corner Bistro. I've had this place bookmarked for quite a while before finally visiting with my boyfriend and a couple of his bros.  All I've heard about CB was that they had "NY's best burgers" for pennies.  The pennies part was right - under $10 for a sit-down meal is kind of unheard of, especially in  that area.  However, I'd have to disagree with the "NY's best burgers" claim... the cheeseburger wasn't the worst burger I've ever had, but it definitely was not the best.  Not even close. The Bistro Burger here was probably the most standard cheeseburger + bacon you'll find in town - it reminded me of the kind you make in your backyard on the grill back in the suburbs... except I slightly prefer those over these.  Yes, they were cheap, but I might pay more for a more significant burger of a larger size somewhere else.  The fries were also very standard and not hot or crispy enough for me. The wait on a Saturday evening wasn't as bad as I thought.. maybe 15 minutes or so for a party of 5.  You basically show up and stand in line and wait to be seated.
