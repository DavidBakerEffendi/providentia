4 stars.  This was one of the better tapa places that I've experienced in the city.  We had the following courses: Croquetas de Jamon paquetitos de jamón pinchos morunos (lamb skewers) chorizo al jerez chanquetes en adobo Skirt steak special with white beans Dessert: Leche fritta All of these courses were tasty!  I especially enjoyed the lamb skewers, croquetas and skirt steak special.  The lamb and skirt steak was cooked to perfection.  To top it off, the Leche fritta dessert was also yummy!  The place has a great ambience and service was excellent.  I would definitely go back in the future and recommend to others.
