I love The Smith for its great food, great atmosphere, rave reviews, so why not try Jane? Jane is no Smith. My friend's burger was overcooked, and the fries were wilted. My omelette was nothing to write home about. The only thing it had going for it was the waitress, who was very attentive. With 100 Acres just around the corner, don't waste your time here.
