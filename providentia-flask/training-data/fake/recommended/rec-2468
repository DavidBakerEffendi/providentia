Pat's is everything you ever expected of a Philly cheese steak sandwich. I can see how there might be some smaller, lesser known, local establishments that the folks of Philly have hidden elsewhere, but the truth is that I recommend giving Pat's a try at least once. If we all agree that there are check boxes that must be completed in life, Pat's King of Steaks in definitely on that list. I cannot avoid discouraging people from going to the competition, Geno's, across the street. They have begun a bigoted "Speak English" campaign that is insulting. Speak with your dollars, and order in any language you like at Pat's. I wish I had a site other than Fox News to site: foxnews.com/story/0,2933â€¦
