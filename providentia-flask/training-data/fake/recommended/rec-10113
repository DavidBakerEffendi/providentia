As someone of Middle Eastern heritage, i was a bit hesitant but the food is interesting and tasty and truly Middle Eastern but with an edge, as are the drinks. Get there for happy hour 5:30 - 7 :30 on weekdays, sit at the bar and try the "from Beirut with Passion" it will soon become your favorite cocktail and only a mere $7!! ( during happy hour)
