"Cozy" atmosphere as some would call it. "Rustic" feel due to the furniture/decor. Ciopinno didn't impress me, as my half lobster came out half raw. The broth was great, sort of tomato-like. Wish it came with some crostino to dip in it. Scallops & shrimp were both kind of overcooked and chewy. Ironic.....since my lobster was not fully cooked. For $25, I wish it came with something else on the side. The bread & dip for starters was amazing. Must be the garlic & oil mixed together. Skate wing tasted allright, but I'm not an expert on fish so I couldn't tell if it was good or not. It came with mashed potatoes & string beans. It annoyed me that the menu was written on paper on the wall, I had to keep turning my head to read it, I'm accustomed to menus given in the form of a book. Sadly, I left here hungry.
