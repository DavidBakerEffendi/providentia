I'm really digging their pizza. And their french fries were cooked perfectly. There is nothing worse than limp french fries. Their fries were crispy with a little salt added. The pizza had a perfect cheese to sauce ratio. It was a little oily, but not to the point where oil was dripping off the end of the slice. The lady that took our order was nice, and laughed at the jokes my coworker made about me. But it was all in good spirit. What made the visit best was the fact that they had air conditioning.  Esp since it is close to 90° outside. Their pizza is better than some of the close competition pizza places nearby. Will be back again.
