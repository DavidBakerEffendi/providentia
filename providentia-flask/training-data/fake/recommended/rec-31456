We were looking for a new gf place and had never realized this place was here, was very excited to hear they had gf french toast. It's a small quaint place, and you have to ask for the gf menu. ITS HUGE. We decided the share the pb and banana stuffed french toast and chocolate chip waffle. To say it was good is an understatement. Both were freaking incredible. You couldn't tell either were gf which is quite a feat. I'm depressed I flew back to Cali before I got to try more of the food, and will def be back whenever I'm in town.
