Kinda just found this place bc we were hungry after a broadway show but sooo happy we did. I've been to the famous NYC pizza places but honestly think this is the best pizza in NYC. This is a small joint in time sq. They also have a family restaurant for sit down service a block away so disregard the reviews about it not having seating bc it's not meant to. Must try if u love pizza. But note this place is good for slices. If u want to sit down n enjoy then go to their restaurant.
