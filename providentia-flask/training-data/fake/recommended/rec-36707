seriously. what is all the buzz about!? eggs benedicts, schmenedicts. personally, i thought the hollaindaise sauce was too thick and i honestly expected more quality/presentation/taste/better service/ambiance out of this place after hearing all the hype of dining at "THE BALTHAZAR". $20 for mediocre eggs benedicts? hm. instead, i wish i had spent that money on a vogue, chai tea, and a thin crust pizza. oh well.
