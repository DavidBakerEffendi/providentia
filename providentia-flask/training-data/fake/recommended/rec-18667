consistently great.  food is simple and packed with flavor and amazingly fresh ingredients.  usually a wait, but worth it.  there's a bar next door where you can have a cocktail while you wait for your table (or bar stool).  great vibe and decor too, especially in summer when you can dine in the back yard.
