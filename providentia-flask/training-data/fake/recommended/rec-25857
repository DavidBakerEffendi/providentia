300th review, ladies and gentlemen... here it is: I came with a small group for dinner, which we were immediately seated for. They brought out some crispy homemade potato chips. For dinner, we had an assortment of entrees. I had the salmon with a pistachio crust and truffle mashed potatoes. Also at the table was a steak, pulled pork sandwich, and roasted chicken. All were delicious, but I can mostly speak for the salmon. Our server was really sweet and said that people came from out of town just to have the salmon. I'm not sure that I would, but it was definitely tasty. Service was wonderful, and although we did not order small plates it seems like a place where you could go and have a few meze shared between a group.
