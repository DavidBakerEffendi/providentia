My boyfriend and I decided to dry this place out for a little Saturday afternoon dim sum.  It's a basement restaurant, so it's a little dark. It may be also a little intimidating because most of the patrons seem to be Asian and no one was speaking English. However, the waitress was lovely and explained every dish. My boyfriend...do the soup dumplings come in soup? Well how do they get the soup in there?! They were very good by the way. I'm in love with the gyoza.  The chicken noodle soup was delicious, but the portion is HUGE. It took me 2 days to finish it. We will definitely be back.
