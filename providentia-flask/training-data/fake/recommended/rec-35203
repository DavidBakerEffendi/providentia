For a year now I've walked by wondering about this place.  Noticed the inviting smell but also the long lines, strange lighting and ugly decor.  Wondered whether the food could be worth it.      FInally tried it last night.   Here is what I learned.   The burger comes alone on a plate, the default is medium rare.   Calories are listed on the menu like a fast food place which i appreciate. you order fries separately,  we got the fried pickles and sweet potato fries. It is pricey but I thoroughly enjoyed by burger and my beer (a pint of stout)   I did not like it that they cover the sweet potato fries in sugar.  I really like to have yams savory and wouldnt have ordered them if I knew they would be covered in sugar. Desert (more sugar) was pie with salted caramel icecream The icecream was great.  The pie was good - though by that time I had eaten so much sugar on my fries that it was harder to enjoy dessert.   I will return again and try more stuff  - the salads looked good.  I will skip the sweet potato fries.
