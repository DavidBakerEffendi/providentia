My first thought was ... Urban Outfitters restaurant? Not. But the food won me over. Really innovative flavors, presented beautifully in a gorgeous space. Loved the open kitchen and we watched the staff like a performance. I went with 3 other friends and we tried a bunch of things. Bacon wrapped matzoh balls, GLT sandwich, Pea salad (my favorite) and sweet breads coated in falafel (amazing). The chewy carrots were outstanding, so was the Banh Mi Poutine. We also loved the upstairs roof bar- so chill. On the negative, not quite up to speed on the service but they just opened. I will def go back.
