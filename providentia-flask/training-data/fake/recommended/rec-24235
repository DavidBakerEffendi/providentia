Family style Italian BYOB.  We have walked past this restaurant many times but when friends were in town we decided to head in.  When you first walk in, it's a small restaurant and space is limited.  But once we were settled in our seat and they accomodated our group of seven, we hardly felt cramped.  The waitstaff was friendly, knowledgeable and super attentive ( I like that).  When it came to ordering there were so many great choices we couldn't decide, so we all tried to order something different so we can sample from each other.  And the dessert, oh my, there were so many excellent options. We will definitely be heading back to order more items from the menu and experience the wonderful atmoshere.
