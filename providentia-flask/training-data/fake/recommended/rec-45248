amazing tea. but you always run out of goat cheese croissants. Those goat cheese bundles of heaven are what makes visiting my sister a little less boring. Peace on earth tea and the Sage Woman teas are lovely! the baristas are always friendly and the food is tasty. JUST PLEASE STOCK MORE GOAT CHEESE CROISSANTS!!!
