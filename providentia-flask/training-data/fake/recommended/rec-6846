We had dinner reservations at the Pines last week.   We started with the BEEF TARTARE.  It is topped with sea urchin. We shared the FAVA BEAN salad.  I am a carnivore.  I hate vegetables and I don't even like lamb.  This was really good.   KELP UDON.  Also topped with uni. BORSA VUOTA was my favorite dish of the evening.  So good!  I think it is a mushroom pasta.  Very flavorful and rich. CULOTTE STEAK We split the Rubarb for dessert.  This wasn't my favorite dessert but it worked well as a palette cleanse and was perfect for this meal. We maybe have ordered one dish too many.  But everything was pretty perfect from cocktails to our waiter.  I can't wait to go back again and try everything else.
