WOW... WOW ... WOW. This is place is most certainly WOW worthy. I came for lunch on Monday expecting a mediocre meal...and I left completely satisfied. First off... $6.75 for Salmon Teriyaki? Did I misread the price? I must've... Wait, what? That also includes a miso soup AND a salad? Alright, stop your games. Shockingly though, Iron Chef House wasn't playing games. Oh, yeah, I forgot they also serve that salmon teriyaki with a side of rice or noodles and over a bed of mixed veggies. Yeah, I know.. too good to be true. But wait, there's more... They didn't just give me a small piece of salmon, no, they gave me a whole salmon steak. How often is it that you get served a dinner + sized meal at lunch prices in Cobble Hill? Really? I'm still amazed by the portion to price ratio. But size doesn't matter... taste, presentation, service... they matter. (Ha, who am I kidding - size is pretty important too!) The food not only was a ridiculous amount, but it tasted great too. The salmon teriyaki wasn't drowning in sauce and furthermore the salmon wasn't overcooked. The rice to sauce ratio was superb. The vegetables consisted of a nice assortment of asparagus, squash, carrots, broccoli, and celery. The salad's ginger dressing wasn't watery and the greens were fresh and crisp. The miso soup had chunks of tofu... ... this is exactly the lunch spot I was searching for when my company shipped me off to Downtown Brooklyn this past summer. I almost don't want to post this review in fear that my new favorite hot spot will be overrun by mangy hipsters. Please don't overrun it... I beg this of you, whomever you may be... WOW.
