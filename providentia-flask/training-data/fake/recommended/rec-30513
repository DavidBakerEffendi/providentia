Fun place! It's trending...and hard to get into but worth it. Had the Sriracha Bloody Mary (I think it was Sake) and it was delish. Also the fried Chinese Peppers - amazing! Love the ramen noodle bar decor and the loud staff yelling in Japanese. LOVED the Tofu Salad with sesame dressing - so good! I had the vegetarian Wasabi Shoyu Ramen and it was good and tasty with a rich broth but not as rich as I would have liked. I know it's hard to do without a meat based broth.
