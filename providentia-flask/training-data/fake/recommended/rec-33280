Went on a Sunday early afternoon before a BAM performance and was delighted! Had Raspberry Mimosa, Savory Parmesan Toast w. perfectly poached eggs and a flavorful, creamy hollandaise. The "toast" was kind of eggy and a bit bland for my taste though. Also had cappuccino. Very colorful, relaxed atmosphere w. attentive, kind waiter. Chair was a bit uncomfortable; I was seated several inches below my companion who was sitting opposite me on the bench so it felt awkward. Otherwise, def planning on returning. Would love to try dinner and/or tapas dishes and their White Sangria!
