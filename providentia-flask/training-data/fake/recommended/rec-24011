what a waste of money. i literally just threw my 'dinner' in the trash - it would have saved a bunch of steps if i had just flushed my $35 down the toilet instead. i guess that's what i get for telling my well-meaning husband to get 'whatever' for dinner. goat cheese salad - inedible. 10,000 pine nuts tossed in some mixed greens, which overcooked and way-too-large chunks of roasted pepper and portobella mushroom. guacamole with crabmeat? not really sure how they invented this one but both are better by their lonesome. i hear new wave cafe serves alcohol, though (note the sarcasm??), but i wouldn't bother going back there. philly's got to raise the bar....
