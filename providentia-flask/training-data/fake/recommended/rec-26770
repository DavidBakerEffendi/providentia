Yes I do like if for their beer selection, fine tv view, friendly beer servers,little above average for sandwhich, since that is only food I have had there.  They must get rid of those looking bad shoe string fries and bring in some monster streak fries.  Also make sure the fries are defrosted and cooked too.  Also great when all doors are open and it is warm outside.
