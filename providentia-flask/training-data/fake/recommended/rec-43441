I'm going to have to break with the crowd here.  A group of us went there and split several appetizers before ordering our own entrees.  I had the Room Service Pad Thai which, to the unintiated, is this rather massive set of piping hot noodles with seafood, wrapped in egg whites, and topped with shredded papaya strips and garnished with an orchid. The food itself was not bad at all.  Frankly, the portions were just about on par with the price.  Based on that alone, I'd have given this place at least four stars.  No, the problem came long after I'd eaten.  The problem was of the unsettled stomach variety, if you catch my drift.  That was the only thing I'd had aside from a beer and a drink later in the evening.  Maybe it was a fluke, but I can't say I'd willing get the same thing again. Also, the dishes came out surprisingly quick.  Almost suspiciously quickly.  Hopefully they didn't have stuff just sitting around warming before bringing it out for us.
