I went for lunch last week with my coworkers. Overall, I thought the food was okay but not great, and not what I expected from all the hype. Most of us had the three pasta lunch which came with a salad or antipasto. Those who ordered the salad received their own portion on their plate. However, those of us who ordered the antipasto received one large plate that we all had to share. It was a bit uncomfortable trying to share a dish that didn't have an equal amount of the various items. I wouldn't have ordered the antipasto if I knew it was served family style. As to the pasta dishes, I enjoyed the mushroom stuffed ravioli, but I didn't like the fusilli with a meat sauce. It had no flavor at all. In addition, one person at the table ordered the fried mozzarella appetizer which looked very small, dry and unappealing. Given that it wasn't too crowded at lunch, I was surprised at how long it took them to bring more pasta for those at the table who had asked for more.
