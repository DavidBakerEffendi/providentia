I have heard that this place invented the deep-fried hot dog.  Hey, it's been here for 80 years, so that doesn't seem unlikely.  It's an amazing sight--when your hot dog is first served, it's plump from the expanding air trapped inside the casing.  After a minute or so, it shrinks to normal size.  The hot dogs are delicious with the truly unique homemade relish and some brown mustard.  I ordered a side of fries and was served fries with gravy by (happy) accident.  The fries are cooked to perfection, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  My total for two dogs, an order of fries and a small soda was about $6, which is very reasonable.  I can definitely see why people have liked this place for the past 80 years.  I'll take it over annoyingly hip places like Crif Dogs any day. If you're going on a true Jersey Junk Food Expedition, try to visit both Rutt's Hut and White Mana on the same day.
