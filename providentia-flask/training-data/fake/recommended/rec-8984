In homage of Hakata Ton Ton, may I proffer a haiku: cold weather calls for Kyushu comfort food - who knew hot pot equals joy? In terms of the freshness of their ingredients, portion sizes, and attentiveness of the waitstaff, Hakata Tonton is one of the best values in the city.  True, the restaurant is tiny.  True, reservations are scarce so you are often forced to choose between dining like senior citizens (6 PM) or rock stars (10:30 PM).  But hey, it's worth it.
