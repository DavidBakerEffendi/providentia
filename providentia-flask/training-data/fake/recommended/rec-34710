Great tasting lunch place. If you are looking for very spicy Indian food, however, you might not be as pleased.  I didn't think the India roll upgrade would make much of a difference but after i accidentally ordered it I haven't switched back to regular rolls since.  The extra dollar per roll is worth it. ORDER FOR PICKUP. There is always a long line and unless you want to wait 15 minutes to order then wait for another 10 to get it, the pickup option is best for you.
