Absolutely delicious!  Went with my boyfriend and we had the beet and goat cheese salad, caesar salad and misto frito for appetizers.  The caeasr salad was superb - the toast points had anchovy paste, romaine was super crisp and refreshing, delicious parmesan, and the dressing was perfect!!   For dinner we had the hangar steak with frites and the mushroom encrusted chicken with pea risotto - OMG: perfectly cooked steak, amazingly tender and juicy chicken, crispy fries, bernaise sauce smooth, truffled risotto, perfect peas and the cocktails were perfectly made.  The atmosphere was lively and relaxing. We left sated and happy.  I definitely recommend it!
