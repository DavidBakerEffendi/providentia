Love this place!  I went here due to all the good reviews and it was worth it.  The wait for a table was kind of long, but the hostess was nice enough to take down our phone number and gave us a call when she thought our table might be ready....that was super cool of her. When we did finally get our table, the noodles were awesome.  The menu is pretty limited, but I think they just try and focus on a few items and do them well.  Finally, our waitress was super cool being super friendly.  Since we were tourists, she even gave us a recommendation for some cool bars in the area.  Overall, it was a great experience.
