Irish coffee and Taramisu pastry are the bomb, perfect combo!! I've live in this neighborhood for 25 years, and it was my first time trying their coffee next door their cafe. Lets say I was pretty bummed when I ordered my latte and found out after putting my order they also serve Irish coffee, my fave! Â Their latte was regular, but definitely fell in love with their Irish Coffee, brought me back to autumn days, it does have a distinct alcohol taste, my bf thought it wasn't sweet enough, but the kalhuna* (coffee liquor) made it sweet enough for me.
