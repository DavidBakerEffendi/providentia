Hands down, the best falafel I've ever had. Really authentic, delish, my mouth is watering while typing this. I'm also a HUGE fan of their spinach rolls. A vegetarian's dream. The atmosphere is cozy, dimly lit and mellow. I'm not sure anything has changed there since the 70s, including the prices. It's unbelievable that you can get this quality food for so little money. Mmmmm.... Mamouns.
