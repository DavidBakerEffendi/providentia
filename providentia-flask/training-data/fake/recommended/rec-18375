I went for a burger yesterday. I got the fried chicken burger. It was excellent. The ambiance is hip and laid back, making use of all reclaimed products. The small bar is nice and the beer selection solid. The only downside is that they play cartoons on the tv at the bar. This would be appropriate if the restaurant was in a family neighborhood, but it's not. Â The manager changed the channel to football upon request and said its the companies policy to have cartoons on unless someone asks otherwise.
