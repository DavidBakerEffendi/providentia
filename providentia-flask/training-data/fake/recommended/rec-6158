This is by far THE best Greek restaurant I have ever been to and I have been to tons on the east coast. I decided on a traditional entree I never had before. The Pastitsio dish. It's like Greek lasagna. I've seen others make this and it didn't look anywhere as good as mine. Perfect sized portion with amazing taste. Our sides and dessert were also phenomenal. Pylos was so good, I didn't care what the bill said.  We will definitely be going back here.  Their tzadiki should be a national treasure.
