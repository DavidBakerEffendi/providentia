Cute little Italian place, two  doors down on Prince Street from where my parents first lived when they came to the US.  The phantom nostalgia I feel from being in this area, already gave me good vibes as I walked through the door of this little eatery. Both times, we've been greeted by friendly hosts and seated promptly.  The food is incredibly yummy, recommending any pasta dishes or the pizza.  We also had bruschetta, which was very good.  Add a bit of Lambrusco to complete the experience, and it was molto delicioso!   Good service and good food in a great location.  Did I mention how reasonable the prices are?  Hard to find good value AND quality in pricey SoHo.  Try it out with their $10 lunch specials!
