This place was something else.  It has the look of a dive bar but as unique of a menu as you'll find anywhere.  After reading some of the reviews my girlfriend and I decided to stop in for a quick bite for lunch.  As someone who's been in the restaurant business for seven years I can honestly say that the service was extremely friendly and right on point for the entire time we were there.   The beer list was impressive for such a small place.  Lots of variety in bottles and on draft, and the draft list appears to be rotating as well.  The menu even had a list of upcoming drafts, I thought that was pretty nice.  Long list of bottled beers as well, including larger bottles. All of the food was unique in some fashion.  We started with the chicken tenders cordon bleu.  Those were flat out amazing.  Sliced chicken breast wrapped in swiss cheese and ham, and then coated in their house breading and fried.  The mustard sauce on the side really completed the dish.  My girlfriend had the fried tomato BLT, which she said was pretty tasty.  Tomatoes and mayo aren't really my thing so I didn't really try it.  I went with the duck quesadilla, which was very delicious.  The duck was plentiful and tasted very fresh.  It was wrapped with spinach, poblano peppers, and grilled onions with two kinds of cheese.  Crispy texture, but it didn't appear to be fried at all.  They covered it with a roasted tomato and dried cherry salsa and a sprinkle of cilantro.  The salsa was unlike anything I've had before.   I just wish we came for dinner so that we could have experienced more of the menu
