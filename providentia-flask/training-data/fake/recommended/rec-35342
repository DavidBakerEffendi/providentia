Located on Doyers Street, you could easily walk by Tasty Hand-Pulled Noodles without a second glance. It's a hole-in-the-wall kind of place; there is limited seating (only 10 small tables) and there's not much between the tables. But this place is not really about the atmosphere, it's about the food! And the food here is excellent. You'll hear the occasional thwack coming from the kitchen, evidence that your noodles are being freshly hand-pulled. The menu has a great variety of different noodle soups. You can choose different types of noodles; there's hand-pulled, knife peeled, wide noodles, thin rice noodles, fat rice noodles. The possibilities are endless! I tried the beef and beef tendon hand-pulled noodle soup and I loved it. The noodles were perfectly cooked, chewy and fresh. The broth complemented the noodles wonderful. It was flavorful and totally hit the spot. It wasn't too salty; the broth has just the right amount of sodium in it. The beef was tender and yummy. The tendon was also good. The bowl was chock full of scallions and spinach. Overall, a solid bowl of noodles. I approve. The steaming hot bowl of noodles hits the spot on a cold February day. I'll be back to try their dumplings and the rest of their noodle soups!
