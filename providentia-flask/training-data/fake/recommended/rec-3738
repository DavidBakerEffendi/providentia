I'm a Texas transplant to New York, and this is the best Southwestern Mexican (not quite Tex-Mex because of the Santa Fe flair) food in the whole dang city. I just can't get over it. I've never had anything bad. The wait. Yes, the wait is bad. Suck it up and tell your stomach to not be a wuss-- it can wait a little bit longer. Cocktails are stupid Manhattan prices. What can you expect?
