I would give them 0 stars if possible!! This place was no good at all... Meat was dry with no flavor. They were so rude and racist... Can't order if you don't speak English!!! This would not fly in LA and quite frankly I wish they would come to LA and see what customer service is all about. They need lessons and take customer service 101. No sense if urgency. Bread is hard and difficult to chew with dry meat, dry customer service!!! STAY AWAY!!
