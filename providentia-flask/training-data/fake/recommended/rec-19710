My brother and I are visiting from San Diego, CA. We wanted a quick bite before we went to the Empire State Building, so we looked at our hotel list and found this place, looked at Yelp reviews, and made our way here, and boy, are we glad we came!! Aside from the awesome music playing, (Nirvana, Guns 'n Roses, Aerosmith) the food was great!!! EAT THE TOTS, JUST DO IT! We asked for well done burgers and we got WELL DONE BURGERS!!! The whole food experience was fantastic! Pricing is just as fantastic! 1st restaurant experience in NY was a huge success!
