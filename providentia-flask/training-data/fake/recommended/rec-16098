I came here for dinner for the first time and it was pretty freaking great. I like the atmosphere a lot. It's nothing really special or fancy, but it has just that right balance between being nice, clean, comfy, but not pretentious in any way. It's sort of dark and candle-y in a cozy way, and we sat around eating and drinking for almost 4 hours. I had the Belgian Spare Ribs and it was the best ribs I've ever had. I mean, really. I just ate my heart out in Kansas City, and I'm here saying that BXL has the best spare ribs. The meat is so tender that you literally can't pick up the rack - the bone just slips right out and the meat melts into pieces. The marinade is amazing, extremely flavorful but not in that gross, overly-sweet, sticky way that a lot of ribs are. Just right. The portion is ginormous, 2 racks. Plus a heap of fries AND a mixed green salad, so I can trick myself into thinking I'm being healthy before I find myself sopping up the meat juice with every last fry. Sad, but true. For dessert I had the molten chocolate cake with ice cream. It has a fancier name but I can't even pronounce it, much less spell it. It's not the best I've had, but it's very good. The chocolate is dark, rich, and very creamy, melts right in your mouth. Ice cream never hurt anybody. It may kill you eventually, but god what a way to die. Sadly, I didn't get to try the mussels this time, but will come back for that on an all-you-can-eat Monday night.
