I had walked by La Viola numerous times and always wanted to go for dinner, so when I was planning dinner for my 25th birthday,  I called immediately to make my reservation!  I went with a group of about 8, and the place was very accommodating, albeit, cramped.  I'm a huge fan of BYO's, especially as a 20-something who would rather spend my money on a high quality meal that I couldn't prepare myself at home. To start, one of my girlfriends and I started with the antipasta, which was delicious.  When trying to decide which entree to go with (they all looked too good to choose!) I found myself looking around the restaurant to see what other people had ordered and I knew that no matter what I chose I wouldn't go wrong.  I decided on the Lobster Ravioli for dinner, and it was unreal.  Having left my plate completely clean, and celebrating a birthday, we splurged for dessert.  The pumpkin cheesecake was superb, as was the chocolate cake that another friend ordered.   The staff was so friendly, and were so excited to come out and sing happy birthday!  The only downside to this place is that it does get pretty noisy because of the small size and excitable groups that it attracts (birthdays, bachelorette parties, etc)  I felt bad for the young couple that came in for a quiet date night who sat next to us, though La Viola has a location across the street that does seem more suitable for intimate dinners.  I'll have to try it over there next!
