Do or Dine adds something really special to the neighborhood - an actual culinary ADVENTURE.  Eating here is like going on a journey, and it takes you to some really special places. I've been twice - after going the first time, I loved it so much I went back a few days later.  They do things with food you wouldn't expect - I have a sneaking suspicion the menu is the brainchild of some really good chefs, a shit-ton of weed, and some excited yelling of expletives. ("Hey, let's devil an egg with bacon... AND THEN FUCKING TEMPURA BATTER IT AND DEEP FRY IT."  "You know what would make this donut from Dough even better?  FILL IT WITH SOME FUCKING FOIS GRAS.")   Everything I've eaten has been weird, but all the food has ranged from good (the Nippon Nachos, which were just tasty) to the f'ing sublime (the lamb breast appetizer that literally melted in my mouth and was so good I ate it off the bone with my hands, the duck with kiwi sauce that was like a revelation of flavor).  Even the drinks are great - I had the tequila-based Old Fashioned and the whiskey/ginger beer combination, and both fit in to that really-weird-but-really-good place. Is everything on the menu the best thing I've ever eaten?  No.  But they push boundaries, they experiment, they blend flavor and creativity.  Do Or Dine is an original.  Go eat there.  Bring a bunch of friends so you can order as many different things as possible and then share them.  What are you waiting for?  Do it.  Dine.
