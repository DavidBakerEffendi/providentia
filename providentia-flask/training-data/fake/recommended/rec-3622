We decided to come to Bonnie's based upon internet reviews and it's longstanding reputation of having the best and most authentic buffalo wings. Being from central new york, the wings were a big let down.  In addition, the sauce on the wings was extremely generic. As far as roast beef sandwiches go, the "Beef on Weck" is comparable to a disappointing Arby's sandwich.  After tasting it we definitely would not order it again, OR ADVISE ANYONE ELSE TO DO SO. To top it all off, the service was abysmal.  In an empty restaurant around 4 in the afternoon our server decided that their smart phone was more important than the customers waiting for service.  The bus boy picked up some of the slack, but not enough to sway our opinion otherwise. As far as the other reviews go regarding the "great" beer selection, Hooray for stocking a fridge with a bunch of bottled beer, I know I can find somewhere else in Park Slope with more than 3 mediocre draft options.
