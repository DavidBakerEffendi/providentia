Great cheesesteaks, lots of tvs, great beer selection. I had been to their truck in Hoboken before which was good but nothing remarkable. The food at this downtown location is much more impressive. Great bread, great cheese selections and well executed steak and chicken. Lots of options and great fried onions. Try the various kinds of fries and the beer battered onion rings. Great place for lunch or watching a game or a quick pub atmosphere dinner. Good food downtown is sometimes hard to come by. This is a great cheesesteak place that serves drinks... For what it is and tries to be, Shorty's gets 5 stars in my book.
