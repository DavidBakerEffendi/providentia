Great little place. Reminds me of dive bars in New Orleans, except cleaner. Friendly staff, good music selection that goes from goth to rock to 80's to metal. I tried the jambalaya, and while it was not the Louisiana style I was expecting, it was still very good and would recommend anyone wanting something with a little kick to it to order. One more note. The order of jambalaya was large enough for two people.not sure if that's the case with other entrees but you might want to check with the server ahead of time.
