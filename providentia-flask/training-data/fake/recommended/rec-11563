I wish this place wasn't so far downtown, but I absolutely love it! The drinks are amazing, the speakeasy vibe is fun, and it's overall a great time. I prefer to sit upstairs at the bar or a table-you get a complementary drink sample to start and it'll give you the full experience. Love love love this place-open more uptown!
