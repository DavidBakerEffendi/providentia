The flatbread was soggy and I got food poisoning after eating at this place. There was a mouse that ran across the floor of the restaurant Â and when I told the waitress she didn't seem surprised and told me that they have been trying to get that mouse for months!? Buy a mouse trap- it's not that hard! Stay away from this establishment!
