This place is amazing for brunch! So much to choose from, prompt, attentive service and a gorgeous set up. Food was great I had the Eggs Norwegian.. Wow. And my wife had the Eggs Blackstone. Both top notch. Absolutely delicious and fresh. Highly recommended. We went here Sunday around 10:30 and had no problems with the wait ! Highly recommend.
