Growing up with southern parents and grandparents makes a southern cooked meal a little rough for others to compete with. This restaurant is AMAZING. we all had chicken as waffles with a side biscuit with honey butter. When I say that's an amazing meal....it's an amazing meal. Our waiter, Chalky, was super cool. Ohhhhh, the sweet tea needs to be sweeter LOL.
