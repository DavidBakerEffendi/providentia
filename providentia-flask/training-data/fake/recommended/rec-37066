so this is my first review on yelp but i am a food junkie and never really had the need to blog but let me tell you about fat buddha!! this place deserves an high kick and a hooray for food, service and music. i mad last minute reservations for a large bday party and erin the manager was amazing! she was attentive to our parties' needs and although the music was pumping and the dining floor turned into a club she still took care of us.. don't delay..run to fat buddha and bring all your out of towners and friends to this place!!! p.s. it was a friday and the crowd was live and happening...wait the food.....tasty...garlic wings, bimibap( i think i spelled that right) the korean bbq and the veg dumplings on point...thanks fat buddha! see you real soon :))
