pho real ... very creative interpretation of a Vietnamese bowl of soup. don't be confused - it looks like an innocent bodega. they be gettin crazy with their sandwich creations. i'll definitely try something else next time i'm in the area (i'm not totally into vietnamese soup, but you know, i like to try new things). i'd bet that they have another sandwich that is all up in my alley.
