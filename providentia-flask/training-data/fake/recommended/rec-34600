We only went here because the other ramen place had a line I wasnt willing to wait for. When we walked up, there was a sign that said closed. we were soo sad. A guy standing outside told us to go in anyways, maybe theyll still sit us. We said why not. We walked in and sure enough, they put us on the wait list. The wait wasnt long and we got to wait inside (which really helps since it was soo cold outside) We ordered unagi dashi maki, tako wasabi and we both got akamaru modern. We had no clue what we were ordering, but soo glad we did. the tako wasabi was my favorite!! It was addicting andt he wasabi wasnt spicey, it was flavorful. yum! The akaamru modern was very good, never had anything like this in houston. the broth was so good, I still had noodles left when I was done. So glad we went here. The staff is so nice, they come by an explain to you how to eat everything. No onei s rushing you because their about to close.
