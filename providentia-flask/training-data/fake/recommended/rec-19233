Wandering around Philadelphia this morning, we decided to find a place to stop for breakfast.   After reading the reviews and seeing some of the photos, we decided to stop in at Sabrina's and I'm glad we did! The menu was full of tasty choices, but after spying on everyone's plates, we decided to have a half order of the stuffed french toast.   Huge pieces of challah bread stuffed with a yummy vanilla cream sitting in a pond of syrup... it was a beautiful sight to see.   Highly recommend if you are in the area!
