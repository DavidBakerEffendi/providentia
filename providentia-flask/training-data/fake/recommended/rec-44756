You come here for the atmosphere -- loud in a friendly way, young, lively, professional (perfect for entertaining salesmen or brokers). You don't come for the food -- generous but ordinary, even dull (don't get the pate). The service is standard New York, i.e., every waiter is trying to get on a Broadway cast. Having said all that, it's like reviewing Denny's in Butte, Montana: Minetta Tavern is the second best restaurant in Greenwich (after Little Owl).
