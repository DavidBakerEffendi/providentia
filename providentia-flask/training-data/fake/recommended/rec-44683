This place is alright I guess.  Our appetizer was good, scallops.  My husbands entree was good, but we paid an eztra 10 dollars for literally two bites of lobster to come in the pasta.  My entree almost made me sick.  I ordered the venison, which was a 34 dollar dish, opretty expensive even for NYC.  I ordered it cooked the way they recommended it, medium rare.  I am pretty open minded about how well done my food is, but this was just gross.  I trimmed off the outer 1/8 of an inch of meat, the only part that seemed edible, and I ate that.  It was cold in the middle.  Anyways, that being said, it wasn't a horrible meal, just be careful if you order this medium rare. In retrospect I could have sent it back to have them throw it back on the grill for a few minutes. But oh well.  Another thing that bugged me was my wine.  I only got MAYBE 2/3 of a pour.  Perhaps if someone else in my party wants desparately to go here, I would return, otherwise NYC has way too many incredible restaurants to waste another 135 dollars.
