Yo VI's thanks for being awesome! I often come here with my co-workers, based on the night, its different specials. Tuesday is Taco Tuesdays and trivia night. Â $3 dollar tacos, they're pretty good. Chicken, Steak, Shrimp, and Mahi Mahi. Steak is by far the best, it does have a little curry flavor to it. They also have Ladies night on Thursday, half off drinks, apps, and tacos. Besides from their specials, their food is pretty good. Bacon wrapped jalapenos are amazing cant come here without getting them. They also have pretty large selection of Fries/ totes, burgers, salads, etc. Burgers are really good, they offer regular burgers, turkey and veggie. Staff is very nice and likes to get to know their customers. They know a lot about all the beers they offer. Verona Inn, has a huge selection of craft beers. They're are TVs all over the place and music is pretty good. There's a parking lot around back if you can't find anything on the Main Street.
