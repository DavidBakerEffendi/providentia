I'm traveling alone so I sat at the bar. The atmosphere was very cozy and friendly. The bartender was very nice and attentive. The spinach salad was excellent (and huge).  The margherita flatbread was also delicious - the sauce was slightly sweet and very fresh.  By the end of the evening, talking to the bar tender and the folks next to me, I didn't feel like I was there solo. A very nice way for a traveler to feel!
