Can't go wrong here! The burgers are delicious as can be. Order the SHACK STACK!!!!!!!!! Deep fried cheese and portobello mushroom hugging inside a cheese burger! I ordered it twice on my stay in Philly and I will tell you this was the best thing I ate in the whole city that weekend. The bun is so yummy, reminds me of the soft chewy dough of Hawaiian bread. Cheese fries are good, but wish they were hotter in temperature. Service was just alright, but what can you expect from a very busy burger spot. One of the best fast food chains in America!!!
