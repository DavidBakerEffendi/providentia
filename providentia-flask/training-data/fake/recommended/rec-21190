Went on New Year's day and the restaurant was very quiet. They apparently serve unlimited brunch on weekends but we got regular lunch menus. The Lobster tacos we ordered were very good but only four small bite sized ones. Salmon brulee is interesting but a little bland. The fish dish was very good. Pasta with short ribs is very flavorful as well. In general dishes are on the smaller side but good quality.
