Went for a friends 30th birthday dinner. Small for the size group that came ( 9 total) but the food was delicious. The hostess was very accommodating,she sat us when only 5 out of the 7 people were present and when even when 2 more people came , who did not RSVP, she made space for us. Â I decided on the getting the buttermilk fried chicken with waffles and roasted vegetables for a side. I figured you can't mess up the menu item that is the speciality, and i was right... it was DELICIOUS! I had the pecan pie sundae for dessert, that too was delicious, the portion size was enough to share between 3 people. NOTE: You must reserve a table if you plan on doing dinner, if not, you will be waiting hours to be seated or end up eating at the bar.
