The food is below average.  The previous restaurant had the best authentic thai food.  This version is very Americanized.  The hours of the restaurant are not consistent.  I tried ordering a few times and they had closed early.  Food is not consistent. The same dish is made many different ways. This place has  much work in improving itself.  I would recommend a pass.  There are many other much better authentic thai restaurants minutes away.
