The location of this place isn't a real draw as it is in a somewhat-struggling strip mall in the true center of suburbia.  My husband and I went there with the intention to have lunch at 3:30 on a Sunday, however we were told that it is dinner only menu on Sundays as it doesn't open until 2 p.m.   We were the only customers with the exception of two regulars that came in during the latter part of our visit.  Our sushi was definetly better than the others in the immediate area (Edo's Sushi, Sumo Sushi), and my spicy tuna roll in particular was one of the better ones I've had.  The freshness cannot match Ajijei in Princeton, but I've yet to find a place that can.   The atmosphere was dimly lit, nice, contemporary decor similar to Elements Asia on Quakerbridge Rd.   My only complaint, and it did leave me a little miffed, is that we ordered the california roll dinner off the menu, listed as being $12.95 for three rolls and soup or salad.  When the check came, we were charged $14.50.  When I inquired about it, our waitress told me that the menu had been updated, and the new menu is here (pointed to a stack of printed paper menus rather than the fancy hard-backed menus we were given).  Even as I suggested that people not be given the incorrect, outdated menu when being seated, she would not honor the price that their own menu lists.  While the sushi was very good, I left feeling a little p'd off.
