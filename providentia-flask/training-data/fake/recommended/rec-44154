My husband and I ate here and it was fantastic. We ordered the cheese sampler for an appetizer and we shared it. The pieces of cheese were small but delicious. And it was perfect to share. I ordered the Victoria chicken sandwich and my husband ordered the pulled pork po'boy. We were both very happy with our food and neither one of us could find fault with it. The onion rings were out of this world and fries with cheese and gravy were fantastic. We will definitely be back the next time we are in Burlington. The service was great too.
