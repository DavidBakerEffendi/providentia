Decent pizza place. I stop here sometimes for a slice on my way home if it's late and other things are closed, and I'm always happy that I have. I recommend the barbecue chicken pizza, if they have it. A note for the management, if they are reading this: if you have a credit card minimum (which you do!), you need to post it somewhere visible to customers. Most customers don't mind credit card limits (or only mind them a little) when they are clearly posted, but it's *extremely* annoying to be surprised by a credit card limit after you've already ordered: it feels like an aggressive upsell. I'm still giving this four stars, because the pizza is delicious and cheap.
