gross! I should be more specific.   I have been told that the day I went was clearly a bad day; however, the quality was consistent at both Pat's and Geno's.  My boyfriend and I went to pick up a cheesesteak from both Pats and Geno's so as to compare.  EACH of them was cold!!!  the bread was stale and like ripping off a bite of beef Jerky when eating them.  The provolone was cold.  it was like eating a cold roast beef sandwich with no flavor.  Nobody was at either place so i am not sure if we just went on an off day.
