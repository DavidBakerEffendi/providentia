TERRIBLE SERVICE!!! Â My friends threw me a surprise birthday dinner at this Pio Pio. My friends bought me a huge tiramisu cake that feeds 16 people. The waiters cut the cake into tiny slices and served it to 11 of us. We all wanted seconds because it was so delicious and asked the waiter for the rest of the cake. Waiter tells us he saw the pastry chef cut the all of the cake and there was nothing left. We show him a picture of the cake with all 30 lady fingers on it because we each only got one. There was 11 of us and 30 lady fingers so where did the rest go? He goes to the back to "double check" to see what happened. He comes out and says he didn't see the pastry chef cut anything and there were only two pieces of lady fingers left on the cake. First he tells us he saw the pastry chef cut the whole thing and then he says he didn't see anything. Then he goes on saying there were a couple pieces of lady fingers left and they threw it out. Wouldn't it make sense to give the rest of the cake out if there was so little left? It still didn't make sense how 11 of us were only given one lady finger and there's 30 on the whole cake. There was NO WAY the whole cake was given to us. They either ate the rest of the cake or threw it out and tried to lie about it. On top of that they charged us a cake cutting fee!!!!!!!! How ridiculous is that??? How do you throw away or eat someone's cake and then charge them extra for it? It's not about the money but the principle behind it. NEVER BRING YOUR CAKE HERE!! TERRIBLE LYING WAITERS! Pio Pio used to be one of my favorite restaurants! I don't know what happened to them. I am never stepping foot into this location ever again. Not only was their service bad but they received a grade C. Management needs to step up and fix their problems.
