I'm a transplanted New Yorker, so I know NYC pizza...and this isn't quite it. However, it's darn good. The best available in center city currently, in my opinion. One star removed because of crust-inconsistency. It comes out differently depending on who makes it, I guess. Sometimes, tender; sometimes a tiny bit tough. It's very good though and I've always found the people to be courteous and the deliveries prompt.
