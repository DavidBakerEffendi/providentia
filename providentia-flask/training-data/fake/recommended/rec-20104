Went here for brunch today.  Cheddar waffles were bomb.  Nice mix between savoury and sweet.  i had the home cured salmon.  it was well done.  we were a party of 5, and everyone got a different dish.  cant complain about any. loses a star because i called ahead for a reservation and when i showed up they said that it wasnt a real reservation because they dont do that. on the phone i said "id like a reservation for 1" meaning 1 pm.  she said we only do reservations for 5.  i said perfect, i have 5 ppl for 1pm.  we get there, and there is a crowd, and we have no reservation.  huh?  so whereas i shouldve been seating by 1, we didnt sit till about half an hour later.  bellinis and mimosas for $4 are totally worth it, although many brunch places offer these as part of your meal.  short rib hash was delish. waffles were decadent, more like a desert than brunch.  lamb was tender.
