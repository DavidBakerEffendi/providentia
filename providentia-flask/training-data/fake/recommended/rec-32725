What a fun place to visit with family and friends! We stopped here for lunch while in West Hartford, and had an awesome time. We ordered a little bit of everything - the chicken tamale, the romaine wedge salad, tacos (pork belly, chorizo, chicken, falafel, mushroom), chips and guacamole, and a sirloin rice bowl. The flavors were a little unique on some of the tacos (pork belly had too much of a teriyaki taste for my liking, and I would have liked the chorizo to pack more flavorful spices and not just heat). Serving style is also interesting - they bring your food on small metal trays, but they're not really good for items that you need to cut up, like the romaine wedge. The brown rice in the sirloin rice bowl was deliciously sticky and tasty, and the salsas are all awesome. The manager came by to chat for a few minutes as well, which was really neat! We would definitely come here again - I've already recommended it to friends.
