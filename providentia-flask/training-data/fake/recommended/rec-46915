As others have said, the owner of this place, Hassan, is what tips it over into being a 5-star place. He closes at 10pm, but my brother and I got there at 9:55, and he stayed open for us. Was honest with us about which lassi options were the best, and gave us extra tastes in little cups of the flavors the other got. I got the coconut lassi, and he got the blueberry lassi. Both very good and very fresh. He also gave us a free small order of chaat when he heard we'd never had it. The chaat was good, but we were even more impressed by how nice he was. Definitely hit this place up.
