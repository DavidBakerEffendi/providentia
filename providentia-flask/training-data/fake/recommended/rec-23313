We made a reservation for Little Fish and I'm really glad we did because it was packed at 7pm on a Friday. The menu wasn't on the website because they change the menu every season, but we took the plunge and went anyway, based on the great reviews. The menu was up on the chalkboard, and on hand-written menus, which was a cool touch. Our server was extremely helpful and went over each option. The restaurant itself is very small, but has a couple of patio chairs outside. You can watch the chefs make your meal as you wait in their open kitchen layout, which is something I've never seen outside of a sushi bar or Subway, so that was really neat. We started off trying the oysters, but I'm not a shellfish guy so I couldn't tell if they were great, good or bad. We shared the salad, which was nice and light. I had the bass with sausage, and at first bite I didn't get it. After I tried a bite with all the ingredients together, it blew me away. I tried some of m'lady's jerk sturgeon, which was subtle but awesome. It really utilized the herb they used, and it made the meal unique. The head chef has a great palate. The dessert was incredible. Chocolate mousse, I think, with marmalade. The only reason I didn't give it the place a five is that I asked the head server to put a candle or something on the dessert for m'lady, which she said "sure" to, but when it arrived, no candle. I guess she never relayed that to our server?
