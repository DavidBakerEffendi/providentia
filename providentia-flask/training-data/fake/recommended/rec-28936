$60 for breakfast, really?  It was so cold and we did not know where to grab eats so when we saw this place we dove in.  Seriously, $12 mimosa and $12 bloody mary that was pretty much vodka, tomato juice, hot sauce (SOOO much hot sauce) and a lemon wedge.   Horrible.   I sent it back and my husband watched as it was more ice a splash of vodka. I had the short stack of blueberry pancakes (no butter).   Dan had the pecan apple french toast (no pecans). $60 was absurd for what we had.     It's not as off the ambience and service was stellar.  It's an awkward contrived ambience.   I think it was the chill in the air, over priced underwhelming food and terrible bloody mary.
