If I was just rating the food I would only be giving 2 stars, however the service and drinks were great. Everything tasted very mediocre and was clearly pre-made based on the less than 5 minute turnaround time. The guacamole was fine, but definitely not made to order. I also had the Chavela salad w/ chicken and the chicken was overcooked and dry... like it had been sitting out for awhile. Also tried the enchilada which again was OK, but lacked any flavor. As I mentioned, the service from the maitre d to the bartender (sat at the bar while we waited) to the waitress was excellent, and really liked the margaritas, but won't be going back for a meal.
