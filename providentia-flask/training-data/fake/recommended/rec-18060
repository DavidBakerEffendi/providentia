Just went here recently for the first time, and I am extremely pleased with the choices I made. I ordered about 6 maki rolls to share, and every one was a great choice! The other couple that was dining with me mainly ordered sashimi plates, and had no complaints. They said all the fish on the plate tasted very fresh, and were given an adequate amount of choices. I think the main maki rolls are decently priced, however if you want some of the chef's selections you will pay about $5-10 more per roll depending what you ordered. It is a very small place, so if you do not like tight quarters (especially when the weather does not give you a choice to sit outside) than this probably is not the best sushi place for you to go. It is a BYOB, and the service was friendly and fairly good. Had to ask our waitress a few times about getting water, but the food came out very quickly. They did allow us to make reservations, but I am not sure if that is regular practice for them. Overall, it was a good experience and I would recommend it for sushi.
