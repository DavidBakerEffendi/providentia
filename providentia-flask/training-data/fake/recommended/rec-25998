It is not often that I get to a Sunday Bruncher.  And although I am not sure if I fit in with the NYC/ Chelsea Yelp Elite when it comes to trying Sunday Brunch menus, I wanted to give it a shot. I found the most reviewed location and decided to give it a try with my friends. I ordered the #5 Herb Goat Cheese & Avocado on toast with Walnut Pesto, Celery, & Arugula. I really wanted to try many things and I chose this at the last moment. I also ordered a Lemon & Rosemary cookie to share with my friends.  I am sucker for anything with Lemon Glaze.   It was surprisingly really light and fresh.  I wasn't sure if I liked the Rosemary flavor though.  It was nice to try something different. I thought the menu was excellent and the space was open and decorated really nice.  I didn't love the fact that your ordered and paid yourself. I can't imagine what people do when it is REALLY busy and everyone is looking for a seat.  Luckily, that wasn't my experience. I plan to visit again and try to other things I was thinking about ordering.
