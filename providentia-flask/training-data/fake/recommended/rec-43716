This is my idea of heaven!!  Having lived in Madrid, I am super picky when it comes to tapas and a lot of times I am left wanting to hop on a plane back to Spain.  I did not feel this way here!!  Patatas Bravas are one of my few favorite things in life and this place did them justice - they were soo good.  We also had the cheese and meat plate - fresh and good.  We had the calamari and it was tender and grilled to perfection.  To complete our meal, their sangria is out of this world.  Please open a location in SF!!
