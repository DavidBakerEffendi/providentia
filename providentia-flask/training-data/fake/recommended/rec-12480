Had dinner here last night after finding out about it in a book about "cool restaurants" in new york. We tried to make a booking during the day, but they only take bookings for 6 or more (we are only 2). Luckily, this wasn't an issue for us as we decided on an earlyish dinner at 6.30pm, and it was a Thursday, so we got a table straight away. The location is really cool at the end of the alley lined with graffiti and the decor/theme inside the restaurant is pretty cool. We ordered some drinks (which were a little slow to arrive, but my prima vera cocktail was very tasty), and then ordered our food (which was very quick from the kitchen). For starters we had the special salad (golden beets, blueberries, rocket, toasted sunflower seeds and basil vinegarette) and the pork and prawn skewers with fava bean hummus. The salad was really niceand light but the skewers werent exactly what I had imagined. For $14, we got 2 5cm long minced skewers,something like a kofta (I had imagined chunks of pork and prawn). It was tasty nonetheless but probably not value for money. For mains we chose the filet mignon and the chicken. Both mains were incredibly tasty. The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare and had a delicious horseradish cream on top and sweet caramelised onion. The chicken was moist and tender and had a nice tart pickle served on top. It was also served with a brocoli rabe which was really bitter so not that great... Overall, the service was good, the food was tasty and the atmosphere was comforting. Definitely recommended.
