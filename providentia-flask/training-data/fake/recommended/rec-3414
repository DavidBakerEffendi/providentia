My girlfriend and I initially found this place after having an argument outside about where to go eat. There was no line when we were there, but that seemed insignificant compared to Tom's strange decor. after letting the strange homey/diner feel sink in, we ordered food and completely forgot about the decor and the initial argument. It was that good. MMMM pastrami & eggs & pancakes. We will be back.
