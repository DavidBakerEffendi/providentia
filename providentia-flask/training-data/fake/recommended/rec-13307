As I slowly enter into a food coma after eating at Rose Water for a Thursday night dinner, allow me to unbutton and unzip mis pantalones. Picture a humid September night. It is the end of your first week at your new job and you want to treat yourself to something special in your new 'hood. Enter Yelp to the rescue. :) I skip the outdoor seating to avoid a.) pedestrians gawking at your food (hate that), b.) mosquitoes (you are not my friend), and c.) the humidity (the horror!). I enter the cute restaurant and am greeted by a hostess with an accent (French?). She tells me I have a few options but suggests that I avoid the loud party of four at the end of the restaurant. (Thank you! I could clearly hear them from across the room. I can't imagine what it would be like sitting next to them.) I sit against the only wall that has a brick exposed wall. Score! I order the grilled swordfish with the sweet corn succotash, summer squash and green goddess. The chef suggests it is cooked rare. I had never tried a Rosé wine with fish. The server suggests it and it is a nice change. It is the Groulleau/Gamay. The server cleverly teases me with a shot of the cucumber gazpacho, which is absolutely delicious. I will have to order it when I am more hungry. My swordfish comes. Beautiful presentation. Lots of colors. I cut my swordfish, soak and mix with the corn, squash and goddess. Place it all in my mouth and I melt. Willie Wonka, please shrink me so that I may swim in this plate full of tastiness. I wipe the plate clean. I finish the Rosé. I order the cherry cobbler for dessert, which comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I can't finish it all but it doesn't mean that it isn't good. I am just full. I am having a swordfish/cobbler baby. The bill comes to about $45. It's well worth it, believe me. Conclusion of the night: 1.) The fact that this place is very close to my new pad is very very VERY dangerous. 2.) I must hit the gym tomorrow morning.
