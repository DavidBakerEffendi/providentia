Great potential. However; don't sit at a booth. Distance front seat to table is too far. Our roll fell apart while eating- kind of ruins it. Pure shoddy sushi making.  Thai basil curry was SUPER salty.  Rice was good, but that's not much of an accomplishment. Dinner with mom so dinner wasn't ruined. Won't be back soon.
