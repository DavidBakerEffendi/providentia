Really trying to love this place as we anxiously awaited its opening.  Been twice though and they've got some work to do.  It's like Teach for America started a Mexican restaurant.   Food:  The 2 complimentary salsas are excellent.  The guac is good, but, I agree with whoever below said about the sea urchin guac - it just doesn't make sense. By now I think we've been through all of the tacos (including a few good specials like the lamb neck and carne asada). I say they are excellent, but the wife thinks they're just good.  I think she's being harsh because she can't get past the service, which I need to turn to because it is still pretty awful 6 weeks after opening. Service: A few of the young hipster waiters make up for their inexperience with a great attitude. There are a few really nice guys & girls taking orders.  But they really need to learn how to wait.  One girl came to our table and seriously said: "I have some specials if anyone wants to hear about them."  Then she read the descriptions verbatim (including the part describing the flavors - that was probably written for her so she can act like she actually tasted them).  It was funny.   Also, the hostess is pretty bad.   We watched as a couple walked out in disgust after waiting 20 minutes for a table - only to see another couple who walked in after them get seated before them.  Hostess was not apologetic and acted like they were the bad guys for leaving.  I really think they would benefit by hiring at least one or two older experienced waiters.  Kids with beards and hasidic hats are cool, but you also need some people who can get the job done and perhaps teach the cubs how to do it.   We'll be back - I would expect this place gets better with time.
