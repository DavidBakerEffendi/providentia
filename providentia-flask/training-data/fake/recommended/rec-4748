Steaming bowls of these hand drawn noodles are perfect for a rainy winter day.  I recommend the broth for post-marathon comfort and replenishment.   The new location makes it a pleasantly spacious experience, yet you can still eavesdrop or take part in your neighbor/tablemates' conversation.  A good place to make friends (or enemies, depending on your manners).
