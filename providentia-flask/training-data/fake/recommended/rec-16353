This place is spectacular. If you're a person who doesn't like sushi, don't fret, the burgers and rolls will have you coming back for more, i promise you. The wait was short and the place is nice, spacious and modern. I suppose compared to fast food joints, the portion of the burger is small, but it's just enough to fill you up for lunch. The chicken teriyaki burger and beef burger are delicious! The beef is done just enough and very juicy. I recommend this place to everyone.
