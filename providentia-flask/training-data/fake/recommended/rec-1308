Descriptive phrase: a fancy conglomerate of food styles. Walked into Rex 1516 on a Friday night and was seated right away. Only two tables out on the sidewalk, but we sat next to a large front window. It's a dark and woody interior, with a long seating area and a bar towards the back. White linen, candles on each table, it has a nice feel. The restaurant is billed as Southern-inspired fare. I started the meal with the Oskar Blues Mama's Little Yella Pils on tap ($4). The have an interesting and varied beer menu, and even offer their draught beers in growlers to go. Our appetizer was the Cheese Straws ($6), more-so because we were curious as to what they were. What we got were six straws that appeared to simply be baked and shaped cheese with sesame seeds. The small amount of pesto dip that came with it was a surprisingly good compliment. The straws themselves were light and airy, and while interesting I wouldn't order them again. I opted for the Hamburger ($12) [I know, adventurous huh?]. A half-pound patty, perfectly medium-rare, below melted pimento cheese, red onions, lettuce, and bacon, all on a pretzel-esque bun. Absolutely delicious. Succulent to the last bite, with just the right amount of grease to overcome the doughy bun. I also thought the sweet potato fries were well above average. Rex 1516 offers some unique entrees to try, but also serves up notably tasty takes on simple staples like salads and hamburger. It's good food in a fancy atmosphere without feeling stuffy.
