It's a great place! Easy parking, great sea food for a decent price. People without pictures on their YELP profile shouldn't give opinions; they might just be the competition, or bad redundant tippers who waiters might not be able to forget. Who knows.... I've seen people demand service and act like the waiter is a slave and when getting a $98.65 bill they leave $1.35 tip from the $100 they pay with and can't stop talking about how good the food and service was. I know that if I was a waiter I wouldn't care about them coming back. But the food should still be great, the cooks don't get a share of the tips neither does he get a chance to see who the demanding people are. His job is to cook. And the food never fails in my opinion... Worth a try...
