ugh, i'm sooooo behind on my reviews from my last NY visit.... let me start with one of my favorite spots from the trip. arms bound tightly around each other braving the freezing temps, we dragged our bundled, shivering selves across the threshold and inside, to complete relief. it's dark, small, warm, sexy and had an impressive whiskey selection. which was the goal. neither of us were in the mood for food at the moment so we ordered a few whiskey flights and huddled close to together to enjoy our surroundings. what a delightful, playful bar... it has that special something to make a night out with a date grabby, happy, flirty and extra fun. the whiskey went down smooth, warmed our insides and the laughter flowed around us as we were equally impressed with the professional politeness of the staff. these guys are total pros. we contemplated ordering food, but decided instead to do "late night dining" somewhere else. the warmth of the whiskey and atmosphere felt so soothing, we stayed for a good chunk of the night just lost in conversation and the moment. it started to get really crowded as the night wore on, but we left before the madness really began. i would absolutely come back if i was in NY and would like to try the food. it looked remarkable. a new NY fave! can't wait to come back on my next visit.
