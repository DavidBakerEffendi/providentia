I will keep this short. Incredible hand drawn noodles with the most fresh and delicious ingredients all for an incredible price. I have never eaten in and always end up getting it to go but I will certainly there in their little restaurant at some point. Â Nan Zhou on a cold day (and hot one too) is the best!!
