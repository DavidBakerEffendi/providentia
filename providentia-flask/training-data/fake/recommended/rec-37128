The food was great! Amazing, actually! But the service....the poor, poor, horrible service! I'm assuming UMAMI isn't use to large parties like the one I had last week for an office outing. From missed appetizers to wrong burgers,  to waiting over 30 mins to be seated...it was all just a struggle. On the other hand, the food was yummy! The truffle fries were tasty and the "Manly Burger" was awesome, although not very manly at all. The white sangria was tasty and had just the right kick. The service slowly improved as the night continued.  Maybe I should give it another try with a smaller group?
