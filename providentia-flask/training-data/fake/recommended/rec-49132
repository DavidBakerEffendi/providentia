Note that I'm reviewing this from a 'brunch' perspective... One of my favourite brunch places in New York right now. Located in the West Village, you should come here at 1030 am when it opens or be ready to queue. The bloody mary here is pretty amazing. Had mine double spiced, using cilantro infused vodka, and accompanied by a beer chaser. I know, Â pretty heavy for 1030 in the morning, but having just flown in from London, I figured I was technically entitled. I started off with a fruit bowl, I know, pretty boring, but it was actually just what my body was craving for. The bowl was filled with fresh, organic strawberries, blackberries, and blue berries. Lovely. I then went for the egg sandwich that everyone has been raving about. It's layered on top of manchego cheese in a flaky, buttery, croissant. I ordered it with bacon, which is super crispy and crunches just right, giving great textural balance to the sandwich. Drool! The sandwich comes with the Brussels sprouts, which are served with sriracha sauce. Crazy but amazing combination! The sprouts are chopped up, and bacon flavoured, oh my! My friend had the kale salad, which looked ginormous, and really delicious. Service was excellent, the atmosphere cosy, and I will definitely be making this my go to brunch place in Manhattan from here on in. Now, if I could only get one of Dominique's freaking 'Cronuts'...
