I've been to Frankford Hall several times for the Nerd Nite (facebook.com/nerdnitephiâ€¦) events which are great b/c for $5 you get the Happy Hour pricing during the talks. Happy hour pricing is mad decent with $5 1/2 liter, $6 pretzel, $10 liter and sausage and 1/2 liter special for $8. I highly recommend the Kasekrainer (beef, pork and cheese)! So darn good. The pretzels and cheese come out warm and delicious. There are ping pong tables and board games, and the outdoor beer garden is spacious and nice although can get pretty loud and crowded depending on the night. But we've also had fun at the Nerd Nite events and dig that they hold them here. Just keep in mind that you cannot order food at the bar! This is not clearly stated anywhere. There is a separate food window out in the garden.
