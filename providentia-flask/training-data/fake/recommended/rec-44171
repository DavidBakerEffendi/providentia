Quality, strong beer - Check Greasy bar food - Check Helpfull/Cheerfull bar staff - Check Outdoor seating - Check Everything you expect from a great neighborhood bar and only a few minutes from center city. I would make the argument for a few more beers on tap, but they always have at least one of every type you would expect and almost always a new brewery.
