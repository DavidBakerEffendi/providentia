they were not kidding about the potted bread--it was v. delicious. i celebrated my bday here. i was looking for something intimate with my group of friends and this was the perfect setting. dimly lit, quiet (but with enough chatter so it doesn't feel awk), the service was great. we didn't feel rushed and was given time to wait for the rest of our party to arrive. if you are a burger fiend (like me!) you HAVE to get the burger. this is quite a compliment...but i think it might be better than dumont's. we started off with the roasted brussel sprouts, fried squid and burrata as apps. to share amongst 8-9 ppl, it was the perfect amount to taste, try and get bits of seconds. i had the burger and some of the gnocchi (fantastico!). the gnocchi are not your typical gnocchis...they almost felt dumpling-esque. the lamb bolognese looked awesome (albeit smaller portions). we had two bottles of rose to share. and they surprised me with the chocolate hazenut pot de creme (SO YUMMY!). i can't stop thinking/talking about it with everyone. needlesstosay, i had a great bday dinner and will be back! ps. they have a garden out back if you enjoy al fresco dining (it was raining on 5/23...so Â no dice for us). enjoy!
