Crunchy French toast whaaaaaat. Homemade tater tot breakfast bowl whaaaaat those are some pretty delicious taters ok those are the best damn tater tots around. Had the veggie bowl too it was good but blah compared to the French toast and tots. No frills spot just looks like an awesome old school diner. Such a chill spot. Food is on point. Â I'll be back.... ...so my friend left her phone there we decided to get it the next morning so we can eat there again. I think she left it there for this very reason. Great freakin plan. We both had the Elvis waffle and chicken n waffle. Both were awesome. Can't wait to go back and try that juicy burger the table next to us ordered. This just may be my new favorite fat spot
