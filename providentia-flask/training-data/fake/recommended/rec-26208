Overpriced and overrated! We came at 5pm when it was just opened. We had pork belly buns, fried brussel sprouts, beef stew, and pork chop for dinner. Pork belly buns were ok, but I prefer the ones in Ippudo NY. Too much sour cream in the brussel sprouts. The dish was so dark that I couldn't tell what I was eating. Beef stew had a very very small potion with barely few pieces of beef tendon. The quality of the pork chop was like any restaurant that serves pork chop. It was at most worth half of the charged price. In general, my experience of Momofuku is disappointing, both the service and the food.
