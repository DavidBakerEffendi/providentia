My husband and I came here after hearing rave reviews from a friend. The food was AMAZINGLY fresh, flavorful, and prepared just right. Â Our favorite dishes were the mussels with cava and chorizo, foie gras, and setas with garlic. We paired these dishes with glasses of shiraz, and they went together just perfectly. The setting is really intimate, and we loved the ambiance.
