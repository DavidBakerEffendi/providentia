We stumbled upon The Smith to grab a quick bite and a beer before a show nearby, and were very pleasantly surprised! They have a decent list of beers on tap (including my beloved Allagash White), as well as a nice list of wines. We sat at the bar, expecting a long wait and surly bartenders, however we experienced quite the opposite. The bar staff was extremely attentive and friendly. Our food arrived in near record time. And though I'm still feeling a slight pang of regret for how quickly and unabashedly I wolfed down "The Rocket" sundae (yes, I, a grown women, ordered a sundae with whipped cream and chocolate sauce - and not to share, just for myself), the food, beer and service totally hit the spot after spending 3 hours en route (by car, train and taxi) to NYC from Philly. The Smith was a great find.
