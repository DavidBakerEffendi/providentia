BEST RAMEN EVERR! Worth the wait? Absolutely yes unless you are dying of hunger, then please get a quick bite anywhere in the area and return, yes, return and wait yo ass for a delicious bowl of ramen. I love the noodles here and the broth. My favorite is the spicy miso. It comes with a little pile of freshly grated ginger atop that you mix into the broth. I was skeptical at how the ginger would add to the broth but it  add such a delicious bite to the soup(and i love ginger). The appetizers are not even bite size, more like micro size. The hirata buns are okay. I think baohaus buns beat momofuku's and ippudo's. I think ippudo has the best ramen. I've only been to ken's ramen (Boston), Batten Ramen (Fort Lee, NJ), and Santouka (mitsuwa supermarket in NJ) so I haven't been through all the ramen joints  but have you ever discovered something so amazing that you don't dare look elsewhere because you are absolutely happy with your find? Yea, that's sort of how i feel about ippudo.
