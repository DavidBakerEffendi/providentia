After hearing time after time about the unbearable wait for weekend brunch, I figured I'd take the road less traveled and check it out for dinner.  I got there early - just before 6 - and was only with one other person, so we were seated right away.   To start we split the spinach artichoke dip - delicious!!! The bowl was coated with bread crumbs and there were big chunks of artichokes so I ended up eating a lot of it right off plate with a fork...bread was not even necessary.  Between the two of us, we licked the bowl clean (oops). I went with the Veggie Met Sally salad for my meal which I really liked too. The  veggie burger that topped the salad was great, definitely the highlight of the dish.  I kind of wished that the other toppings (green apples, onions, and feta cheese which I substituted from the goat) weren't chopped so tiny, but I got over it quickly.  Best of all, it definitely did NOT burn a hole in my wallet :) Very quaint spot and really nice staff, but considering their popularity amongst the Murray Hill crowd, you'd think they would invest in an expansion so I can get some pancakes without waking up at the crack of dawn!!!!
