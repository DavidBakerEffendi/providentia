Ha, yes, I remember it well.  I've talked to some of those snooty NYcers myself.  But oh well, their lost, because The Grocery.  Had dinner with my family here once.  And the experience was great.  We had clams (sprinkled with garlicky goodness), trout stuffed with mushroom, homemade sausage, and two other entrees I think.  It was under $100.  The space is small but the food is crazy.
