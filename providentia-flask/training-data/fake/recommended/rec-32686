This place is so cool and has such a great vibe!  The bartenders are so nice and the margaritas excellent - I feel as if I'm on an island away from all the hustle and bustle. You'll love the music and smiling faces - super friendly staff and excellent service - It's a must if you're looking for a place to wind down and enjoy.  My favorite is the ceviche, the mojitos, the brown rice bowl with Duck and the grilled fish tacos!
