Spent this past Saturday night at this wonderful little place celebrating my wife's birthday along with 15 friends/family. The staff was fantastic. Service was top notch and food was great. We opted for price fixed menu which included a nice cross section of great delights along with various different flavored sangrias. The mango flavor was a favorite. The chicken croquets were great along with the spicy cheese squares, the sausages, curry chicken and meatballs. The entertainment was GREAT. The performers were gracious and extremely talented. The music and dancing were both top notch. I rarely offer reviews, however the combination of GREAT and caring management along with an equally up to the task staff and wonderful entertainment made this night truly one that we will remember with smiles for a long time to come. Anyone debating of where to go for a great evening filled with something different, the debate is over.... this is the place.
