Great food. Simply put.  I know a lot of people on here say "Maybe good for tourists"...but I have to say that the food is quite good.  Maybe a little pricey, but what do you expect when you eat in a tourist area. I will say that the sampling of three pastas that they feature every night I believe, is a little excessive and the quality is a little lack-luster.  Other than that, a fun atmosphere that serves up some great dishes.  Warning: it is quite loud at times.
