The drinks are cheap, so are the pierogies.  Get anything other than a PBR and you might look horrifically out of place. It's very comfy and homey, as comfy and homey as a graffiti-lined place can get, and I don't mind coming here.  But I've been here for several Taco Tuesdays, all of which turned into Upset Stomach Wednesdays.   Yet somehow, I still blame the PBR.
