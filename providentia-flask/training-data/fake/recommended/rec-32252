Yea this place is the bees knees. Pretty sure they hate me now because my group was super loud and the place is super tiny. There are about 10 tables in the joint and we had to wait about 30 min to get seated at 1 of the 2 tables that can seat 6.   Got a menu?   Who cares.  I'm pretty sure all they sell is Bun Bo Hue.   Just get it.   The oily, super spicy broth will make you sweat and your nose run.   I went for the safer Bun Bo Hue with sliced beef only (Bun Bo Nam?).  It's not the authentic experience with hock ,liver, tripe, etc, however, it was still super delicious.  One thing I do wish they had were some apps to compliment the soup, like spring rolls or papaya salad.  But I understand.  I can never go back to Pho now.
