Loved the decor! Came here with the locals I came to Philadelphia to visit, this was our first stop on a Friday night. Not too crowded for the 8pm hour, cheap beers (Yeungling, I love you) and free Dum-Dums on the tables. I didn't partake of the $1 PBRs and it looks like I should try the food next time based on some really good yelp reviews. I'll be back!
