I came for the fried chicken and was not disappointed with the chicken itself. The problem? fixin's. Call me a traditionalist, but I like a pile of mashed potatoes and gravy with my comfort food. So when they served me chicken with some cold apple salad on the side, I was a bit disappointed. What's more, I couldn't even order sides of the customary fix'ins, as they didn't have them on the menu.
