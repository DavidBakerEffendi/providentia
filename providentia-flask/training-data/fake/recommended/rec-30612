This place reminds me of a restaurant in Seattle.  The place was packed, but we did not have to wait at all.  They seemed very well organized there.  The restaurant seemed a little upscale, but I'd say it was more trendy.  The wait staff we're mostly in nice dark jeans and collared shirts which was nice to see.  Some friends recommended this place to us and we came for the food.  They use a lot of organic/local vegies etc.  It was great to see that for a NYC restaurant. Who knew......  Unfortunately I was not that hungry that evening so we ate light.  We started with 2 different types of salads.  THey were both very different, but very delicious.  One contained beets & pears and the other was mainly greens.   I usually do not order Chicken, but I did that night and was really glad I did.  Good portion and paired with purple potatoes which were grilled.  My partner ordered the lamb.  It was sort of a sampler and paired with polenta.  For dessert we shared the ice cream. I forgot to mention the cocktails were good and also had a nice mix of wines.
