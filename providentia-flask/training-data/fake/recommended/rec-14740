Came here for lunch a few times with coworkers.  Great prices and super trendy atmosphere.  I usually ordered the same thing, Chicken Pad Thai.. its the safe way to go in my opinion.  The chicken is very tender and seasoned, in other words its very very good. The noodles and peanut sauce are good as well.  No complaints here.
