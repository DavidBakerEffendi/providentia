I have been here about 3 times since my last review and I still love it.  We took my super snobby foodie brother in law for his birthday and he loved it.  We also came to Rose Water with another couple for the New Year's Eve Prix Fixe and it was amazing.  We all decided to go with the wine pairing option that came with each course and were thrilled with how perfectly matched each course was (plus it was great not to have to decide on one bottle of wine that everyone would agree on).  And the service was friendly and unpretentious.  I would definitely recommend that you check them out!
