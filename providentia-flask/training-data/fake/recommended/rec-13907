LOVE it! Cheap, fast, and tasty. You can't get better than this :D Recommendation *I actually prefer the chicken and rice as opposed to the chicken/lamb combo (both $6), but the white sauce actually takes over the flavor so it really doesn't matter. *Ask for TWO sides of white sauce! It's just awesome, you will thank me later :) *The red spicy sauce is SUPER HOT! so, be EXTRA cautious when you pour it over your plate, because it is HOT HOT HOT!  I had a friend make that mistake (and he LOVES spicy food), but alas he fell victim to it.  So use it responsibly!
