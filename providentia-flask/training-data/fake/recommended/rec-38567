This was to our surprise some of the best food we had in Philadelphia - nice plates, good beer, and pleasant atmosphere. We came in after recommendations from folks who lived in Philly, and were in the neighborhood for a dance night. The wait was a bit long for a table, and one of the hostesses was a bit rude to one of my friends at one point (so minus one star), but once were seated the service improved. What we thought would just be standard bar food, turned out to be a pleasant menu of fresh options. I had the apple and fennel salad, which was on the small side, but it was all I needed for the evening. Overall a fun pleasant place for a laid back dinner.
