Super authentic Basque pinxtos, sidras, and vermouths. In fact, most are exclusive to Donostia... the selection is incredible. Grab a seat at the bar, and start making your way through the ciders... I love the Petritegi! Also, the spanish tortilla with jamon and queso is great. They also bottle their own basque products, like grilled artichokes and peppers. You can buy them at the store!
