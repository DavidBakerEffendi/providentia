If you're craving for pizza tonight, skip all other usual establishments and go to American Flatbread.  Their flavors are unique and feature local and/or organic ingredients.  Ask about the specials too as they are created each week. Maple sausage on pizza anyone? The garnishes are so characteristic of this Green Mountain State.  If you can't decide on a particular flavor, order a whole pizza with half of one and half of the other. The wait time can be ridiculous as it is almost always packed especially during weekends and nights when they are hosting an event.  They give out a pizza slice beeper that lights up and vibrates when a table becomes available for your party.  At least that kept our little ones occupied; they waited wide-eyed for it to do its thing.  During the winter, we check beforehand if there's a big chance we would get seated right away.  If not, we shrug and go to our second choice, which is whatever will get us in instantly.  We've stood out in the cold once when we tried it for the first time. We will not do it again.   But once you're seated, they take care of you and make sure you get what you want.  The hearth is in full view.  You can see and almost feel the heat of the flames cook those flatbreads being prepared right on the spot. If watching your food getting cooked just makes you salivate more, pick up a board game by the receptionist to divert your attention away from that hunger pang.  Chances are, the food will arrive before you connect four! The servers we've had in the past were great and they do know the beers that they serve. And that's another thing worth going here for---they have an amazing beer list!  They serve both local and international brews.   And just like the original definition of a pub, this is a place where people of all ages meet, talk, eat, drink and be merry.
