From California so we come across a lot of Korean BBQ joints. Looked this place up to set up our itinerary for our trip to NY and was so excited to see that there was a Korean spot next to the Empire State Building! Very clean and a large beautiful space to sit down and enjoy your meal! Food was perfect! I finished my tofu soup which I never usually do and the meat was just right and rich in flavor! I ordered the L1 lunch special BBQ ribs which I highly recommend! Enjoyed my lunch so much I decided to write a review once we finished and I hardly every write reviews so this is a definite must after some sightseeing!
