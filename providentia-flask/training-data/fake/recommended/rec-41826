Alright the Clam sandwich with fries and a bottle of Bud is one of the greatest values in New York CIty.  Old bartender cracks me up, seems like he hates his job at first but you get him talking and he's definitely down to earth and friendly.  Goofy atmosphere, but I kind of like some aspects of it.  If you are thirsty and hungry and on a budget, this is your joint.
