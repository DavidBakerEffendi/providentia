Pio Pio and its delicious food now ranks at the top of my culinary experiences. I began with Pio Pio's amazing "Piscorinha" cocktail; their take on the famous Caipirinha from Brazil. This was my first taste of Pisco and thus Brazilian/Peruvian marriage goes down unbelievably smooth with flavors that satisfy with every sip! My meal was the real highlight! I had the Camarones Cuzco. This dish is a combination of perfect plump shrimp, a bed of amazingly well seasoned rice and the star: the unbelievable aji amarillo sauce. Folks, if I could have an endless supply of this sauce, I would eat it with every meal!!! You really owe it to yourself to experience Pio Pio! I will return everytime I'm in New York.
