We were there for a birthday party last night with a large group of people. It was my first time in the restaurant and I was really impressed with everything. The decor and ambience of the place is beautiful, modern and sexy. It has a very cool and trendy vibe to it. The food was delicious and chef was so amazing with all the complimentary dishes he served. The waiter service was outstanding and very fast. I loved everything about it. They have this amazing private room with a rooftop that opens in summer time. I will be definitely coming back!
