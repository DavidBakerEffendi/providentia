Creative, but simple, fresh tasty food. The cuisine is French-ish, creative American, with a touch of Mediterranean. I got the wild-caught salmon with lentils and crisp green beans, preserved lemon. my friend got the penne, simple and straightforward with some flavor and spice. It is an intimate dining experience. You are dining with the entire restaurant. It is very loud but romantic in a way. I would dress nicer for this place, but that is always my philosophy. There's always the person with jeans and sneakers on to validate the lazy or the too-busy.
