This is a pretty damn awesome venue. The beer is great (delicious German brews) and the food is decent, too (pretzels, kraut, sausages, etc...). Disclaimer: I was there for a university-sponsored event, so the food and beer were free. Â After perusing the menu, I'd say the beer prices were reasonable, but the food prices were a bit more than expected. The multiple ping-pong tables (and foosball table) and Jenga games were really appreciated, and they make what might have just been a regular, fun bar experience into a much more memorable and enjoyable one. I'd love to come back here, especially with a group since there's plenty of space both indoor and outdoor.
