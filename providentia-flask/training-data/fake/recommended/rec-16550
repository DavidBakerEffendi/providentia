You're going to wait for at least an hour on weekends - probably an hour and a half - and for a good while on weekdays. That's not on them, of course, but it has to be factored into the decision. It's lovely, of course: our eggs were perfectly poached, the coffee was tasty and bottomless, and there's creativity in the menu, it's more than your typical brunch spot. Great service. But it's not amazing, just very good. Sneak in early on a weekday or save your time.
