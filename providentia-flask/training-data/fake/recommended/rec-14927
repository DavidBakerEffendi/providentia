I feel like all of what I want to say has already been gushed about, but I will reiterate that the dan dan noodles here are incredibly delicious--one of my favorite bites to have while in Philly, for sure. Be careful though, if you don't have a great spice tolerance! Weaned on jalapeno peppers since early childhood (and then bhut jolokia sauce for the first half of college...), I don't find the noodles very spicy, but my boyfriend (who is incredibly sensitive to spice) nearly always starts sweating and nearly dying. The scallion pancakes are nice, though a little too fried for my taste--they do some different kind of sauce here that's a little heavy on the white pepper too. The serving staff are also very outgoing and friendly, striking up conversation on the fly and generally engaging with you in a fun way. All in all, definitely try it out!
