Would really give it three and a half stars. Went for brunch with my family and we ordered a lot of different things. Eggs Benedict was overcooked...the eggs weren't runny at all, so if I went again I would specify. The blackened scramble was lamb instead of fish but the scallions were a little too powerful. Also, the food didn't come out all at the same time. But it was all plated attractively. The drinks were good and the live music was great! They were also really careful about food allergies and extremely accomodating. Atmosphere was great and so was the service. Would like to go for dinner.
