Had a reunion here last night. Pretty solid typical sports bar. Drinks wavered some did not really taste like there was much alcohol in them, others were strong. It was mostly filled with our group so I cannot comment on what it is like on a normal night. But I would definitely go back sometime. It is pretty big with a bar downstairs and one upstairs.
