This place is awesome. I love me some Korean food and have tried a few places in the city and in queens, and I have to say--this has become my new favorite. I'd been going to the next door restaurant for a while (Han-Bat), when we decided to give this one a try, and it's much cuter as far as atmosphere (and the coolest menu), with slightly tastier and more yummy food. SO this wins. The banchan starters were good, with the Kim Chi being fresh, strong & spicy.  Their cucumber/eggs pancake was also very good, as was the tofu.  I ordered the bulgogi stone bowl and man was that a dish! Rice, bulgogi, eggs, peas, veggies--everything you could think of served in a still-steaming stone bowl that sizzled. Awesome dish. Price was a little higher than average. Still have to try their BBq dishes
