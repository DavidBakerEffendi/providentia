Found this place totally by accident on our last trip to NYC.  Great drinks and food at a fair price for New York.  The real treat of the visit was the partner of the owner who happened to be holding court at the end of the bar and greeted us as family; we must have looked lost:-)  They even have a pretty good Oregon wine, so we felt at home.  Even if your not staying in the Village, this place is worth the ride.
