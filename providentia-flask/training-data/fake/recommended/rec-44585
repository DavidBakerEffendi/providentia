I love the pizza here. The staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable. I've had the pizza and a few of the pasta entrees and was very pleased. This is a place that I'll return to again and again (its in my neighborhood). The only bad part to this place is the acoustics. It can be quite loud at times. They need acoustic tiles.
