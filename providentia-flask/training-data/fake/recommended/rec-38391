Sandra's deserves the 5 star rating. The food is excellent. Fried chicken with dirty rice and collard greens was my choice. Did not disappoint. The atmosphere is very relaxed and feels homey. I love the way she serves iced tea and generous with corn bread. The owner came out and greeted us suspecting it was our first visit. Very friendly and explained how to order etc. we will be back here for sure. Price is very reasonable for the quality of food. You can tell that she and her husband have love and pride for their business.
