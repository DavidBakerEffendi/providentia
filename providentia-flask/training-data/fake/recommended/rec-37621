Riverpark restaurant is beautiful!  Every detail has been thought out, down to their business cards.  The food was fantastic.  For brunch, we had the cinnamon donuts for a starter.  If you told me they were healthy, I would believe it.  The donuts were light & fluffy!  The chocolate sauce sent it over the top!  I had the BLT, very delicious & filling.  The view is lovely as well.  Good job Tom.
