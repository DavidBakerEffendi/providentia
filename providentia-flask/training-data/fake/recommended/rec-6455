The first time i came here with my good male friend and good female friend, we ordered one of the big ramen... and the noodles felt powdery and i didn't appreciate that. their appetizers are definitely overpriced, tho it's good. The second time i came here with my best friend and her another friend, i ordered the chicken ramen, decided to stick to the simplest ramen coz i didn't wanna be disappointed. my best friend ordered miso ramen, i think. her friend ordered miso shoyu, that was actually the best. i would try the miso shoyu ramen if i do decide to go there again...for whatever reason. i personally think Terakawa Ramen is way better tho super casual. very humbly service and their ramen soup is fulfilling. plus it's inexpensive. this place may have a nice decor but i think it's quite overrated. and oh yea another thing that bothered me was that our waiter, tho acquainted to one of us, he didn't smile and that bothered me. A SMILE IS IMPORTANT! If he gave all of us a sweet smile instead of being all japanesy (UPTIGHT), i would've given 3 stars. this really bothered me. a free drink for each of us because he knew one of us was unnecessary if he wasn't gonna treat us special sake. don't ask, JUST BRING next time. i hate young japanese guys because of that... amateurs. BORING. Therefore I felt ramen was VERY expensive for the whole experience.
