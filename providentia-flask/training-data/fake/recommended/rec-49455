I rarely write reviews but Beyond Sushi deserves 10 stars! It means so much to me as a vegan to have more then just "cucumber avocado" as a sushi option. This place is one of my favorites because the food is AMAZING and flavorful, the prices are fabulous (small wrap for $5-whatt) and the staff is friendly. I'm also a bit OCD so I appreciate the "viles" of sauce that you can pour as you wish with no mess. I only wish they had a bigger space. Since the place is tiny there isn't always a chance you'll be able to eat in. But I understand how high rent must be so it's not something that really bothers me. But seriously- take anyone with a working palette here and they'll be blown away.
