Be warned, this place is TINY! I went with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday. I ordered the Ropa Vieja which is basically a shredded beef stew. I have definitely had better. The sauce on the Ropa Vieja tasted like ketchup, the rice was undercooked, and the beans were bland. The only thing this plate had going for it were the tostones which were nice and crispy. I tried everyone else's dish and from the various dishes that I tried (6 others) none amazed me. The Pollo Empanizado (Breaded Chicken) was bland and dry and it had a weird cinnamon flavor. The Bistec de Palomilla was overly buttery and too thin. The steak did not look the least appetizing. The sauce of the garlic shrimp was the same deal. It was overwhelmingly buttery and flavorless. If you KNOW and LOVE Latin food, you will not go here. The food simply isn't worth it.
