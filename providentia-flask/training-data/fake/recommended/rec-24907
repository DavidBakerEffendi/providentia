Pats and Genos are both for toruists.  Real cheesesteaks dont have cheese wiz and are loaded with meat.  A step up is Johns Pork or Tony Lukes.  Both are a must try, but Johns Pork is the best for just about anything.  Also at Pats, you make sure your ready to order, and get it right, and have your money ready or the knock you off.  Not the best customer service, but they do try to keep things flowing. Try Johns and update me what you think.
