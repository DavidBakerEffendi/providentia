Great place, but it's really small and always packed.   Usually a 30 min plus wait to reserve a spot and you have to do it in person.   Prices are typical Manhattan prices. Food is really flavorful and drinks are really tasty.   I usually go with the guacamole & chips to start and get the mango steak salad & jalapeño infused margaritas.   Everything I've tried here is pretty good so it's hard to go wrong.. Definitely worth a visit!
