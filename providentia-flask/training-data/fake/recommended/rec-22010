Came here last minute for my bday with a large group.  The service was nice and they have a great view of the lake.  The atmosphere and decor were like any local seafood spot.  The food itself was ok.  Except the soft shell clams were FILLED with sand.  I ran my fingers along the shell and brought up so much sand.  I asked for a bowl of water to rinse them leaving the water murky.  Even after that they were too gritty to enjoy.
