Kate's is what Verona was missing. They serve delicious sandwiches, salads and even have a section where you can purchase fresh products by the pound. My personal favorite is the grilled chicken with pesto, roasted red peppers and tomato. The grilled chicken tastes like real chicken and is quite filling. All their food is made in house, is fresh and tastes delicious. If you want to eat a healthy lunch/dinner in the area this is the place to go. It's good and good for you.
