Meh.... Went there with my sister, bro-in-law, and two friends. Decor was cute, menu not so much. Not vegetarian friendly at all. There were a few vegetable choices as far as appetizers, but no vegetarian ramen. I asked if they could prepare a veg ramen and was told no. So while everyone chowed down on what looked to be delicious ramen dishes, I ate appetizers. I was very unpleased. I think this place received a lot more credit than was deserved.
