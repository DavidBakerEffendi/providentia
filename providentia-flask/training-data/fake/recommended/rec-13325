Tiny place with communal bench seating.  Refreshing salad options.  I had the shrimp and avocado salad which was filling and of high quality ingredients where the shrimp was cooked to order.  Besides the construction going on across the street, it was an enjoyable lunch after having shopped SoHo.  Very reasonable pricing.
