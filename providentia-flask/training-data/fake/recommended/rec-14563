Like a lot of places in the city, this one may be a little over rated. My life hasn't change since I have had umami burger.... Maybe because it started in Cali and everything is blah over there so they though it would be the bestest idea to import it in NYC, but we are so spoiled  here with good food that the standards are  very high. That said, the burgers are good. But really, do you want to wait 3 hours for a freaking burger? Why!?   Went there a few weeks ago with 2 guy friends, we ordered everything on the menu and split it in 3, so we each had a flav' of everything for only a one time 3 hours wait ;) Umami burger, truffle burger and manly burger were great! Cali  was all right and the tuna would have stand by he tuna itself ;) So it was good overall, but the hype about it is not worth it, I would definitely go back, but it's not worth the crazy wait. Seriously. Not worth the wait.
