Seriously overrated and overpriced! If the cheese steaks at Geno's is the best that philly's got to offer, then that is the saddest story I've ever heard. The sub was sloppy, dry and tasteless. I can't believe I paid almost $8 for this? I got mine with provolone as a coworker recommended... dry. I don't really have much to say about Geno's but if you've never had it, sure go for it. At least you can say "been there, done that"! ...but I wouldn't go back for a second time.
