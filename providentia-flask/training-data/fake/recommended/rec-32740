In terms of the food, there's not much grey area; the food is either delicious or disgusting.  For instance, the Mayflower grinder, homemade meatballs, white pizza, Margherita pizza, pulled pork pizza, and Hawaiian pizza are all top notch.  In fact, the pulled pork pizza, alone, could earn an overall four star rating for the place.  On the other hand, the salmon pizza is overpoweringly salty, the clam pizza tastes like canned clams were poured onto pizza dough and tossed into an oven, the veggie grinder tastes and looks like a soggy concoction of frozen spinach and cheese. Overall, Luna offers some great selections, but this is not a place where I can order just anything and be content, unlike, let's say, Harry's Pizza where I enjoy literally everything on the menu.
