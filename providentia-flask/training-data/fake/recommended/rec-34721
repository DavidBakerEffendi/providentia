A casual eatery that serves up different kinds of excellent kati rolls! We went at 2:30 pm on a rainy afternoon and it was pretty empty except for 2 other couples. Fresh, hot, right off the tava rolls. Achari paneer was my favorite, though Aloo unda roll was not bad either. Each is $5.50 Â or 2 for 10! Finish off with elaichi chai. Makes a quick, hearty meal.
