stood in line for their pulled pork sammy (original style) with the broccoli rabe and provolene cheese. this place has been on travel channel so there was a huge line around the stand in reading terminal. it literally took 1/2 hr to get my sandwich. however, it was a great sandwich with a hearty french roll to soak up all the juicy pork. the broccoli was a perfect complement with just the right amount of contrast and spice kick. would i be back? yes only on off peak hours!! the line died down significantly at 2pm on a saturday.
