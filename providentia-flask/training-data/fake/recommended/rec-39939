The hotel suggested this place to my husband and me. What an incredible find!   The pastrami and corned beef are made in house. The macaroni snd cheese is life-alteringly delicious. The hostess and or server were so friendly!  They helped us navigate the restaurant's extensive menu and checked in on us (the leaf peepers) several times during our meal. One thing is for sure,  we'd REALLY have a weight problem if we lived nearby instead of in Texas.
