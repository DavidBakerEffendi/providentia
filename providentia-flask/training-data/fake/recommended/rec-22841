Good food and awesome presentation I had the lava chicken and the waiter poured a special flaming sour sauce on it, the food stayed on fire for about 3 seconds. I would have given this place five stars if my Mom's dish hadn't smelled funny and my grandpa's wasn't that good. By the way I am nine so if you don't want to listen to a nine year old's review then don't listen to this me.
