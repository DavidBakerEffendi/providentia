Whoever came up with artichoke pizza is such a genius! To me it tastes like spinach artichoke dip on pizza. Who wouldn't like this?! I hear the crab pizza is great as well, I'll have to try this next time. This place is open late at night, which makes for a great meal after a night of debauchery. A slice of pizza is $4.75 (from what I can remember) for a huge piece! Seriously, if you aren't super hungry, 2 people can share 1 piece. This isn't a place to bring a group as there is no seating. More of an order and go place. If only they could open an Artichoke Basille Pizza on the West Coast...I would be there all the time!
