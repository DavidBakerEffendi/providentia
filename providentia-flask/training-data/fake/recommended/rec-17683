I got the lunch special recently, ordered 3 rolls for 12 dollars. Shrimp Tempura w/ avocado(extra$) Shrimp/Avocado Philly roll. This was on a Thursday afternoon, it was very fresh. I had it delivered, they got it to me in less then 10 minutes, even if I was only 1 minute away. The food was good I was actually surprised, it wasn't the greatest sushi rolls i ever had but I def enjoyed it and for the price can't complain at all. I def recommend this place! I'm glad they reopened, the old place was always dead.
