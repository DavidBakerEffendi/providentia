I didn't love it here. The food seems decent, maybe a little expensive (almost 9 bucks for eight chicken wings) and I'd like to see a little more variety.  The website advertised daily/nightly specials but the 'specials' we were told about are what is already on the webiste menu.  Lame. I'm not sure if EVERYONE (except us) in the restaurant ordered fish last night, or if this place always smells fishy, but it was bad.  Like low tide out on the wharf.
