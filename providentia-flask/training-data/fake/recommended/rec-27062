What a nice experience. Â The waiter was knowledgeable and suggested the grilled sardines. Not something I would have thought of on my own but it was great. A bit boney (just the way they are) but delicious. If you order them be prepared to do a lot of work. Greek salad was excellent as were the zucchini fritters. we really liked this place and its priced well.
