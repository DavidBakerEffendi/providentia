We were lucky enough to snag a reservation that must have cancelled and i sure am glad they did! We made our reservation through opentable and were seated promptly. i highly suggest making reservations because as we were being escorted to our table the hostess was telling a couple that it was a 2 hour wait for a table! The quac was the best i have ever had and probably will ever. it is so fresh and delish. we also ordered a pitcher of their margarita which was amazing. for my entree i wanted the crispy mahi mahi tacos but asked if i could have the fish not breaded and fried. Unfortunately our waitress checked with the kitchen and the fish was prebreaded so i opted for substituting the mahi mahi for sea bass. it was cooked to perfection. the portions are very small but i filled up on the quacamole so it was fine for me. I would highly highly recommend el vez and be sure to order the quacamole as it was my favorite part of the meal!
