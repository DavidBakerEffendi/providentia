For diners lucky enough to be granted access, Bohemian does not disappoint. The impeccable service, exquisite food options and quiet setting are the last thing one would expect at the end of the dark, door-less hallway leading to this haute little hideaway. Whether sitting at the bar or relaxing at a table, don't dare leave without trying the miso black cod; it's a dish you'll be telling people about for a while (I still am). Beverage-wise, patrons are treated to a healthy selection of sake, liquor, and beer options. Should you prefer something more exquisite, the cocktails are stout and well-crafted. To all lovers of Japanese food: do what you can to try Bohemian ASAP.
