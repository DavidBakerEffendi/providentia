What a great spot for a drink and a bite to eat.  I happened upon Tavern On Jane one cold Sunday morning in February looking for a warm place to grab some brunch.  I couldn't be more satisfied to find this nice place.  It was cozy, staff was welcoming and attentive, drinks good and food great!  Enjoyed chatting with the gentleman working the bar...super nice guy.  Next time I'm in the neighborhood, I'll definitely stop by...thanks TOJ!
