If I am looking for a bar and it's before the nighttime crowd has invaded downtown, I will always pick Good Dog.  The beverages here a decently priced, but the main appeal of Good Dog for me is easily the food. And if you want to get even more specific, it's the fries. I love the fries here. I mean I love the fries. I order the burger (which is also delicious and affordable) just so I can get those fries in my mouth. The nice blend of sweet potato/potato-potato fries go well with every beverage I have ordered here and I am always sad and depressed when they have somehow magically disappeared from my plate causing me to consider ordering  more. The only way Good Dog could make me even happier is if they expanded into a larger space so there would always be a guaranteed table waiting for me to sit at.
