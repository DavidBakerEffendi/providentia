So Good I Want To Glue My Tongue To Stuff In Their Kitchen It has been brought to my attention that people on Yelp are starting to feel bad for me because they think I only go to horrible places where guys shave their facial hair into the shape of lightning bolts and where Balison pukes on someone.  I wanted to dispell that myth.  I actually go out and have a great time and enjoy the place I'm at often - it's just not very interesting to write about on Yelp.  So fine.  I'm going to write a review about a place I ate at this weekend that was so good that I'm considering giving up the gym in favor of sitting in a corner in this restaurant and becoming a paella-faced 400 lb land monster.   Are you kidding?  This place made BRUSSEL SPROUTS taste like the best thing since carrot cake (highest compliment ever, and if you hate carrot cake then I hate you).  I went with three of my girlfriends, and I think we shocked the waitstaff with how much we ordered and then actually consumed.  But whatever.  If someone was like hey why don't you try this fig that's been stuffed with all kinds of delicious cheeses and then wrapped in bacon and then given a hug by God, wouldn't you eat it too, and then everything else on the menu?  I thought so. The staff was really knowledgeable and helpful - for instance, they suggested we stop ordering when we just kept shouting the names of items on the menu.  And they were right.  They paced our meal perfectly, and one waiter was really excited about clearing our empty plates.  And ya know, if you can get excited about that then you have the right attitude.  Maybe he knew he was serving Jen S. though and didn't want me to write a review about how I wanted his face to explode.  It's cool though, waiter guy, I was into you. So that's it.  There you have it.  Jen S. went out and had fun and no one vomited and no one went on OkCupid.  5 stars for me for having a normal time.
