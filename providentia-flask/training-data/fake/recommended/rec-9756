i came here with my family and friends for my birthday and had a great time. the decor is very stylish and modern and yet very cozy. the service was great.  very attentive and professional without being overbearing. the food was absolutely delicious (for the most part)!  we were a party of 9 and we ordered at least half the items on the menu :)   the standout dishes: CEVICHE!!!!!!!!!  yummy.  get it! we had the "mixto" and "limeno". both were amazing, super fresh and flavorful.  they are exactly what they are supposed to be. and i've been to peru.  the 2 seafood entrees (JALEA and ARROZ CON MARISCOS) were really, really good!  the BEEF STEAK was done perfectly!  tamal octubre was very good and different than any other tamales i've tried... but i have to say that their famous chicken was good, but nothing to write home about.  i can get a similar version of rotisserie chicken from Costco :)  and i was very DISAPPOINTED BY PALTA RELLENA con camarones.  i loved this dish in peru and got it every time i saw it on the menu (which was often).  but in pio pio it was nothing like that.  the "stuffing" of the avocado was very blah!  empanadas also were just ok.   for dessert we had flan and chocolate cake, and both were delicious! pisco sours are good.  a little too sweet, but very enjoyable. all in all, everyone in my party LOVED THE FOOD and the AMBIANCE was great. i am taking the star off for the SUPER LOUD MUSIC.  seriously, it was definitely distracting.  great spanish music but please pio pio, take it down a notch (or two) and let the people hear each other at the table.
