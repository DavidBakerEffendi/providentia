This place is deafeningly loud. The parking situation sucks. You may have to wait a while for a table on Friday and Saturday nights, especially if you're with a large group (I think you can call ahead now, I know last time I called they said they didn't take reservations.) Sometimes you will feel as if your server dropped off the face of earth (and if you call him from more than 10 feet away, he may not hear you because of the jackhammer volume music and diners. BUT the food is here is excellent! I'm a Cuban and I know good Cuban food. These guys can cook. The sangria is great, but it's weak. The good thing is they're BYO and your server will gladly dump it in (I don't recall a corking fee, I could be wrong.) The Lechon is the best you can find in Jersey. The Ropa Vieja is awesome. The Yuca is good. The Congri is good. I'm pissed that they took off the BBQ Guava Ribs, though. That was the best item on the menu by far.
