Savory. Fresh. Relaxed. Great vibe. Thirst quenching Red Sangria. I literally go there with my family every Saturday for lunch and sometimes I manage to get there on Friday's as well. The Manager is so observant and mindful of the energy and service. The wait staff know us and treat us like family.  So welcoming!  Love the food. my favorite foods: Paella for two, bombas, croquetas de bacalao, pan con tomate, tortilla espanola and the pitcher of Sangria. We order that every time and it never tires. LOVE them.
