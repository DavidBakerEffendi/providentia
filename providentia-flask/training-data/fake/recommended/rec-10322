This place has a great vibe. Whether you have a work group that you want to take to a happy hour, or a date you would want to take to a romantic setting, Salute provides the perfect atmosphere. The location is also a can't miss, with close proximity to the park and Bushnell Theater. The service makes you feel like family. After just two trips to Salute, Jimmy (one of the owners) knew my name. The guy has an elephant memory. The food is incredible, particularly the Rose Pasta and Chicken Gnocchi. I have tried everything on the menu and have yet to find something I don't like.
