Decent food - all of the small plates sounded amazing, but we only tried three.  The falafel buns and brussels sprouts with figs were both a little underwhelming.  The pork pizzette, however, was delicious. Service was friendly and attentive, although I should hope so on a Tuesday night when there are only 2 other tables (never filled up in the 2 hours we were there). The place was smaller than I anticipated, very dimly lit, but a comfortable atmosphere. I would try this place again, there's a lot more food I want to taste!
