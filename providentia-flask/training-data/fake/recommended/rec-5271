I've passed this place probably dozens and dozens of times but never visited Intrinsic until today. I needed a pick me up after a brutal spring semester final, and since this cafe was just down the street, I thought why not take a peek? Well I went in and found it odd that there was only one patron inside on a late Tuesday night... I guess the students of Rutgers/NJIT were probably done with finals and not around? Anyways--I wasn't sure what to order, so I asked them to whip up whatever they thought was good... and I ended up paying for a shake that reminded me of those Asian Popsicles that my parents used to get when I was a kid--super random right? The shake tasted pretty good--might have been a little artificial--but it was good enough for the late night. Service was actually really good as well... the person who made my drink was super cheery and polite--I'm definitely coming back to try the boba.
