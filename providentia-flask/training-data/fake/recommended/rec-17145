Great local spot. Great home made ice cream. The food is always good and consistent.  It's like a mom and pop diner. Some nights they have a magician and sometimes love music.  One time during the holidays we got a bouquet of flowers. This is a real business and I would recommend anyone to stop by and see for yourself. You won't be disappointed.
