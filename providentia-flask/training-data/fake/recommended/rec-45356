The food and the drinks here are always delicious. Clean, highbrow, complex cocktails, and warming, hearty food. Even the asapragus is good. The setting is great - very Brooklyn-edison-bulb-underspoken-chic. The staff may have stepped out the Portlandia Season 2 opener, The Dream of the (18)90's Is Alive In Portland. In the dozens of times I've eaten there, I've found them to be pretty cold. There are a couple of male waiters that will smile back at you or share a kind casual word, but all in all they are concerned with getting your order, capable of answering any and all questions about food and drink with expertise, and only going to have conversations with their colleagues. I once saw a waiter eating the chocolate mousse from a shot glass in the back of the bar and told him it looked pretty tasty. He blushed and joked about being ravenous, then exclaimed about all the great ingredients with true sincere joy. I felt like I'd won a big prize and/or seen a unicorn. I've learned to not take out of towners here because of the indifferent service, but NYers know the deal, and I love taking city types to the beautiful yummy spot.
