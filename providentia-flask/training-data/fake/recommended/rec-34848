Small place that serves up excellent German (actually its Austrian) cuisine. The last time I came here it was only for dessert and digestifs and the tortes were so good. This time the four of us ordered a cheese and cold cuts platter, goulash with spetzl and of course many different types of sausage- all of which was delicious. The beer is legit and is served in proper 1 liter mugs. The only negative thing I would have to say is that we waited over an hour for a table! Thankfully, we could wait at a nearby bar and since the peeps I was with used to live upstairs from Katja they were great friends with the owner so the service was good. So no stars off.
