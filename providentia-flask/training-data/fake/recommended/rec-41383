3.5 stars for brunch arrived on the early side at noon and got seated as soon as our whole party arrived. tables are pretty cramped along the wall, so there's a lot of 'pardon my ass in your face' as you squeeze into your space. the whole interior is pretty dark since there's only two windows in the front and they use very dim lighting. had the old-timey feel with tin ceilings, big impressive bar, antiqued mirrors, and lots of exposed wooden beams. service was great.. efficient, friendly and solicitous. our food took a while to appear; however, our appetizer and drinks tided us over nicely. the donuts weren't soft pillows like i was expecting -- seemed like they were made with whole wheat flour and were pretty firm. my cocktail was the red rooster: sriracha, tomato juice, horseradish, lemon juice & vodka... i loved this! uncomplicated, perfectly spicy and savory and not overwhelmed by the hot sauce, and didn't leave me straining horseradish bits from my teeth. the baked eggs (cannellini beans, eggs, sausage & pecorino) was a hot soothing casserole of saltiness. i ate it all, but i also drank at least 4 glasses of water with it. my companions got the rye benedict (egg poached well, potato ball thing was good, but biscuit didn't stand out), and the poached eggs. overall i vastly prefer dumont and dressler to rye... still i'd come back to try out the dishes other ppl have raved about: meatloaf, short ribs, etc.
