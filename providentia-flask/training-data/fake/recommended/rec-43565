I found this place via Yelp and read how it was the bomb dot com. I finally tried it out today. Walk by and you may miss the place. I wouldn't recommend eating there since there's only about 6 tables. After I ordered my food, I was a little apprehensive since the sanitary grade was a 'B', but I had already ordered and paid so I was committed. There was a pic of the Chef and Guy Fieri, so I knew I was in for a good meal, sanitary scores be damned. I got the veggie and tofu hand pulled noodles in veggie broth. I was not disappointed. For $5.75, I got a large container of noodle soup and a small side container of tofu. I didn't wind up mixing the tofu since it had its own sauce and was very soft. It didn't matter since the noodle soup was great on its own. The noodles are fresh and tasty, so much so that you can tell they were just made. I didn't finish my meal since it was way too much food for lunch. But for $6, you really can't go wrong. Cash only, so plan accordingly.
