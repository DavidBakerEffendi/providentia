Being a true paleo on vacations in NYC, I find it a real struggle to escape all the crappy-pesticides-gmos foods all around the city. I heard about HU kitchen while visiting paleo website and decided to give it a try despite the so-so reviews. To summarize my experience: little food, expensive and untasty. Grass fed beef burger was a big nono!! My wife and i were still hungry after our lunch! Definitely the worst sign! Glad we had our emergency nuts ;) Stop if you're in an emergency, otherwise walk an extra mile to the nearest Bareburger and you'll get the quantity and the taste for a fair price.
