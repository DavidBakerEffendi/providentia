Tia Pol is my favorite tapas bar in all of NYC. The staff is super great and friendly and has no hipper-than-thou-self-important ego (*ahem* Boqueria). It does get expensive depending on what you end up drinking and eating. It's also the most authentic Basque-region styled tapas bar I've encountered in NYC. My friends and I like to get the patatas bravas when we expect more than two glasses of wine a person. I love the navajas y almejas (razor clams and cockles), and to sop up the broth with hunks of bread. Sometimes, the quality of it varies. One time it was salty and they were out of razor clams (which adds a sweetness to the dish). The fava bean puree on bread, with crumbs of beyos cheese is soooo good. The almonds are a must. The pinchos morunos are perfectly seasoned. The paquetitos de jamón (ham) y alcachofas (stuffed with artichokes) are literally "little packets" and although they're yummy is a very tiny portion, even for tapas. Gamas a la plancha is a necessary plate to try. The huevos rellenos (stuffed eggs/deviled eggs) are picture perfect and taste just as good. The assorted spanish cheeses is also a great end instead of the traditional dessert.   The sangria jug is refreshing (but somewhat sweet) on a hot summer evening. You may have to wait for an hour and half or more for a bar seat but it's a worthwhile experience.
