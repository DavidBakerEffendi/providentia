First time I went to Tops, I had the crab hash, which is exactly what it sounds like - corned beef hash, except with crab meat instead of corned beef.  They give you big, generous amounts of real crab meat, but somehow it wasn't quite as amazing as it sounded.  The red velvet pancakes are another fan favorite, but I found them to be too sweet for breakfast. Service was great, fast and very friendly.  The waitress even patiently accommodated my brother-in-law, who has a habit of asking thousands of questions about the menu anytime he goes to a new place.
