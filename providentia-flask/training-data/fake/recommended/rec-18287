Stay away from the Sunday brunch. I do hope the rest of the week the food is better. This was the worst brunch I've ever experienced. The eggs were greasy. I sent it back and got the french toast which was just soggy bread drenched in sugar water with a mile of whip cream on top. We were the ONLY people there which I guess should have been a huge warning. Lesson learned.
