Place is super friendly and inexpensive. In addition to bahn mi's, summer rolls, fruit teas with jellies, and vietnamese coffee, Nam Nam now serves pho on Mondays & Weekends. I haven't been able to try their pho yet, but I was told it's made on the premises--hence the select days. Other than that, my usual go to is the pork and the chicken bahn mi. I also tried the chicken bun noodle dish. I am not sure if this is the way it's supposed to be prepared, but the ratio of chicken/veg to vermicelli noodles was off--much more noodles to my liking. I'll stick with the banh mi's.
