I've heard a lot about this place, but wasn't really expecting much, just another burger joint. Boy, was I wrong... We had gotten there at 12 and there were only 2 other diners, which seemed odd for a place I thought was always packed /had a line. Paroused the menu and decided in the original burger (I think it's just called the umami burger? Lol). The prices seemed decent,  ~$12, though I was expecting a tiny burger. It was a decent size. I don't remember everything that was on it. All I remember was the amazingly soft bun(brioche) that the little burger from heaven was served on. The first bite and my mouth just exploded with, you guessed it, umami! Lol, I've never really tried truffle flavored foods before, the savoriness from the burger was just, heavenly.. The cheese was nice and gooey, and the truffle sauce was so good that me and my friend ended up just licking our plates clean, lol (not something I ordinarily do in public, mind you).  We got the truffle ice cream cause, why the hell not. Maybe it was for a more sophisticated taste bud, but ice cream and savory did not bode well for this... The ice cream had chunks of chocolate and a really salty truffle caramel sauce on it. It tasted sorta... Funky? Me and my friend split it and could not finish it. Definitely not your average burger! Next time, I think I'll pass on the funky truffle ice cream though, otherwise definitely coming back! We were so lost in our burgers, that we didn't realize the place was full and there was a line going well past the entrance, lol. I think we came right as it was opening, not sure how long the wait would have been otherwise.
