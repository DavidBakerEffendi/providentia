We walked over to Cafe Lift from our hotel on Market St and, at first, it seemed like we had the wrong address because the area is a little sketchy. There were 5 of us one Saturday morning and the wait was about 30 minutes. It wasn't too bad as it was an oddly warm day outside and there was outdoor seating available. The place was packed and we were able to order coffee and tea while we waited. I had the chai latte which was pretty good. For our meal, we had to split the cannoli french toast because it sounded awesome and it definitely was. I would recommend splitting it because it's heavy and comes in a hefty portion. I believe I ordered a vegetarian frittata for my meal which was great. Â It's definitely a spot worth checking out.
