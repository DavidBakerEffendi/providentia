Squeeze tight! The person with the most space in this restaurant is the bartender. The dining tables generally seat two to four, although there seems to be a larger, separated area for private parties in the back. You just cannot expect to sit comfortably at the bar if you have any bulge. Somehow they think that they could  squeeze in two tables to the side of the bar AND three tall chairs in front of those two tables. The poor waiter had to wiggle in and out. Anyways, bad dining configuration aside, everything I had here on the night of NYE fixed menu was lovely and delicious. My faves were the beef with lobster risotto and the tuna tartar. The bartender who took our orders was super nice and checked in often and the waiter explained each dish carefully.   Overall, a great place for a date or just a few drinks.
