Room Service was great! It was a birthday dinner for me. I made reservations for 10, and the number dropped to 7 by the time I got there. When I walked in, it was packed but the ambiance was nice. It's a bit on the narrow side, but the energy in the room makes up for it. After getting there, I had 2 people text me that they were on their way, I told the hostess, and she was so kind and gracious about it. They extended our group by adding another table and voila problem solved. Next our waiter "Paul" was so on top of things! He was polite, and got every single order right! The food was excellent. I had the Room Service Pad Thai w/ extras (big portions, I had left overs) and the Room with a View drink. Both delicious. I sampled my friends duck dish, and snapper, and the golden fritters. Everything was yummy. For dessert, my friends got me the chocolate mousse, and the RS staff sang Happy Birthday to me! This was a no fuss experience. I love this place, and so did my friends. I would definitely recommend it for large groups or if you're looking for great food and a good time! It is a little boisterous in there, but worth it!
