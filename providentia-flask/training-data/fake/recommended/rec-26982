Fabulous evening on all levels. Called at last minute and were able to get our preferred seat over looking prep area. Had cheese plate, oysters, mushroom toast/bacon poached egg, monk fish, and hanger steak. Everything was fabulous. We ate at four restaurants on top lists of where to eat and this was the best in Burlington.
