Came here for the first time with a living social deal.  The food was ahhh-maaaz-ing!  The deal allows you to choose 5 courses.  I had pork tenderloin, cheese plate, butternut squash bisque, steak with snap peas, and creme brulee.  Everything was super delicious, and I was surprised by the larger size of the portions, in fact I could only finish 2 of my three courses.  The deal also came with a bottle of wine.  On deciding which bottle to purchase, the waitress allowed us to taste test, which was great.  Service and food was excellent and I will definitely be returning.
