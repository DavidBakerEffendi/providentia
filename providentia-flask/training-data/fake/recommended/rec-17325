This place is good, but not great. The decor is ... Mexican. The food is pretty good. The drinks are ... pretty good. All in all, it's a nice place to eat. Despite having a full bar and bar area, and an upstairs section, the atmosphere just does not live up to its potential, in my opinion. The music is too low, the service is a bit slower than it could be (servers, smile a bit!! Â Be upbeat!!!! Something!!!!) I come here when I want a drink with dinner, NOT my first choice for good Mexican food in the area, or atmosphere.
