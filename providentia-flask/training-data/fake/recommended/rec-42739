"" to stop here after seeing 'Hey Bartender'. This place was everything I expected and more. We came in on a saturday night around midnight and had to wait for a table, but once we got inside the place 'It was on!'. The party was rocking at the bar and the bartenders looked like rockstars, and the sitting area was comfy, welcoming, and private. The staff was on point! The cocktails are amazing and the food was made perfectly. I been working in the industry for 10yrs and I was quite happy with the over all expirience. Keep it up!
