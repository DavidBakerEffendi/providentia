I ate dinner at McCrossen's the other week and it was an excellent experience with superb food, an attentive staff and a very cozy ambiance. We gave the chef liberty with what we were served, so I tried many things I normally would not eat, such as pate, pig tails, sweetbreads and bone marrow, but was pleasantly surprised by all. The pate was bursting with flavor and I really liked the harder consistency. I had never tried pig tail before, and was a little put off by the concept, but the meat was juicy and just fell off of the bone. The duck stuffing was a great side to compliment any dish. Aside from the pate, my two favorite dishes were the veal sweetbreads and the scallops. The sauces for both of these dishes were incredible and it was apparent how much effort had been put in to developing the flavor of them. The sweetbreads came with a thicker sauce that was a party in my mouth, while the scallop had a light refreshing sauce. Although I had a bad connotation of how sweetbreads would taste, I now dream of those that I ate at McCrossen's. Hats off to the chefs for giving me one of the best meals I have ever had. I highly recommend McCrossen's to anyone looking for a nice and delicious meal, and encourage diners to be adventurous with the menu. You will not be disappointed.
