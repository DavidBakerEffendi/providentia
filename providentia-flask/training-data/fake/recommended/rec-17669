Love love love the food. I usually get shrimp shumai and salmon rolls. I love that they have so many options of food other than sushi since my husband isn't a fan. Also love you get a free item when using GrubHub when you spend a certain amount. Great food at a good price but the delivery guy always annoys me. Either they ring my bell like crazy people, knock on my door like the are the police, question if I paid online and call to check then just drive away without saying a word. Would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the weird delivery people. (I must note that only on my last delivery did I get a nice delivery guy!)
