I've been to many Japanese noodle places in Manhattan, and this one is definitely not top of the list. We ordered Washu beef udon and Katsu Toji Soba. They taste ok, but the quantity is small. I'm not saying the taste is bad, but given the price it sets on par with Ippudo, it's disappointing. The space is crowded, but the environment feels cozy though. Maybe this place is good for other type of food, but for noodles, try Ippudo or Sapporo.
