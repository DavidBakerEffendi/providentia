Best meal in New Haven right now. First of all the interior is stunning. But the food is just spot on. Everything is simple, clean, and delicious, without trying to be French or Italian or whatever the concept is. It has influences from alot of places, but is most of all what was fresh and delicious around New Haven. The atmosphere allows a great long casual dinner, and on top of it all, the price is extremely reasonable. Two people with multiple drinks, apps, entrees, and desert and exactly 100 buck. I would pay alot more to eat that meal again.
