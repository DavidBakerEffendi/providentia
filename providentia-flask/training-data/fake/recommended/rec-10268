Rebecca B. got it right - the gluten free pizza here is AWESOME.  The staff was great and friendly, and very much into talking about all the "special needs" diets they cater to.  Apparently they have gluten free cookies and other dessert stuff too, so if you suffer with the wheat affliction, you can still satisfy your sweet tooth.   I was too filled up with pizza though, so skipped dessert!  One person with a pretty big appetite could easily eat the whole pie; and two people with not so big appetites would probably be satisfied sharing.   The only thing keeping this from 5 Stars was the gluten free beer - Redbridge.  Its the most available GF brand, but also the worst.  Stepping up to a Estrella Damm would make this a place I would have to work hard to stay away from.
