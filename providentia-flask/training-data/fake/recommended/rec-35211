I must have gone to Katsuhama on the wrong day! I lived in Japan for five years, and trust me (and my increasing waistline) when I say that I have eaten LOTS of katsu. Approximately 33% of my blood is katsu at this very moment, to be honest. So I went to Katsuhama with high hopes and an empty stomach. Upon arriving, we were taken to a table in the back. The corner table, sandwiched between a couple talking loudly in Korean and an Important Business Meeting (tm) happening directly behind my chair. This is fine though, and not at all the restaurant's fault. I ordered the kurobuta miso katsu, remembering how delicious the miso katsu was in Nagoya and hoping to enjoy that magic once again. First came out the miso soup and pickles. The pickles were great, and I loved the soup. A while later, my katsu and rice appeared. The rice was fine, perfect consistency. But I couldn't say the same about my katsu. It was extremely fatty and tough, far more than any kurobuta katsu I had in Japan. The miso smelled a bit off to me -- I mean, as off as something already fermented can smell. There was also not nearly enough of it to give the meat the proper flavor. The katsu seemed over-cooked and was extremely oily. After seeing all the great reviews on Yelp, I was disappointed that my entree was a soggy, tough, overdone nonevent. (The center two pieces were fantastic though, for whatever it's worth!) Overall, it was okay. I want to come back and try their regular buta katsu sometime and see if it's better. Perhaps it's better for the fit of my pants, though, if it's not..!
