I love this place. The atmosphere is great. It's very cozy and on a corner with lots of windows. The food in nothing fancy and it's not supposed to be. My sister I went on a Saturday night late. There was no wait and we got a nice booth by the window. I love watching the sights of the city while you are in a nice cozy restaurant. We had the rum punch which was very tasty. We had the Mac and cheese with bacon. The bacon had a nice hickory flavor to it that reminded me of fall. We both got grilled cheese and tomato soup. Everything was delicious as always. It's casual fun food in a relaxed environment. It knows what it's supposed to be and it achieves that.
