took some clients here for dinner.  client is italian guy from sicily.  he was a big fan of the dinner.  we were in a big group of 8 so we had the set menu.  highly recommend this as we get a nice tasting of everything.  the gnocci was incredible.  fluffy light clouds.  i'd go again here for sure.  maybe next time w/o clients.
