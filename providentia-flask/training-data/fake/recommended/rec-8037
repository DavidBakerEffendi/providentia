I've been here 3 times and have had stellar service every time!  I get treated like family when I go.  Ok...my brother is the sous chef there...but even when he's not working I get a warm genuine welcome. The food?  Fantastic!  Being vegan I have a tough time finding vegan friendly options, let alone something that's actually good!  I highly recommend the Vegan Buffalo Cheesesteak and the Seitan Chickpea Dosas.   Cute, cozy atmosphere.
