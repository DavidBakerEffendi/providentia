If you ever get to try the lemon bar for dessert, it is to die for. The perfect blend of slightly sweet and tangy, with a refreshing texture and graham cracker crust, so nice on a warm day to finish off a meal. It came with homemade pistachio ice cream..mmm. It was our table's consensus that the strawberry rhubarb crisp was a close second, especially a la mode. The peanut butter pie was normal, thick and chocolatey, but nothing extremely special. Now that I've established myself as the ultimate fatty, I'll just say a few things about the main course. The shrimp salad was fresh, with crisp greens and just enough dressing (i hate soggy salad), my friend Lynnley swears that their burger is THE best, and it pretty much looked that way. It is overflowing with bacon and cheese..really, how can they go wrong? Oh and they have awesome outdoor seating.
