Ok so there are a lot of reviews on here from people that actually eat those stupid rice filled burritos from the chain restaurants like Qdoba, Chipotle, etc. Do me a favor and go to the Southwest...pick a state...or even better, go to Mexico and go somewhere authentic, i.e. not a Qdoba, Chipotle, etc. and find me a burrito filled with rice. It won't happen because its not natural and its dumb...and...(last and)...its not delicious. The real beauty behind a burrito though is that its simple and anybody can get their burrito the way they want. Â I want to say that people who like rice in their burritos are dumb...but that's not what burritos are about. They're about taking the most beautiful form of bread in the world, "the tortilla", and rolling it up with whatever you want! Some people, like Tim at work, want to put bacon in the burrito, others want yummy chicken, steak, chorizo, lengua, carnitas, chicharone, beans, and of course even (not yummy) rice in theirs. I can't give El Fuego 5 stars because there wasn't anything special or amazing about the place or the food, but, you do get to pick whatever you want to put in it (with limits, no penguin or kiwi), the tortillas are good, the guacamole is good, they have a few options on salsa, are authentic enough to have Tapatillo on the counters, and the guys behind the counters weren't jerks. Unless they were from New Jersey and I couldn't tell, then they would still be jerks, just subtle jerks. Oh yeah...the burritos are HUGE too, so that's nice too!
