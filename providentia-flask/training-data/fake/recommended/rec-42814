This place rocks. Great for casual Sunday afternoon, happy hour and even fri/sat night. I do not drink beer so cannot personally comment on that, but friends who do live their craft beer selection and the opportunity to take home a "growler" of their favorite. So what about it appeals to me? First of all, it's just a really cool comfortable vibe. I also love the drinks at the cocktail bar and during the day their coffee is delicious. They play good music, all the bartenders are awesome, the crowd is good (very social and friendly). The only improvement I think they could make is to expand the food menu. They have some great snacks (hello truffle popcorn), sandwiches and I personally love the homemade pickles and cheese plate. But because it tends to be a popular spot pto go on a sun afternoon/afterwork evening, I often find myself there with hungry friends who want a meal and we have to go elsewhere and then come back.
