The stars are for the fact that they choose to serve their eggplant Parmesan over spinach instead of pasta which is great! Unfortunately the Parmesan was like a layered slab of friend eggplants with barely any sauce. When I requested more sauce it took 15 minutes to arrive and cost extra. The red sauce is unspectacular which is a bummer as that's a pretty important part of making any good Italian meal. There was no spice to it aside from salt. The most disconcerting thing was that they charged us for a drink a friend bought for someone at our table. Seriously. Thankfully, Burlington has much better options than this restaurant! Don't waste your money here!
