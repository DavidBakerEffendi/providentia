"Spanish fly" This place with worth the trip no matter which neighborhood or borough where you dwell.  If you are local then you definitely need to make a trip here for a pre-dinner drink and tapas or a full dining experience. What it is: Super authentic Basque Spanish cuisine.  This restaurant has a very cosmopolitan Spanish feel --- not a caricature of one that too many restaurant design to.  Only thing I don't like is that it's little cramped, servers have that haughty air about them --- definitely something your gf will like. Felicida - It's a date place - Outstanding wine list - They have one small private dining room that is perfect for 6 people - The tortillas are amazing (potato cakes nothing to Do with the Mexican ones) - One of the rare places wher you can get Pintxos - Prices are reasonable Lo Malo * Tables are mostly small and bar style * It's screaming violently to have outdoor seating * If you sit at the bar near the front, there is a distinct pork odor that may not be desirable Note that the menu is very Northern Spain, Basque.  You won't find the "Americanized" Spanish tapas here like Calamari, spicy meatballs or patatas bravas.  But why not try something different!
