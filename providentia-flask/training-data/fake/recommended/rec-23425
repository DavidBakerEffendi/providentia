Burgers are fantastic. A really nice addition to the neighborhood. I hope they keep their current chef around -- he or she is going a great job. Service is just fine, always friendly. The atmosphere always lacks a little liveliness, but you're in and out rather quickly. I think this would change if they offered beer. When I was last there, BYOB seemed to be acceptable.
