I was very excited to learn that Rex 1516 had a gluten free menu.  That was enough to bring my friend and I to the restaurant.  We didn't have to wait long and the staff was attentive and pleasant.  I was sorely disappointed when I realized I should have read past gluten free.  There isn't much in the way of gluten free and vegetarian - just fair warning.  I compromised with a salad which was tasty and dessert for dinner.  It was ok.
