I've heard about this place for some time and am ecstatic that I finally had a meal there.  The bruschetta was fantastic.  The braised beef ravioli was even better.  The pasta was cooked just slightly al dente and the beef was full of flavor while being as tender as could be.  On top of the food, the establishment being BYOB is just an added benefit.  It was a bit loud, with many larger parties.  That being said, I can certainly deal with that minor inconvenience to enjoy the food.
