I am a pasta lover and live in Midtown West -- why did I not know about this place before?! I did a low-carb diet all week long in anticipation of this all-I-can-eat pasta dinner awaiting me on Saturday evening.  It was well worth the mini-dieting!  Of the three pastas of the day, pesto spaghetti with green beans, mushroom ravioli, and penne with vodka sauce and shrimp, my least favorite was the pesto but it was still good.  I wish I had had more room in my stomach for the other two.  Our waiter was very friendly and the staff was prompt to bring out additional helpings of pasta that were always warm and fresh.  The caesar salad was very good, too.  Oh and the white bean spread they start you off with - soooo delicious.  I need to find the recipe for it immediately. I was too full from pasta to try any dessert, but I will surely be back here again!
