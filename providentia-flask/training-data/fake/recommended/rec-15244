As soon as i got off the plane, got my rental car, i made a B line straight to Johns roast pork! Got a Roast pork with sharp provolone and spinach, it comes on a toasted sesame roll which is great because the roast pork and spinach have a lot of moisture and without a toasted roll it would be all mushy.  The bread held its crunch on the outside while the inside soaks up just enough juices from the pork and spinach to make it juicy.  The pork is tender and the spinach is a great match.  Pretty darn good sandwich.  yelp.com/biz_photos/john… Also got a Cheesesteak with onions and sharp provolone, it was my first official Cheesesteak in Philly.  I wasn't really impressed, with this one, i preferred the one back home.  They use the same toasted sesame roll as the pork sandwich I found it to be too dry and bread-y in this application.  I think with this bread you need to get it with wiz, i feel like that would have done the trick.  yelp.com/biz_photos/john… Being a roast pork and Cheesesteak newbie, my inexperience showed and i ordered wrong.  There are 2 lines, one for roast pork and another for cheesesteaks.  If you are ordering one of each you have to order one from each station, i of course tried to order both from one line.  The guy (and other customers) was nice enough to let me cut in front of the other line and order my cheesesteak, because i didn't know how to order.  They were really nice about it.  I've been told that at Pats and Gino's they kick you out and make you go to the back of the line. Each sandwich cost about $8 - $9.  I like that there are more choices with cheese; american, sharp and mild provolone, and wiz.  Sharp provolone is 75¢ extra.  There is a small parking lot in the back or just park along the street.
