Very disappointed.  My family went the day before and they took me back the next day.  I love, chocolate lava cake and they had a truffle cake that was sure to please anybody who love anything resembling it.  To my surprise, my dish came out first, before two different beverages.  If you know anything about a chocolate cake, it should take some tome to prepare, not just five minutes.  The chocolate was not oozing out of the center of the cake the way it should - and only warm.  The cake was obviously prepared earlier, and nuked.  It was overdone and much to my surprise, the ice cream that was suppose to come with it was not fit for a baby.  When the menu says a scoop of ice cream, it doesnt mean a tablespoon.  Im not lying.  It was laughable.  I spent over thirteen dollars.  The final laughable moment was the plate.  It was totally flat.  No rim, just flat with a graph sheet design on it.  Now the cake came with the cake sitting off to the right, a tiny dish with a tablespoon of ice cream.  In a stainless steal cup with a shaker top on it, half filled with melted chocolate.  Im supposed to pour the melted chocolate on top and then use a spoon to eat it, on a flat plate.   Since i had never been there the waiter explained what i was supposed to do it.  What shocked me is that - without asking - he proceeded to pour the melted chocolate over the cake.   Now I dont mind spending money on a delicious  desert, but when i spend good money -  it better be worth it.  The price should math the atmosphere.  It was nothing more than a cafe style bestro.  I had to sit in a cafe with a family nearby with 2 unruly children, not to mention a mom who had no problem with yelling for her child to come back after running.   So for those who want a lovely experience - dont waste your time with this place. You'll be dissappointed and your wallet will suffer along with it.
