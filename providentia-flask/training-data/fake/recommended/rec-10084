wow! I'm surprised to see the rating is almost like per se here Halal is everywhere in NYC. Honestly there's no big difference between those sold in this cart of other cart at corners in Manhattan. Personally I enjoy the chicken over rice whenever I visit it. It's the long long long waiting makes the experience special. Â And the final food in hand is like a prize to show off! And you can't complain for something you waited for that long right? Its business hour is also attractive to me too. -- Man it's so hard to find yummy food at that area than area below 14th street. There's a new Halal opened close to my place which tasted no difference to me. So I'll probably forget the 53rd 6th one. To tourists, it still worth a taste. I mean sitting in public area eating cart food is one the things I really appreciate living in NYC. And if you find my rating somehow trustworthy, please stop by any Halal cart you encounter to, and pick the chicken over rice, saving your time to visit more place.
