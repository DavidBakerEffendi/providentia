Yum Yum Yum! What can i say, i've been a fan of Umami Burger since my CA days. SLOPPY MAMI is scrumptious. The original burger with the mushroom is delicious and the best you will get if you don't eat beef. while i love the fries the onion rings are not my favorite! Their garlic aoli and other sauces are a great condiment! I truly enjoy their burgers and it's always worth the wait! PS. - The Santa Monica location rocks with their outdoor seating
