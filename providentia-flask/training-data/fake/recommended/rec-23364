All I can say is baby pig!  I know that doesn't sound too appetizing to many of you, and I had my doubts, but it was delicious.  Osteria offers "baby pig" as a special on many nights and I'm sure to reserve a plate as soon as I sit down because they frequently run out.  FYI...it's not an actually baby pig on your plate but rather certain cuts that are incredible. Great wine list, great menu, amazing food.  The sommelier is one of the best I've dealt with.  Don't be embarrassed to let him know what you want to spend, and don't feel like you have to crack open your safe to enjoy a night here.  However, unless you order pizza (I haven't but keep saying I'll try it) a meal here is going to cost you.  It's not the kind of place I go often, but when I do I really enjoy it.
