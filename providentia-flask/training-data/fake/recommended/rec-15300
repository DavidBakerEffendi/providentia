I do not even know where to begin with this one. La Petite France has got to be one of my favorite locations in all of West Hartford. Okay, yes, I am a fan of their macarons, but there salads and their breads, I mean it is absolutely fresh every single time I go there. I truly recommend this one to anybody who is in the mood for something different and for a taste of France. You won't regret the visit.
