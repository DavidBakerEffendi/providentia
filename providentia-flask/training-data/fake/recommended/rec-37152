If a friend is in the mood for some semblance of authentic Chinese I would normally tell them to top up and head on over to Queens for the real Chinatown of New York in Flushing. This is usually met with protest and occasional tears until one party gives up. In retrospect I figure it's good that people are afraid of outer boroughs--lets keep those tourists and hipsters at bay. But this for once wasn't the case for me finding myself in downtown Manhattan eating Chinese food this past Saturday. After a little afternoon tea we were hungry for some grub and found ourself on the famous Mott Street for Big Wong Kong. While waiting outside it was only then that we noticed the giant "B" rating. Apparently I was feeling a bit daring that day and decided what the hell, let's go for it. We're in Chinatown after all. After living in Boston for college, I forgot what good Chinese food tasted like and was pleasantly surprised with our food. I had the beef with broccoli...not the safest but my bravery paid off. I was back in NYC! The city's Chinatown shut me up that day but I'll still tell folks to head to Queens. Expect your typical not overly friendly and rushed service that's common with Chinese restaurants. Don't take it personal, and be happy that your food comes out fast and hot! You'll have to flag the staff down if you want more food or water and don't forget to leave your "xie xies" at the door, we're in NY, it's 唔該 (mh goiiiiii).
