Delicious, inventive sandwiches. Have tremendously enjoyed everything I've tried here, especially the fried chicken & kimchi and the cubano sandwiches. The side salads and potato wedges are interestingly seasoned and a great complement to the sandwiches. The "large" size is intense -- I would recommend getting the smaller size, which is enough for all but the hungriest of people. If you come here during lunch time, expect a small wait for your food.
