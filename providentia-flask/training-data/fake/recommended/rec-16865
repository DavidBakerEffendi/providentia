Been here half a dozen times. Finally time for a review. Never disappointed. Perfect spot on a cold winter day up here in Vt. Small dining room, a few tables outside in the summer. You'll notice by the decor that the focus is on the food. Amazing stock broth in all the pho. Â Ingredients taste fresh and well prepared. Large shrimp as well. Above average fried noodle dishes too. Portions well worth the money. This is a definite local go to for the family and I.
