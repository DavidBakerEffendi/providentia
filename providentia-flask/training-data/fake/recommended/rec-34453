I'm so excited a new lunch spot has opened on pratt- we are definitely in need.  I agree to the prior guy that they are still working out some kinks, but everything so far that I've gotten has been really good, and I really encourage folks to give it a try so that it stays and doesn't fail like so many other places on pratt. What I've tried so far and really liked- bubble tea, coffee, smoothies, the santa fe chicken and the burrito bowl.  All have been really really good.   We should all collectively try to get this place business so it doesn't fail!!
