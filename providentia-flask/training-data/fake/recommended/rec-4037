We came here because I was in search of somewhere that'd feed us breakfast close to 3pm. We ordered brunch and it seriously arrived in like 60 seconds. I may have never gotten freshly cooked food that fast at a restaurant. Both vegetarians and meat eaters left happy, full, and satisfied and without spending much money. This place embodies the *good* aspects of stereotypical American food/diners.
