Pulled pork sandwich is awesome. I hear good things about their Mac & cheese and iced teas but I only go for one thing... pulled pork. The tables are a bit too close together. It was getting busy when we were leaving and I had to zig zag amongst the incoming crowd and people waiting. . but wooooo... Pulled pork! :)
