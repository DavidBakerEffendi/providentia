Small and cozy and oh so good!  The fish is fresh, portions are generous and food presentation is done well too.  Huge selection of specialty rolls, for instance, a "special" spicy tuna roll which was topped off with tempura flakes.   The prices at Iron Chef House are insanely low and comparable to many other sushi joints in the Brooklyn Heights/Carroll Gardens area which lag far behind Iron Chef House in terms of quality and restaurant ambiance.   I forgot how good this place is until I came here this past weekend.  Now I  won't go anywhere else  in the Heights for sushi.
