A shame because this place has unique flavors and delicious food. But small portions for the price. The Ceviche appetizer had only 4 shrimps, are you kidding me?? And the empanadas were tiny. I had the churrasco and although it wasn't a big piece of steak, it was very tasty. The chino latino rice - delicious! The mojitos were excellent.
