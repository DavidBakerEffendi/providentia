My husband and I visited this place for lunch on a recent philly trip. Good service, fast and accurate as well as friendly. Food was a 3.5, pretty good. We had the Miso Soup (we liked this the best of all our menu choices), the Lobster Mac and Cheese (would have been better if the pasta wasn't Orzo-made it taste like creamy rice mush a bit), and Pad Thai with lump Crabmeat ( a 4 /5). Cool 70s mod style and a full bar with cool martinis. A fun stop but not a must see, must eat in our opinion.
