AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING! I loved this place so much. Just went there today for the first time and I felt like I was in London again with their amazing Indian cuisine. Very high quality, amazing flavor, great price. I loved it! I really wish I knew about this place earlier! I ordered their Tikka Masala lunch special, next time I will try the Vindaloo I think.
