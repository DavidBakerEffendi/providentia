Awesome. This is the ONLY halal that I like. Their chicken over rice is spot on! cheap, good portions, fresh and not overly greasy! There is always a line here, but they are quite fast with their service. I love buying my halal and indulging it at central park in the warmer months. Warning: go easy on the spicy sauce! white sauce is yummy too.
