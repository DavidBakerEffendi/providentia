I'm giving Oregano Joe's 5 stars because they are getting a bad rap on Yelp. I would rate it 4 stars only because we ordered delivery that came back with a messed up pizza. BUT, I am from JERSEY and this is the closest thing you are going to get. I don't think its New Haven style, nor do I believe its brick oven, but its good pizza. Btw, they cook mushrooms well, a big plus in my book. Try them out
