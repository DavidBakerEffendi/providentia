This tapas restaurant is great because of it's no frills, no gimmicks approach to Spanish food. It is as close to authentic Spanish tapas as it gets in NYC. After traveling through the whole of Spain for a month I was eager to find something like this in New York. The only negative is that the restaurant is always cramped and the often long wait negates the 'pop in for a bite' purpose of a Spanish tapas bar. But then again that's what you get when most other Spanish restaurants in NYC are temples of mediocrity. My favorites in Tia Pol are the simplest offerings. Cockles in white wine with garlic come out sizzling and fill the space with a salty, garlicky aroma so good it can make you dizzy. The blistering green pipers with sea salt are sometimes sweet, sometimes hot but always addictive. Gildas combine intense, bold and surprisingly harmonious flavors of olive, anchovy and a hot pepper held together by a toothpick. The shrimp al ajillo are always tender and properly cooked, briny and succulent. And the croquettes are some of the best in town- get the specials Valdeon cheese ones whenever they have it- a melt-in-your-mouth explosion of silky texture, salty cheese and a perfect Â fried crunch.
