I've eaten here three times and found the food to be consistently very good, the service attentive and friendly, the decor and atmosphere cheery, comfortable, and welcoming. The mixed drinks are quite tasty, the guacamole superior, salsas with the chips above average- plus, they bring both a mild salsa cruda and spicy salsa picante with high quality chips. And the entrees....never had a bad meal here, nor have my dining companions. The enchiladas verdes were prepared well and, as with most of their dishes, offered a more than adequate portion size. The sides were good and appropriate. The people I was with had the pulled pork and the spicy shrimp. Both tasted great and offered substantial portions, though I thought the shrimp was a little tame given its description. The dining room is crowded and I've always had to wait for a table here....but it's well worth it! Best Mexican food I've found in Philadelphia.
