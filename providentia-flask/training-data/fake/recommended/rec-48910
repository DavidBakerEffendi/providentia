I went here with my family on Father's Day and it was perfect! The restaurant looks fabulous and is very comfortable and inviting. I had the mushroom ravioli and my fianc√© had the turkey burger - both of which were delicious. The service was a little slow but the place is still new so I expected there to be a few bumps. I'll definitely be back again!
