Don't get confused, there are two locations. If you go during off hours you usually will not have a problem getting in. I have gone twice and was seated right away. You can call ahead and they can put your name on the list. It is CASH only. The staff are very friendly. It is a small place, but that adds to the atmosphere. I would recommend the dipping soba - it's very fun to eat!
