I really REALLY like Siggy's. I order one of 3 things everytime I order from them. Â The Greek or Beet salads and their Greek omelets. Why not 5 stars? For some odd reason they will only serve omelets at Brunch and some other special days. I guess people don't eat eggs in the afternoon or night? It's sad as I would rather order from them but I end up ordering for another place during the week as Siggy's won't make their amazing omelets during the week. Please put it on your weekday menu.
