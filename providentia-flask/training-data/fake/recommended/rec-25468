Only had their food once so far, but it was recommended by some friends.  They told me whatever I ordered I had to make sure to get "THE rice".   We had our food delivered, so I can't comment on the decor or people.  But we were quoted a 1-hour delivery time on a Friday evening but I think we had our food within 30-35 minutes.  I had the chicken gyro platter, and also the hummus.  I don't love the bread that comes with the hummus, but the hummus itself was very good and garlicky.   Everybody really liked the food, they gave us lots of extra sauce. And the white sauce is very good.  Will definitely get takeout or delivery from them again soon!
