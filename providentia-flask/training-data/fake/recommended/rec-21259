Had my christmas dinner here with the ladies last night and i really wanted to LOVE this place, but maybe my expectations are too high and so was somewhat disappointed.   I do love the atmosphere in there, however we had a party of 5 and was seated at the round table which was really meant for 7 people, and hence it was hard to shout over the table and have a conversation together which is not expected with a group of 5.  Just something to note if you have the same number of people. The food was overall good, however i didn't leave the restaurant telling myself i have to go back.  I was more impressed with the appetizers than the entrees itself.  We had: 1.  Arugula Fennel Anchovy salad - really yummy and fresh 2.  carpaccio octopus with palm of hearts- i really liked this dish since octopus can be a bit chewy sometimes so having it thinly sliced out was much easier to eat 3.  Grilled Quail - this was the best of the 3 appies!  a bit salty but when sharing amongst 5 people, everyone got a good chunk of it.   As for entrees, the meatball was the standout dish!  Hearty flavoured and great for a cold winter's night out.  The venison was on the smaller portion side and the Cobia fish was simple/fresh (if you don't mind a bit of fishiness to your dish). Service was great and a good selection of wines!
