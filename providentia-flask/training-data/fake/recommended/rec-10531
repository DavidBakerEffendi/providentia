My favorite Turkish restaurant! Named after a neighborhood in Istanbul, this place combines a stylish decor with amazing food to give a great all around package. The mouth watering baklava is just that, mouth watering. you can tell its fresh and just oh so good. Not too sweet or hard like most other places. just about perfect. The Hummus is also fresh and delicious. If you go try the Doner Kebab or chicken special, they are both great. The wait staff is extremely pleasant and very informative. Any questions just ask. I have been here numerous times and always stayed for a couple of hours and did not feel rushed at all, in fact quite welcome. Its even better in the summer when they open the doors (and have outdoor seating) to the sidewalk. It does not get to noisy, and the tables are small enough for you to feel like you are in an intimate setting.
