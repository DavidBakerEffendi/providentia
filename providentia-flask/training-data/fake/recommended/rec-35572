Um, really good, tasty, late night, drunk dinner.  We even ate our leftovers for breakfast the next morning lol.  For $6, you can't go wrong with a lamb dinner plate!! Beware of the red sauce - it will make you cry for about 15 minutes.  One drop was enough to floor me!! The white sauce - I could swim in a pool of it.  SOO good all over your food. I really wish they had one in Philadelphia....sigh.  Can't wait to go back to New York to eat here again!
