I went here for restaurant week last year, and it did not disappoint.  It was nice to go into the city and not have to search for parking or park far.  They have a lot right outside of restaurant.  We had a large party of 12, but we were seated right away a nice big round table that allowed us to converse and see eachother without having to look down the table.  Our waiter was outstanding and very knowledgeable about the food.  The food was outstanding.  I can be very picky about Italian, but this stuff was very authentic and delicious.  The portions were large and most of us left with carry out boxes.  The prices are very reasonable, and I look forward to going back.  They opened up another one in Media a while back that I haven't tried yet, but I will definitely be getting there soon.
