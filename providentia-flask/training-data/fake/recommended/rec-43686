My husband and I explored this little gem's fare one Saturday evening. Beware, there will be a waiting list if after 5 or 6. Luckily, it wasn't too chilly that night, so we strolled around the neighborhood to kill time. When we returned, they seated us immediately. The place is fairly tiny, so expect to squeeze into your booth or table and be seated extremely close to other parties. We ordered a pitcher of the red sangria. It was alright, but tasted like it had not been aged long enough. (3 days is the norm, right?!) The waiter wasn't extremely friendly. He sensed our Southern Accents and immediately started ex-plain-ing thing ver-ry slowly for us so as to not overwhelm us by the "foreign" tapas menu. We asked specifically for the Piquillo Peppers, which they were "out" of that night due to a "nationwide shortage". We asked if he had an inkling as to when they might return. He asked us the daunting no-no question: "How long are you guys in town for?" Ha. I love that one. We LIVE here, ya jerk! Then, when my husband began explaining that he had the peppers in Barcelona a few weeks ago, (and a few months before that in vegas) and we'd come the especially for that. Needless to say, he stopped talking down to us.... Okay, it sounded like my review was going down-hill, but why the 4 stars you say? Because the taste is absolutely AMAZING! I mean, melt in your mouth, heaven on a spoon, fabulosity. From the tender and amazing lamb, to the prosciutto, to the bread smothered in tomato and spices... everything was absolutely de-LISH! The portions are even tinier than most tapas venues, and the bill will not be cheap, but you must experience the taste of this little tapas Heaven. I'll be back!
