Appetizers: Shrimp Tempura Shu Mai was great. The batter was light, the shrimp was fresh, and the spiced bean dipping sauce was really delicious and had a nice spicy kick. I highly recommend it. The pork buns (your choice of soft or cripsy Japanese buns...we got soft) were also phenomenal. The pork is flavorful and moist and it's served with cured tomatoes and spicy mayo Entree: I had the Terakawa Ramen (their signature dish, roast pork and pork bone soup). The noodles tasted freshly-made and the broth was flavored with bamboo shoots, mushrooms, ginger, scallions, and a boiled egg. The roast pork was great delicious as was the broth. I drank the broth after finishing my soup. The atmosphere was really chill and the wait staff was friendly and attentive. This place is good for groups.
