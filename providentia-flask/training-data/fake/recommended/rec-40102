National Mechanics is the kind of place that draws a certain crowd: friendly, fun, you know the type, where conversation with strangers are a breeze and the atmosphere is energetic. Alcohol is alcohol as far as I'm concerned, so I go (and return to) places for more than merely what they pour. That being said, I found that they made decent standard mixed drinks Â --- and yes, a bar can easily mess up the simplest. My wife insists that last night's was the best made Cosmo around (actually, she said it was the best ever but that may have been the alcohol talking, no pun intended). A standout for me was the bar food. Particularly the wings: Hands down the best wings I've tasted in all of Philly. Crispy and meaty, with outstanding honey BBQ sauce. Having passed the test I will definitely come back to this place with an appetite (and my usual thirst) to see what else they can do. I have a feeling I won't be disappointed.
