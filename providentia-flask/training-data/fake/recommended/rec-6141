BF ordered the shrimp with garlic sauce and he liked it. Portions are pretty big, very good price. Why the low rating? I ordered a noodle plate with chicken. Smelled pretty good when it arrived, but the chicken was served raw. It was at night in the garden, so it wasn't until the fourth bite that I realized it was raw. It looked cooked outside, but pink. We showed the waitress several uncooked pieces. She did apologize, and it seemed that they would cook a new order. When it arrived a few minutes later, it appeared to be the same entree--but burnt. You could smell and taste that the spices had been burnt after being cooked the second time around. I couldn't finish the plate--felt already weezy thinking about the raw chicken. They didn't charge me for my plate--but still I would have rather had cooked food.
