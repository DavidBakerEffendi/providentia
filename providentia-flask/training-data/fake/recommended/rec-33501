if i could get over the fact that i'd be obese and broke, i would have a lobster roll every day of my life from RHLP and I'd be the happiest person in the world. I did have it about 30x this summer and now have about 10lbs to lose before my NYE vaca :( but boy was i the happiest girl in the world. the bread is grilled in butter so that when it is topped with the cold lobster salad it creates this perfect ooey gooey wonderland that will instantly leave you wanting more. immediately. try to check out the lobster bake on weekends during the summer at rocky sul's....get the big guy for $25 or $30, sit outside on the roof deck and watch the sun set over the water. doesn't get any better than that, does it?
