This is a must try place whether you're a local or a tourist. After a nice walk on the Brooklyn Bridge a good pie is the best reward. We ordered a small mushroom, pepperoni and sausage pizza. All of the ingredients were fresh. The crust was perfectly cooked, just the right amount of crunch. The sauce was tangy and flavorful. . Very good pie! They also have a good selection of beers, wines and other beverages. I ordered the Black Cherry soda and my husband had a Peroni. I do recommend you go early. We went on a Monday at a little past noon and did not have to wait to be seated. When we left there was already a line. I will definitely be back.
