We have always been happy with the food and the experience.  The tables are small, but cozy.    Food basic, but delicious. Once left a bag with my camera behind and a guy busing the tables ran down the street to catch me.  I was very impressed by this gesture.  This demonstrates one small way that people in NYC are so great.
