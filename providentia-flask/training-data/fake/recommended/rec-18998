This would be among my first banh mi, but compared to other sandwiches I've had, this place is great. The ingredients are fresh and the bread is toasted to perfection. The resto itself is tucked away: a literal small hole in the wall in the East Village. There is next to no seating, but the decor is cool: dark walls with a chalk board menu and some bar seating on the side. I had the side car (meat with pineapple chutney, pickled veggies, not spicey), my boyfriend had a spicey super cub classic; we shared a Vietnamese coffee. The coffee was nothing special (tasted like a regular coffee to me). I didn't try the sig other's sandwich, but he is a self proclaimed banh mi expert (he grew up in the San Gabriel Valley in LA and apparently that gives you expertise in all foods Asian) and said it was great: fresh ingredients, nicely toasted bread, very flavorful. As for mine, I liked it a lot for a lot of the same reasons (I thought the little bit of sweet with the tender meat and then the tang of the pickled veggies at the end was awesome). My only complaint was the laying of the sandwich: all the meat was cramped into the fold of my bread and all the veeggies were on the other side of the bread. Instead of the flavors marrying with each bite, I had one bite veggies, the next bite meat... Not sure if this was done on purpose, but I liked how everything tasted together and the fact that I had to take 2 bites (my mouth is tiny) every time was a little tedious. Pricewise, it's something like $7? Well worth it... Overall, I would come here again (I took half to go and it STILL tasted great 4 hours later).
