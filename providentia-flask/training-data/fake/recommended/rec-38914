We stopped by here for a quick, no-thrills bite to eat one night. Bueno Y Sano had friendly service, good prices, and good food. I don't see myself specifically seeking it out in the future, but if you're looking for a quick, decent, fresh burrito, it's worth the stop. I had the Spicy Chipotle Chicken burrito, which wasn't very spicy. The flavor was good, but not anything exceptional. And to the reviewer (Christopher B.) that docked them a star for not having table service: really? It seems to me that type of service would not be a good fit for this eatery.
