Service at K-town is usually amazing, and this place does not disappoint both in terms of food and service. I really enjoyed the appetizers with kimchi, bean sprout, and most particularly, the fried fish. Most of the time, I order the soondubu tofu dish, and the taste is aromatic and delicious. I would definitely recommend getting the tofu mildly spicy, unless you're one of those adventurous types. The food also comes out pretty fast, and if you could get past the sometimes long waits during peak hours, this place is well worth your wait.
