OMGosh! Ok, they have a late night happy hour which is soooo cool but I need to mention the food. I have been to this establishment several times and had so many good things. Â The fried pickles are my fave but the tuna melt and beet ravioli was also delish. The service staff is always great and quirky which makes it a fun night or brunch out every time :) I haven't gotten the chance to sit outside on that beautiful deck but I am looking forward to it this summer.
