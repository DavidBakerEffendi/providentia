Was really pleased with dinner at this newish spot on south street. It was a beautiful evening and we were able to sit outside. I love that this area is now full of healthy quality options to grab a quick meal. I had the Cobb salad, it was full of all the typical ingredients and topped with a tasty white balsamic dressing. He had the burger, topped with cheddar and bacon, according to him it was perfectly cooked and the fries were pretty amazing too. Our server was super friendly and accommodating when we changed our order from to go, to eat in, to eat at the table outside. I only have two comments- 1. My salad was a decent size but it was served overflowing in a shallow bowl, it was really hard to cut up the chicken and I think I left at least a few bites of lettuce on our table trying to mix it all up 2. The owners kid was outside being a pain and standing in front of the door blocking people from coming and going and it was a little annoying while we were trying to eat (not to mention he was by himself and I was afraid he was going to get kidnapped or run in front of a car on south st). That isn't enough to keep me away, I am looking forward to trying breakfast sometime.
