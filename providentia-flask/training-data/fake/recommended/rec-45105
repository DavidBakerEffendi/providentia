Great food, great vibe.  Small and good for a date.  Had the pork chop that they are famous for and it did not disappoint!  Lobster soup was good as well, much thinner than a usual bisque.  Can be a pain to get in, if you will be in the area go in early put your name down and hang out till they call.
