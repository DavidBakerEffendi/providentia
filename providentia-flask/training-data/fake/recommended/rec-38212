Hands down, my favorite burger place around. I've had a lot of different entrees there, but the one that's stuck by me is the Smokehouse Burger. It's so good and greasy with a big slice of Smoked Gouda on top. And the sweet potato fries are fantastic. The other thing that's really good there is the pulled pork. If you get there before 7, you get half price beers and apps for their happy hour. Every time I go there, it's super crowded and they don't take reservations for parties less than 6. It quiets down around 9:30 pm and the wait isn't so bad. Most entrees are around $10, but with beer and any apps, you can expect to spend around $20 a person.
