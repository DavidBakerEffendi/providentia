Mmmm. I really liked this place. Came here on a wintry Friday night and chose to sit by the bar. The beer selections are great and the bartender was really helpful in helping us decide which to choose. There doesn't seem to be happy hour but the beers are decently priced, tasty and with a high alcohol percentage so we didn't mind. Ordered the bacon mussels, $20 for two pounds and it came with french fries. A very decent meal but more like an appetizer for two people. Really good. I want to check this place out for brunch and when the weather is warmer. It definitely warrants a second visit.
