Stopped by as part as our daughter accepted student orientation @ MSU on a Sunday afternoon.  Yes the place is loud, there is very little room between tables, and you will have to wait a bit for your order...nothing different than a typical high volume restaurant, plus a Latin factor, and since you are here that's what you are looking to experience.  We enjoyed several of the tapas and were very please with the flavor and variety, the sangria's are very tasty and since its  a BYOB (wine store 2 doors down) you can "customized" them to taste. Great for a casual meal, great for a group,  not for quiet date. We are hoping for our daughter to have a successful four years @ MSU, we plan to stop by  Pete's often, when we are in the area to visit her.
