One of my NYE resolutions is to get out of Manhattan once in a while and discover the rest of the city. I happened to be in Williamsburg on my way to the East River park when I chanced upon Artists & Fleas. First off, what a find, but I'll save my A&F review for another time. Let's talk about The Brooklyn Taco Company; simply amazing. I tried the Mexican Curry Chicken, which consists of braised chicken, a mouthwatering curry spice marinade, chopped herbs, diced onions, what I think was queso blanco and a generous topping of two sides of hot sauce (rojo and verde). After having my first taste of BK Taco's, I believe my tastebuds will refuse anything less than the best. I can't wait to go back.
