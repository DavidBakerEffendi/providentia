I have been coming to Bouley 1-2 times per year for the last 10 years. It has been my favorite place ever to bring people for special occasions and I would previously have given 5 stars without question. The last two times we have gone, I have been disappointed.  We have had to wait for our table (despite reservations) and the staff in the waiting area/check-in are elusive,  stuffy and seem to avoid eye contact so they don't have to deal with you.  I've been really turned off by this.  The service we had last week was a hodge podge - one of our main waiters was phenomenal and the others were all wet noodles - no personality and didn't bother to explain any of our dishes when they brought them. Part of the fun of bouley is hearing about your wonderful dish.  When my husband had a question about two dishes he was deciding between our waiter just curtly said "the flan" - made the decision for him and didn't elaborate why the flan or even what the whole dish was. When my husband got it, he was ultimately disappointed and had the waiter taken the time to explain the two dishes, he would have gone with the other one. A bright star in the experience was the bread cart and the lovely gentleman who serves the bread. Both were fantastic. Overall, the food is very good and you still can't beat the prix fixe lunch price but they really need to work on their service.
