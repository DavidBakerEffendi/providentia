This place is meh. The food is decent but not worth the price I paid for it. They also don't cater very well for a to-go option. I ordered a Giaourtlou, which was essentially "meat on a stick" with a burger bun, tomato, and yogurt sauce. To me it seems a little bit counterintuitive to put meat on a stick on a burger bun and paying almost $20 Â I would rather take my business to Organique next door. Service here is a bit slow, waiting 15 minutes for a to-go order doesn't make much sense to me. I don't think I'll come back here, it was a dissatisfying experience.
