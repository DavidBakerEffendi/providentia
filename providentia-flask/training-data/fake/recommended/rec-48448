Have to say that I was not impressed.  Very hopeful going in as it can be difficult to find healthier food choices in small towns.  Very disappointed with all of it. - out of chicken - out of spinach - espresso machine broken - over charged for coffee b/c espresso machine broken - WAY WAY WAY over charged for a super tiny Greek salad
