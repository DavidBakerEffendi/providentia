I'm still finishing my lunch here as I type this review. Best. Pita. Ever!! Warm, airy, fluffy, made in front of you, amazing even on it's own. We got the kohlrabi hummus with candied peanuts, it was delicious, and definitely different than any hummus I've had before, though just the plain hummus was already knocking our socks off. Highly HIGHLY recommended!
