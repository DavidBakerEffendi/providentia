Truth be told, I've been to The Reservoir four or five times since 2006 when we moved to the area.  I knew what I was getting into last night. I always liked the food, but since my wife says (and it's true) that this place is way too dirty, the waitresses act like you are in their way, and the restrooms are disgusting... She will not go back.  So, since she is away, I decided I can go eat there last night.   Still, very dirty floor, CASH  ONLY, waitresses that practically roll their eyes for customers they don't recognize etc etc.  BUT, The food is still very tasty and HUGE portions.   The owners seem very nice to their Regulars and even greeted me with a warm smile and "Hello" , and I saw many seniors (65+) patrons shaking hands with the owners, talking about old times, who just passed away, who just got married, kissing the waitresses hello etc.  I get it, The Reservoir has a lot of Nostalgia for these people.  But since I'm not a regular, I feel like I was treated as a nuisance.   I hesitated to return my food when it came out wrong, but I returned it anyway.  Then, had to wait another 25 minutes before my food came back out.  When food is returned, it should be prioritized, yet my order was put in the back of the line.   Again, I did LOVE the Food and took half of it home, but I don't think I'll be going back, at least it wont' be my idea to go back.    I should have gone with my original plan which was to go to Star Tavern in Orange. 3 Stars because I like the food and portions, but just know what you are getting into.
