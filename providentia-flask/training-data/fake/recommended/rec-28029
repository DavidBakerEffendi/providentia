Food was great, service was absolutely terrible. Was seated with a party of 7 in a cramped "patio" area at a table that sat 5. Was greeted by a jerk waiter who acted like he would have rather been anywhere than serving people. Everything was a chore to get done... drinks, ordering, silverware! We had to ask for everything and chase them down. Waitress who took over for the food was miserable, jerking things from us and slamming things down on the table, all while sighing and grumbling. She also forgot to put my order in, and proceeds to make me feel bad like it's my fault that I asked her to remove the order since everyone was already done eating! I don't care how good the food is, if you can't get basic service down it will do you no good, your food will only take you so far. Went to shady lady the day before and was impressed by the food and friendliness. Much better choice!
