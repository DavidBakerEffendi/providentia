Fantastic food....cold, methodical service.   I've been coming here for years....ever since they only had the one store front. I'm definitely no expert, but this place is by far the best, most authentic Thai food i've ever had.  The fried Calmari is yummy. For entrees, the crispy pork and sauteed duck are phenomenal, as is the seasoned pork with garlic. They also have a nice selwction of beers. That sai, if you're expecting to be greeted by a warm, welcoming host, you've come to the wrong place.  Additionally, when things go well, it runs like  well oiled machine.  But, when something goes wrong...like your server disappearing...forget about getting help from another server or staff member. So, say a prayer to the Restaurant Gods before coming in here and hope for a good seat in the garden.  If stars are aligned, you can be in for a FANTASTIC meal. If they're not, well, your food will be still be great, you'll just be frustrated waiting around until someone realizes you're here! ( Oh yeah....and cash only...)
