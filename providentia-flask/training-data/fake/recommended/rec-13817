they don't call this place new WONTON garden for nothing.  their wontons are the real deal.  and that's just one of the many things this place does well. their wontons are fresh, large, and not skimpy on the ingredients and filling.  you know the places that try to ground everything up together to try to hide the ingredients that it's supposed to have?  nope, won't find that here.  each wonton has at least one whole piece of shrimp, plus ample pork filling.  pair that with whatever suits your fancy (fresh noodles, roast pork, duck, veggies, etc.), and you're golden. not to mention that the staff is super friendly.  i mean, come on, they wear hawaiian shirts!  if that doesn't scream fun, i don't know what does.  they're also open until 2 am, so if you're done with the bars early, go to new wonton garden to finish the night off on a good note.
