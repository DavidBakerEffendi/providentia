A local hotel at which I was staying at recommended this restaurant although they did indicate that the outside of the building made it look a bit questionable, we elected to give it a try anyway. The food was excellent, personally I had one of the pasta dishes which exceeded my expectations. Â Although I can't say the serve was bad, it just seemed that the locals received better serviced.
