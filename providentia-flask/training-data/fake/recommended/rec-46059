Decent place to get pho. I am no connoisseur but much of the clientele is Vietnamese, so hopefully that indicates that you're getting the real thing. A waitress at a different vietnamese restaurant recommended this place, so that must count for something as well. Anyway, it's better than Saigon Grill in NYC. Try the combination pho with brisket, tripe, tendon, and you won't be sorry. Order the crispy spring rolls (cha gio) and you'll understand why the table next to you got a double order. Service is quick, so is pick-up....this comes in handy on Saturday night when there's a line of ppl waiting for tables. Sometimes they do skimp a bit on ingredients, so they forfeit one star.
