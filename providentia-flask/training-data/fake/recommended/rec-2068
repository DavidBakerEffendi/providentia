All my life, I've heard people telling me that you can't get a Philly cheese steak to taste right unless it's made in Philly.  And when I asked, they told me that this was the place to go for it.  I have to say that I wasn't thrilled.  I was expecting to be knocked over by how different the steak was from every other sports bar that claims to have one, and I was not.  That being said, Pat's crew were much more pleasant than the crew at Geno's across the street.  My group and I decided to split up and try a sandwich from each place.  I walked back from Pat's, and went to sit down with them (I stopped for a napkin on the way) only to be yelled at for taking a napkin.  I figured they were mad because I wasn't a paying customer, so I offered to buy some fries.  The guy looked at me and said, "No!  You got a bad sandwich!" I had heard the competition between these two was tight, but I wasn't aware that their principle strategy for gaining market share involved alienating potential customers.  I met my group in the "neutral ground," and I gotta say, not much difference between Pat's & Genos, flavor-wise, but as far as kindness goes, Pat's wins.
