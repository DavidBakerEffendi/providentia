This place is legit!   Some of the best ramen I've had outside of Japan.  The pork bun was on point too.  The service was attentive and the place was very clean, even our table despite having two children under 3 at it.  Our waitress came over every once in awhile to pick up whatever my crazy child had thrown off the table at that moment, so that's an extra star in my book.  Definitely check this place out!
