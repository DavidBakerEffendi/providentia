Located in the plaza just outside Princeton Junction train station along with Dunkin Donuts and Dominoes. The interior is nicely decorated (not your typical chinese take-out). Service was decent and all waiters/waitresses were attentive to our needs. Especially this random waiter who was continuously mopping the floor in front of us. We ordered the pork soup dumplings, spicy beef noodle soup, and the Shanghai fried noodles with shrimp. Â We came mainly for the soup dumplings, which we thought weren't too shabby, but they aren't the best we have ever had. Good enough for the location. I did however think that there seemed to have a lot of soup in them. Anyways.. the spicy beef noodle soup didn't have much taste to it. It tasted more oily with the chili oil than anything. It wasn't really that spicy either. I'd pass on it. The Shanghai fried noodles with shrimp were also alright. Nothing too amazing. Overall based on the food we ordered, everything was just ehh. We may be back if we are really craving soup dumplings since we won't make the 1 hour drive to Philly to Dim Sum Garden or 1 hour train to NYC for Joe's Shanghai. Plus! we signed up for the VIP to get 10% off each visit. Guess we're invested now..
