This place makes some of the best Empanadas. They have a variety of fillings and your choice of corn, organic , or flour shell not to mention that they also have desserts. I usually order the carne(beef) but lately i have tried some other fillings and i haven't been mad about that.  This definitely isnt the best place to come in as a group i wouldn't even recommend eating them there. As others mentioned this place truly is tiny. The spring time is just around the corner so you can order a few ahead of time and walk on over to the park that is just a few blocks away and you can make a nice picnic out of these babies.  Anyway the flavor is excellent they also give you a good amount of aji( spicy sauce) but i wouldnt even call it spicy at least i wouldn't.  Im not sure if they have any other sauces available. All in all this a favorite little spot in Corona. Fyi they only take cash and the only atms around there are in a shady supermarket i would make sure to hit your bank's atm before heading over.
