They only have grape jelly? Seriously?? How can they not have just one other flavor for people you do not like grape? This is just a no brainer! Strawberry should be the obvious other choice! If they don't add this to their condiments, I will seriously have to stop getting bagels there. Too bad... cause the bagels are actually pretty good!
