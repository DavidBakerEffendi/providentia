Went here looking for some nice wine, cheese and atmosphere. Cute place, extensive wine list and pleasant service. Split a cheese/charcuterie plate and had the artisanal greens salad. I had a lovely glass of white wine off their "interesting" list and wasn't disappointed. The waitress was helpful and accurate in describing the wine. Prices weren't exorbitant and location was convenient to my hotel (Loews). I may go back while I'm here for my conference just to have some wine.
