Eight Turn Crepe transports you to Harajuku, Japan with their Japanese rice crepes. The crepes are golden, airy light, sweet, and have layers filled with deliciousness! You can choose sweet or savory, both are the way to go! I really like that the ingredients are evenly distributed in the crepe and they package the crepe in a wrapper that allows you to unwrap as you nom your way down. Sometimes I wish they would provide more ingredients in their crepes which tempts me to buy another one! Yes, it's that good! If you are in the mood for savory, try the eight turn lox with avocado! If you want sweet, definitely get azuki berries (match icecream and pocky sticks included)! I just found out they deliver. I would totally abuse that if I lived in the city!!
