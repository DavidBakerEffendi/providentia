I sent this in the mail to the management - but just incase it gets lost in the mail: Dear Lombardi's- we had a rehearsal wedding dinner on fri oct 3 2014 at 5pm and we would like to specifically say thank you to the guy who we had talked to a year prior about the space and who came to work when he originally wasn't going to work that day - I believe his name is Yani. His customer service , personality and professional attitude is amazing and truly made our experience unforgettable. The server we had was excellent too. We wanted to write and make sure the man who we talked to in 2013 who remembered us in 2014 after only meeting us once was recognized for his attention to detail and making out experience wonderful. All the members of our party of 30 were blown away by the delicious food and kindness of the staff. I am sure when they visit by again you have customers for life- thank you - Kali and Shawn (We ordered white pizzas , pepperoni pizzas , Caesar salads, sangria and beer pitchers and were in the basement room which was perfect! )
