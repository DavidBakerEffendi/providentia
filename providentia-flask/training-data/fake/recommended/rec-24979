it is wonderful to have another great bay street restaurant to go to that is close by. and the weekday pre fixe menu is finally here. and what a great concept. $19.20 pre fixe goes with the 1920 theme. we started with and enjoyed the shrimp & sausage in a spicy scampi sauce over toast points and prosciutto& fresh mozzarella risotto cake with a roasted pepper pesto. entrees pork medallions with hot cherry peppers in a port wine sauce and sesame crusted salmon were equally delicious. to top it off the creme brulee was perfectly crunchy & creamy. chez ettore
