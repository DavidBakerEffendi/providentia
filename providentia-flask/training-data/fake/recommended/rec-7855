I don't like broccoli rabe. I don't like sharp provolone. I got the recommended pork sandwich with broccoli rabe and provolone. It was one of the best pork sandwiches I have ever had. The bread had great integrity, the pork was SO moist and flavorful, and somehow the accompaniments on the sandwich created an explosion of perfectly complemented meaty flavor. The porchetta in San Fran isn't really comparable because the fat content of the meat is just so different. Loved. This. Sandwich. Will be back tomorrow.
