A small boutique restaurant that offers a wide selection of vegan vegetarian food. I ordered the meatball sandwich and to my surprise, it was quite good. I don't know if I'd pay $8 again for it, but being that their are still many other dishes to choose from, I may revisit this place. I had a sample of my friends dish, vegan chicken quesadila well done, and wasn't too thrilled. But, along with their hot sauce cum vinaigrette sauce it wasn't too bad.
