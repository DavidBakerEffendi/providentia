Came in for dinner with my parents who were in town last Saturday. I forgot to make a reservation anywhere so I decided to check open table for what was near by. So I found the bar room. When we arrived there was a vibrant bar crowd that seemed intimidating. After squeezing through the crowd we entered a beautiful and intimate dining room. The skylight, the mural, the decor; fit the space perfectly. We started with the kale salad the steak tar tar and the oysters. I had the lamb chops. It was such a great meal I was really impressed with food. Really cool wine list as well.
