This is still arguably one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I actually stopped going out to dinner in Manhattan when I kept finding consistently better options in my neighborhood of Williamsburg. I found I was paying a large sum for dinner and I'd get a waitress that didn't know crap about the wine, or my meal was just awful. Meanwhile, I have never had a bad meal at Walter Foods. Cocktails (my fave is the fig side car), Oysters, great specials, and the best, i mean the best bread pudding. I mean... its sex in a hot plate. Yes its pricey, but yes its worth it when you want to treat yourselves. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable, pick a special occasion and go all out. Its one of the best dinners you will ever have.
