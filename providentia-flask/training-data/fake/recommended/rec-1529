Good spot for a quick bite--muffins, bagels, pastries, sandwiches, etc. especially for those vegan hipsters out there.  The also have vegan soft serve which, according to our dairyless friends who recently visited for the weekend, is beyond fantastic.  It was a pit stop every day of their trip! The only criticism is the hot tea....a pint glass? Really?  Although the little knitted/crocheted yarn coozies are cute, they don't make up for the scorching hot glass and all the schmutzy tea leaves that are undoubtedly floating around in it.
