ok, i finally managed to force myself not to get their delicious apple, brie and chicken sandwich. it took me 5 minutes of going back and forth which i'm sure perturbed my coworkers but i did it (only because i had that sandwich the day before!) the chicken pot pie was AMAZING. i'm not sure if anybody mentioned it here, but it has butternut squash!!! i go crazy for that orange goodness. who wudda thought to add it to pot pie?! great, now don't even try tearing me away from ordering the pot pie every single time now.
