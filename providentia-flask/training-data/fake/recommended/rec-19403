Our first stop when we reached Philly this past weekend! We were staying at Hilton Garden Inn right next door so we popped into the Market for lunch. I had been doing a little Yelping and saw that this counter was a location worthy of skipping the prerequisite cheesesteak for, so we had to check it out! The line was really long, but we managed to grab some counter seats! SCORE!  Hubs and I split a roasted pork sandwich with (HOT) peppers and provolone.  It was served up to us super fast and DEFINITELY lived up to the long-line hype!  YUM! Definitely glad we shared too, cos that was a BIG sandwich!
