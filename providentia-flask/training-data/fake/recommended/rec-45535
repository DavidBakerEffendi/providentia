One of my favorite outdoor drinking sites. I love coming to this place because they offer free games such as ping-pong and jinga two great games to play when on your trying to drink and enjoy the day off.  Get there early because this place gets packed quick on the weekend. One thing I really enjoy is the actual easiness of the whole bar.  You go up to the bar or kitchen and and you don't have to worry about a waitress. Place your order and grab a number and wait for your food to come to you. It does get any easier than that. I discovered that my new favorite drink is a radler, almost reminds me of a summer shanty. Totally recommended on a nice warm day.
