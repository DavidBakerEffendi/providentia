After the disappointing experience I had at Tony Luke's my first time coming through this city, Philadelphia has now redeemed itself in the form of Sonny's.  I'm not sure where we got the recommendation for Sonny's, but from what I've gathered, their cheesesteak is what the locals eat.  Forget what Travel Channel or Food Network tries to shovel down your throat. I'm not familiar with the layout of Philly, but Sonny's seemed to be in some central, fairly busy area nestled in a bosum of parks and historical buildings.  The service was fast and friendly, blah, blah, blah, but let's get down to the cheesesteak, the only reason you're reading this.  There are hundreds of ways to customize your sandwich, but I went with the ribeye with bleu cheese and grilled onions, served on a fresh, still-steaming roll.  Un-effing-believable.  That's all I can say. Back in the early 90s, Philly natives Boyz II Men came out with "I'll Make Love To You."  That wasn't about no woman.  That song was written for this sandwich.
