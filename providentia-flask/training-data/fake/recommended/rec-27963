pommes frites, you are getting too big for your britches. the prices were already obscene in the first place, but i loved you so i paid. after recently seeing the price increase after 5 years at the same prices, i am pissed. i also feel they are "stifing" the amount of fries they give you compared to the amount they used to give you. maybe i am just turning into more of a big girl, but i really think that they have been trying to get a little slick in there with no reason as potatoes do not cost like $5 each last time i checked. sadly, i probably won't be going back to my favorite place ever.
