I wish there were different criteria to rate such as the wait staff and the seating as well as the food. The Food: 4 stars. Unbelievably simple yet delicious. You just check off your combination of balls and sauce and sides and you're on your way to an extremely delicious meal. I went with the Special Meatball (a Bolognese meatball) with spicy meat sauce, spaghetti under and risotto on the side. This comes with a small piece of bread on the side. This was one of the best bowls of spaghetti and meatballs I've ever had. This place was awesome! The waitresses were attentive and the food came out quick and every one got what they ordered (doesn't hurt that you check off the items you want on the menu) The only reason I gave this place 3 stars is because it's pretty small and it got crowded quick. We sat at the long center table in the middle and kept getting bumped by the people at the bar waiting for their turn to devour these delicious balls. I can't blame the restaurant for this though. They are relatively new, they get a lot of press, and their meatballs are out of this world. That's the price you pay for having a great place like this in NYC. Speaking of price, we had 4 people, each person got an entree, we had 2 sides, a few beers and wine and the bill was only $80. Didn't expect that. Over all, the food here is amazing and definitely worth checking out. Just be prepared for it to be a little noisy, be a little cramped in your seats, or be ready to wait 45 - 60 minutes for a table. Screw Flanders!
