I have a really bad track record of forgetting people's birthday, especially my mother's birthday for the past 3 years. I've gotten her really nice last minute gifts that she, by some wonderful miracle, loved and cherished. But I still felt kind of guilty and promised that there will be no more last minute gifts!!!! So since the beginning of March I was hunting down restaurants that I hoped my mother would love. I was about to give up and take my mom to a dinner until a friend told me about Carmine's. Of course I went on yelp to confirm if this place is legit, and a few reviews later I was sold and made a reservation for a party of 5. Oh how I love my friend for mentioning Carmine's in my time of despair. My mother loved it and my whole family had a really good time. We had the veil parmesan (yes, were cruel cruel people), lasagna, and the mixed seafood pasta. OMG the servings were huge!!!! each serving is meant for sharing with 3-5 people. I wanted to order the Titanic for dessert but after dinner we were so stuffed, we settled to sharing a slice of cheesecake which was still too much for us to handle. The cheesecake was meh! it was soft but I was not amazed, I like Eileen's Cheesecake so much better!!!! But everything else, the veil, the lasagna, the mixed seafood were superb! My mom had an amazing birthday and almost cried when they sang to her. Even though I the bill burned a whole right through my wallet, through my pocket, and burned my skin, seeing my mom so happy was priceless. Oh and a little heads up, the menus are on the wall. Yes I know, strange. And dont fill yourself up with bread, big mistake!
