The whole experience is iconic Americana, and for that I give it 5 stars.  It may be touristy, there may be better sandwiches,  but this is birthplace of the union and the birthplace of the cheesesteak.  Authenticity cannot be challenged.   There aren't much better things you can eat after a night of drinking...in Greece the gyro, in Germany the doner kebab, in California the burrito.  Lines can be long and ordering can be stressful for newbies....you can and will get sent to the back of the line.  But this all adds to the drama and anticipation.  The dumpy corner spot and hectic scene adds as well.  The sandwich here is slathere in whiz, and they invented this method.  The meat grilled and left in thinly shaved strips.  I often prefer white American or provolone, but the original is nice and dirty.   All of it became one of my favorite reasons to visit my brother at UPenn.  And I have taken a liking to search for cheesesteaks everywhere....even if they cannot match up. Didn't they even have an MTV Grind here?....nuff said
