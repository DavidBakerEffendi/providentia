Couldn't make reservations here cause sadly I don't have 6 friends. I only have one, and I chose to come here for dinner with her. Seating took 15mins but she wasn't around so it actually took like 30mins as they don't sit you without your entire party. The place is sorta interesting because the outside decor is not noticeable at all but people kept flocking in...so I guess it's a popular place. I forgot what I ordered but it had basil in it and I chose the duck accompaniment. I think they could have given me more duck pieces. The duck I did get was delicious, moist and not loaded with 10inches of fat. So for a duck that tasty, can you blame me for wanting for on my plate? They have many mojitos and I had to bite my tongue so the word "Mango" wouldn't come out...I ordered the coconut mojito. I am a sucker for mango mojitos but i wanted to try something different. Overall, I think I have to come back and make another assessment. From what I experienced it was an ok place. Nothing bad, nothing exactly superb either.
