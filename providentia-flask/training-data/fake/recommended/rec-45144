Was looking for quick, healthy lunch, and i found it. Its like a fast food salad place. Many salads to choose from or you can create your own. Can also have as wrap. Fresh ingredients, creative combinations. I got the tandoori fire: romaine, tandoori chicken, feta, pita chips, cucumbers, red onion, low fat yogurt cucumber dressing.
