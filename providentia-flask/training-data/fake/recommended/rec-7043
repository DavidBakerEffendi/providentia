Whoah. This place is amazing. I walked to pies n thighs for dinner last night but it was packed, on my walk home I decided to try this place. I ordered a fried chicken and bacon biscuit sandwich plus the fried green tomatoes. Both were amazing. I think that was the best biscuit I have ever eaten, the fried green tomatoes were also probably the best I've ever had. Â They also have good beer. I am going to be coming back often to sample the rest of the menu.
