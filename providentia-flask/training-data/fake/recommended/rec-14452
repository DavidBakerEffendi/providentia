Super good spicy shrimp starter. Had the fried chicken for dinner and I have to say I'm feeling the fried chicken here maybe even more than pies and thighs. The skin has a different overall crunchy darkness with a nice juicy interior. Also had brunch here today and ordered the steak and eggs. The steak was not too much to eat, it was a perfect portion ( medium rare, well cooked and yes, juicy ). Had the steak with some eggs cooked over easy and I was in brunch heaven. I can't believe it took me until this last week to eat here. I guess two times in one week is a good way to start catching up with all my friends that have already eaten everything on the menu a few times over.
