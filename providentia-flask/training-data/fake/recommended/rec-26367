Aww this place was very cute and cozy. I had the Froho with banana (Curious George) which was good, it's basically like a frozen slushie chocolate beverage, topped with whipped cream. They have a lot of flavors. My friend got the peanut butter one which was really good and my other friend got the birthday cake flavor, which was good if you love ice cream cake and would love to eat one that was in a blender! I also had the cream of tomato soup with cous cous which was tasty and a relatively large portion for being "small" - also it came with a piece of bread. Really nice fancy bathrooms. ;)
