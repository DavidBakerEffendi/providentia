Beer was delish -- I had a hefeweisen and my bf had a darker something-or-other. We also had dinner -- bread dumplings for me and kielbasa with boiled cabbage for him. I thought mine was...well, it lacked texture. The dumplings are like giant gnocchi, which is great, but it's served with a creamy mushroom sauce, and there's just mushy-mush-ness as far as the eyes (palate?) can see. Boyfriend really loved his dish, though, and it smelled amazing. Â  Friendly bartender, big menu, a wee bit pricey -- but all in all? Happy to have it in the nabe...
