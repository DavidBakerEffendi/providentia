great spot, love the building, reminds me of lobster mecca, Gosman's, in Montauk, but in look only. Ridiculously expensive considering we were sitting at a picnic bench with paper napkins and an ineffective plastic lobster fork. 35$ for a mediocre lobster and corn on the cob in this setting is outrageous. Friendly but incredibly lackadaisical service. How many times did I beg for extra butter (and by extra I mean, like, 2 tablespoons), and by the time it arrive what little was left of my lobster was cold. And it was my birthday! I'd go back to sit and watch the sunset and have a beer, but never again to eat.
