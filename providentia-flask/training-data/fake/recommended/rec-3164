Good burgers, fun location in an Irish-pub sorta way, not a sit-down dinner place. Can be hard to get a seat. Food: the burgers are simple and quite tasty. The fries are thin and crispy, not big and soft, so that's what you get. Served on small plastic plates. Perfect match with a McSorley's. Probably good to avoid the high times here, such as lunch, so you don't have to eat your burger standing up.
