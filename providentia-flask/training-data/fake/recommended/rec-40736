I am a huge sucker for high end comfort food. It is right up there with Japanese as being my favorite type of cuisine...and Jones does it very very well. I don't actually live in Philadelphia and have only been here on trips. A few of my favorite meals, that keep me coming back for more, include: the sesame seared tuna (this will not disappoint), the mac n cheese (always a solid choice), the fried chicken and waffles (filling!!!), and the jambalaya (spicy...just the way I like it). The decor has a 50's Brady Bunch vibe to it, which even though it isn't spectacular or uber chic, fits the food they serve very well. Also, every time I have been here this place has been pretty packed (and a little loud) but I have never let that deter me from a good ole fashion American meal....mmmhmmmm :)
