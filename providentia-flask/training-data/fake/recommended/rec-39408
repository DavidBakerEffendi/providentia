The food here is delicious, something's area little too salty. Drinks are too strong if you ask me. I used to drink their sangria and margaritas a lot but it did not go well with food so I just stick to food. TUESDAYS Â are the best because of the 50% off tapas. SAME AMOUNT OF FOOD JUST HALF-PRICE OFF. Happy hour is until 7 PM now and it gets really crowded once after happy hour is over it starts getting better. Music is great but you can hardly hear it by all the people having conversation, but after having a few drinks no one really cares. Overall I absolutely love this place come here all the time!!!
