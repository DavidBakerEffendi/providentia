I tried BS&S for the first time this past weekend and I have to say that I wasn't overly impressed.  The outside dining area is lovely and the staff were all very attentive and professional but I wasn't overly impressed with the food.  I felt that the portions were on the small side for the price, my steak was overcooked and the side of sauteed mushrooms that I ordered was really under-seasoned.  Considering the cost ($48 for a beverage, an app and an entree not including tip) I don't think that I would return.  I have to admit that I was disappointed, I'd heard good things and expected more.
