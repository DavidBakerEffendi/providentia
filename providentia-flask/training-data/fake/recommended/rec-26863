I got the Brielle here. The brie paired well with the cranberries (even though I would have liked more chutney in there), and after it was grilled, the cheese was perfectly stringy. I also couldn't taste the onions or the pine nuts - was it left off my sandwich or were there too little to notice? The girl who took my order was honest - when I asked if I could add anything to it, she said that it's possible, but that the Brielle is perfect as is. You should know, though, that all the sandwiches are pre-made waiting to be grilled, so you can't substitute anything.
