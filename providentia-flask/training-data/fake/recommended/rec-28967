This is exactly my kind of place with a laidback atmosphere, delicious food with generous portions, and friendly staff. I've been here for both a la carte dinner and the tasting menu. The $55 tasting menu was amazing, they helped accommodate my boyfriend's shellfish restriction and observance of Passover, but we definitely didn't feel like we were missing out. Best dishes: cauliflower with black garlic pesto and Sauteed Chatham Cod. We have also done their 'Plats du Jour' (a different special every night) which was $34 for steak and fries Â that generously served two. Their macaroons are also delicious. I will definitely be returning.
