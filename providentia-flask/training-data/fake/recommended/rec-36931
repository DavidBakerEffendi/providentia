Do I need to add another review here... after a solid 90+ this place still stacks up around 4 stars... My personal experience has been afternoons... I'm stressed need a long walk from the APT.  saddle up to the bar for a brew and a BB.  No it's not a Bistro, but a friendly neighborhood establishment with a good burger.  There can be some inconsistency and I can't call it the best NYC has to offer, but you won't go wrong.  Enjoy
