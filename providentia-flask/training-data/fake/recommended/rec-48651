When I get through Philadelphia I always try and stop by here. First time was years ago and not much has changed except the crowd. That's the reason for the low rating. The food and the drinks I'd give a higher score but the clientele had me wanting to punch my own face. Maybe I'd do better on a school night or somethin. Either way, whenever I'm in town Â you will more likely than not find me here at the bar, even if it's a brief stop.
