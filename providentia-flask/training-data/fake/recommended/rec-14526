Wow - really good legit Greek food, good prices, just good stuff.  Waiters are good and friendly and will help you find something good, make sure to try some appetizers and enjoy it!  The cheese balls and deep fried zucchini were excellent, make sure to come hungry.  BYOB too, pricey liquor store 6 doors down
