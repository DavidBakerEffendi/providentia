Overnight trip with the GF to Philly. Lunch Food- Pretty good but still can't see what the craze is about Service- Line gets long but it moves very fast Ambiance- It's inside a market so it's very loud. Be prepared to fight an old lady for a seat The famous DiNic's pork sandwich. Apparently I ordererd it wrong because we got the cheese and peppers, but the not greens. Ordered the pulled pork sandwich and the roast pork sandwich. Both tasted pretty good, but I kinda preferred the pulled pork and it was more juicy. Would I drive 2 hours from NYC to eat this again...definitely not lol!
