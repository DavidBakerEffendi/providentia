This place was such an experience that it convinced me to join Yelp just so I can share its "amazing-ness" with others. Firstly, I completely agree that the line is part of the experience. While my roommate and I waited in the cold morning weather, we were served coffee along with samples of delicious sausages and pancakes. This aloud us not only to warm up, but it gave us a great idea of what we would like to order once we got inside. The people working there greeted us like family and the food was DEFINITELY worth the wait. We shared the pumpkin walnut pancakes (with the cinnamon butter... yummy) and juevos rancheros. I have to say that it was the best pumpkin pancakes I have ever had.... coming from a pumpkin lover this says alot. The juevos rancheros was equally as mouthwatering. We also ordered a side of the sausage, inspired by the taste test in the line earlier. The only downside was that our table was a little small and it is cash only, however everything else made up for those minor observations. (They do have an ATM machine inside) I have found my permanent breakfast place and HIGHLY recommend it to other as well.
