My first 5 star review! We tried to make a reservation for Saturday night but they were booked. We walked in and found out the outside tables are for walk ins if available. After about 1/2 hour we were seated, very easy. I am a NYC foodie and seek out great food experiences. I can say for sure that this was one of them! The shrimp dumplings, warm goat cheese salad and buffalo rock shrimp appetizers were great for the 4 of us to share and we loved them. Â Our entrees included seared scallops, blackened redfish, triple tailed snapper with capers in a lemon butter sauce and crab cakes. All 4 of us loved EVERYTHING, including the sides....mashed sweet potatoes, french fries, rice and baked potato. Perhaps the best crab cakes any of us have had and trust me when I say we've tried them all over the east coast. Service was solid and not rushed. We brought wine since it's BYOB and skipped dessert because we were all just too full. We will absolutely be going back, hopefully soon.
