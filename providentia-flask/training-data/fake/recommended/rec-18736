Wish I could have actually eaten here. The menu looks so good. Was trying to put together a 25-person group dinner here, but the receptionist forgot to send details about putting together a pre-selected menu after I spoke to her, then didn't return my phone message when I called four days later to remind her, and when I called the third time and asked if they had gotten my message, she told me how busy they were and that she will get to it eventually. Â When she emailed me two minutes later, she told me they were going to charge $6,000 (!) plus tax and tip for a dinner for 25 people, and we could eat at 5 PM (!) Regardless, renting out the restaurant was totally not what we wanted, but she either didnt't listen (to the conversation and the voicemail) or she is just obtuse. Either way, I didn't have the energy to start over with the explanation. It's NYC - we have plenty of other options.
