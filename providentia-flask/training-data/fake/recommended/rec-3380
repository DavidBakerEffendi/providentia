The food was ok, nothing fabulous but average. Service needs to improve. I was told I can't substitute plain eggs for herbed eggs. I would have paid extra but the waiter just said no. They also stacked one plate on another so the bottom of a plate was touching my hubby's food. Yuck. The flavors were good but execution and presentation suffered. I don't think I will be back as there are soooooo many other good places for brunch in NYC/Brooklyn area.
