pork belly tacos has to be S&F's standout dish. the texture of a hard shell taco with the braised pork belly really add depths of flavor. the pork melts in your mouth and each layer of flavor of the pico de gallo and cheese keeps you suprised and guessing as you chew. the fried chicken is also one of the best i have had in nyc. it reminds me of the fried chicken at redhead but even more juicier and tender. the seasoning of the fried chicken is innovative but very familiar at the same time. the ranch sauce is solid but honestly once you take a bite of the perfectly seasoned chicken, you will not even reach over to the other side of the plate for the radish or the sauce. its that good. i also had the oxtail terrine. loads of excellent texture and taste. i think this dish really captures the mission of salt & fat. go and eat it and youll know what i mean. i had the lychee panna cotta to end the meal and i think it was the perfect way to end a carnivore's meal on a light, refreshing note. the dessert wasnt heavy and the fact that the panna cotta is paired with a light, tangy lychee sorbet leaves the palate cleansed. they just got their liquor license so if youre looking for a solid, affordable experience of casual fine dining, this is the place to go.
