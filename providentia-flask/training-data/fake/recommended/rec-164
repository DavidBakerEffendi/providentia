Kumo is a pretty good sushi restaurant that's usually a staple for me and my friends on Friday nights.  They have a 50% off discount on their sushi most of the time and the sushi tastes pretty damn good.  They also have cheap, good hot sake (like $10 for a large one) and friendly folks.  I like this place, but, it's not one of my favs for two main reasons: 1.  Even at something like $4 a roll, I still end up spending around $25 to get my fill here.  At that rate, if I was solely interested in the culinary experience, I'd be better of heading to an all you can eat (AYCE) sushi place like Sushi Palace or Sushi X.  Conversely, if you're someone who feels overwhelmed at an AYCE sushi place, then Kumo is definitely for you. You can pick up two rolls for under $10. 2.  If you go in a large group (of six or more people), it essentially invalidates the 50% discount on most of the rolls.  They charge an automatic 18% gratuity for parties of 6 or more AND the gratuity is charged on the FULL price of the food (before the 50% discount).  It's not immediately apparent that they do this so be aware of it. Those two things aside, I enjoy myself there every other week or so and have a good time.  Overall, I'd recommend hitting up there sushi from time to time. Their hibachi is pretty good.  You'll almost always see a large crowd there on Friday night enjoying Hibachi.  I got hibachi there only one time with a good friend of mine.  The food was tasty / what you would expect from a hibachi experience.  A chef comes and grills it in front of you, does a few tricks, and feeds you ultra cheap sake from a squirt bottle. Definitely a lot of fun and not unreasonably priced.  I usually stick with the sushi, but the hibachi is an enjoyable experience there.
