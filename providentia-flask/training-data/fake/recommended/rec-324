My boyfriend and I have been coming to Nai for years and when my brother came to town with his fianc√©, it was a no brainer that this is where we would be taking them. We went on Thursday so we saw the amazing Flamenco dancers and, as usual, the food was perfect. We ordered multiple pitchers of Sangria (red, champagne, and blueberry champagne) and each was more tastey than the other. Some of the best Sangria we've had. Our favorite dish is usually the fried goat cheese on toast, patatas aioli, and mussels. Can't wait to go back soon. Hands down our favorite place in the city.
