This was our first visit to Philadelphia. We asked for help in locating a good place for cheesesteaks by our carriage driver. We were told to try Sonny's as they believe that they treat you better and the food is just as good as Pat's or Geno's. We were not disappointed. We ordered two different types. One cheesesteak with peppers, grilled onions and provolone and the other "Sonny's Fave" which is a cheesesteak with cheezewhiz and grilled onions. Both were delicious and served on fresh rolls. Â We had ordered a lunch special it came with fries and a soda. The fries were made to order and were piping hot and crispy. YUM! I would go back to Sonny's and recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great cheesesteak.
