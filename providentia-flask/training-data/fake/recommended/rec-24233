Finally, a vegan cheesesteak that's worthy of being served in Philadelphia! Since the closing of Gianna's Grill I've endured several years of vegan cheesesteak mediocrity. No more! Although HipCityVeg's offering is not as legendary as their previously mentioned, defunct peer, the HipCityVeg Philly Steak has made it to my "awesome vegan sandwiches" list. Placing higher on that list is their Ziggy Burger. After 15 years of vegetarianism it's hard to get a rise when I see "veggie burger" on the menu, but the Ziggy Burger really raises the bar on this commonplace staple. It is thick and juicy, the sauce is incredible, the bun is sufficiently sturdy, and the presentation is delightful. The new University City location is spacious. The decor is beautiful- live plants and all. The dining room is clean. The staff is friendly. One bit of advice: it is best to visit this spot during the holidays when the students go home to their parents.
