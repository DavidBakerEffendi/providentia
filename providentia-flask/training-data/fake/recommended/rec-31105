Our time at Frankford Hall on Father's day was really relaxing, fun and filled with good beer and decent food. I must say I was skeptical at first, knowing it was a stephen starr place and given how much hype it got pre-opening and post. I am not one to jump on band wagons, but this one i will say is worth a trip every once and a while. You order either your beer or food from one of the bars located throughout the inside, get your beer and choose a spot to relax. There's tables inside or outside, benches around a fire pit and pingpong or fussball tables for play at no charge. you can also grab a box of jenga and play at your table. Food is delivered to your table and you serve yourself condiments and forks/knives/napkins from a station set up near the front. The beer was all german-influenced, though not all imports are from germany. we stuck with the half liter beers which were plenty big enough for our taste...the full liters are pretty huge and kind of intimidating. the burger we ordered was kind of lack-luster and definitely over-priced at $12. They did not ask for a temp when i ordered and it slipped my mind at the time so when it arrived it was overdone for our taste. The half chicken had an interesting sauce that was tasty. I've only been once and it was during the day on a sunday so i cannot speak to what the scenes like at night time, but from this experience i'd say we'd go back and check it out again. Overall i'd say the vibe here is low-key at least during the day and the food and beer a bit over priced for what you get, but definitely worth a stop in again.
