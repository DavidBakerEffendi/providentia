My wife and I came here for the first time about four years ago when we first started dating, it was instantly one of our favorite places. The food is consistently excellent and we've never been disappointed. The specials are always very creative and delicious. We've said the chef is "five start uptown", but in an east village neighborhood restaurant. The staff is super friendly and we look forward to seeing them during each visit. Excellent and creative desserts, and great sangria as well!
