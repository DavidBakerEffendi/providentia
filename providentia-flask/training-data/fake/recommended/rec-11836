When you walk into Penelope, its cute bakery causes you to immediately salivate with the sight of: carrot cake, red velvet cake, peanut butter blondies, cupcakes and cookies. Penelope is the only "gem" in Murray Hill so, unfortunately, the wait for brunch is consistently an hour to an hour-and-a-half on weekends. However, the amazing prices Â are unbeatable for the delicious treats. Food to get- (See pic of the food by going to my blog which is listed on my profile) Brunch: Penny Egg sandwich on a croissant with pesto. only $8 Dinner: Arugula with chicken meatball salad chicken meatball sandwich When Veggie Met Sally Salad (veggie burger salad) Warm Brie and Apple Sandwich Fries Rock Red Velvet cake is ok. Peanut butter blondie is better. The Scene: The inside is painted bright, light blue, and the glossy, wooden tables are finished with a newspaper looking recipe printed in the center. The food is great! If you can't stand the brunch wait (or can't get anyone who lives nearby to put your name on the list), go for dinner and you won't have a problem. Good thing they serve cake all day!
