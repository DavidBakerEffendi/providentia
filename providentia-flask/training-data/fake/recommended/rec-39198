We ate here during a weekday late afternoon. Since this is normally when a restaurant is busy catching it's collective breath and restocking before dinner, we did not expect much as first time visitors. We were wrong. From the moment we entered, and were promptly welcomed with a handshake from the owner, it only got better. The food was prepared and presented without a single mis-step or fault. Every item was cooked properly and tasted beyond my ability to convey here. You will just have to experience it yourself. It is comforting to know there are still restaurants out there that remember we are not customers, we are guests. Being a curmudgeon, I struggled to find a complaint. The only thing I could come up with was that they had no Strega. If you haven't guessed yet, I highly recommend. If this is how they are during down time, I can not wait to try when they have their game on.
