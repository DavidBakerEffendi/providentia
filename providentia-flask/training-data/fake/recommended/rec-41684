I've been here several times and I am never disappointed with the tacos or margarita . The tacos average about $4 a piece . Parking can be difficult and sometimes there isn't available seating ( reasons for the 4 stars ) . Worth the wait?! Uhhh yea ! It's a short drive for me but I'm always willing to make it . At $4-$5 a piece per taco, it's pricey because it adds up , BUT definitely worth it .
