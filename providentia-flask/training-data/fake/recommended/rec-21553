The noodles were amazing and unique. Definately a hole in the wall in terms of ambience but is a true gem. I felt that I was at a real Chinese restaurant unlike many other imitations that serve Americanized dishes. Simple and delicious and I know exactly what I'm getting when I go there...delicious hand drawn/shaved noodles with my choice of meat,...with my assortment of spice and flavor. DELICIOUS!
