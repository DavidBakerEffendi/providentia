This is a nice burger place to go to. I went with some of my friends today and I like the fact that it is not a noisy environment and it's very relaxing. The service was great and the staff were very friendly. The burgers were heavenly, the only thing I wish is that fries came with the burger instead of having to pay for them separately. But since they're not that pricey it was all good in the end. Definitely plan on going back!
