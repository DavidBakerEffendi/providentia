Everyone has reviewed the food and I really can't add anymore good feelings about it.  So, a few words on the dining room experience.  We had an 8 pm Saturday reservation and was seated promptly in the back room. What I immediately noticed was the noise level.  At the two adjacent tables their voice level was very high.  And that I can understand becuase the dining room is designed poorly and does not  absorb the noise, and everyone just wants to speak louder to be heard.  By the time my main dinner course was over, I was ready to head out into the quiet of the NYC streets.
