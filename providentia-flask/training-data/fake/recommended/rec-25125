Ooooow Mami! Dayummmm!! Dat burger was wicked good. Great quality meat and the buns are pretty neat. Not the best burger I've had and it's pretty expensive for the size of the sides/burgers. I really enjoyed the fried pickles very much. It tasted like jalape√±os almost haha. Very well battered and full of flavor. The truffle burger was supreme and amazing. Very juicy... almost too much juice it overflowed everywhere. It had a distinct flavor... almost like the patty was marinated in potatoes. Would love to come here multiple times but it really is too expensive for my liking. Also word of advice... don't get the fries they're way to thin and taste more like potatoes chips haha.
