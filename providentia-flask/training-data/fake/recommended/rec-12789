Shake shack runs the burger scene on NYC. Lines stretch 25+ deep at Madison Square Park at all hours of the day. For all the hype that is Shake Shack, UMAMI IS BETTER. We tried to beat the dinner rush but by the time we got there the quoted wait time was 45 minutes. Contrast that with the expected wait time of 2+ hours as we were leaving and you'll get an idea of how crazy people are. They waitress highlighted the extensive cocktail and beer list with influences from local establishments. For food, a little homework is required in order to dig up their secret menu items. The secret duck burger was not being served on this night, but we were able to order the cheesy tots. The Original Umami Burger($12) is still my favorite. You get mushrooms and a crispy piece of cheese. It's unlike any other burger I've eaten. The Truffle Burger ($12.5) only costs marginally more but drops all the great fillings mentioned above in exchange for truffling. My one issue with most things truffled, is if you're going to highlight something with truffle, don't skimp on it. 'Make 'em manly' Fries (cheese, onion strings, and bacon) were underwhelming. Until you mix them with the sauces, but more on that in a second. Smushed potatoes are just that - flat smashed potatoes great for dipping. The 3 complimentary sauces should have at least one that appeals to you. It boils down to ranch, hot sauce, and garlic aioli each with their own twist. While the sauces are amazing, placing one set per dining group is just a shame. For the staff to drop down a single set of sauces for both a party of 2 and a party of 6, lacks common sense.
