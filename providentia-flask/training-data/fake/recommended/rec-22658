The food is exceptional and the decor is amazing. For a moment I felt I was in Europe. The staff friendly and were on the ball. For my appetizer I share pasta with truffles and a cream sauce with fresh asiago cheese. It's was amazing. Had pork chop over mash potatoes with caramelized apples and onions. It was great. Had creme bruele for desert. Good not amazing. Crepes with nutella looked good at the other table. Prices are fair. Will def be back again.
