Delicious little place in Williamsburg. I has the fish and chips, which was a giant piece of fish fried to perfection served with tartar sauce, vinegar, and spicy fries, which were just the right amount of spicy. Would definitely come back to try the burgers or if I were craving fish again. Cash only!
