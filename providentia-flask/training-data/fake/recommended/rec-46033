My fiancé took me here for my bday and I love this place. It was my first time here and it was a quiet Wednesday night. The ambiance is a bit dark but the staff was extremely friendly. My fiancé and I ordered a sushi boat, which included sushi and sashimi for around $50-60, which I thought was great considering the amount of sushi you get. I'm very picky about my sushi but I'm always willing to try something once. The reason for my giving this place a 4 star was because the sashimi looked a bit dry. The fish on top didn't look as fresh as I would've liked, making me a little bit skeptic to eat the sashimi. One upside to this place is that it's BYOB. Those who are looking for a more intimate place in the Montclair area should try this place out. The prices were decent and the staff was fast. The preparation for sushi takes a bit longer, but well worth the try!
