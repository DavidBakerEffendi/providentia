The Original Pancakes House has definitely reinvented breakfast!!   This is my FAVORITE breakfast spot in the world.   I have been dining here for years!  Everything about their food is excellent b/c it is unlike anything you ever had!  From the dough batter, to whip cream and butter...EVERYTHING is made fresh in house. Every item is unique. Favs:  Dutch Baby, Banana Crepe, Tahiti Crepe, Cinnamon Almond French Toast, ANY omelette, Corn beef hash....every and anything.     Please try the Original Pancake house and email your thoughts!!
