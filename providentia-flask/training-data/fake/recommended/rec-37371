All things are relative.  The food at Fornos is good.  Not great...not very good.  It's good. Portions are plentiful. With all the good restaurants in the area (if you know the area...I grew up down neck) it is overpriced. It's near the train station and not far from downtown so that may contribute to the pricing but, if you're driving into the Ironbound for dinner on evening, there are other eateries that are as good (better) for less money.
