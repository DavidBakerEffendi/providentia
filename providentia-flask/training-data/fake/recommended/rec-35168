This could have been a good experience... IF -had they not totally forgotten about us and made us get up THREE times to get service. -It was literally, here sit, here are some drinks, then waiter disappeared the whole meal. -After looking for the waiter a few times he finally sent a girl back to take our order. Food was served, and again, nobody to be seen. Got up again to get service. -The check came and we tipped based on the horrible service, a very standard tip, not even deserved at all. The waitress came back and DEMANDED a higher tip. I politely said "tipping is based on service and since you pretty much left us alone the entire time, that is what we are leaving." Never ever going back. Â  APALLED!
