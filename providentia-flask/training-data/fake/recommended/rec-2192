Family members live nearby and brought us here for dinner several years ago.  We definitely enjoyed things. More recently, we had a catered meal from here.  The vodka pasta and the chicken marsala were fabulous!  We also had broccoli and gnocchi.  Nothing wrong with those either.  The bread was perfectly crunchy too. We do not live in this area, but we will gladly dine at Reservoir anytime we are.
