Kumo is good sushi:  fresh, expertly made, but I havent' tried any of their specialty rolls and thus far haven't round anything that impressed me.  Their rolls and sashimi are overpriced so that their 50% off gimmick seems like a deal, but it just brings the prices to a more reasonable level.  $10 for Ikura?  No.  That's $5 per piece, which is highly overpriced.   Their miso soup had a nice broth but unfortunately my order had very little seaweed or tofu.  Still, the flavor was very nice and I enjoyed it.   I'll be ordering from them again.  Their lunch special is a good deal and like I said, it's fresh and on-point.  I just wouldn't classify it as spectacular, but it is a solid go-to spot when they have their promotions going.  Otherwise, it's a little overpriced.
