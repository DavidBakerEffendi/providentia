We stumbled upon this place while out in the East Village on a Saturday night. I was hungry so I made the group stop here and get some food and drinks. Bad idea! The service we had was awful. Our waiter barely paid attention to us. We would ask questions and he'd give rude answers, then he walked away when we weren't done talking to him. We had to flag him down again later to order. When we did order, our $11 appetizer was the size of my hand. Literally 3 bites. Who would pay $11 for that? Luckily, I split it between my friends and we left as soon as our drinks were done. Will not be going back.
