First I want to say that I've been coming here since they opened last year, and it shocks me that it has a single bad review. The owner and employees are very nice and the food and wine are delicious. Olivier has an authentic menu and a good selection of wines for very good prices. The carafes of house wine are an excellent deal for 2 people, and both house wines are delicious! My partner is French and was very pleasantly surprised by how good this place was. If you want affordable and authentic French food and atmosphere, this is your place. I highly recommend the moules mariniere and the lobster risotto, both were awesome (depending on seasonal menu). Â The steak frites is my favorite thing to get, so delicious with peppercorn or shallot sauce. The cheese plate is good and with great French cheeses that you won't find in other restaurants (Tomme, Morbier). We have been frequenting Olivier since it opened last year and have not been disappointed yet! PS. The portions here are healthy and filling. I've never walked away hungry.
