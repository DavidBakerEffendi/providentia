I'm a regular at Public, as well as a member of their wine program.  Public continues time and time again, to provide my guests and I a terrific dining expierience. The atmosphere is romantic, urban chic..  Up beat and busy.  It can get loud, if you are looking for a quiet night, Public might not be for you. The food continue to impress, with complex flavor profiles and great presentation. Fun place to go, if you are looking for a vibrant crowd.
