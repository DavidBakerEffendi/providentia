We stopped by Rybread before heading over to the Art museum and fell in LOVE with the place!  I got the Buffalo Chicken sandwich and my girl got the San Diego sandwich.  Both were delicious!  We will be back soon for sure, esp. when the outside patio is open. A+ and will be recommending to friends.
