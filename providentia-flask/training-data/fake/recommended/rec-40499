Philadelphia = Philly Cheesesteaks. Boom. Naturally, I had to make a stop at Pat's during my short stay in Philly. With Pat's being the founder/creator of the locally-famed concoction, I knew this place would satisfy my hopes for the traditional cheesesteak experience. Now the real interesting part is that I could only squeeze in a stop to Pat's around 7am as we were headed out of town...so yes, I had a gigantic Philly cheesesteak at perhaps the most unusual hour ever. All thanks to the fact that Pat's is open 24/7! Regardless, the sandwich - cheese wiz steak wid onions - was pretty tasty. I was pleasantly surprised by the freshness of the bread, the quantity of the steak, the flavor of the cheese, and the balancing effect that the onions had in melding all of the sandwich components into one cohesive unit. Overall though, I must say that this famed combination of the cheese wiz and onion steak was just pretty good and not nearly as spectacular as some of the other reviewers have noted. I think I may have enjoyed the sandwich more had I gotten it with provolone and no onions - as that is more of the type of flavor profile I'd dig...next time! For it being so early, the worker was pretty chatty....must be a morning person. that PLUS he had a wonderfully thick Philly accent! such a tourist :)
