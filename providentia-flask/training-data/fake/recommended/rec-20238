This has become my new favourite place, and with all of my cravings since having it last weekend, I can't help but wonder if their key ingredient is crack. The food is GREAT. Surprisingly great, in fact. I want to try everything, but I was so in love with the Arroz Con Pollo and the red cabbage (??) side that it came with that I doubt I'll ever stray. Seriosuly. Whatever that side was, I could eat it every day for the rest of my life. The atmosphere was equally fantastic. As a person who tends to be a little, um... boisterous, I didn't feel loud and crazy at all. Everyone was having a good time and enjoying themselves. I will definitely be back. Again and again. In fact, we're going this weekend for my birthday. There's a pitcher of Sangria with my name all over it.
