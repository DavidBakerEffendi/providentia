I live two blocks away from Kiwiana and I really wanted to love it. My first visit was for brunch on Saturday. I lived in New Zealand in 2005 and was looking forward to having it in the hood! My boyfriend and i ordered cappucinos and were told it would take a couple minutes for the machine to warm up. No problem. I ordered the yogurt and granola with fresh berries ($8) and my boyfriend ordered boar sausages with bubble and squeak ($15). My food was fine, but there was barely any of it. After about three bites my food was gone and i was still hungry. By the way, it didn't come with fresh fruit, it came with dried apricots. My boyfriend said the sausages were good but not amazing or special and the bubble and squeak was bland. Oh did i mention we still don't have our coffee? After twenty minutes or so they brought us some super weak drip coffee with foam on top. We sent it back, got the check, and bounced. I am giving Kiwiana two stars because the staff was really nice. they cant help it if the food sucks or the portions are tiny. Wouldnt bother going back. There is too much good stuff out here to eat to waste my time on second chances.
