Decor is so cute, the staff were knowledgeable and friendly, and the food was spectacular. Okay, so we only had the oysters and the free popcorn, but it was still amazing! Im a huge oyster fan and these were some of the freshest. They come with non traditional jam-like condiments (spicy, bittersweet, and smokey). I was only a fan of the spicy as the others were really overpowering. A little bit of a lemon on the oysters was fantastic as well. Oyster happy hours: sun and monday all day for $1, tues-sat 6-8pm $1 and fri and sat from 12-2am $1.
