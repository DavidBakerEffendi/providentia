Eating at Kona Grill was my first experience with sushi and I found the food to be tasty and approachable. The waiter was surprisingly helpful and friendly when I revealed my newbie status; he not only recommended the staple sushi dishes but a few of the more exotic choices as well that my untrained palette might enjoy. I took his advice and everything was delicious. Overall, the decor and ambiance of the restaurant is perfect for a weekend dinner with friends or a Date Night. My only complaints are that I can't remember the names of what I ate and I now have sushi cravings.
