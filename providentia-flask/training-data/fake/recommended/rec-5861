boyfriend and i went here a few nights ago. the atmosphere is crazy in here, with a huge chandelier, couches downstairs that wrap and wind around, and upstairs has basket seats that hang from the ceiling! overall its an interesting looking place indeed. now, onto food. we shared the lobster mac and cheese [which uses orzo instead of a more tradtional noodle, and has seasoned breadcrumbs all over the top] YUM, and the bbq chicken quesadilla [came with avocado sour cream, mmmmm]. both entrees were amazing, but the menu is smallish which may make it harder for a picky eater to find something right away. so overall, food was very good and came out very quickly. BUT the problem that i encountered there was that i asked for REGULAR sweet tea to drink and i was informed that they only carry flavored teas, so i think "okay, no problem, peach tea please" and boyfriend orders a raspberry tea. all well and good untill we get our bill and our two teas each and one refill each [four teas total] equals out to over $20!! thats more than the lobster mac and cheese costs! so we asked if this was correct on the bill, only to be informed by another waiter which was not our own that they DO in fact carry regular sweet tea and that it is the only kind that has free refills! so if this review was only food based, five stars all the way. but due to five dollar water and tea power concoctions, 3 stars it is my friends.
