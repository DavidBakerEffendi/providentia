It's a gastro pub with New Orleans décor.  They have a New Orleans style brunch on Sundays.  We went for dinner though and the comfort food hit the spot. We were visiting from out of town and who knew Philly would rock this down home cooking! I recommend the brisket, mac & cheese and big ass biscuits.  The beer selection is good as well.  The prices are really reasonable.  The staff was friendly and attentive even on a busy Saturday night.  The restaurant noise can get quite loud so I wouldn't recommend if you're trying to have a quiet, romantic dinner.  I can't wait to get back there.
