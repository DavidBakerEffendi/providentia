Mmmm, nom nom nom. Yummy, yummy tapas (how many 'm's' can I get in that sentence?) Seriously though, this place rocks. Awesome interior and structural design and the food is even better. I went with two others and we ordered the mozzarella in filo, pork empanadas, broccoli rabe, crispy brussel sprouts, marinated lamb skewers, avocado rellenos and chorizo-wrapped shrimp. Though I had to opt out of the mozzarella and empanadas (not gluten-free!) my friends raved about them. I would probably pass on the rabe next time because it was a bit bitter for me but everything else was sensational. Wine selection is good and the glass of Crianza I had was perfectly dry and tasty. I would have given this place 4 stars but bumped it to 5 because I was 30 minutes late for my reservations (tsk, tsk, I know) and they still sat us right away with no problems. Plus, the hostess was impeccably cool and stylish in a way that made me slightly jealous.
