This place rocks! I started my day off poorly waiting forever in traffic on the BQE causing me to miss my examination. While waiting for other errands I went on Yelp, found this place, rolled on over and relaxed. Awesome food at a reasonable price. Great place to slow down and relax. They aren't the quickest here anyway. They even have six beers for $10. They were playing Sonic Youth while I was there so that was pretty cool.
