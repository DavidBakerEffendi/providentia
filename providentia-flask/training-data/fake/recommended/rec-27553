Wow, this place has the best pasta I have had outside of Italy.  The pasta was absolutely incredible, everything about it.  What's more, the inside is incredibly charming and cozy, the staff is wonderful and it is incredibly reasonably priced.  I would come back here in a heartbeat. I had the special pasta with monkfish, asparagus and capers and it was amazing.  The gnocchi with gorgonzola was also amazing but really rich so make sure you can share with your neighbor if you order that.  Buffallo mozzarella tastes just like Napoli.
