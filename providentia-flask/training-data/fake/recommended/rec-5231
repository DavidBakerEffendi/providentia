Simon Pierce is an upscale spot, overlooking a waterfall and appended to a fancy glass shop. Only a little bit away from the Dartmouth campus, the restaurant takes full advantage of the gorgeous New England location and makes for the perfect date spot. I would say that the food is typical "country club" food, more about plating and fancy ingredients than deliciousness. Â Although the fish I got was perfectly flakey and the mash potatoes it sat on top was divinely creamy and well seasoned. I just think that it could have been served anywhere. What you're really paying for is the view, which is seriously breathtaking in the fall, with the foliage and the waterfall looking like something out of a painting. So really this review is probably a 3.5, but I rounded down bc food is important to me. Great place for a date, time it so you can watch the sun set during dinner!
