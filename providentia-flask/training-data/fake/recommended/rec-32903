Sat at a bar height community table on high bar stools -under the table is a coat and bag hook, clever for the tight space of the restaurant.  Only tried a couple of dishes -the bun with pork belly and slaw and the sliced duck with watercress served over rice. Both were fine and tasty. There were several condiments on the table -the yummiest was the fried onion and garlic bits. The bun was cumulus dense and I got lucky with not too fatty meat inside -unlike my neighbor's whose looked more like a slices of lard (probably tasty too). The duck meat breast was juicy, tender and delicious. All enjoyable albeit pricey for the portion size.  Wait staff were nice busy bees. In the open kitchen you could see the chefs artfully designing each plate. I will return at an off peak time to savor this lovely asian-ish food.
