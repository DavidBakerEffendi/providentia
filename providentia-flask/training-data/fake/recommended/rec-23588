Good, but could be great. This is in a great location to start an evening in downtown Burlington.  Well-positioned on Church Street, there is always plenty of people watching if you can get an outdoor table in warm weather.   In the spirit of full disclosure, I will admit that I continue to visit Church & Main for the chili-glazed calamari.  I think it is some of the best I've had.  It's not overly-breaded and the chili sauce is a great addition.  While I've never been incredibly disappointed with anything I've eaten there, the calamari is the only thing that stood out.   Having read a few of the older reviews, I will agree that the service leaves much to be desired.  I've shared the experience with many others that you have to work to get the host's attention and then wait a long time even after being seated to put a drink order in.  I've also asked to be put on the wait list and told it would be 45 minutes, during which time I strolled up Church St. and found immediate outdoor seating at Sweetwaters.  When I called to have my name taken off the list, the host said "I have a table ready, but since you couldn't wait 5 minutes.."
