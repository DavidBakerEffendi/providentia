Had dinner there with friends and enjoyed it immensely.I had the vegetarian fajitas and spinach w/ mushrooms.I would give it five stars but for two factors; the music was too loud and the temperature was too warm. The temperature is not a major point but I wish restaurants would stop with the loud music.People come to restaurants to talk and having to shout to have a conversation is not enjoyable.
