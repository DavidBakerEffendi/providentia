Walking into Juniper, I was taken aback by how small it is with limited seating in the front.  We must have hit it just right, being seated immediately, because people started rolling in in droves, each carrying a bottle of wine or six pack of beer.  Did I mention it's BYOB?  There must be a black hole through the kitchen because a whole slew of people went through there.  Apparently there's some nice garden seating out the back. DO NOT call this diner food.  This is comfort food at it's best.  Tom, the chef & owner serves up some of the most amazing dishes from an albeit limited menu, but makes each dish his own and with a lotta love & care.  To say that the menu is eclectic is an understatement.  It is a true American melting pot from all over the country with the chef adding his signature, accents & spins on classics.  He even made it a point to come out during a lull in the kitchen to greet his guests and make sure everybody liked their food. We started with the (mmmmm) catfish poppers & mussels w/wine, garlic & shallots.  The mussels were on the small side, but went really well with the shallots on top of crustini.  The broth of the mussels was so good, we were using the half shells as spoons and drinking it as soup!  I really couldn't decide on an entree because I wanted to try everything from the Truffle burger to the Jambalaya.  I decided to lay off the meat and go with the Linguini & Shrimp, which at $15 was the most expensive dish on the menu (along with the Jambalaya), super bargains.  It came with 7 colossal shrimp in a similar broth as the mussels but with parmesan cheese for added depth.  The rest of the family had Pulled Pork & Catfish sandwiches & the Jambalaya.  We even shared a huge green salad to add some roughage in there.  We saw the mac & cheese at the next table and it was HUGE!  We'll have to try that next time. When Peter D gives it 5 stars, you better well show up there with your cash in hand.  Oh and it is cash only.
