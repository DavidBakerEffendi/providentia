I went to Pho 501 with my mom one Saturday around 1:30ish.  I had trouble parking because the place was packed and the giant snow banks did not help the situation!       Now, you must know that I have never had pho.  My mom, however, is a fan.  They only had the one thing on the menu, beef noodle soup-you can add shrimp if you want, so two things then?  You can get it in sm, med, or lg.  Saturdays they are supposed to have also the spicy beef noodle soup but they ran out that day.  But really, I was fine with that, 'cause I was only going to eat one thing anyway.  This made my choice easier.  So I ordered a sm beef and shrimp.  Customize your bowl with the condiments they provide: fresh basil, bean sprouts, lime, chili, sriracha sauce.  You got yourself a pretty nice bowl of noodles with a refreshing broth.         The young man who took our order was very friendly, as was the older man at the counter.  My mom tells me that as far as pho goes theirs is quite good!
