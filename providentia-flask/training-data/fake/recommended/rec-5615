El Vez is a party disguised as a restaurant/bar. Totally enjoyed our last visit to this trendy addition to trendy Midtown Village. Lucky to score seats outside, trading the crazy crowded, indoor scene for the crazy, crowded street scene which adds to the festive atmosphere. The tacos & guacamole were delicious & the margaritas strong. All in our group gave it 2 thumbs up.
