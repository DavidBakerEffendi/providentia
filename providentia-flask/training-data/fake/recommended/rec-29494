Went here for breakfast and was very disappointed. Service was poor and the prices on the the check were significantly higher than those listed on the menu they provided. They tried to charge a dollar more than the menu price for my western omelet and the coffee prices were inflated on the bill as well. Add to that the slooooow service. The wait to place the order was way out of line and we had to ask several times for juice that was supposed to be included in our order.
