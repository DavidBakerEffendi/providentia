Meatball are indeed delicious but the highlight of our meal was the ice cream sandwich dessert. The menu is very minimalist, we got the message that this place was all about meatballs very quickly. We were quoted a 45 minute wait on Saturday night but as soon as we turned to leave that turned into a 5 minute wait. Probably just luck, not saying you should do this and expect to be seated immediately.
