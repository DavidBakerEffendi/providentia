You are all being DUPED!   I have no idea why people flock to this place, and the fact that people wait in line to get in is just plain stupid.  I resent having to give this place any stars, but Yelp made me give it at least 1. The food is not at all special and overpriced.  I am willing to admit that it is perhaps on par with any other cheap diner in Brooklyn, but the truth is that Tom's isn't really that cheap...It costs me something like 14 or 15 bucks to have lunch there.  Their home fries are season-less and not crispy.   The coffee is amongst the worst I've ever had...it's watery and flavorless even by NYC deli standards.  It literally toes the line of whether or not you can call it coffee.  It is like drinking brown hot water.  It is pointless.   People seem to rant and rave about the service...well, the reason I'm writing this review right now is because I just had the unfortunate experience of going to Tom's...trust me, I avoid it at all costs, but Cafe Shane is being renovated (more on that later)...anyways, I placed my breakfast order, and waited..and waited, only to find out 20 minutes later that my order had not been placed!  They started to ask me what my order was again, at which point I left.  Furthermore, passing out disgusting sugar cookies with metal tongs does not compensate for impersonal service. I know people like to cut Tom's some slack because of it's old school charm, or it decor, or atmosphere, but that is COMPLETE crap!  I am not charmed.  The decor is tacky, and I have a feeling that people in the 50's thought so as well.  The music is just terrible.  It is the soundtrack of purgatory.   The craziest part of all of this is that I have walked past that long line at Tom's countless times to go to Cafe Shane's TWO DOORS DOWN, where the food is DELICIOUS, and there's usually never a wait, and the service is great and personable, and the atmosphere is awesome, usually with Soul music playing, or a DVD of James Brown or Sam Cooke being played, AND IT'S CHEAPER THEN TOM'S!!!!!! So if you enjoy waiting in line to pay too much money for sub par food, while sitting on plastic lawn furniture and listening to mind numbing music, then Tom's is your place....I'll be at Cafe Shane's.
