Its good food, and gives off the traditional Turkish Gyro shops you see at every corner in Istanbul. But sadly I wasn't able to get the exact taste from Turco. The "fast food" style is ideal, yet we found the service to be extremely slow. It should never take that long to throw some gyro meat between bread and serve it on a plate. The staff is friendly, and the place is clean.If you're in the neighborhood.. its definitely an option, but don't make the mistake of trekking out of your way because it has "such great reviews".
