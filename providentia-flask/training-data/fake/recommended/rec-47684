This may not be the end all pizza place in New Haven, but it certainly is one of my favorites. They have a friendly staff, and massive pizzas and calzones that could easily feed 4 people or more. Easily one of the best values in New Haven. Â They tend to be a little bit laid back at times, but I think it may be because they don't get nearly the amount of business they should be getting.
