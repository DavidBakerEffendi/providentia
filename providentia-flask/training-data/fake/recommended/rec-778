I was given a chance at the 'cheesesteak' challenge (Pat's vs Geno's) and had to take it.   We were passing through and thought, 'Hey, let's stop for cheesesteaks'! I ordered a cheesesteak 'wit' (which means with onions), and added mushrooms, and provolone. The service was very quick here and the employees don't mess around.  If you start asking questions, in their mind...you are just holding up the line....it's pretty funny to sit and watch people order.... I opened the wrapper and....no magic fairys flew out.....it looked like a regular cheesesteak....I was a little bummed, but I ate it anyway. In all honesty, it was just ok.  I have had better cheesesteaks in SoCal... The bun was soft, the meat was nice, and the veggies too, but there was no binding ingredient to make it come together.  The provolone slices were thick and cold, and that also hurt the sandwich score.  Normally, I am a 'contrast of textures and multi temperature' guy, but in this case, melty cheese would have been better.....should have gotten the whiz? Just ok sandwich but fun experience.....
