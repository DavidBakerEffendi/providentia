Always so consistently tasty! I don't care if it's out of the way, whenever I'm passing near Astoria, I have to patronize this unique gastronomic delight. Please give the Wafco's a try, a perfect blend of sweet and savory! And support such a great culinary offering to ensure they'll be around a while. One of NYC's hidden gems!
