I've been going to Blue Point for about 8 years or so and I've never had a disappointing meal. It is a bit pricey but I've always found the fish to be fresh and always prepared well. My biggest complaint is the wait (they are taking reservations now). I've waited as long as one hour to be seated! The she-crab soup has always been one of my favorites and I always order the halibut if it's on the menu! One of these days I'm going to participate in Oysterfest....
