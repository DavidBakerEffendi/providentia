Love this place! Delicious Mediterranean inspired food in a great, relaxed atmosphere with great service and delicious wine. The chef is very accommodating of tweaking dishes to be vegan and is honest about when doing so will compromise the dish. This place is a go to when we want tasty food that doesn't feel heavy or greasy and always tastes fresh.
