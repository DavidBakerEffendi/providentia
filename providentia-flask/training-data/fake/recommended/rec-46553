Let's face it...brunch is the best meal of the day, so it's important to nail down a good location for taking part in this mid-day affair. I've been to many restaurants for brunch, and this is by far my favorite. The atmosphere is pretty cozy, but I prefer the front room to the back. The back room reminds me of what I'd think an old European brothel would be like. The menu is extensive and innovative, and they also offer the entire regular lunch/dinner menu at brunch-time, so your choices are expansive. No- NOT expEnsive, expAnsive. In fact, the menu at supper is quite the opposite of what I'd call pricey. On my first visit to Supper, I ordered eggs parmagiana since it's a bit out of the ordinary and was comprised of ingredients I adore- eggs, sauce, cheese. It was absolutely delightful, and definitely a dish I'd order again. However, let me preface what I'm about to say by informing you that I love baked goods and sweet things more than any other genre of food. The meal that was placed across the table from me was almost enough to move me to tears. My boyrfriend ordered the french toast with fresh fruit, and was nice enough to offer me a bite of it. As he moved the fork toward my mouth, a heavenly scent floated off of the utensil and permeated my nostrils. Finally, I tasted the most enchanting breakfast food I've ever been exposed to. This french toast is the french toast that all other french toasts should strive to be! I returned for brunch the next day and needless to say...I ordered the french toast.
