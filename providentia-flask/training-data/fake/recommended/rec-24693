Recently visited here 3 times in 2 days!!!  Twice for dinner and once to watch game/drink at bar. The food is outstanding.  Steak Tartar y Frites is a winner.  Also, Crab cakes are delish.  I wish I lived closer as this would be my spot to meet up with friends.  Cool vibe, excellent service, and great food/drinks!!   10/10!
