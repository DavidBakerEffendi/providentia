If you go to Jane Restaurant you should really just make a reservation. It gets really crowded and I'm sure the wait is hellish. But I feel like this is common sense when you go to any popular restaurant in Manhattan. The interior is really charming and it's pretty spacious. But they did overcrowd it a little with the tables. So sometimes waiters bump into you. No biggie. I had a cup of coffee and the Farm House Scramble. My friends got the Jane Benedict and B.L.T&e. The Farm House Scramble was delicious! I thought it was going to be heavy and greasy. They added chopped ham, gruyere, and onions to the eggs. But much to my surprise, the scrambled eggs were so light and airy. No excess grease and they complimented the mixed green salad well. If you want carbs with this dish, you can just add some of the complimentary bread. I wasn't able to pick at my friend's egg benedict but I did try some of the homefries. The home fries were delicious and there was a hint of garlic. These were crispy and chewy and chopped up into smaller pieces. Best three bites ever! As for the BLT&e my friend, unfortunately, did not like it. She said it was too salty and too heavy. It's a little bit of a downer but you can't win 'em all. I enjoyed the coffee. It was light and aromatic. Thankfully it wasn't burnt and there was no weird aftertaste. So all in all, it was a good cup. I really enjoyed my visit and it was definitely a very pleasant dining experience. The menu sounded so appetizing and I wish I could have ordered more. I can see myself coming back in the near future, and I definitely plan on ordering the steak salad with a glass of chardonnay next time. Also, I definitely want to try the blood orange mimosa.
