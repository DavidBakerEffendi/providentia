Wow. Located in Newark's tiny (but thriving) Muslim district, Mecca's Halal Restaurant has some shockingly good food.  Don't let the lofty name fool you; though they do serve middle eastern classics like shawerma and falafel, the big ticket items here are down home comfort food, served cafeteria style.  I don't know how they do it, but their trays of food taste better than the freshly prepared stuff of their Broad Street competition. I got this awesome sweet chicken, with mac+cheese and collard greens on the side, for $7.50.  I'm literally drooling on my keyboard just thinking about it.  I would give it a five, but the decor is pretty terrible.  I'm seriously in love with this place!
