Food was good, however service was seriously lacking. I ate dinner at the bar, and the bartender was indifferent and aloof. Even when there was a problem with my order and something had to be reordered, he took no ownership of the situation and delegated to others. After the corrected item was served, he never checked with me about it. Really poorly trained, or maybe he's just a bad hire.
