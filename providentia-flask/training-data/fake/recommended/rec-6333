There are very few (if any) places that I leave feeling like I need to create multiple yelp profiles so I can rate them over and over and over an over. Ok I'll stop. But i'd love to rate them over and over. I never write reviews until my 2nd or 3rd visit. This was my 3rd and maybe I caught the place on a good week night or maybe not, it was f&$@ing unbelievable. Ordered 4 items to share - tilapia taco, guac , calamari, and paella. I could've skipped the taco * was ok but not great* everything else ... hit the spot. The service might've been the best part of the night...after a while I wasn't sure If I was in a reality tv show + they were just acting. It was that good. Extreme friendliness. Free champagne. Half priced bottle of Reisling (for dessert). #blissAndAhalf Anyway my date ended up being amazE Â and I know deep down that it had to do with this place...and of course my limitless swag. Thanks Jose. Ill come again. (#noPun).
