I l-o-v-e Ethiopian food and am a certified enjeraholic.  Based on the rave Yelp reviews, I hustled to beat the dinner rush, but there were only two people in there besides me at 6:00 on a Saturday night, not counting a few people who came in later to get smoothies.  The restaurant is tiny with two levels.  Sitting at the bar in front of the window is good for people watching. As I was coasting in from the other coast having had nothing but a coffee and a banana all day, every (Ethiopian) item on the menu sounded great.  The veggie combo won out over the zilzil tibs, and it did not disappoint.  The flavors were tasty, and the enjera was tender and flavorful; I ate every last bite.  Terrific service.  Sounds like I should have had a coffee, but that gives me a reason to return.
