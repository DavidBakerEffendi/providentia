I haven't written a review in some time but I definitely could not skip out on this. This place is wonderful, amazing, warm, friendly, and the food (the most important part, right?) is delicious! We had plans to go elsewhere and picked this on a whim, GREAT DECISION. We were 3 native Russian speakers and my best friend, who is American. I find that in most places like this, the natives are always treated a lot better but here - everyone made a connection and no one felt like an outsider. From the hostess to the manager (I think that's who it was) to our server to the busboys were incredibly pleasant from the moment we came to the OUTSIDE door (the hostess greeted us outside) to the moment we left when were handed a shot of vodka, a pickle, and a cookie (I won't spoil the surprise, but you'll definitely want that cookie, trust me). The place was empty when we got there, about 30 minutes before our reservation, and the hostess politely double checked to make sure we had set aside a table. Why, I wondered? Well, within minutes of us sitting down, it was packed. The server came over right away, we got drinks (great drinks, not too expensive for the neighborhood) and food (same as drinks, great quality - matches the price point, for TriBeCa at least). Everything came out pretty quickly even though the place was packed, which was great. They gave us some traditional Ukrainian head-wear, it was fun to wear (flowers for the ladies, a straw hat for the gentleman) - definitely a very warm environment. Very generous portions, we ordered far too much and couldn't finish the food, and a slice of the cake they offer for dessert (which we did not order but instead spotted at a nearby table) is probably enough to feed a table of 5. All in all, we sat around for a few hours and never felt rushed. Definitely try this place, and definitely try the Cardinal.
