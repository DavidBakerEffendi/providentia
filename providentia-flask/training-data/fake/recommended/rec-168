This is a small, quaint pizza joint which offers Daiya vegan cheese. I got a small pizza which I found to have a nice, flaky crust and fresh vegetables. They sparingly used the Daiya, which I think was a smart move, given that it would over overwhelmed the delicacy of the crust. The service was friendly and prompt. I wouldn't come here with a group larger than 4, though they probably could put some tables together. There's also outdoor seating and live music. If they offered some vegan desserts and some mockmeat toppings (how about some phony pepperoni?) I'd give them another star. Note that the restaurant is in the back of another building, and not on the main street, so you have to walk down an alley to get there.
