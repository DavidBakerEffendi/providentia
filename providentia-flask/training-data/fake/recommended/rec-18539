It was quite interesting to see chef jump from his seat to the counter where the raw foods are right before us. It's quite entertaining to watch two chefs grilling in front of us if you're being seated in the front bar of the restaurant.  The bar is elongated facing towards chef either directly or sideway, so you'll get a pretty good views whereever you're seated. I'd have to say all the food, especially seafoods looks really fresh, I've never seen gigantic shrimp or scallops in shells. We ordered a whole mackeral, veggies such as asparagus, mushroom, brussel sprouts that were grilled to perfection, we also order salmon cerviche, it was beyond delicious and refreshing w just right touch of citrus! the sliced beef (forgot the name of the dish) appetizer was prepared really well, J was nice enough to yield me the last piece cos of odd number of pieces :).  Their menu changes daily, that reassure the freshness of the food! Overall, I love the food, our waters were filled the whole time.  Like most of the yelpers mentioned, the portions can be small, for example, an order of broussel sprout came w 3 pieces, so it comes down to quality over quantity!
