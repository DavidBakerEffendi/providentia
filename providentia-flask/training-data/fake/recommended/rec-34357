I ate here last night with my parents and my children, ages 2 and 4. From the moment we walked in, we were treated with care and attention. The waiter quickly brought a high chair for my youngest, crayons and a coloring page, plus a small mound of pizza dough to keep my kids occupied while we waited for our food. They were thrilled! The Mediterranean salad with candied walnuts, blue cheese, and pears was delicious. The bread was warm and fresh, served with olive oil and grated Parmesan. My parents enjoyed the lentil soup and house salad. Our entrees were also decent--chicken ravioli with pesto and garlic, lobster ravioli, and penne with prosciutto in tomato sauce. My parents felt their dishes were a little too heavy on the sauce, but the waiter was very clear to us when we ordered that we could change anything we wanted about our dishes. Customer service was fantastic. Prices are typical for an Italian restaurant in north Jersey. Yes, it's in a hotel, but the lobby area is lovely, and the outdoor patio (which I've dined at in the summer) is fantastic. We left with a loaf of Calandras famous bread. I would definitely return!
