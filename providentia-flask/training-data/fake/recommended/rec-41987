They advertise as vegetarian but I'm not sure to what extent they really are; they have chicken and meats on their menu. Perhaps they mean that there are vegetarian options available, but even the falafel which is deep fried, I'm not sure if they use separate oil for than their fried chicken dish. Perhaps someone here can clarify this?
