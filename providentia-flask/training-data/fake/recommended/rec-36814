This place is over. After looking at the menu and photos, I'm not sure why I still went but I did. What a waste of $400. Decor is industrial but it's sloppy. The postal boxes are not impressive in person. They don't have a built-in feel, they are just sitting there. The books are ugly... like salvation army ugly. The ferns are so tired and wrong in this setting. Sure the concrete and Edison light bulbs are cool but the whole design does NOT work. The little back room is filled with too-new leather couches and footstools that look like they were bought at the nice corner of the La-Z-Boy store. They have no character and that room has no soul. Portions are very small. Flavor on some dishes is full bodied and on others is missing something... like the Miso Mash. The trout was a real dry fuck. Wine had the shortest pours I have seen in quite some time... maybe ever. My lemon cucumber martini was a watery cucumber mess with no taste of gin. Atmosphere is stuffy. There is no joy here. Music is wrong... Like way-too-loud Blondie? I just didn't connect with the vibe here. I resent going to Public. It's your decision. You have been warned!
