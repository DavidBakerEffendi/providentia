On a business trip to the area and I  was told repeatedly that I had to try this place for lunch. So here's my review: The place looks like a small old house with a big covered front porch.  Not much seating to stay on site for lunch but the staff was very friendly. I ordered the hot and smoke sandwhich that was delicious!  Just like everything in VT (I noticed during my trip) is expensive, but the line out the door proved my colleagues point to eat here.   If you're in town this is a great place to get lunch! If I am ever in town again I will for sure stop in again.
