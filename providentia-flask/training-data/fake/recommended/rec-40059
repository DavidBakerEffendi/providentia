This was fourth time at Buddakan unfortunately this my least favorite of the four experiences. We went with a group of friends and ordered off the group menu. Big mistake. Portions that were served on the group menu were extremely too small, and left hungry. That being said, the service and overall quality of food was great. Bottom line stand clear of the group menu.
