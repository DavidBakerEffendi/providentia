I know the halal guys' illicit secret and I'm going to share it with you. If I mysteriously disappear tomorrow, please tell my mom that I love her and properly dispose of my ashes in the Hudson river, thanks. The Halal guys have a deal with the Mexican thugs down in Tijuana where they get crack for dirt cheap and sprinkle it in their white sauce because that's how good it tastes. Oh and that's where they get their habaneros too to make their flaming hot sauce. Make sure you hit up this joint after you consume copious amounts of Crown because it's only open from the hours of 7pm - 4am. After your plate gets shoved in your face because their so busy and the line is down the block, go over to the left side of the cart and you'll be blessed with unlimited amounts of white sauce and hot sauce! Be careful that you don't get tempted to steal one of the sauce bottles because Pedro is actually hiding in that white van across the street and he'll immediately take you down and throw you into the van where your whereabouts will never be seen again. VERY IMPORTANT TIP: TAKE THE HOT SAUCE TO GO IN THEIR LIL PLASTIC CUPS. THE SAUCE IS HOT ENOUGH FOR YOU TO CRY AND WET YOUR PANTS. Also, If you consume this late-night like all the rest of us alcoholics, you will wake up with cotton mouth since this stuff is super salty. DRINK LOTS OF WATER!
