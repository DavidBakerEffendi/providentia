I tend to enjoy environments such as this as it is more affordable, low-key, nothing fancy with a large menu and craft brews. I do not think a place like this is meant to impress though. Large menu with a great variety and plenty of beers to have. This is a place that you may go to with a larger party as a fail-safe given everyone can get something they enjoy. Everything here is more than affordable, and it is always fun to check out their seasonal crafts. May not completely standout when it comes to food or beer, but definitely somewhere I will likely go again and again knowing exactly what I am getting.
