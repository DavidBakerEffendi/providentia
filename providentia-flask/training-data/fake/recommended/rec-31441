Came on here to write that I loved the food I received last night.  Ordered the short ribs, and scallops for appetizers.  Portion sizes were great, presentation excellent.   Ordered the Back East Porter draft which lived up to its expectations.  My girlfriend had wine and margarita pizza which was delicious.  We can't wait to return
