Ekta, we almost walked by you because we saw you from across the street and thought you were a carryout-only joint. We were wrong. Your food was very tasty, once the order came out right. The deduction here comes because of a somewhat awkward encounter w/ the waiter after my non-meat-eating girlfriend was brought a chicken tikka masala dish instead of the paneer. It took a few minutes of awkward exchange before the mistake was realized and eventually corrected. Once the correct order came out, we were both pleased w/ the food (the Kadai Chicken effectively cleared my sinuses). Overall, a good meal, just took a while to get there.
