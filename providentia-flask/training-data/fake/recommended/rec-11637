I've lived in the area for 7 years and just now discovered this place (cue over dramatic sad face)! This place - is - PERFECT. I am, like a child (but I am not), a very picky eater.  Meaning I want food that is fresh, simple and flavorful.   I have only ordered the salmon and the israeli breakfast (daily) and have never been happier with a restaurant on Seamless.  The food is so good I want to go in and slap the face of every cook in the kitchen!   I love this place and am moving to the financial district and don't know what I will do without my super amazing breakfast/lunch supplier.  I can't bear to think of not being in their service delivery range...
