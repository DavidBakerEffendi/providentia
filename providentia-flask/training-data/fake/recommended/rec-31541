I am a die-hard fan of Sagami.. and found that most sushi restaurants in Philly & NJ pale in comparison. Well.. I finally experienced Izumi.  WOW!  The spicy tuna roll was out of this world.  The soft shell crab roll was one of the best that I have ever had between here and Asia.  The salmon avocado roll was so flavorful. As far as peices..the fatty tuna was the stuff you dream about.  Hand's down.  When making comparisons.. the Eal, Yellow Tail, & Tamago will always be the BEST at Sagami.  The service was a bit slow at Izumi, and I had to ask the waiter on more then one occasion for  refill of my water.  At most authentic Japanese restaurants, service is exceptional, and water is re-filled every time you put down your glass.  Over all, this was a such a pleasant surprise.. and I am excited that I live so close to such amazing sushi! Bring a bottle.. and enjoy!
