My new favorite Indian place in the area by a wide margin.  I'm still a fan some dishes elsewhere (best veggie samosas: Mehek, best naan: Masala Grill), but overall, this place blows the other guys away.  All of the chicken entrees I've tried have been outstanding, including tikka masala, korma, and cashmere.  The grilled chicken appetizer with onions and peppers (can't recall the name) was amazing.   Can't comment on the service or atmosphere, as all but one of my experiences have been take-out, but everyone seems quite friendly, and they have done a good job with the space (which wasn't all that great to begin with). I would probably award 4.5 stars if I could, because the naan is just a tad dry and lacks the chewy, moist center underneath the crisp crust that I like.  Also, the samosas are very good, but I think they are a bit heavy on the spices.  I also got the chicken soup once because I had a cold and needed a backup in case I couldn't stomach the normal fare that the rest of my family wanted.  I suppose it's what you get for ordering chicken soup at an Indian place, but it wasn't great.
