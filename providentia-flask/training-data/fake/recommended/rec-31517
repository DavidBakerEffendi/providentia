This place is fantastic and super authentic. As we were eating we were already planning our next visit. I ordered a caesar salad for my appetizer that was perfectly dressed and the lettuce was fresh. It also had fresh peeled cheese on top. My mom got artichoke's for her appetizer. Two hearts in a garlic, olive oil sauce. For the main course I ordered the talipia that was on special. Two filets crusted with olives and a bit of bread crumbs. Genius. They sat on top on a tomato and zucchini melody, topped with capers. Delicious! My father ordered the flounder that came with a white sauce and mussels. Also very tasty. Lastly my mother ordered the veal, and it was a piece of steak! Not a wimpy thin piece. It came with mashed potatoes and mushroom sauce, similar to chicken Marsala. While it's byob it's not conducive for large parties. It's a small restaurant. Looking forward to going back! Make reservations!
