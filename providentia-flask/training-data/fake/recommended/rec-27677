A true find -- thank you Angelia for recommending.  I'm not much of a pizza person -- but the pizzas here are more like a work of art.  Jackie and Tom have created a wonderfully warm restaurant with the most amazing BREAD you will ever find.  The pizza is crisp -- and cooked to perfection (no soggy middle) and they feature very unusual specials as well as more traditional menu items that will please everyone in your group.  Last week I had the pizza special (duck sausage and spinach with a ricotta/fig foundation) that was crazy good.  We've tried all their menu items and loved them all.  Did I mention the BREAD! OMG it is the best bread from anywhere near and far -- hands down.  Crisp on the outside - soft on the inside -- with died and gone to heaven flavor.  This will definately be a regular place! As others have mentioned the space is small -- so be prepared.  Also, the only reason I did not give 5 stars is the starters and deserts don't live up to the pizza.  Looking forward to upgrading my rating as these are improved.
