The Bahn Mi is easily in my top 3 favorite sandwiches, the only problem is it's not often done very well (I have my own theories as to why but won't get into it here). For years Silent H in Williamsburg had the best Bahn Mi in NYC until they closed, now Zon has the best, maybe even slightly better than Silent H although a little more expensive. Definitely worth trying.
