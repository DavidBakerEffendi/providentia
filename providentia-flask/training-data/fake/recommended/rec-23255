After hearing rave reviews from friends I decided to make a reservation for my husband and I the day after Valentines Day. Little Fish is a very small & intimate place, perfect for a special evening. It's an open kitchen (which we love) and I also appreciated the single hand-written menu on each table- it was romantic to share. The menu was a selective and perfected list!! We started with the East Coast Oysters (omg amazing!) and the Octopus (holy cow!!). The tentacles were so tender, juicy and HUGE. "This is seriously the best thing I've ever eaten in my life" were my hubby's exact words. Our entrees were so delicious we decided to split up our plates and share the entrees..too good not to have both. Thank you very much for a memorable night. We could not have been more pleased with every part of our meal and the experience. Appetizers, Entrees and Desserts were all of high quality, unique flavors and perfect presentation.The service was just as excellent. Let's just say we'll def be back!
