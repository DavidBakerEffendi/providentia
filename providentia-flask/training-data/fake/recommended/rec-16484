First, let me start off by saying I've never had this without going out before.The food is delicous and it is definitely worth the wait. 3:1 ratio on white sauce to hot sauce. If you want to avoid the grease, I suggest getting chicken/lamb on pita, not the standard platter but definitely tastes just as good without the rice!
