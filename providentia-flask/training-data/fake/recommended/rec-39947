Lorenzo's has moved about a block down Elm St. I went for a Father's Day Lunch, and this is the first time I've been to the new location...they did a nice job on the decor except for some odd "faux marble" panels over the booths.  We had no reservations and were seated promptly.  Our waitress Cassandra, was exceptional; pleasant polite and attentive service without being at all intrusive.  (She is the reason this is 3 stars and not 2)  We shared an order of the fried calamari, which we agreed was chewy and a little fishy tasting.  Next came the house salads, on chilled plates, a decent little salad, fresh crisp greens, but their balsamic vinegarette served on the side had so much oil that you just couldnt get it to whisk together, so I got mostly olive oil...the bleu cheese dressing was very rich and creamy with large chunks of cheese, so thick it was custard like; dad enjoyed it.  .  For entrees we had chicken marsale and chicken florentine; both large portions, both were good but too salty; and with the marsale since it had pancetta in it to begin with, they could easily have skimped on the salt otherwise .  We opted for sides of ziti with the entrees and I only had 2 bites of mine; the sauce was horribly disappointing, and there was an awful lot of water on the bottom of the dish.  A bit disappointing since they have such a loyal following, but I'll give it another go another time...
