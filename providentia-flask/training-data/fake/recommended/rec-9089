I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS RESTAURANT! I am always on the hunt for a good foie gras, and my mission is now near complete. excellent food. the foie gras burger oozes little drops of heaven into your mouth. foie gras and eggs were delicious as well. I have ONE complaint, its not open for dinner most of the week, so i have to work my schedule around their hours. PLEASE OPEN MORE DAYS CHEF! preferably a Monday and Saturday night! i can't even send my friends because their hours are the same as mine!
