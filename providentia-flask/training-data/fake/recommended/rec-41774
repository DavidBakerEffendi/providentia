Went for lunch when Gueros was closed, but honestly Chavela's would've been the first choice if I'd ever been here before. The lunch special is 6.95 and is plentiful and delicious. I got a chicken mole tostado and a avocado taco. My friend got fried eggs with potatoes and toast. I got a michelada on the side too and it was one of the best I'd have in a while. The inside of the place is beautiful too. Want to go back for brunch, dinner, whatever.
