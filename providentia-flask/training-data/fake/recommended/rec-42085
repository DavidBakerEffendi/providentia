One of the best deals in Brooklyn. I've tried probably half the menu and I've enjoyed everything. Wonderful roast pork, wonderful chicken. Love the black beans. And $1 empanadas with $3 beers before 7PM? It's the best happy hour in New York City. Seriously, those empanadas. Easy place to have a great dinner for 2 and keep it under $30.
