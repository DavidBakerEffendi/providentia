LOVE LOVE this place!  The outdoor concept is just amazing especially with those heat lamps.  Went for the first time the last weekend in November and I took off my jacket because I was toasty :) On to the beer- three in and let's just say I was feeling it.  Black Bavarian (2), and a can beginning with N haha.  Bartender was great let me sample two beers- very attentive.  Food came out extremely fast.  Had the Spricy Braut and purple cabbage, my date had potato pancakes.  Would love to try those with the smoked salmon on top.  Didn't try the ping pong but loved that their are two bars and three access points.  Pretty crowded but able to sit both outside and at the bar. Will DEF be back SOON!
