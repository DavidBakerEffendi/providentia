Sometimes all I want to do is don my cool graphic tee and ripped up skinny jeans and drink some beer in a back yard.  Frankford Hall is the perfect place for that.   I love that the food is ordered at a window and same with the beer (or at the main bar inside).  Food comes out quick and man, the brats and frank furters were really good.  I'm also a fan of their german potato salad.  There is also a pretzel girl walking around selling jumbo hot pretzels for about $8.50 a pop.  It's worth it, especially if you need something to soak up all the german beer in your belly. I went there on Saturday a bit skeptical... but after hours of tumbling tours (generic version of Jenga) and playing drinking card games (Burro and A$$hole), I felt like I was in college again!  We were having so much fun, that a neighboring table asked us how we were having so much fun.  There is a table next to the hostess desk where there are UNO cards, playing cards, jenga and other games.  They also have two ping pong tables (which I assume would turn into beer pong/beirut if the beers weren't so delish). I sucked down a few big mugs of the "Rattler"- which is fizzy lemonade and beer.  Sounds weird, but it was awesome, and very freshing for a humid evening. It got very busy around 11pm, so people were standing around waiting on the big tables to open up.  Once we got up around 12:30, the vultures took over our table immediately. :) If we had noticed them earlier, we would've asked them to join our riveting game of A$$hole. Loved it and can't wait to go back.  What will they do in the winter when it's freezing outside?
