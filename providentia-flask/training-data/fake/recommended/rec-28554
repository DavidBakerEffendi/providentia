FOOD / DRINKS: Wow...why didn't I find this place sooner! Hu Kitchen is a great place to eat whether you are paleo or not; but for those who are looking for meals made from grass-fed beef, etc., look no more. Though there is no beer served here, but they have good coffee. This is a kitchen, plus a market so you can eat here and/or buy a pound of meatloaf to take with you. Other food fare includes kale chips, rotisserie chicken, roasted veggies, you name it. They have some borderline non-paleo items as well, like quinoa and chocolate....but paleo isn't their claim....but it sure is close. Love this place! It's also nice because you get to try these awesome recipes made by professionals so you know how good they should taste when you make them at home. SERVICE: Good service....no issues. UTILITIES: Comfortable dining atmosphere too. Sit upstairs, enjoy the AC, and crazy delicious fuel...er, I mean food. The bathroom is clean, but right across from the cash register. A little too 'public' :-(. Â I did not see a plugin to charge a phone.
