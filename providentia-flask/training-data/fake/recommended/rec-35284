I've been here for lunch plenty of times in the past few months.  The food is fine, nothing really special, except maybe the fries.   Nothing has been rather memorable, the chicken pot pie was a salty disappointment and the chicken meatballs were rather lame.   I like that the place has a nice interior and is close to my office, and a decent veggie burger.
