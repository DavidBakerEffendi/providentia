I love this place for a first date.  The food is okay, and can get a little eperimental at time (one date called it fear factor).  But, you find out very quickly what kind of person you are with.  I find the more experimental an eater the more fun they are behind closed doors.  So, while this place doesn't thrill with the food, the ambiance (downtown tokyo), decor, and sake make up for it.  The sake list can be daunting, but a great selection.
