public 5 year anniversary party last night: flowing rose champagne, signature cocktails, appetizers, food celebrities and other handsome folk. so much more fun than the furgus henderson event at the spotted pig for overpriced chinese food. gasp! omg! pigs ears and trotters and head! give me 100 dollars worth!
