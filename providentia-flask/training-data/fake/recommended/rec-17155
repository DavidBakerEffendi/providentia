It seems a lot of the reviews for this place are from people who haven't had Peruvian cuisine before but it seemed worth a go so we gave it a try.  This place surely has it's positives and negatives but overall it's a decent option if you're in the mood for some Peruvian food.  Below is my brief pros/cons. Pros: * The quality of the ingredients seemed very good.  Tender meat, fresh veggies, etc. * The sauce for the lomo saltado was excellent (albeit peppery but I like lots of pepper). * Very friendly staff * They have grassfed beef BUT it's limited to their Paleo menu which seems ridiculous if you just want grassfed beef but don't want to eat a Paleo diet. Cons: * Fairly pricey for Peruvian food.  Lomo saltado was $14 and that's pretty much mainly a plate of french fries and rice with a small amount of meat.  Some reviews say that the portions however the lomo saltado was average to undersized compared to other restaurants. * Their Aji Verde is pretty lacking in flavor.  I think it needs some mayo or salt or something.  That's too bad too because I love aji verde made right. * I didn't see any Aguadito de Pollo on the menu. * I feel like they are catering to a non-Latin American crowd with things like a Paleo diet menu and a Taste of Lima etc.  Not sure how happy I was about that. * They up sell a bit too hard.  We were only having lunch and they were trying to up sell us to fairly expensive and large dishes, dessert, coffee, etc. I'm used to getting lomo saltado for around $10 and that's with a side soup and a basket of bread.  With that said, I'd go back unless I can find a more reasonably priced Peruvian restaurant in the area with similar quality and a bit less Americanized.  The hunt will continue....
