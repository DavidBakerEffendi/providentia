Wow. Worst management I've ever encountered. Ignorant and unwilling to accommodate.  The manager did not comply with a promotion that was advertised and actually had the audacity to argue about it.   The server, Cat, was IMPECCABLE. She was Extremely attentive, polite, friendly, and captivating. Food was ok. Cajun calamari had good texture but the flavors didn't compliment each other. Crab stuffed shrimp was fishy and had bland rice. The scallop and shrimp jamboree was lacking flavor but was overly salty. The chicken florentine was very dry. The yoohoo tini did not taste like yoohoo. If the management hadn't been so appalling, I'd at least go back for the wonderful service. But never again.
