Robataya is kind of awesome. The food is exceptional... despite the small portions. Favorite dishes are the rice pot with salmon and salmon roe, enoki mushrooms with soy sauce, broiled edamame, cod, and the kobe beef sirloin special. The desserts serves as a great palate cleanser after a long session of pigging out. I recommend the green tea ice cream with red bean paste topping (optional but totally worth it). While Oh! Taisho, Kenka, and Village Yokocho are more bang for your buck, the quality of food that Robataya offers is like I said... pretty awesome. Another plus - yakitori-type places leaves a grilling smell to your clothes. Robataya does not!
