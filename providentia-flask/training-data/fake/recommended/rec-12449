Neat atmosphere. A hidden gem of the city. If you're in the mood for British food, this is a great pick. The fish and chips are amazing. I've visited the UK a couple times and this beats most of your standard British fish and chips you'd get in England. It can get rather loud, but it's a pub style place. Service was decent, but a little slow. However, the ambiance is very unique. I'd recommend coming here with a group as opposed to a date.
