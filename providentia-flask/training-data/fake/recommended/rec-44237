116 Crown is what I wish my life was: hip and mysterious with a great playlist. My very favorite place in CT. The cocktails are outrageous(ly priced) & delicious, the ambience is perfect for a date, and food is just as tasty as the drinks. Sad that recently some of my favorite food items disappeared (as did those awesome candle centerpieces), but DON'T WORRY, the truffle fries are still there. Forth & Clyde and the Glitterati are my favorites. Dress well and try not to stare at the drop dead gorgeous staff.
