Stopped in for lunch one afternoon to meet up with a friend. We ordered the mozzarella pie which wasn't too cheesy or too saucy - I liked it. I'm not sure if the crust was a garlic crust but it was so good. Kind of weird but I think I likes the crust the most!! Overall, I wouldn't say it was the best pizza I've ever had in my life but a good option in West Hartford. Their menu had a lot of variety and I'm sure you can make your own too. The restaurant itself is pretty big and very clean - loved the tables.
