I recently moved to LIC and have been scoping out the local restaurants, of which there is no shortage of in LIC. This place is really good. It's a small, cute place. I went on a Friday night around 8 and was immediately seated with no reservation. They have an excellent wine list. I ordered their prawns for apps and their lamb chops. It was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious! The service was also on point. Overall, great place for a low key dinner. The only reason I gave it only 4 stars was because it's a pretty pricey place. My friend and I ordered a glass of wine each, two apps, and two entrees and it came out to $160!!
