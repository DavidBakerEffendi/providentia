OH MY GAWDDD... I've died and gone to heaven. How can a simple $6 buy you such happiness?? How can some chicken and rice be soooo good?! And all from a street cart?!! Yes it is true... 53rd&6th's Halal Guys must be descendants of Allah! No, I was not drunk; I was sober. No, I was not starving or remotely hungry; I actually had just ate a few hours ago. And yet there I was... stuffing my mouth and wishing I had gone back for seconds. I don't know if its the (cheesy?) rice or the perfectly cooked shredded chicken or the orgasmic white sauce... but it was like heaven on earth! I'm glad I made it a point to stop here on my trip to NY... I will now forever dream of it in my sleep, in my states of hunger, and just 24/7. As noted previously, BEWARE the RED [HOT] SAUCE - just a drop will go a loooooooong way. But do drown yourself in the white sauce (: PROTIP! There are now, as of 07/03/2012... **THREE CARTS** all situated in the area of 53rd&6th, serving up the same Halal Guys Chicken&Rice. When I went, there was one cart with a line of at least 25-35 people deep. The other two carts had maybe 5-10 people... and it was confirmed by the 25-35 ppl cart-workers that the other carts were in fact serving up the exact same food - wooo! So skip the line if you can... or at least try to disperse and save the guys from dying under your anticipation and unwanted drool.
