You aren't a really NYer or you haven't visited NY unless you've eaten at Pommes Frites. Pommes Frites is a NYC legend. I first discovered it on a food tour of the E. Village. This authentic Belgian style fries with sauces that will impress your foodie friend. Like Fig, Bordeux wine and Sage. Or Pesto Mayo. Or Pomegranate Teriyaki. Do not order a regular size fries alone. If you do not have friends you will make friends if you share your Pommes Frites. A regular size fry is sharing size. Sharing size is to be eaten with 3 or more people. It is too much grease and fat for one being to handle unless you are an alien. Then proceed. Do not come here expecting a seat or short lines. Prepare to go sit elsewhere. There only two seating booths. You're welcome.
