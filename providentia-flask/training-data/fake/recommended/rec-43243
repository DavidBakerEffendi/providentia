I must admit that I have been very spoiled in my burrito experiences to date. What passed for a "Cosmic Cantina" in the E.Vill. (now closed) was nothing compared to the Cosmic in my college town of Chapel Hill, NC. I must've eaten at my Cosmic every other week for 6 years. Upon moving here, I had to find something that would match up. Dos Toros is AMAZING. Not only is it close to my apartment (and Trader Joes... so I can do my shopping and then grab dinner on the way home), but it's totally delicious and affordable too. I've only had their burrito so far, but the guac and the quesadilla are next on my list.
