I love ilili.   I love ilili for birthday dinners, casual dinners, dinners with coworkers, just-in-town friends, dates.   I love ilili for its hot and old mezzes, which are enough to fill you up without having to order entrees. I love ilili for life-changing BRUSSELS SPROUTS, delicious WARM EGGPLANT, and DUCK SHAWARMA. I love ilili for its cocktail menu; namely, the Fresh Meadow and Beirut with Passion. I love ilili for its sweet cheese tart dessert, which I never would it have ordered if it wasn't for Christine T.   It's not perfect, but that's not what love is about.  Also, its a palindrome, and super fun to say.
