I'm not sure how tea quality and selection could get much better.  This is exactly what I was looking for in a good tea place.  Cha-An has a very good selection of a variety of different teas.  It's easy to stay for hours when they refill your tea pot.  The environment is friendly but small so you may have to wait for a spot.  Great find!
