I love Ants Pants. The Food is AMAZING - the Bacon Stack (add Avocado to create a near religious experience) changed my Life. All of their Food is to Die for, and they have some of the most innovative specials to come out of any cafe in the City. Their Coffee Rocks. But they have one up on any other coffee purveyor in the City - The Australian Coffee. This consists of an Iced Coffee made with Vanilla Ice Cream instead of Ice & Espresso or Chocolate - but being me I combine the two for an extra scrumptious treat. All of this yummitasticness is topped off by the fact that this joint Busts Your Gut without Busting Your Wallet. A Bagel with Cream Cheese and Nova Lox is $3 ($9 anywhere else). I would call it Intimate as opposed to small, and it is best to take the attitude of Love Thy Neighbor, as you will be sitting very close to them! As with any place, there are better times to stop by and if you go during the meal rush, you will wait. If course, you can always do Take-Out (yet Another bonus). The Outdoor seating in the back is refreshing and partially shaded, which is nice especially in the heat of Â the summer. As long as it isn't during the rush, they don't mind people stealin their internets while sipping on coffee. The staff is incredibly sweet, and keep me coming with their friendly attitude. This is a place that values its neighborhood & its community, and hat helps elevate both through its charm & goodwill. Final Thoughts: Yummy, Cheap, and Friendly!
