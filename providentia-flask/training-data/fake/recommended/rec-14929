This is the kind of place the neighborhood has been lacking: It's clean, efficient layout mean that even long weekend brunch lines don't interfere with diners, while the pre-order/ pre-pay system allows your food to be prepared even if you've yet to find a first come, first served seat. I guess theres always the risk that the food will be done before the people currently eating at the tables are, but in my experience thats never been the case. The menu is a combination of reasonably priced staples, with inventive brunch and daily specials that rotate. This is one of the last bastions of the truly bottomless cup of coffee. The service is excellent (thanks Jess and Kirin!), the food is always great, and the complimentary (through somewhat unreliable) wi-fi makes this a great place to sit with a client or just get work done. In short: Great food, great service, great coffee, great music. What else do you need?
