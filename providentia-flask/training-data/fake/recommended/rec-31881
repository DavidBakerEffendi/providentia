Sunny and Annie's is simply the benchmark for a NYC corner deli. It's small. It's quaint. It's a bit claustrophobic. Buy hey - the make THE BEST sandwiches I've ever eaten in my life. Now I love sandwiches. More frequently than not, I'm craving a nosh-worthy sandwich. And when those cravings come, I head straight for Sunny and Annie's. Generally I stick to one of the following three: 1. The Louis - incredible and heartwarming. This is the perfect for hangovers or a cold day. 2. Kimchi Bulgogi - just incredible. Like the kimchi is delicious and the roast beef is delicious. Everything is delicious. 3. Pho #1. Wow - this is unique. But, clearly, it's delicious. Like a bowl of Pho between two pieces of bread. Honestly, if you live in the East Village go to Sunny and Annies. It's probably impossible to find anywhere more...delicious.
