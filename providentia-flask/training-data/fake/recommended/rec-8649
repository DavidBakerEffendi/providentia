I'm going to review this restaurant I went to last night regarding four areas: parking, decor, service and the food itself. The parking:  on street (I thought) and we did get a spot but I can see where this might be hit or miss. However, walking to the restaurant I noticed that they DID have a small private lot by the restaurant (which was full).  As this was my first time going there, I missed the parking lot, which was just as well (see above). The decor:  Outrageous.  Actually 5 stars for this......colorful, happy?, bright, well done.  Really pretty Mexican tiled restaurant....well designed.  Colorful dishes...just makes you happy to be there.  I would like to post some photos since words can do this place justice. The service:  This is a bit tricky.  It was quite crowded when we first got there but by evening's end, the place had emptied out and we got quite a bit more attention from our waitress.  I noticed most of the staff is very young (not a bad thing).  However, our waitress did forget to ask us for refills on our drinks so minus a star there.  She was very very good by evening's end when dessert time rolled about.  Very attentive.   The star of the show:  the food.......generous portions.  As you would expect, Mexican of all kinds, all ways prepared.  I went for a burrito (made with veggies).  I also had yellow rice and refried beans.  My burrito was huge with red sauce on it. I really loved the tortilla part.  There were all kinds of veggies in my burrito ranging from brocoli, cauliflower, carrots, green beans...actually you name it, veggie-wise and it was most likely there......The veggies were a bit crisp.  It was decent.  A decent meal. Dessert:  Flan with whipped cream.  Delicious!!!  5 stars for this!! Would I go back?  Yes, I would.  I did very much like this place.
