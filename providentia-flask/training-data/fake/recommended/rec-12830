One of my best friends recommended this restaurant to my boyfriend & I about a month ago but sadly, I was sick for a while and didn't start feeling better til two weeks ago, so we finally gave it a try today. The restaurant is somewhat small but I did feel warm and welcomed upon entrance to the restaurant. It's spacious, warm, and has a very modern Asian vibe and look to it. Even the bathroom is very nice! The service was top-notch, my boyfriend & my dish was quite big so since the table next to us was empty, our waitress helped push the table closer to us so we have a little room for our dishes and food,how nice of them! For appetizer, we got a BBQ Squid - a rather simple dish but overall, pretty good and tasty. Lunch, My boyfriend got a Chicken Noodle Bowl and it was a pretty big  bowl of noodle soup with eggplant, udon noodles, chicken and other vegetables, very tasty and light! I loved it. I got a Salmon Teriyaki Combo box, it came with an assortment of food and it was very good, that I finished almost the whole darn thing.  Gosh I'm a pig. I am totally coming back here! Top-Notch Babyyy!
