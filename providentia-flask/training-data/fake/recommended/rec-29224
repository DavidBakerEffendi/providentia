Best cheesesteak in Philly, coming from a local. Puts Geno's, Pat's, Tony Luke's, Jim's to shame. Dalessandro's is always so tender and I love that they chop it so fine, that even a baby could eat it. Get WIZ on it, makes it a million times better. You have to pay cash, and they're always made on the spot. Call ahead to get your order in and when you get there, they put you to the front of the order. Just writing this review, I'm craving one. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.
