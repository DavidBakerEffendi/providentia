A go to favorite for standard diner fare.  Convenient and consistent.  I highly recommend the Tomahawk breakfast skillet over french fries.  However, I will not be going back anytime soon.  New server has turned me off, beyond incompetent.  She is clumsy, rude, and common sense eludes her.  She is a triple threat to ruining a meal.
