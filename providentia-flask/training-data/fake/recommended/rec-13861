After attempting to eat here short of a dozen times, I finally made it in today.  Thanks to Lauren's bright idea about going there at 8:30 am for brunch - which to me defies brunch since it's too early.  Let's call it breakfast for now.   Before I get started - let me digress a bit.  Don't you just hate it when something is so hyped and you make the mistake of building your expectation so high and then you experience it first hand and then you just say "eh".  So, I'm torn about why I am not raving about this place as much as I should.  I liked my dish (spanish omlette), let me make that clear firsthand.  Could it be that for the almost half a dozen times I attempted to eat here the line was ridiculously long and walked away?  Did I build the hype too high in my head?  Am I just frustrated about my many failed attempts???   So, I decided not to give a bad review but to make this fair I will go back again soon.  I should have tried their popular blueberry pancake, maybe I would feel differently.   After that, I'll have to edit my review if it lives up to its reputation. Oh.. I hated the fact that they sat us, a part of 3, at a table for 2.  I guess that's what happens when the line is out the door by 8:30 am.
