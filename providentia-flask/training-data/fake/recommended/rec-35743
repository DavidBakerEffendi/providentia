If you're in the mood for a good beer this is a good place to go. They usually have a great draught selection and extensive bottle selection. The only thing that displeases me after living in Philadelphia longer is that this place is definitely way more pretentious in terms of good pubs. Occasionally, Â a couple bartenders will neglect some customers they don't know or act like hot shot beer snobs. The food is decent when compared to Johnny Brenda's, Good Dog, or Green Rock. One qualm that I really have is that they pride themselves on all their beer selection, but have High Life to cater to this "High Life is the new PBR" hipster crowd, but no Yuengling. If they want to be consistent with their standards they should stop their High Life supply and replace it with Pennsylvania's own, and oldest local brewery, Yuengling. Also, I'm disappointed that they have a surplus of Port Brewing beers but no Stone a vast majority of the time, which I think is superior in more ways than one.
