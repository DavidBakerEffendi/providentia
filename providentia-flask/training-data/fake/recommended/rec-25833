Nice spot, but the best part of it is the lounge area off to the left.  The only problem is of the 4 times I've gone, I could only get seated up there once (and that was the one time I didn't have reservations and specifically request a seating spot there).  Other areas, you're just on a hard wooden stool and it loses a lot of the charm.  Really good olives and at $3, those are a real bargain!
