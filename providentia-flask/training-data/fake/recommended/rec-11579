This is a seriously good burger. I sank my teeth into the perfectly plump bun and tasted euphoria. I had the truffle burger medium, and the meat itself was extremely impressive- perfectly tender and juicy but still a little charred around the edges. Coupled with the buttery soft bun and gooey truffle cheese, it was a home run. I will say that it tasted quite salty, but I did catch mouthfuls of "umami" and wow that was truly noteworthy. Kudos on the portion too! Not too big or small, just enough to fill and more than satisfy me. We also got the thin fries manly-style, with fried onions and bacon and cheese. It was yummy, but next time I will just get plain fries because either way they come with AMAZING DIPS- roasted garlic aioli (i could live on this), diavolo, and jalapeno ranch. ALSO their ketchup was delicious, there was a tangy sweetness to it that paired well with fries as well as burger. I will be back again to try the rest of the menu! I arrived at 6:30 and we had a 25-min wait for 2 people. As we waited the sidewalk got more and more crowded, so definitely come earlier than later, and select just one lucky companion to ensure minimum wait time (or alone, for that matter!).
