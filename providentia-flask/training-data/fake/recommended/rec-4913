I've lunched here many times & have always enjoyed my meal.    The lamb burger is delicious & I love that you get a choice of either fries or salad.  I always opt for the salad and it comes with dark green lettuce; not the dreaded ice burg lettuce.  The veggie burger is homemade & moist.   There is an appetizer platter that has hummus & veggies on it that is great to share with friends.   The burgers are enormous & very juicy.    I dine with a few vegetarians and they enjoy the gruyere panini.   If you are a beer fan you will definitely like this place since there are so many interesting beers on tap.  Give this place a try - I really like it!
