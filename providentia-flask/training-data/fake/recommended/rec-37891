I was in Philly for a wedding last weekend and had the good luck to stop in at Zavino for lunch one day--total treat! We snagged a seat at the bar and were entertained (and warmed) by the action at the wood-fired oven. The winter caprese salad was a great start, with melt-in-your-mouth burrata instead of the more standard fresh mozzarella. Sopressata was served with a trio of garnishes, and most importantly some of their killer flatbread. I could've eaten nothing but that flatbread all afternoon. Until the pizza...That was the highlight. At the recommendation of the bartender, we ordered the "stache"-- a pesto pizza topped with citrusy arugula, on the best whole wheat pizza crust I've ever had. It was the best of pizza and salad brought together as one. I'd be back often if I lived here.
