I always get the same thing. Falafel platter with baba g and eggplant, fries and hummus. You get so much food for around $10. I am truly stuffed when I am done and it tastes great. One of the best falafel platters around for your money. BUT. You do have to inspect your platter because they will forget something. This past sunday night, picked up my girlfriend from work and she went in and picked it up and didnt bother checking it and they forgot the eggplant and 2 sauces. Not a huge deal, but still, its a pain, because as your leaving the cash register you then have to find a table, sit down, open up the bag of food, figure out if theres anything missing, the food is hot, so  your usually using  your dirty hands, then getting hot food on  your hands, then you have to close up the food again. And its not just the falafel platter they miss stuff on, my girlfriend gets other items and they forget to include stuff as well. Oh well, its close enough I guess.
