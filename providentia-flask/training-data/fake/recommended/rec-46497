Delicious. The food was fantastic and the dessert was even better. Pecan pie bread pudding...get in my belly! Casual ambiance, very rustic interiors, dark and romantic. One of the better meals I've had in a while. Cocktail menu was disappointingly lacking, but the beer I had was good (though not tap).
