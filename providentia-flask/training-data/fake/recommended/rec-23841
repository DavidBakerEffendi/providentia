Amazingly good food! I've hosted a Diwali party here for the past two years in the upstairs party space and everything has been perfect each time. The food is outstanding and I've had many friends who have never tried or cared for Indian food love it after coming to the party. Also, the entire staff and the owner are wonderful: very responsive and they really go out of their way with every detail. I couldnt more highly recommend it for dinner or a party. Tip: buffet is amazing!
