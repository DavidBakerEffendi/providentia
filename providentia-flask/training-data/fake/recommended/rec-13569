As many of my restaurant reviews begin, I came to Locande Verde because of the decor. In fact, my clients had dined there the week before and wanted the light fixtures over their dining table, so I came to check out the design and obviously stayed for the food. I must say, my expectations were very high, and usually when that happens, they aren't met. Which was the unfortunate case at Locande Verde. Although to be fair, we didn't order too much. We split a couple dishes.. the pumpkin agnolotti - which was very nice, definitely the best part. A perfect combination of sweet pumpkin paired with savory creme sauce. The brussel sprouts were decent, not the best I've had (see Alta review) but decent. I thought the pancetta and pecorino overwhelmed them but then again I am a purist. The duck crostini was NOT what I was expecting. It was said to be paired with a sweet sauce, which sold me, but this was basically duck SPAM. I guess I read the description wrong?! Â Lastly we had the scallops - they were over an apple and shallot mostarda, which was a nice pairing - but overall rather anti-climatic. The best part was the hazelnut and brown butter gelati. So, so rich and not overwhelming sweet. Wow. Still thinking about them. I guess I'd return but I was not wowed. Maybe I'll just wait to eat Carmellini's fare when it comes to The Garden. ha. If only I liked sporting events.
