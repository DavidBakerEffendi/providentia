Passed this place numerous times but never gave it a second thought since it looked like a typical diner. But today, after a relaxing massage at the spa next door that left us famished, and being too lazy to wander through the area to search for a good brunch place, we decided to just come in here and see what they got. We came in and were seated right away. We were served right away and almost got our food right away as well. I didn't even know the place is Cuban. The bar/counter had that antique-y look and there were these antique fans on the wall that gave the place kind of 1950s vibe...like Havana right now, I guess. My mom and sister had the Huevos Pericos, which she devoured. And I had the Dos Huevos with sausage. Everything hit the spot. I'd definitely come back to try the other food on their menu. And try their Mexican Hot Chocolate.
