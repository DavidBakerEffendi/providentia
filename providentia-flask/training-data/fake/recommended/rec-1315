For my 800th review (wow, I really have too much time on my hands) let me review a spot near my work that has some of the best wings I have had in a while! I ordered their Persian Spiced Chicken Wings and it came with a creamy dipping sauce that went perfectly. The wings were crispy and a nice size and full of flavor that you almost didn't need the sauce. I am a sauce fiend tho and I like all things dipping so I gobbled that up as well. My friend had the chopped salad, which he did not enjoy, but for wings, this is the place to be! Cute ambiance too, definitely casual date night worthy and friendly service. Definitely recommend!
