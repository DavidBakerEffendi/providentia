Where does one take a Chinese girl from California for her first NY restaurant experience? Apparently Joe's Shanghai for some famous soup dumplings!! My friend and I went to Joe's Shanghai right before the lunch rush, so we didn't have to wait at all. Ordered an order of the pork XLB/soup dumpling and an order of Shanghai Fried Noodles (so we could save our tummies for other delicious NY eats). And we still had leftover noodles! The service was decent for a Chinese restaurant, nothing to complain about. The soup dumplings were sooo good! Pretty big, really juicy, and so delicious! The noodles were pretty good too! We ended up recommending that dish to two other parties sitting near us, who also really liked it. Good thing we read the tips before going to Joe's, because if you read the receipt, it tells you that the restaurant automatically adds 15% gratuity Â (regardless of the number of people in your party), so make sure not to tip them double!! Our total for the 1 order of soup dumplings and 1 order of noodles came out to be $18, which was pretty cheap. But seeing the prices for the other dishes, they can get kind of pricey. I think I would just come and focus on the soup dumplings!
