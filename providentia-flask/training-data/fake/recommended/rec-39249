One of my favorite Indian restaurants! Absolutely love their Channa Masala and Aloo Gobhi! The naan is always great and the bread basket is delicious and interesting. They have awesome samosas. I've also been here for their lunch buffet which is great too and has many vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian options. It's one of the few Indian places I've walked into that I've seen all the tables taken so they must be doing something right!
