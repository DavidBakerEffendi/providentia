The salmon wrapped poached eggs were eggcellent! I wanted eggs for breakfast, but having been steered down a dark and hazy path by previous breakfasts with their tough omelettes and dry scrambled eggs, I needed to stage an intervention. Ah. Go with the poached egg. The smoked salmon was flavorful, and when paired with a combination of 3 things: the poached eggs (yolks running every which way on your plate), black bread (exotic to behold), and green goddess dressing (if only I knew how to make it!), my breakfast at Penelope came alive. Lordy was it good. A friend had the farmer's market omelette with swiss cheese, mushrooms, and sausage, which came with a side of french fries. She seemed content with the omelette, but her attention was drawn towards the fries, which she said she really enjoyed. My other friend had the FBLT, the fakin' bacon sandwich, a thick center of avocado, tomato, and lettuce between two pieces of toasted sourdough bread spread with a mayo sauce. This too came with fries. I can't say too much about either of my friend's entrees as I was obviously way too occupied with my own. We toasted to each other with our rose mimosas, part of our prix fixe brunch order ($14.50! My wallet thanks me!), and indeedy left very content.
