Came last night, brought a great box of Chardonnay around the corner and brought it to this BYOB cute as a can be french seafood restaurant. I ordered the whole fish Dorado, and it was grilled , meaty and perfect. I loved it! My girl got the scallops and they were humongous. The olive oil they brought out with the bread was delicious too. Everything was sooo good!
