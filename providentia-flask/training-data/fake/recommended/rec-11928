Floors covered in film and filth. A sort of localized fetor. A sign on the bathroom door that says it's out of service. Tables covered in bits of food, more film. Dust all over the floors. Someone called and the lady near the counter yelling, 'no no! we're closed. we're closing. [pause]. no! we don't have any more soup'. Bottles of what seemed like diluted sriracha, old bits caked around the top. We waited about 20 minutes for our order. Sat at a small table near the front, then switched to a larger one after some people left. A few other sets of people came in and more shouting at them, 'closed closed'. The food smelled funky, some of it was hot some wasn't. About all that could be said of was that it's cheap. One of the ladies to my right swept the floor, flinging bits of dust towards our feet. They overturned the chairs and set them on the tops of the tables after spraying them down with 409. We stood outside for a minute and those near the back took out a floor broom and put it in the cooking surfaces, which were filled with a green liquid, then scrubbed the back metal surfaces with it. Buckets of hot water and thrown onto those same metal surfaces.
