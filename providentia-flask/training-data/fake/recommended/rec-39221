I just have to say that the people who work here are extremely nice! I had a few questions about the menu because lately I haven't been having a good time finding Chinese restaurants in the CT area. I was pleased to know that they have many vegetarian options and they also have scallion pancakes! I ordered the pancakes and a few spring rolls and they were nice enough to throw in a couple extra rolls and duck sauce (which was super yummy!) I will definitely be visiting again and updating my review.
