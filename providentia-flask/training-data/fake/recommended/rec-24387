Alright, alright. Everyone just raaaves about this place.. Everyone except the vegetarians and pork haters/dislikers (yes, there are such people living on this planet! ). I am one of them. I don't eat pork, and everything here is about pork pork pork. They should probably just name it iporkydo. There isn't much of a variety for non-pork/meat eaters. Only one veg. Ramen and it does not taste good. I repeat. It does not taste good. The soup is way too salty, or as my friend put it - it's just soy sauce. They have a lunch special which includes a side small salad and bowl of rice with chicken, seafood (I forget which fish) and duuuuh MORE pork. (This place is a pork lovers heaven.) the rice bowl is pretty small but it's tastes pretty good. (Or maybe I say that only because my ramen was just blehck!) It's just a bit dry so I mixed in some of the soup from my veg. ramen. Aaaand that was prob the only thing I liked from ippudo, sadly. :( But the staff was very nice and attentive. The place was also nice and welcoming, decor wise. It's just not a non-pork eaters place. My friends who do eat pork, however, did rave about their ramens, and the buns which they got as appetizers.
