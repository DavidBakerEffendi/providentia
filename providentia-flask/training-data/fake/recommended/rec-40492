Ok, honestly I'm torn between 4 and 5 stars. We came on a Sunday around noon and even though the place was packed were able to get a table right away. I had empanadas (of course) delicious, and I loved that they have both corn and wheat. I also enjoyed the butternut squash soup and my husband fell in love with the ox-tail soup. I think he would have married it if we weren't already. It reminded him of home and the broth had just the right flavor he said. While the food was good it was a bit cramped, like I could have eaten something off of the plate of the lady sitting next to me. But this is nothing new in New York. Good latin food, nice variety, quick service, a solid four stars.
