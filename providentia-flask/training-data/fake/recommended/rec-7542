Went there for the Thanksgiving Buffet with my young family.  Great pork roast and vegetables.  Meat was tough.  Traditional Thanksgiving fixings were pretty good. The sweet potoatoes had an orange flavor that totally overpowered the great natural taste of sweet potatoes.  Staff was very friendly and despite the crowds, they made us feel at home; booths provided a lot of privacy. Desserts and coffee were fantastic.  Thanks.
