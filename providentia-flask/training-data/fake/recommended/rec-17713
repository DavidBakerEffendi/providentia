I've been to this bar many times, it has a decent menu. Of the the few items I had all were good. The tacos are real good. If your going to eat here I recommend luch or early dinner as this place turnes into a sausage fest  from after work hours till closing. This is a typical Newark hoochie bar. Theirs about 20 female bar tenders,  all trying to weasel shots out of you at 10$ a pop. Most a fairly pretty ( actually meet my GF here)...lol. you can blow through cash at this place if your not careful.   All that being said overall if your a guy and into loud Spanish music, (which i'm not ) lol, and like Spanish girls ( which i do)..then this is your hangout.  I'm usually the only gringo in the place, very few speak English and it's mainly all Ecuadorian guys that hang here. It's not a place to bring your girl and chill.
