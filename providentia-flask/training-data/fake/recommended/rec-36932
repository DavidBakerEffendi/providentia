Tiger's Tale gets 5 stars if you know what to order, but if you come in clueless it's probably more of a 3-4 star place. Rack of lamb is AMAZING--it's only served once a week, I think on Monday's. If you eat meat/lamb it's a MUST try--& at under $20 (TT is a casual joint) it's a steal. The cheddar burger is my other favorite & a Tiger's Tale classic. Actually anything drenched in their flavorful, sharp cheddar sauce is quite tasty. I can't speak to anything else because the only other item I've had is the beer (though their black & tans are good!) My mom & I frequently go here on my visits home, & if you can get a fitness/health nut (her, not me :) to eat rack of lamb & cheddar burgers, they have to be good!
