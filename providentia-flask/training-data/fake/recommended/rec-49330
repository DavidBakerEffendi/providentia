Good food and beer, exactly what I look for in a pizza place.  It took awhile to get seated on a Friday night, but that just gave us an opportunity to survey the excellent beer menu.  Both the pale ales were quite good.  Sitting outside at sunset was a big perk, and the flatbread was delicious and reasonably priced.  A great way to start my visit in VT!
