Room Service is very similar in concept and decor to Qi Thai but less of a tourist trap since it is a bit too west from Times Square for tourists to find or walk to after an exhausting day with life sized superheroes and the infamous naked cowgirl. The crowd is surprisingly very eclectic, representative of the neighborhood in Manhattan it is in. With that said, Room Service is a decent spot to go to when you want to impress a group of non-NY'ers with a fairly priced Thai restaurant with nice decor. You do not have to worry about bringing your friends to a shady looking, grimy feeling Asian restaurant because Room Service does an excellent job at maintaining a certain extravagant and luxurious feel for its patrons. Most of their waiters and waitresses are not from the US, or have recently moved from Asia, so their English is a bit out of wack and can be irritating, but I try to be as patient as I possibly can. Their service isn't at all horrible but during peak hours, the waiters can be overwhelmed and may forget about your table for a split second. Their food isn't anything too special or too grand and their prices are reasonable.
