Went there for the private dinner before the opening, the second night they did it. It was excellent on many levels. Very original menu. Very fresh ingredients. The brined chicken was the best chicken I've ever had. It was so juicy and flavorful, I was in heaven. The bread they serve is also memorable favorite. Friendly service, lots of smiles. Well done!
