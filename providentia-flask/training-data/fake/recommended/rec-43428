My brother and I came in for lunch at an odd time of day, around 4 pm.  We were customers number 2 and 3 in the entire restaurant. I realize it was an odd time and will give the staff the benefit of the doubt, but it took almost 10 minutes of us sitting there before our server even gave us menus! However, once we ordered, the food came fairly quickly and our arepas were great.  We had a pork shoulder and a whitefish arepa.  Having never had arepas before, I didn't know whether to order one or two, and while one left me plenty satisfied, for a larger appetite two is a better idea. I like the decor: conscious use of plywood and sheet metal for that down-home shantytown feel. Review is 4 stars for now but I will be trying this place again and could easily give out that fifth star if service was better.
