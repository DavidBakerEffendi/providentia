This is a new-er Pizza joint that is adjacent to the Bruggers bagels on Whitney ave in NH. They make very nice salads (huge) but no home-made dressings. I have never had the pizza before, but several co-workers say it is pretty good. Overall, small family run business, perfect if you are going to jury duty (literally 1 block away) or are in town and want to catch a quick bite. I like this place!
