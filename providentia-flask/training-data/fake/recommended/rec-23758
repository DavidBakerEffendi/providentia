Cantina where the staff is too cool for customer service... Listen I used to go to this place A LOT, but lately the service has completely gone down the drain. Yes the food is really good, but that will never account for how bad the service SUCKS here! This has been the 3rd time Ive have to walk out of this place because its been so bad. One Wednesday night I call to see if theres a wait, guy tells me that he cant tell me that over the phone, but if there is a wait to just have a drink at the bar (what if I was a recovering alcoholic?) I go in anyway. They say its a 15min wait for a party of 2 wait 30 min then ask again when we would be sat, hostess says 30-45min so we leave. Another time Saturday night we get seated right away, but wait 20 min and nobody came over to greet us take our order or even a drink order so we walk out again. I overheard the staff saying that they were swamped and the kitchen was backed up (not the 1st time Ive heard this BS excuse) and the inside wasn't even crowed. Other times Ive been here the service has been hit or miss most of the time has been waiting forever to put an order in or to receive my food. I don't wanna call everybody out here Im sure theres some good staff that work there but most of them are straight up rude and weird. Too busy being cool and messing around than to worry about what their table needs. Its sad that I can count more bad experiences Ive had here than good ones. They need to just clean house and get a whole new staff. Go to the one in NoLibs Ive never had a problem there yet. As for me I will NEVER be back to this god awful location!!
