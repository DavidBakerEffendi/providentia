I had never been to this place because I make my own homemade pasta and usually can't justify going somewhere and spending a lot of money for something I can prepare better at home for a lot less. I went here because some colleagues in town for a conferences wanted to go. I was excited when I saw that they had a pasta wild wild boar on the menu, so I ordered that. There was not very much meat served with the pasta, however, and the sauce was not that great. I can't say I'd really recommend this place.
