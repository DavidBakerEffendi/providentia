Intellectually, I like the 'as availability clause in their menu - if you're late you're SOL. It's not a NYC posh thing it actually harks back to an old world way of eating and buying that is more sustainable and real. They buy the lobsters they think they will need for the day and if they run out - oh well. Â instead of killing lobsters unnecessarily and serving the leftovers the next day - they only kill what they need. That said, the lobster is pretty good but not quite great and for the price and the complete no-frills environment (flea-market seating anyone?) $16 is high. Given the fact that i can have the BEST Latin American Food I've ever had just two booths over and nothing is more than $6 makes the price even more ridiculous. I like the artists-as-fishmongers idea, but this is more Williamsburg than Red Hook (ooooh snap)
