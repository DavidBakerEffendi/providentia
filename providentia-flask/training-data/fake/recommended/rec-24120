I was just here on 3/19/2011 with a large group. We called ahead of time and the owners were very nice and accommodating. They gave us the whole upstairs for a surprise party. And were friendly squeezing past us to bring food and take orders. And he kept checking on us to make sure we had everything we need. I do suggest sharing food since you get a lot. The food is good and they have a lot of variety. I would have probably liked my beef cooked a little longer, but everything is tender. They give you lots of Enjera (bread) to eat it with. It's BYOB so your party can bring their own wine and they will give you glasses. The dessert is great!! I wasn't sure if I wanted a cake (chocolate cake) for the surprise party so I didn't order one, but he made one anyway - and good thing because we decided to get it. It was very tasty. It's a block north on 20th street from 20th and Walnut. Parking is available on the street; and if you go before the club hoppers come out you can probably get a nice spot.
