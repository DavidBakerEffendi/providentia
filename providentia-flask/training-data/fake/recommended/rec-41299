This. Place. Is. Fantastic. Went there for the first time with friends a few weeks ago and was not disappointed--it was even better than I'd heard it was. I had the veggie ramen, which was probably the best soup-based meal I've had in my life. No idea what they put in this broth to make it so delicious, but it's basically life-affirming. (Upon tasting it, one of my dining companions' response was "I want to take a bath in this.") Ordered it with a soft-cooked egg, which made it even better, and piled on plenty of the garlic-and-chili-oil condiment they serve alongside the ramen. Basically, it's all I can do not to go back here every day. I've heard the kale salad is great, but I'm not sure I could bring myself to order anything but ramen.
