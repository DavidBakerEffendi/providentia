I've been to Almond now three times, twice for dinner and once for brunch. All three experiences have been great, and the food is very solid and reasonably priced all things considered. I highly recommend the hanger steak frites, which priced in the low 20s, is a very good value I believe. Service was very friendly and attentive, although one time our waiter misplaced my order (put in strip steak instead of hanger steak). This sort of thing usually gets me very annoyed, but he was very apologetic, friendly, and we got a free round of drinks for the mishap, so wasn't too much of an issue. It's also a great place to grab a few drinks at the bar. For brunch, I highly recommend the duck confit hash, and also (contrary to what I read in a review above), I really do like their coffee.
