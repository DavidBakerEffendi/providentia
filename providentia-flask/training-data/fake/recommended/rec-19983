Food was awesome. My friends and I happened to walk in during happy hour and had the pleasure of enjoying 50 cents wings and $6 GPH Lemonades (lemonade, bourbon, and soda). We also ordered the Rosemary Goat Cheese Salad and Shrimp Caesar Salad. Both were delicious. The only thing we didn't like was the corn. It was a little overdone. But other than that, everything was good.
