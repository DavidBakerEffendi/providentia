Absolutely must try. This place truly is a hidden gem. I've had breakfast all throughout southern CT mostly because my girlfriend is a breakfast fanatic, but "The Pantry" takes the cake. Best pancakes you can find, the coffee is drinkable, and fruit is super fresh. Our experience there is usually pretty good. Â Must visit!!
