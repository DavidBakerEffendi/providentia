Wow, I had such high hopes. The place was well reviewed and the food smelled great. However, when we figured out what we wanted none of it was available. I had to ask three times about one item as was being ignored and then got snapped at for asking. I then got a hot sandwich and they toasted it so long that the bread was rock hard (and I am not exaggerating I literally knocked on it and it sounded like wood). Maybe they just didn't like something about me but the experience was so bad that I actually left angry and I'm a pretty easy going guy.
