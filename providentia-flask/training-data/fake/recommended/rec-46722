You have to know what to order here. The noodle soups ($5) and the freshly made soymilk (doujiang) and soy pudding (douhua) are the best. I'll come just for these. Their weekend dim sum is mediocre but will satisfice if you have a craving. Overall, a friend of mine described it best: Great Wall serves up the kind of authentic Chinese food you would get in a student cafeteria in Beijing. Authentic, yes, but also pretty coarse.
