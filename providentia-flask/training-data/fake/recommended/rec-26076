This place has me conflicted. Some really positive things and some negative ones. The food is seriously great. There were four of us here the other night and all of us loved what we had: the moqueca, the housemade gnocchi, feijoada, choripan sandwich. A bunch of dishes I had never heard of before and the adventurous spirit paid off very well. Love the atmosphere too. It's small but cozy, and the fact that the cook is standing in the corner making everything gives the room a great smell and ambience. However, the entrees were a little too expensive for the amount of food you get. Some of us were still hungry after finishing--which may have been our fault arriving ravenous. I still would recommend the sandwiches as much more reasonable and you get just as much food. Additionally, the service wasn't great. Took us forever to grab someone to order, get the check and pay. It's not like they couldn't see us; it's one little room. Plus they only take cash which I find aggravating. Places with entrees close to $20 shouldn't be cash only. I'm optimistic though. The negatives should be simple enough to fix and they've already got the food figured out right.
