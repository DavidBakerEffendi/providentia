I got reservations here on a Friday night, and I was really impressed with the decor inside. Opposite of the Murray Hill location, the seating is more spacious and intimate. My date was very impressed with the presentation, and I was just happy I had made the reservation, as the entrance was packed with people who didn't have one. The food is absolutely delicious! We shared the Peruvian combo and it was plenty of food to leave us satisfied. For dessert we ordered the tres leches, which was very well done. Nice and moist, packed with plenty of flavor. The only downer was getting over to the west side, but overall it was a great place for a nice date, or for a big party. It seemed like they were singing happy birthday every 5 minutes, but it adds to the excitement of the place. Must go!
