The Farmacy is a great little brunch place. I can eat anywhere anytime but it was nice to take my girlfriend to a place that makes accommodations for gluten allergy's. Their menu didn't list drinks, the waiter mention a little bit of their selection. He said coke, I chose. That. I was then given an old fashioned bottles which impressed me. The steak and eggs were fantastic. It came with potatoes cooked "duck-style" which was amazing. The word crunchy and soft come to mind. Steak which I prefer medium rare was very soft. Eggs were eggs, nicely cooked. My girlfriend's quinoa was cooked very well, however she claims it was too sweet. She prefers a little too sweet. I sampled some, I thought it was very well prepared and tasted great. Food took a while to get to us, but we did have 7 of us on a Sunday. Bathroom felt home like and was retro feeling, Adequately clean. All in all a great experience. Every body was happy, service was little above average, no complaints. Definitely going back soon.
