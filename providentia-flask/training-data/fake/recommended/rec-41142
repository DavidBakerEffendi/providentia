I have had Umami in Cali and at this year's Googamooga. The store definitely disappointed. :( The beef was falling all over the place in clumps as if it wasn't properly binded. It was a little bland in the fact that I could barely taste any of the truffle essence. One of my friends ordered medium and her burger looked rarer than any of our medium rares. The bun wasn't as pillowy as I last remembered it. In fact, they gave everyone a 50% discount on their burgers because their buns weren't up to par today. (This was the first thing our waitress told us. So on the bright side, this made our meal super cheap!) The truffle fries were decent and I especially liked one of the sauces out of the three that an order comes with. The smushed potatoes and fried pickles were, again, a little lackluster. Maybe I would give them another try when they are more established in NYC. Otherwise, our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable, while the greeter attempted to open the door for all the customers.
