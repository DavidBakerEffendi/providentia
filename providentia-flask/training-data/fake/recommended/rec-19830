Great brunch. The portions are large. I ordered the fried pork chops with cheddar waffles. I would definitely order it again. The pork chop was huge and tender. I was a little hesitant about cheddar waffles, but that soon changed. They were melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I would visit again. The only complaint is that it was very crowded and we were seated outdoors in 91 degree temperatures. They should purchase more table umbrellas for extreme temperatures.
