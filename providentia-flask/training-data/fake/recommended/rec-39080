I'm not sure if it was because I had a haze of booze covering my good judgement but I absolutely fell in love with Odeon. My boyfriend and I ended up here after a night out as it was the only thing open past one still serving food in this area. Plus it wasn't pizza. Although very pricey it Â was the best meal we had while in town. We shared the calamari and the tuna burger which were both divine, and then their assortment of handmade ice creams in chocolate, and peanut butter, and a scoop of passion fruit sorbet. Combine that with a couple more cocktails and we were sitting pretty by the end of the meal. Also I should add that our server was the sweetest! The Odeon was the absolute perfect end to a great evening while visiting New York.
