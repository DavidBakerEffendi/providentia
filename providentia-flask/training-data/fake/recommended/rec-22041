Loved this place. It's not the kind of place that serves 1,000 kinds of beer to attract people who will think that's cool and drop cash and buy t-shirts, but rather the kind of place that just loves beer and good times. I really, really liked the atmosphere. Sort of like you're in someone's house. Maybe like a bed and breakfast for drinkers? We had an appetizer...some cheese and I forgot what else. It was good. The food being served to tables around us looked good. The servers were so very nice. We sat around for hours and were never rushed or pressured to order more in exchange for our prime seat. My husband is contemplating a move/job transfer to Philly. I wasn't in favor of it until I visited Eulogy. This could help with the transition from my beloved hometown of Chicago.
