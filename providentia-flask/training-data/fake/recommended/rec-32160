Seemed like a nice place. Then the waitress recommended a strawberry peach sangria pitcher. For $36 we expected it to taste better and have some liquor in it. Watered down & no flavor. We explained this to the waitress. She then ignored us for almost an hour. We couldn't get anymore drinks, food or service. Shitty place, horrible service. My friend noticed the table next to us was also annoyed at the lack of service. We offered to pay for the drinks but not the watery pitcher of no flavor sangria. She said only the manager could deal with this and we waited another 15 minutes. We were hungry and just wanted a good drink.
