Delicious! My husband and I came here to celebrate his birthday. When I initially called to make reservations I was asked if we wanted to do a chef's tasting. They were able to accommodate my no meat, no shellfish requirements. Dinner was phenomenal. We did the wine pairing as well. Everyone from the hostess, to the sommelier and our server were wonderful. We even had copies of our special menu waiting for us to take home. We enjoyed every dish and even ordered an extra salad and dessert after the tasting because they were that delicious! Â Can't wait to return!
