I just ate here last night for dinner, and here are some tidbits you all should know before coming out here: 1. Not everything is 50% like the huge sign outside says it is. Only your basic sushi maki rolls and hand rolls are. If you are a fan of the more expensive specialty rolls, those are 20% off. Everything else on the menu is full price. 2. I have to disagree with Ann B.; this restaurant is NOT Japanese owned. Perhaps I experienced a different staff that night but I had a hard time explaining that I wanted salmon nigiri and that I wanted my maki rolls to be rolled with the seaweed on the outside. I actually had to tell them "Yes, nigiri, I want the fish on the ball of rice". 3. The 50% rolls are a little on the small side. With that said, the sushi is pretty good here and the menu is pretty extensive. The rolls being on the small side is actually pretty forgivable too, because with an average of $3.00~ a roll, you can afford to pick up another one if you're hungry! The sushi here beats out the food Osaka Sushi for sure. Plus, if you have an order over $20, they deliver to your house! I would definitely come back again.
