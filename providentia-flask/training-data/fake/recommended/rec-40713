Have walked by this place several times and several items on the menu sounded good. Stopped by for brunch. I've been looking for a good French toast ever since moving to Queen Village. Other places have been bland, soggy or both. Catahoula's "Brioche French Toast with Banana Rum Compote and Too Much Whipped Cream" did not disappoint. Crispy on the outside but soft inside. The bananas were sauteed but still firm. And as described -- a LOT of whipped cream! Take the time to read the signs both inside and outside the restaurant -- it really gives you an idea of the restaurant's laid-back attitude.
