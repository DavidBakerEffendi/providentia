Delicious pizza! Best grandma's pie in Jersey. CHECK YOUR PIZZA BEFORE YOU ACCEPT DELIVERY. Their delivery guys clearly don't care about your satisfaction. Twice in two weeks I got a pie with cheese on one side of the box. The first time was annoying. The second time is infuriating. I'm more mad at myself for giving the kid $5 before I checked inside the box.
