Everything else on Church Street had a really long wait, but Sweetwaters was able to take us right away (not sure this was really a good sign, but we were hungry). We ordered burgers and steaks, and everyone was satisfied with their meals. The sweet potato fries were delicious. I also enjoyed the cider/beer combinations.
