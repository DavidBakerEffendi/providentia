Went here for lunch with the wife and a few relatives. Food is sort of middling. Bangers and mash were very mild in flavor. I'd have gotten them with gravy but somebody who owns the place thought that onion gravy was a good idea. Onions are a vile plant. The only good use for an onion is stuffing it in a sock and beating an onion farmer. Screw you, onions. As an allium you suck. Why can't you be more like garlic? Anyway, sweet potato fries were good and the food overall was pretty cheap. Sampled some of the pub's house brews and was mostly indifferent. That is, nothing was bad, but the only thing that really wowed me was the Burly ale, which was fantastic. In any event, samples are nice and cheap and make a nice snack. Git in right when they open. This place fills up fast. We got in right at 11:30 and it was empty. 1 hour later it was packed.
