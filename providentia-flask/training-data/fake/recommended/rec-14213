The burger menu is really creative and extensive. But this place has been hit or miss for me. I've either really loved it or been really disappointed. For example, my husband ordered a ten dollar burger and it was served on a pathetic school lunch cafeteria style bun. But considering that there's a shortage of southern food in this area, I guess that it's the best option of you're really craving something fried.
