Dinner was good, my linguini was excellent, and my friend liked the warm lamb salad. But what is up with that dessert menu? Uninspiring choices and both desserts we got were a lumpy cloying mess of vanilla (even the chocolate bread pudding). A freezerful of ice cream sandwiches would be more interesting.
