Coming from NJ, where there is an Indian restaurant at every corner it's easy to get bored with Indian cuisine, but after I came here I can safely say that this is by far one of the best Indian restaurants I've been to ever!! The dildar curry was awesome, and the service was exceptional, the owners really care what you think and look after you really well! I will certainly be coming back :)
