Had a baby shower at Elaine's yesterday for our daughter. I have planned many parties for special occasions in different locations I must say Elaine's was the easiest place, most accommodating place to work with. From the first phone call to the last moment when we walked out everyone was very professional and so helpful in every process. The servers were great. Very attentive but never in our face. The food was wonderful and plentiful. Will definitely use Elaine's again for our next party.
