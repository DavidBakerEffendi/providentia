I went here about a week ago, the reason the review took so long to write is because I didnt really want write it.  I dont like this place, not one bit.  Let me say first that the food was actually pretty good.  I had the enchilada with mole sauce which was surprisingly good since I dont like mole sauce. (I didnt know it was chocolate). She had a steak dish with mushroom that was cooked and seasoned well.  The guac I ordered was such a small portion for $7.95 I expected much more.  Everything else here is pretty bad.  I went here about an hour before closing, there were only 2 other tables besides ours.  We waited sooooooo long for everything, drinks, appetizers, meal, refills, and of course the check.  You would think they would try and be very fast about the service so they could go home at closing time but NOPE!  The other reason I didnt like this place is because it seemed expensive.  Mexican restaurants are not usually $17 $18 or $19.  I dont think the "ambiance" or "decor" validated the prices at all.  It looked like a cafeteria with nicely painted walls in fact.  I probably wont go back.  Total $65 plus tip... Could of gotten my entire meal for $40 or less at Jose Tejas in Wayne.
