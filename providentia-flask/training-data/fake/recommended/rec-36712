To begin, I wanted to rate The Spotted Pig at a 6 or 7, but Yelp wouldn't let me. So a friend and I decided to go late night binge eating, and I had been dying to try The Spotted Pig.  I was afraid that because I had so many expectations that I would be let down somehow, how silly of me.  This place lived up to all hype I'd heard.  We ended up ordering five different plates (between two little girls) so that we could attempt to try everything! Deviled Eggs - They look ordinary enough, but after you take your first bite, you can tell they have something a little extra, I'm thinking maybe olive oil? I'm probably totally off LOL Chicken Liver Toast - I could subsist on this alone.  It was so rich and creamy, the toast was toasted to perfection.  This was pure nirvana... there just aren't enough words in the world to describe it. Crispy Pig's Ear with Lemon, Capers & Trevise - Oh geez.... I could feel my arteries clogging just at the site of this dish, but I couldn't help myself.  The ears were cooked to perfection.  If not done properly, pig's ears can turn out very tough to eat and not tender at all.  Obviously, they knew what they were doing. Seared Squid with Cilantro Butter & Fennel - What a surprise it was to get a little spicy kick at the end of first bite.  But absolutely a good surprise.  This dish was full of flavor, the squid was tender... I could go on and on. Rosemary Shoestring Fries - I love it when your fries have so much flavor and seasoning that for once you actually don't need ketchup, ranch, 1000 Island, whatever you normally use. To finish, Head Chef April Bloomfield is a food genius.  I will be sure to go to John Dory and also back to Breslin Bar when they start serving food.  I officially worship the the stove she cooks on!
