Wow. Everything was going so well until we asked for the check to be split... The food was good. I had the lamb "tagine" (traditional tagine is not served on couscous) which was good, but needed more salt. A friend that I was with ordered foods after being told that they were gluten-free, but had symptoms of being "glutened" later on in the evening-so for the celiac crowd this is NOT the place. The awful part of the experience came when we got yelled at the end for asking for separate checks. Wow. The waiter (owner? not sure who he is, really) was completely unprofessional and for such a simple task. Won't be back for this place-we truly cannot believe how we were treated by this staff member.
