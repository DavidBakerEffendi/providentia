Pat's looks a little more nitty gritty and doesn't have flashy neon lights  compare to Geno's down the street, but they have more options, thicker steaks, pack their sandwiches with more stuff, and have hearty fries than Geno's.  The service was extremely quick and it's a plus that they're open 24 hours. However, I found that both cheesesteaks lacked in flavor and can't remember tasting much of anything.  If cheesesteaks are what Philly is known for, I hope that neither Geno's or Pat's aren't it's top notch steak joints because if they are, maybe Philly should be known for something better.
