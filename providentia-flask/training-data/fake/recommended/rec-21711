I came across this hidden gem as I was exploring NYC's Chinatown during my first few months there.  It down a random street and located across from the post office.  If you've never had fresh, hand pulled noodles, now is the time to convert!   Fresh noodles have a fresh taste and chewiness that boxed / factory made noodles can never replicate.  You can actually watch them make the dough and pull the noodles out by hand.  The food is legit!  I always order their beef noodle soup, which tastes like what my parents make back home in California.  The flavors are light but abundant and the soup never leaves you feeling bloated or weighed down.   They also make great dumplings and other side dishes! This is a small restaurant with big flavors! Added bonus, this place was featured on Food Networks' DDD!
