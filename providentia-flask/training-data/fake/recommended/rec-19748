So I feel like three may be a bit low, but Yelp don't do no 1/2 stars so I'm gonna err a little conservative. The scenery is very nice. Super cozy and warm. They have the six tops that area great for fours. Anyways. I got to order some NJ Beer Co to rep my boy and proceeded to wait to order. And waited.... Now I could see the whole restaurant from where I was sitting but it looked like there was only one waitress for the whole restaurant. I'm talking like 15 tables! Poor form. That said she did a heck of a job. I ordered the sliders (love sliders why did they fall out of favor?) They were great. Cooked wonderfully. Fries were great too. Gotta say they have done a great job as a local spot that does well as a date night place too. It's off the beaten path of Bloomfield Ave so if doesn't get to crowded. Will definitely be a place I will put in a regular rotation.
