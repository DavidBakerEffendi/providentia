"Omg, there's bacon in my bread!"... And so began a really awesome dinner. Yes, it was probably Pancetta in my bread, but sometimes when I get too excited I can't spit out the right word. This was immediately followed by "Omg, I love this olive oil, and I don't like olive oil!" And then "Omg, the polenta!" I think you get the idea, the food was amazing.  Seriously the polenta appetizer was on of the best things I've had in a while. I had the pork loin, tasty.  Mom had the lobster something pasta dish, also tasty. Desserts were interesting and complex without being too heavy. Portions were small, which I enjoyed because we wanted to try so many dishes.   So why 4 stars?  The service, while incredibly friendly and attentive was almost too efficient, to the point that we started to feel a little rushed.  The dishes came out very quickly with very little time between courses.  A meal like this I wanted to savor, not feel rushed to immediately eat the next course for fear that my dish would get cold. There just seemed to be a very subtle current of we want to turn your table. Food 5, Service 4.
