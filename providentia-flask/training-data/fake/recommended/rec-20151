My friends and I went to Buttermilk Channel last Saturday. We went for brunch to celebrate my girlfriends birthday.  Even though we wanted eat brunch at 11 am we got there for 10:45 as we heard there is ALWAYS a wait...and there was.  Thank goodness it was only a 40 min wait. By the time we returned from the bank 5 blocks away, our wait was only 10 min. We we sat down ordered out brunch and everything was delicious. I ordered the poached eggs. It was a bit salty but that was due to the ham. Everything was fresh! Pancakes was divine! One brunch type drink was included. The best part was the whole brunch was inexpensive. The 5 of us ate for $80. I would definitely go again!
