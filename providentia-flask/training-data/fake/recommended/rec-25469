I'm only giving one star because negative is not an option. The wait staff and drinks were good. Food on the other hand, was awful. There are literally no words to explain what just happened. The red tavern risotto balls were dismal at best. Definitely previously frozen, and not risotto. It seemed as if, a piece of pollio mozzarella was cut into a square and a rice mixture of lemon and saffron was formed into a ball, rolled in panko crumbs and frozen. Then, fried to order and Served with jarred tomato sauce, with a stick placed in the middle of said ball. Then, came the meat lovers brick oven pizza. The dough was raw, the pizza was greasy, the sauce again from a jar. The "meatball" on the pizza was over cooked mystery meat. In edible, in every sense of the word. The killer is the pulled pork plate. You could not taste the pork as it was smothered in some ketchup concoction, served with two sides. We chose mac and cheese and Parmesan creamed corn. The corn... Oh the corn. I don't have words to describe what that was. The mac and cheese was penne mixed with butter and cheddar cheese. It was as if, a college student was up late cramming for a final and had nothing but penne, butter and some kraft shredded cheddar and decided to make a meal of it. I never complain, however, this establishment has 4 stars on yelp, which is what led me here. How???? Why????? Is all I am wondering. This place could be on kitchen nightmares.
