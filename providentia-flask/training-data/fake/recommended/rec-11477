Food: Average/Above-Average. My friend ordered this lobster "ravioli" type dish I ordered one of their fish dishes. I'd say the food was pretty good. Very-well prepared. I was satisfied (by the taste - not necessarily by the portion). Everything else: BYOB (always a foreign concept for this West Coaster, but definitely don't object). Cash only. Our server was nice and attentive Return visit: meh... maybe. Overall, I'd say it was a pleasant experience.
