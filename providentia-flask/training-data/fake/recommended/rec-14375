I feel misled. This place is not very good. I ordered the Bo kho hu tieu (Vietnamese beef noodle stew) and was sorely disappointed - especially from all the great reviews about their bo kho. I received 2 small measly pieces of beef that were dry and extremely chewy. So hard to eat. What happened to the tenderness of bo kho meat? There was extra extra tendon but they were all overcooked. The soup? Flavorless and bland. Noodles? way overcooked. I have yet to come across a restaurant that serves better bo kho than my mom's. My brother ordered rice and mixed meat. This was so bad. Doused in soy sauce. Poor quality. He didn't even finish half of the mixed meats plate. Â  On top of that, the cashier overcharged our meal and refused to explain to us the details of what she had charged. We insisted that she overcharged and pointed out the prices listed on the menu - in the end, as a last resort, she told us she included gratuity. What? gratuity included for 2 people? $4 gratuity for a $14 meal? What the heck.
