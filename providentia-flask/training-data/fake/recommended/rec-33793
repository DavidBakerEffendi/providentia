OMG!!! Mindy T. below nailed EVERY description of the meal SPOT ON! This place is a MUST try . I consider myself to be a foodie and I truly enjoy trying new cuisines and some restaurants in philly don't necessarily make the cut. But this Marrakesh restaurant is ABOVE PAR! The dining experience is exquisite. Seriously, the knocking on the door part and you're greeted by the owner is a unique first experience. The owner is so customer oriented and super friendly! Service is amazing! The quality of food is excellent and the flavors of the dishes were very robust and bold, especially the chicken with cumin and spices. I like how there was not a whole lot to choose from. it was either X or Y, A or B, and the owner has been a part of the philly restaurant community for 37 years. 37 YEARS!!! that's CRAZY! This restaurant takes you on a culinary journey from start to finish. We had a 6.30pm show that evening so we def had to rush through the meal, rush through HALF our meal as we didn't get to the other half. Plan to spend at least 1.5-2 hours dining at this restaurant. It is certainly not a quick bite kind of place. Worth the money!! $25 per person, but for the level of service and the quality of food, i'm happy to drop $40 if not $35 off the bat each time i come here.EXCELLENT! A GEM IN THE city that i happened to stumble upon with my friends.
