Holy Seafood Tower Batman!!!  My wife ate here a couple years ago and always raved about Le Balthazar, which is an enormous raw seafood tower featuring fresh lobster, crab legs, clams, oysters, snails, shrimp and a shrimp and calamari salad.  I was visiting the city from Houston and we made reservations well in advance of our trip.  I was not disappointed at all in the Seafood Tower.  I even got one of my good friends to try (and ENJOY) oysters from the tower.  The tower also comes with a great cream sauce which I highly recommend (also comes with the classic cocktail sauce).  My meal could have ended here but no Yelper would stop with an appetizer.  As a true eater, my entre was the Steak Frites which I would describe as above average, especially after having the amazing seafood tower.  The Béarnaise sauce on the steak was creamy and provided the steak with the extra flavor kick that it needed. I would definitely like to come back and try the Onion Soup as I had to pass on the hot summer night that I went.
