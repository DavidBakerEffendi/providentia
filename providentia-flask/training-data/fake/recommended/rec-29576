Slightly above average Jersey Italian fare. Decent portions, and tasty too. I enjoyed the baked ziti and the pasta e fagiloli was great. I thought that the prices were reasonable and the ambiance was fine (Sinatra always works). We there for my birthday on a very cold January night, so there was no one there and that hurt the experience slightly (not their fault). Not sure I'd go rushing back since there are so many other Italian choices in my area, but I would recommend the spot if you want good standard pasta.
