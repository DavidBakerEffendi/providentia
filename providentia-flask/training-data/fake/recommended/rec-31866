I spent a month in Vietnam and ate banh mi about every single day.. so when I came here with my family I ordered the lotus root salad and my family all ordered different sandwiches.  We were ALL impressed!  The catfish sandwich was incredible and the lotus root was sweet and tangy and I loved it - somehow missed that dish during my travels.  The man behind the counter who I presume is the owner was very nice and turned on jazz music when we walked in - also beautiful photography on the walls.  I'll be back when I return to NYC.
