This is definitely above your average breakfast and brunch joint.  I'd say that the only REAL downside to this place is the 2.5 hr average wait time.  Luckily, the bakery allows us to track our wait online and provides a text msg 5 minutes before you're supposed to be seated so that you don't have to stick around the entire time!   We had the infamous blueberry pancake, sugar bacon and the salmon eggs benedict.  My personal opinion is that the blueberry pancake on its own was really what you'd expect it to taste like.  However, when you dip the pancake into their homemade maple sauce, it brings it to a whole new level.  The salmon eggs benedict was more of a treat for me because I typically enjoy savory stuff more.  The eggs were poached just right, the salmon was tender and the hollandaise sauce was just perfect. I think if I were ever to visit nyc again.. i'd probably skip it only because it didn't necessarily live up to its hype.  It is definitely worth trying it once just for the novelty!
