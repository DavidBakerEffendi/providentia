442 reviews, what is left to say?  meatballs?  legit.  mint ice cream with real mint in it? TOTALLY legit.  gets packed so check it out early, and when getting your ice cream sandwich I recommend the peanut butter and chocolate chip cookie to sandwich your deliciousness. next time though, i think i'll go mushroom sauce
