Used to be great, and the food's still delicious, but I feel like you have to consider the whole experience, including the wait. I've been there countless times and had pretty much everything on the menu. Used to be able to go at peak times and just wait at the bar for a bit, then the regular NYC cycle hit and now you can go there at 5 pm and they'll have a three hour wait. Better to go to rai rai Ken. The pretention and peccadillos used to be charming, but when you combine it with having to wait so long, your low blood sugar just makes all the shouting annoying. Ippudo has fallen victim to its own success.
