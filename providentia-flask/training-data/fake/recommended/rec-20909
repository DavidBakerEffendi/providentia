This review is about takeout/delivery since I've never eaten in the restaurant. Their food is amazing! It's inexpensive yet authentic Italian. We've ordered pasta dishes, sandwiches, salads, etc., and none have been a disappointment. Their takeout/delivery service is very quick as well. Sometimes your dishes are ready in 15 minutes if you're picking them up. Panini's is in our heavy dinner rotation.
