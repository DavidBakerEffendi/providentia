I'm convinced that this humble little fry shop was started as a conspiracy to make me fat. I've been going here for fries in the EV since I was a teenager. Years later I'm still helplessly addicted. I've always enjoyed hand-cut fries, but these are something special. They're always fresh, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and pleasantly salty. I love them with mayo, ketchup just too overpowering for frites of this quality. Their flavored mayos are wonderful, but I haven't tried them all. My top 3 favorite mayos are the rosemary-garlic, pesto, and the roasted eggplant mayo. They have something for everyone, and are more than happy to give out small samples of fries to try a taste of the different mayos. Ketchup and regular mayo comes with the fries, but if you want a flavored mayo it's $1 each but well worth it! The container amount is more than enough for a regular size of frites, but if you're ordering larger sizes it couldn't hurt to buy 2. I've found that their smallest serving size is MORE than enough for one, even if they happen to be famished. But they're so good your stomach will magically find room for them all. I noticed they also serve poutine, but I haven't tried it yet. If I do I will post an update.
