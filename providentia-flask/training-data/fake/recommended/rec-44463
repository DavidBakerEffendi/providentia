So, I feel awful writing this review because I truly love the beer selection, but the food is unimpressive, on par with a diner, quite possibly worse than diner food. My boyfriend and I went there two nights ago and it took a day and a half for our stomachs to recover. Let me emphasize that I don't consider myself to be a "foodie," or whatever the hip kids are calling it these days, but the cajun burger wasn't great and his steak chime-something-or-other was gross. If you're looking for presentation or a fine crafted meal, DON'T GO HERE! Now, if you're looking for a bar that has really good beers.... then definitely go here. The sliders are perfectly good, they serve popcorn at the bar, and I love the free pretzel rods. All in all, the food we had the other night was really disappointing, but five thumbs up for the beer. My advice, go for the beer and somewhere else for food. In hindsight, that's exactly what we should have done. Waitress- 4 food- 1.5 beer- 4.2 (only because coppermine is equal distance and has an amazing beer selection) This review was really written this past June of 2012. This place is probably one of the reasons I stopped eating meat.
