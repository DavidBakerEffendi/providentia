HYPE!!! 1st off they wouldn't deliver literally 300 ft from their line. Soooo, we decided to go pick-up so we could see what the "hype" is abut Roberta's.  They told us to pick up in a half hour. My husband got there 25 minutes later, picked up the small Pizza (they could have asked us if we'd ever ordered there so we'd KNOW the pizza's were small)  and picked up the Salad which was EIGHT dollars for 5 strips of romaine a wee bit of pecorino sprinkle and 3 candied walnuts.  Main thing...4-6 minutes later My husband came home from picking up the Pizza & salad and it was not only COLD...I mean COLD!  Not tepid, but C-O-L-D; but it was also doughy.  YUK!  I might as well go down tot he local pizza joint and get a slice with fresh mozzarella for $2.50.  It was not AT All thin crust and a huge disappointment.  Thank goodness I cooked up olives and mushrooms while he was out because they were hot and we were hungry! Mushroom topping was $3 extra and Olives I think either $3 or $2, so we saved money since the little cold doughy pizza was like $15!!! Never again...and I guess most people have no clue what's really good.
