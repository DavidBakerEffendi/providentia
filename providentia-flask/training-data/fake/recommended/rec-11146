When I first walked in I was a little intimidated by a mass of people crowding the front room and bar.  I almost turned around a left.  But then the waitress beckoned my date and I inside, and took us to a back room which was blissfully quiet.  She brought me a last word (yummy and boozy) and my date a vieux carre.  And then came the food. We each started with the small plate goat cheese, melted in a little bowl and served with delicious thin crackers, apple slices and honey, a winning combination.  Unfortunately there were about five tiny apple slices and a small dab of honey, some of which was sucked up under the unnecessary doily on my plate, so there was lots of cracker and cheese to go when the required accessories were already gone.  Maybe not the best start to the meal. I ordered the pork loin, which was enormous and meaty and came with sauerkraut and potatoes.  It was simple, hearty and delicious.  I wasn't feeling my drink with it, though, and although I was afraid they would not have beer, like so many places with great wine and cocktail lists, they did have beer.  They had a whole great list of beer, and I got a Sly Fox, just perfect with my meal.   My date got shad roe, which I don't think he enjoyed as much, not because it was not done well but because he learned he is not a fan of shad roe.  We both felt certain that if he was going to like it, he would like it prepared here. Then dessert: I had the mint chocolate chip ice cream sandwich.  It had whipped cream that was also vaguely minty.  It. was. just. so. awesome.  My date drank his dessert, having two half-pours of rye that apparently are quite hard to find.  I'm not a big rye fan and didn't try them but he was in heaven, so I'm assuming they were well worth it. All in all, a surprisingly wonderful experience.
