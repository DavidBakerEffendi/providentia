So I went back again to try the seeded roll with the sharp italian hoagie. I liked it, but I wouldn't say it was the best seeded roll I have had. It was of good quality, but if you do not receive it because they ran out, I would say you are not missing out on much. I really prefer a seeded roll, but at Little King Sandwich Shop I could go either way.
