Best pizza in new haven, and cant say ive found a better place in nyc either * best pepperoni ive ever had, anywhere * the pizza tastes great, the olive oil they put on top definitely helps * nice slightly charred crust, tasty line is usually very long, i usually call ahead for pickup or would suggest going to the sister location 'the spot' next door
