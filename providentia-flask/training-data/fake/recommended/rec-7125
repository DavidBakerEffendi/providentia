Aaaaaah I missed this place! Used to come here weekly when I worked by Fidi. Rotating all my favorite noodle spots as it gets colder and all I am craving is carbs and soup. Well, carbs in soup,  yay! Stopped by this afternoon for my go-to -- pork-filled fishball hand pulled noodle soup. So. Good. Gone in 5 minutes even though I'm practically eating blindly due to the fog up of my glasses from the piping hot soup. Noodles are a great firm,  chewy texture. Broth is subtle in flavor but very clean tasting. The meaty, plump fishballs(comes with 6) are filled with a tasty pork filling. I prefer the balls here over the ones at Super Taste. I've had their pan fried knife peel noodles too -- great texture on the noodles but could use more flavor. The dumplings here are solid though. Meaty, chivy, huge, yum. Orders come out fairly quickly despite the hustle and bustle of all the nonstop take out and phone orders. Guy Fieri did this place good. Lives up to the hype! Btw, cash only.
