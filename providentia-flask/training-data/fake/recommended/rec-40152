Eulogy is fine. Their selection is fantastic, of course, and they weren't out of anything despite being there on a busy Friday evening. They even had a few beers hiding out not on the menu--we managed to snag a Dogfish Head World Wide Stout for our table, which in hindsight may have been a mistake on the way to a nasty hangover, but at least it was delicious on the way down. The music was great (either the juke is well stocked or the bartenders have good taste. We also managed to grab a table for our party of three, which was unexpected. Because the two problems with Eulogy are its size and its clientele. On the first floor, there's room for the people on the bar stools and nothing more behind them, and some awkward clustering in the front by the door. Upstairs is a bit more spacious but still awkwardly oriented. If you get there on an off hour, great, but it's in the middle of the Old City scene and becomes packed frequently and easily. And the people that come... I mean, seriously, who orders a round of Patr√≥n and Stella in a serious beer bar? The cognitive dissonance between the place itself and a good portion of the crowd is spectacular. Despite the hordes and terrible layout, the service on my most recent visit was great, though it's not always been that way. I've never been a fan of the food, but then again I don't eat moules, so I'll call that a push. If Eulogy were bigger and the clientele were different (i.e. if it weren't in Old City), I'd give it an easy 4, maybe 5 stars. If the beer list and the service weren't so good, I'd give it a solid 2, maybe 1 star. As is, I'll average it out to 3.
