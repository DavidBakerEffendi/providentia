With no fewer than 15 people working here at any one time, and approximately 35 people eating or waiting to eat, this place has no shortage of visible restaurant cred. It's active, orderly, and all about the food. After a quick wait in line, one can possess flavor-popping dumplings and a sesame pancake sandwich for less than a Starbucks cappucino. And it's 1,000 times tastier and more satisifying. The sandwich is my real love, particularly the pork, for its intense meat flavor, offset by fresh cilantro, hot sauce, and sweet carrots, all on a warm, airy, slightly sweet sesame bed. This is the kind of thing I want to rub on my body and attract good, salt-of-the-earth men, women, and dogs with. And for $2, I probably could use it as a daily olfactory bribe.
