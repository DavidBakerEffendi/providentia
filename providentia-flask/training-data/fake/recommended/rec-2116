This place was really cool but crazy crowded!! It's definitely a tourist spot.  It has so many good places to eat.  It was cool to walk around and see the different shops.  I came for the cookies.  4th street famous cookies.  They were delicious!!  Wish I was hungry to try other places but we ate before we came here.
