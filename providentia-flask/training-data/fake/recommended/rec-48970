Our dinner was off the charts at A K & B.  I could not believe that this place was the old O'Neils.  I dined at Culinariane many times so I knew the food wasn't  going to disappoint.  It was fun trying a burger as we had never had that option before. Ariane did not let us down! The drinks were a tad pricey but the liquor is top shelf  and they use fresh ingredients, so we knew we were paying for quality.  I agree that they will no doubt work out their small kinks as their aim is to make their customers happy.  See you again soon!
