Very few really awesome Greek restaurants in the city, but this one is definitely one of them. The decor is cozy, service is very friendly, no one rushes you out the door, and it can be a great date place depending on how enjoyable your company is:) The food was delicious to say the least and prices were pretty moderate in comparison to other places like Avra. Definitely a great pick for Greek food and will definitely be going back.
