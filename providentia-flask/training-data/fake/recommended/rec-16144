Went in with a friend on a cold day and was happy for the cozy atmosphere. It was 1 pm on a Wednesday and we were told the wait would be 20 mins but we were seated within 10 mins (always great when hostess overestimate the wait a bit). We weren't rushed during our meal and lingered chatting for awhile. The service was attentive and friendly. I had the chicken meatball salad. I wasn't sure how I would like it but I was pleasantly surprised though not bowled-over. For the price, it was a nice meal and felt fairly healthy. The meatballs weren't greasy but they weren't dry either. For dessert my friend and I shared the red velvet cake. We both loved it though after awhile she started to get overwhelmed by the sweetness (not me--I could have eaten a whole cake of that stuff mmmmm....) I didn't love their coffee. It wasn't bad but it wasn't delicious. I'm certainly not a coffee connoisseur, I just know what I like. I didn't love the atmosphere but I understand the appeal--you definitely feel like you've escaped the big city and can pretend to be a country mouse for an hour. Maybe I would appreciate it more if I still lived in NYC rather than just visiting frequently.
