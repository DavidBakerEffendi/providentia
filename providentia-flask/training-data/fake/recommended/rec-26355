It is a bit overhyped... The fries was not that impressive to begin with. I have tasted better ones at restaurants and fast food chains (!). As for the dipping sauce, you do get a lot of choices, but they're kind of a hit or miss. It might take several tries to get the sauce you like.  Besides, for a fries shop, the fries are more important to get right and they did not impress me... The line is pretty long. It might take 15-20 minutes to get your fries. It's a  small shop, and they provide very limited seating, and it's dirty too - I see fries dropped on the ground and they're getting stepped on by so many people walking in and out of the shop. It is pretty expensive too.... I would say it is not worth the money.
