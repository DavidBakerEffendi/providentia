Came for lunch and had to say that despite the loud music, the food, atmosphere and location are great!  The food was in particular outstanding! We started with their daily special - baby octopi in a sesame aoili - delicious! Tender, bright red baby octopi with a sumptious taste of raw octopi and sesame oil. Then we had the sashimi sampler off the regular menu; I must say we quite enjoyed the grilled squid, tako, salmon, something else my coworker enjoyed and some very delicious white fish with a fantastic taste and texture we didn't recognize.   We had the special maki roll - tuna & tobiko inside; crab outside - delicious!  They did not skimp on the tuna nor the real crab meat. Hmmm... then we finished with a small plate of sushi which I must say was outstanding.  The fish tasted and felt fresh, tender & moist.  The accompanying spicy tuna roll was very very good; more tuna with a light kick than the standard unrecognizable super spicy mostly sauce spicy tuna you find at some places.  I'm not a fan of spicy anything roll because of this, but Izumi definitely put spicy tuna rolls back on my mind!
