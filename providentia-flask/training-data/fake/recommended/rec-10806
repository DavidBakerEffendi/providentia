Umami, savory, tangy, and sweet all come together on these delicious burgers and fries. The burgers are cooked medium rare and the toppings tend to accentuate the earthiness. The truffle is highly recommended though it can overpower the burger a bit. The original burger had mushrooms and a great savory taste. The hatch burger had delicious chilles though these also masked the meat a bit. The fries were the stars. We got the manly froes which had cheese and bacon. They are skinny straw fries and the four sauces are amazing. The diablo sauce and garlic aioli were particularly great.
