Actually 3.5 stars would be more accurate. Â Went here with some friends for a night away from the kids. The atmosphere is typical north jersey goombah-tastic. Low lit, extremely unnecessary valet parking, and lots of guys in from the fahgettaboutit crowd. Owner/host is phenomenal. He told my friends a story about how he had a dream about a meatball stuffed with spaghetti and decided to put it on the menu for the night. He was so excited about it we had to try it. He came back several times throughout our meal to check on us...and of course get a report on his creation. Service was super attentive and all of our dishes were very good but nothing really blew me away. This is a standard red sauce Italian joint, basically you already know the entire menu by heart before you even walk in the door. My only gripe with the place was that they have a window into the kitchen in one of the dining areas. I see what they were going for and it's a cool concept but the bright ugly florescent light pouring into the dining space made it feel really uncomfortable. We were almost seated in this section and asked to be moved immediately( a request they accommodated without any fuss). I would suggest some kind of adhesive colored film be placed over the glass, maybe orange? It would still let you see what's going on in the kitchen but diffuse the really ugly light. Just a thought. Anyway it is a nice spot for a good dinner.
