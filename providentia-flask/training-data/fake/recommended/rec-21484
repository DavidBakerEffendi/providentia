Frankford Hall is a blast. A bar with great selection of German beers, food, games, outdoor seating, fire pit, the occasional live band, what's not to like? The atmosphere of Frankford Hall is a major highlight. The tables are long with lots of seating. This place still manages to get crowded though. The fire pit outside is great during the winter, and you can even cook smokes on it. There are several ping pong tables, card games and other board games which are great for a group. The beers are served in huge mugs and are varied. They are a bit on the pricey side, but you're getting a better quality beverage for your buck, so the value is there. I've had the bavarian pretzel and their turkey burger. The pretzel was delicious, the turkey burger was fine, but seemed a bit dry. Their fries combined with their curry ketchup are spectacular though. This bar has a lot going for it, and definitely worth Â a venture out to Northern Liberties.
