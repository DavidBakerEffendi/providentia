This place has awesome food and its byob which makes it even better. the ambiance definitely needs some work and the servers both times i've gone have been slow teenagers seemingly just learning how to wait tables- Â but if you're patient enough it's all good. Their menu is eclectic and the food really is successful, just what Boonton needed.
