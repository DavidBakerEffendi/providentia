The food was quite tasty (although the duck breast was a bit dry) but the environment is VERY loud. It's not a place to go to if you're trying to have an intimate conversation, but everyone was obviously having a great time. Nice selection of dishes, reasonable prices. Just make sure you're prepared to talk loudly!
