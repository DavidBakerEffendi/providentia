The one place I made reservations on my recent quick trip to New York and so glad I did.  Dinner was great, food was outstanding and the service was awesome at the bar and pretty decent at the table. The Chili Lobster dish for an appetizer was outstanding and probably the best lobster dish I've had in my life.  Bone marrow was pretty good thanks to the fried pieces of short-rib on top. Entrees were both great - steak was good and prepared well, the snapper was cooked perfectly. If you have room for dessert, get the chef's tasting of ice cream. 5 small scoops of ice cream served in individual house-made mini waffle cones.
