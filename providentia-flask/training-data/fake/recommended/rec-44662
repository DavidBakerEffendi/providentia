hands down, one of the best burgers in NYC...and I am picky!  For pickle lovers...they get it right!  They don't give you soggy measly slices of pickles on your burger..they cut the pickle from it's side and it's crunchy! The meat is savory and juicy and oh my...burger heaven...order the "bar burger".  The staff is also very friendly and decor is not something you see very often in this city anymore...even though it's brand new it has a vintage feel to it...loved everything about it.
