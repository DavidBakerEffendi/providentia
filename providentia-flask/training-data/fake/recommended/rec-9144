look folks-i ain't gonna lie. this place ain't cheap. it ain't supposed to be. what makes it rock your world-is that it remains-at least among the lame choices after hours.. top notch food-and i say that as a classically trained chef! but equally, if not more to the point, it's intimate Late Night Dining-no one i know has a kitchen open this late-and serves this high caliber of food. again i do not measure value in this place by price. that would be like comparing holiday inn to um.. the hyatt regency. you get what you pay for. and again: excellent food. still a well kept secret to some degree. out of the way hole-in-the-wall, and serves up food at 2 am that i can't find in many other places at 2 in the afternoon! it's an experience.. or maybe i was drunk and it was too dark?.. either way, the food and experience was worth every cent.
