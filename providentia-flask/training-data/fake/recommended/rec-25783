This place has helped me through SO MANY hangovers. SO MANY. One of my best friends is the Foursquare mayor here, so yeah, I come here a lot. Like once a week. And I always order the same thing: Oxtail hand-pulled noodle soup with a fried egg. Sometimes they forget the fried egg and leave it on the side, but that's okay. I forgive them. There's something about the hot sauce that really enhances the taste of the broth - I'd recommend it over the sriracha if you like a spicy kick to your noodle soups. My only grievances are that sometimes they forget about you if you end up having to sit downstairs, and I freaking hate that tiny corner table by the window. Also, this is definitely the kind of place you should go for dine-in over takeout. I've never ordered takeout (though my friend has and there's no complaints that I know of) but I wouldn't bother taking home what you can't finish. The broth gets all gelatinous and it's disgusting. It's all so much better when it's in it's beautiful, original piping hot form.
