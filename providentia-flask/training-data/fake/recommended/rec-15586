Came here for Sunday brunch one day when a friend and I were sitting outside across the street at Poco and had yet to see our waiter for 15 minutes (I'm sure it was just an off day; I do still love you, Poco).   Our hunger got the best of us and so we got up and walked directly across the street into Fonda, not knowing what to expect.   Compared to the bustling, dank/hipster vibe we had just left, Fonda was pretty empty and looked a bit more upscale (think high tables, white tablecloths) for the neighborhood.  However the menu was impressive, everything looked delicious.  We each ordered a coffee, which came out in a french press, which was surprising as well.  Our order of guac was served with warm tortilla bread in addition to the usual chips, which was also a nice surprise.   All the food was great and they let us linger at our table. Had a great experience and really hope they stay; I will say that something felt a bit "off" or "missing"...not sure if it had to do with it's ambiance for the location, and the sparse attendance for brunch, or what.  Not usually the kind of spot I think of when I'm all the way over on Avenue B.   Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with everything from the food, the service, the ambiance, the presentation....would definitely be interested in coming back for dinner.    I think they might fare better in a different 'hood, but it's a good option if you are that far east and want a decent meal. Salud!
