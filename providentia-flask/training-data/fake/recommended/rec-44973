There's usually a line anytime I stop here for a burger and a beer, but it's always been worth the wait. Service is pretty brusque during peak hours, but the place is pretty small for the volume of people that come in every night, so they kind of have to hurry you along to keep things moving, which isn't really an issue since the food comes out so quickly. As far as their burgers go, I always find the bistro burger is tasty, juicy and very satisfying. Maybe it's not the BEST burger in the city, but for the price, it's absolutely fantastic. I usually grab a McSorley's dark and a side of fries, and my grand total for the meal is barely $10 without tip. Considering the quality of the food and the fact that this is New York City, a meal at Corner Bistro is unarguably a great bargain, and one that will leave you full and happy to boot.
