Holy delicious! In addition to an incredibly chill atmosphere where everyone is super laid back, the food weas out of this world. Nothing overly fancy, just stellar ingredients. The only downside was that they're SO laid back here that the waitstaff will wander off to talk with their friends outside, completely ignoring new patrons who walk in and sit down. We saw a couple come in, sit down, gett annoyed because no one had come over to take their order and leave during our dining experience.
