Starting from the way you are greeted at the bar (thanks Dave!), every person who came in contact with us was polite, helpful and gave great suggestions.  We went here for our 2nd anniversary, and it was a perfect night. Especially suggest trying the ham croquetas (or any croquetas for that matter), and the garlic shrimp.  The coconut crepe with scallops, crab and shrimp was also delicious, and the fried goat cheese never disappoints. Beyond the food, they also had a great beer and wine list, which was very affordable ($9 - 11 glasses of wine).  I must mention the staff one more time, because everyone made us feel very welcome and felt truly sincere. We definitely plan on returning here without a doubt, since there were a few dishes and the sangria that we still want to try.  Don't forget to pick up an Italian pastry next door on your way home too. Enjoy!
