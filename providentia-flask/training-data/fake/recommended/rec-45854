I've been wrestling with how to review the Red Onion. As far as food goes, they are tops in my book. The Chicken Salad is awesome, and I really love their breads. That being said, I have to echo what many others have said; The staff seem like they could care less. I realize that you're hipsters living in a hip city, but please get over yourselves and smile.
