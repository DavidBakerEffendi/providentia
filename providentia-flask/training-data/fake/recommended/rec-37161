I had a birthday party here last year.  I had a late dinner so that it could roll into the DJ that showed up at 10.  The food was ok.  I wasn't a huge fan.  But really loved the service, the restaurant itself, and the music was really good.  Lots of hip hop, reggae, top 40 type stuff.  We were there until about 1 in the morning having a BLAST.  Wouldn't necessarily recommend this place as a restaurant.  But a great place to grab some drinks and go dancing.
