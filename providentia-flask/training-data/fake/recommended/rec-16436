Sorry Song - was hoping to have a better experience since we love Joya.  Your idea of summer rolls completely baffled us.  Definitely not rice paper and soaked in sauce - not to mention tasteless.  Didn't eat more than one piece. The rest of the food was just ok.  Spicy noodles were decent.  Hot and sour soup ok. Beef with basil sauce had tough meat - didn't even save it for leftovers.  Song, just not hitting the right notes...
