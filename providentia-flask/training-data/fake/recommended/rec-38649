I had the 'chicken' cheesesteak (albiet wrapped up in a tomato basil pita because they were out of bread!), fries and a Nantucket Nectars Half-n-half.  The food was definitely tasty, but at the same time the place leaves you kind of feeling like an unhealthy vegetarian.  its sort of the like the veggie equivalent of a 'greasy-spoon.' Eating outside was way more pleasant--well minus the gaggle of bro-dudes yapping away in my ear from the table behind me.   But that being said, I'd rather focus on the food, which was actually very good. I'd totally recommend it for a quick, inexpensive bite almost any day of the week.
