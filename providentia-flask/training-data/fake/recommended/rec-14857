Two competing factors here: the lobster roll was a fantastic sandwich. And it cost $16.50. Of course, as this is New York City, I should have figured. Its too expensive for me to consider it five-star but that's the only ding I can give it. I love how the bun was just lightly toasted. The lobster and its dressing are perfect. The scallions on top are a perfect finishing touch.
