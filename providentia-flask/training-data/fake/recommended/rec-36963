Although this place is on my street and the people who hang out there on the weekends bum me out, I can't put it down. Brunch is real chilled out and dinner is always a good idea here. I reccomend going when it's on the empty side which does happen occasionally. The artichoke dip will make you feel like you are living the good life.
