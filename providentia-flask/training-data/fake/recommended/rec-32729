Came here on Labor Day afternoon. It wasn't too busy at all. The establishment is very clean and well kept. The decor is simple yet slightly nautical/modern. I knew it was a winner when I saw a sriracha bottle along side salt and pepper at every table. The menu was simple and didn't have too many items, which I liked. Many seafood places have a vast menu of all fried or broiled of everything under the sea. This menu has 20 items tops (including the sides). Prices are moderate. For what I saw, I wouldn't expect hole in the wall prices. We ordered: Thai calamari for an app. It was well portioned as an appetizer for less than 9 dollars. It was presented and tasted like a 15 dollar app from any one of the pubs or restaurants in the area. Maine lobster roll for him. Probably had about two claws+ worth of meat. The bread roll was New England style--where the sides were buttered and toasted (YUM). Not too much seasoning, probably just salt, pepper, and mayo. It was simple and straight to the point which is what makes it a Maine lobster roll. The meat wasn't too chewy when you bit into it, (when you have trouble taking bites without pulling out the entire contents of the sandwich) which tells me that it was cooked properly or carefully. For me, blue lump crab roll. At least two full ice cream scoops of crab/mayo mixture on the same heavenly buttered roll as previously mentioned. Looked very white and mayo drenched but I still tasted a lot of the crab. Both rolls came with our choosing of fries and slaw. Slaw was eh, can't expect much from a stereotypical side. The fries were perfect and seemed to have that fresh cut taste and texture. On the thicker side but not as thick as steak fries. Topped it off with the seasonal Narragansett!
