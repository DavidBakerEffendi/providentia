First impression upon entering fighting through a waiting crowd to get to the host stand to put our name in: 1. Even though I think I'm dressed okay, apparently I should have been 'New York City' dressed. 2. The host is snobby and probably because he's reacting the fact that I'm not dressed 'up'. We are given a 25 minute wait, but after less than 10 minutes, the host comes out to seat another party who had gone for a little walk based on the quoted 25 minute wait...so he sat us instead. Service was friendly and attentive. I had the tomato soup which was O.M.G. amazing! and the famous Mac and Cheese which was top 5 but not the best I've ever had. VERY good though. My boyfriend had the Turkey Burger, no bun/sub. lettuce and sweet potato fries. Regular fries arrived at the table via the food runner. The waiter brought over the sweet potato fries and let us keep the regular fries anyways. For drinks my boyfriend had the bloody mary which he said was VERY good and I had a mimosa type drink - I can't remember the name - prosseco/grapefruit juice...also good. Overall we were very satisfied with the food. Drinks were NYC expensive ($12) but food was very reasonably priced.
