The food here is amazing! Minus 1 star because it can take a very long time to get a server and also to get your food, but to be fair, I've only come during very busy times. When our waitress did come take our order last night she was incredibly nice. Â For example when I asked for limes, she brought 3 wedges instead of just 1 which was perfect. We got 2 types of dumplings, and they were the best I've ever had! The Up tini specialty cocktail was pretty terrible, so next time I'll stick to beer or wine here. The pad thai was incredible, and I love that when you ask for hot chili sauce on the side they give you a little tray with a whole selection!
