Ahhh, so many good meals at Caseus. This place is great. Whether it's the Â cheese plate, the burger, the beet salad, the mac, the french onion soup, the various local soda options... It's all divine. But I really, really like the burger. And the chocolate pot dessert. My god, that thing is so obscenely good.
