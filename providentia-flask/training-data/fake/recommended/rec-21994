while i love the many vegetarian indian selections along rt. 27 in north brunswick, sometimes you just need meat!! and that's when you drop by this place. correct me if i'm wrong but abhiruchi serves cuisine from the andhra region of south india, which, luckily for me (=szechuanese), houses meat eaters who like it HOT. really really hot... although i normally eat in here, tonight i got take out. ordered a chicken 65 app, lamb kadai, and mutter paneer. come to think of it, i almost always get chicken 65 and lamb kadai here, and they've always been very good. definitely not under flavored, and if there's anything i cannot stand, it's blandness. as for the veggies, i think the peas in the mutter paneer were frozen but that didn't detract too much from the dish. i love that they use fresh jalepeno peppers if you like it hot. and their "hot" is no joke.. take something beforehand for your digestion if your stomach cannot handle it. you've been warned!
