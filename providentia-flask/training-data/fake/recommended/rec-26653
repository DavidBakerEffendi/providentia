The Savannah and San Antonio are the way to go. Really great ingredients and my love of cranberries does make me partial to the savannah. The specials they have are usually impressive as well. Great selection. Prices are $1-2 more than I might expect, but they make big sandwiches and use good stuff in them, so its worth it. Gets crowded quick but you can wait outside.
