Went there last night with a bunch of friends for a bday night out.. I usually don't review restaurants but have to say the place is good.. it is still a new location so you can tell that, the menu is still small, there is only one waiter for the restaurant. Idk I would have had one more person but since its still new it's ok.. Anyway, the atmosphere is nice, a little quite but if the right customers are there it will not be. The drinks are creative I have their version of an old fashioned with mezcal, I liked it smoky and nice, and other friends had drinks,I tried one off their margaritas, it was good, not to tequila dominant just the right amount. Friends had tacos, have to say tried a little,a lot of flavor in what ever I had.. The server was really friendly, and so was the owner I guess. In all I would say once they get the menu digger and maybe one more server it could be a great place for the neighborhood, it has potential, will be back again soon to see the location fully Â up and running...
