I ate at BAR last night and it was pretty good. We had the mashed potato pizza with chicken. I'm only giving it three stars because while the mashed potato was an AMAZING light and fluffy unconventional topping choice (it's all a matter of opinion but I'm beginning to think the mashed potato pizza haters are crazy!) the chicken tasted a little bit funny. I've eaten here before and never liked any meat that I've gotten on my pizza, I always end up picking it off. The crust is very very thin and crunchy. The place is usually packed although they do have bar seating in a picnic table type fashion where you go to the bar and order your pizza and drinks, pick them up, sit down and eat. They do not take reservations so I've eaten in the bar area quite a bit due to the wait for a table. The beer is alright. I've been to a lot of breweries and wouldn't necessarily say this one is anything to write home about. It's good- not fantastic.
