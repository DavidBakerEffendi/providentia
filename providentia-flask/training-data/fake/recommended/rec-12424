Wowowowow. This place is amazinggggg I had half a truffle burger, half avocado ahi tuna burger and the sweet potato fries. So I tried to go the half healthy route... I think that the sweet potato fries were some of the best I have had! Amazingly seasoned and prepared. Definitely worth coming back to try their other burger options (burger diet?) hehe.
