The Bad - The Penny Egg Sandwich (I expected it to be so much better....I can make this myself...cut a crossiant put fried egg and pesto sauce..not worth it) - Small portions for pricey foods The Good - The french toast is good. Not much fruits given though but it's fine. French toast is not a regular toast...its more of a baguette type of bread which makes it yummier. The Bottomline- This place is okay. Stop by for their french toast, that's about it.
