I really enjoyed my dining experience at Melograno. The place is cozy with friendly service; great location; BYOB - didn't have time to grab a bottle of wine since we were trying to make it on time but they allowed us to go out and grab one -  still saved our table near the window. We had::: Antipasto Rustico - A platter of assorted seasonal crostini, salami Prosciutto di Parma, olives, fresh mozzarella,grilled & pickled vegetables. Pappardelle Al Ragu di Cinghiale - wild boar bolognese Pescespada con Caponatina di Melanzane - grilled Atlantic swordfish The platter was amazing - big portion and delicious! They all went well with our wine. My favorite was mozzarella, grilled zucchini (with balsamic vineg.) and pickled vegetable. We were getting full just with this platter. Dangerous one! I had the bolognese and I loved the pasta noodle - really wide & flat. I wish i smelled/tasted less of wild boar since it was pretty strong, but it was meaty and good.  I had a swordfish before but this one was exceptional. The fillet was served over an eggplant, capers, pine nuts, tomatoes & olive Caponata - all blended very nicely. Perfect date spot. Also perfect for wine & chill-night with friends. Definitely recommended!
