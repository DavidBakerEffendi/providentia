I came here about a week ago with my friends and was really looking forward to the food. The pork we ordered was good as well as the coconut rice. The reason for the lackluster review is because as we were waiting for our order of Â coffee and tea, the manager came by to tell us the table was over its time limit, since our full party was not on time. The owner came back to apologize realizing we were upset, but the manager's lack of service and rude attitude left me with a bad taste in my mouth.
