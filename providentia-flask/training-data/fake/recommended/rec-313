If you expect something American style, this cafe is not for you. Portion is "Non-American Size". Cafe Latte is not weak like American style cafe latte. I can easily imagine some Americans complain about their style. So,,,,this place provides you real French style food! I'm happy I found this place! I had smoked salmon and scrambled egg for brunch. Scrambled egg was fluffy and moisturized. (I know every single restaurant in USA cooks wrong way and it's dry...). And I had mini croissants with butter and raspberry jam and they were same quality as you get in France!
