Being obsessed with the food network, I was watching "the best thing i ever ate - in a bowl" - well when Guy said... these are the best hand pulled noodles, I had to try it. This place is nothing fancy, actually it's a little on the gross side.  But,  we ordered beef pan fried noodles (knife cut) and then chicken soup with hand pulled noodles - plus dumblings and two beers.  Everything was fresh, delicious and way too much for two people!  You then forget about how small and dingy this place is.  The kicker - $20 for the whole thing.   Afterwards, my friend and I went to Apothoke for a cocktail and well.. that was way more expensive than our entire meal. I'm excited to go back.
