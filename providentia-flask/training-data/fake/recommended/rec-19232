Highly recommended for anyone in the Art Museum Area. This was the first restaurant I ate at when I moved to Philadelphia. It was late on a Thursday evening about 30 minutes before the kitchen closed for the night. Usually this late, everyone just wants to go home and the dining experience suffers, but I was delighted to have a great meal and an attentive server. Since then I have been back several times, each time trying something new on the menu. The food is incredible. Portions are large and well seasoned, and the ingredients are fresh. Servers and staff are friendly, and speed of service is quick. They deliver through DiningIn.com Prices are reasonable.
