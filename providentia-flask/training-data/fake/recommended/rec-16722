I'll be honest by saying that I was almost tempted to write a negative review because I don't want this place to get over-run by annoying "City Folk". Bistro Petit is too perfect the way it is to have to deal with that disruptive and disloyal attention. Rather it's BP's attention that is my favorite thing about it. From the moment you meet "Chef'" you know your talking to a man who's focused like a laser-beam. He better be, considering that he's not only the Chef, but also the head waiter, greeter...basically every position in a restaurant. His dishes reflect that focus by being innovative without going overboard. Foie Gras came with charred grapes on the vine and drizzle of port wine reduction. A Â local Porgy (a bit of a fishier fish than I usually go for) was perfectly balanced by the use of kalamata olives and butternut squash. There is no "gilding the Lilly" here. Obviously food and atmosphere are the most important attributes, but BP gets extra points for being BYO also. I love being the master of my own destiny when it comes to wines in restaurants. This all being said, I can't wait to go back again for another great experience. We're already planning our anniversary dinner with their 9 course offering. I'm sure that will knock our socks off!
