Ivy is a LOUD music playing lounge with great drink specials before 7pm; and believe you me, this lounge is buzzing before then. Definitely a place where the 20's and 30's come for a drink and to meet up with the local "woo girls." Not recommended to carry out a conversation since you can barely hear yourself think here; just chug and grub. The only thing complaining will be your wallet after your through with this place. The food was spot on and I have nothing bad to say about it. Ingredients were fresh, burgers were juicy, and salads were put together very well. Everything on our table was very tasty. My Flame Grilled Crunch burger reminded me of  poor college days tailgating among  friends; where the only fresh ingredients you could afford were buns and burger patties. And when you craved a little bit of veg to compliment your burger, you would throw in some potato chips to make do. Ivy truly captured this ghetto sporting burger  and marketed it into their gourmet menu. I just wished they kicked it up a notch with more sriracha sauce. Cool neighborhood gem, will come back go burn the dance floor!
