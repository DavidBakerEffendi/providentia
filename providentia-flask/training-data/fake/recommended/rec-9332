I feel like I'm cheating on my chosen people in the Upper West Side when I sneak into Kefi to devour their huge, succulent, absolutely-couldn't-be-more-perfectly grilled shrimp. So tender. Scattered generously over the orange citrus salad, it's easily one of the most delicious, naughty non-kosher lunches to be had in this part of town. It's hard to believe I spent almost the same price for a boring over-chopped make-your-own salad next door at Lenny's.... eh. The egg dishes on the lunch menu pale in comparison to the grilled meats, wraps, and assorted dips. At $11 with a Greek salad included, the frittata is a good deal, but pass it up. Get the mezze appetizer, and dig in with their warm grilled pita points - the fish egg spread is other-worldly. Kefi also has notably good service, with waiters that hail from the homeland and know their stuff. Get 'em to the Greek.
