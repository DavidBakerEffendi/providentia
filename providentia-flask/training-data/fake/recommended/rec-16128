Love this place. I love the vibe, the decor and mostly the food. Went here to grab a bite to eat after going to the comedy club. The food was amazing. Wine list, incredible. The only down side really is that even at 12:00am this place is CROWDED. Definitely want to head back next time I'm in the area.
