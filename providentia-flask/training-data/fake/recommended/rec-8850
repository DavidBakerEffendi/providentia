One thing Staten Island lacking, is good bars. I mean there are some, but they are few and in between. In my search for places that serve great beer and good food in my new 'hood I found yelp listing for this German place... Hmmm, let me check it out, I thought. After a weird drive though the narrowest street you will find on the island and turning up right on Castleton, I saw it - windows brightly lit and lot of people walking in. Parking is not bad on side streets, and short walk is a breeze. Place is packed on any day of the week - and you know it usually be a sign that it is genuinely good. There is a formal sitting area on a back, but there is also tall tables and a long bar upfront. It does get a bit drafty in winter, but not too bad. Beer selection is solid, lots of good ones on tap. ~looks at dark tall glass of beer and swoons~ The food - THE food will blow your socks off. If you like German food, if you like simple stuff like sausages and potatoes done right - you must try this. My favorites are their Kartoffelpfannchen dishes - it's a skillet with sizzling potatoes, crispy, golden, AND with bacon - just like my mom used to make. It's topped with most delicious juicy sausage - there are several varieties to choose from. (I am getting sooooo truly hungry just typing all this) There are lots of appetizers too - herring plate was huge, and pretty good. Prost! I will be back - many, many, many times.
