While I've never been for brunch I really enjoy dinner every time I've been here. I always get the penne with chicken. It's really tasty. My favorite dinner here was with my wife soon after Sandy as the neighborhood was just coming back to life. But every time we enjoy the mix of longtime residents and young people at what seems like a vanishing breed: the high quality reasonably priced neighborhood restaurant.
