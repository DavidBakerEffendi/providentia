What a lovely discovery this was. My wife and I were in Queens to visit family at the same time that 3 friends from home were here to handle the affairs of a family member now in a nursing home here. Their day was grueling and we arranged to meet and have dinner together. Knowing that they are unfamiliar with the area, as I am also, I googled for restaurants in the area. Malagueta was among the choices, had good reviews and was just a short walk. It was a fortuitous find. We had the most wonderful night! ...I just discovered that I never posted this. Well then, let me add that I've been back twice and loved it, my brother-in-law has been back twice more and another of the group that originally visited with me has been back and had a good time. YAY!
