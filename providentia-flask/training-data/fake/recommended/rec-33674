My parents are visiting from KY and I wanted to take them to a great local joint and this is the place!  The cocktails and wine selections are delicious and amazing and cocktails made with great skill.  We had the app special of pork belly and shrimp to start with an old stand by of the pear salad.  The menu is well thought out and appeals to a wide variety of tastes and flavors.  I have gotten the perfectly cooked and seasoned hanger steak several times...maybe should branch out on the menu more, but it is soo yummy.  We each enjoyed our dish very much and after wandered down to the promenade to enjoy the view of the city.  It was a perfect way to spend the last night of their visit.
