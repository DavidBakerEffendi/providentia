Taste and quality of food were less than what you'd get from a vendor on the street, and the food cost 3x more. Cappuccino was made poorly and also was significantly more expensive than much better places. No anger or spite here -- just completely underwhelmed with the product, especially in relation to the price. Never to return again, which is a shame given proximity to home.
