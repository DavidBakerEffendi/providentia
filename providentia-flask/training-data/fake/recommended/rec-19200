My favorite sushi I've ever had (even BEFORE I was vegan). Great flavor combinations, beautiful presentations! Prepare to amaze your sushi-loving omnivore friends! I don't think anyone would be disappointed with this stuff. The Mighty Mushroom is really the best! But try them all, you won't find a bad flavor. Quick note: it's really counter service only. They have about 10 seats. Don't expect to eat here, just grab n go!
