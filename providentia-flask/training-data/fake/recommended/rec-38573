People rave about Govinda's and I keep coming back to give them more chances as soon as I forget how bad my last experience was. But my days of coming back to an abusive boyfriend are kinda over. First of all, the service is all over the map. Don't get me wrong. They're not unfriendly, just...not good. Second, the food is just OKAY. Honestly, all my orgasmic vegan cheesesteak experiences come from Blackbird Pizzeria. And third, it costs a fortune! I can put up with spotty service and vegan junkfood that is just "alright" for a quick bite. But when you're charging a gabillion dollars for it, I gotta draw the line. This especially goes for the baked goods. I understand you're having most of them trucked in from Vegan Treats bakery (which is awesome!!!!). So there's a markup. But now I can get the same stuff from multiple places around the city for less. So, I'm sorry Govinda's. You'll always hold a place in my heart for being first. But now I've moved on to someone who loves me better.
