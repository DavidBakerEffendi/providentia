The setup is great. A relaxed, slightly rustic decor, right level of music, noise and lighting for dinner and conversation. We went on a nice summer night, and despite having a reservation, could not get a  seat in the garden. But there was a nice fresh breeze throughout the place. The situation with the wait staff was a little confusing and we went quite a while without being able to order. Got the rabbit meatballs, calamari and burrata, which were all delicious. The portions were generous, and I would definitely recommend all three. For entree, we had the pork shoulder. It resembles no other take of pork shoulder I've ever seen: five small slices of some medium rare meat. It tasted slightly gamey, was extreme salty, and left my mouth cringing. My dates bite was a glob of salty fat that she spit out into the napkin. Left most of the plate untouched, and gulped down a lot of water to recover.  Definitely stay far away from the pork shoulder!  At the least, I hope they are flash freezing the pork to kill the cystercercosis parasites. Good start, bad finish. With plenty of great food in the village, probably won't be back to this spot.
