The location is good, and the atmosphere is lovely / cozy / intimate. Our service was good. But the food was terrible. I had a pastry wrapped pork tenderloin, and it was totally overcooked to the point of tough and hard to chew. My husband ordered a pasta, and it had almost no flavor at all. Our friend ordered a pasta dish with lobster. The lobster came inside the shell and was pretty much all shell / no meat. Bad food - we won't go back to eat. But a lovely place to grab a glass of wine!
