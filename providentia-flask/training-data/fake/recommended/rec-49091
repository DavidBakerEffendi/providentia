Jonathan Waxman is known for his chicken and ordering the pollo al forno at Barbuto will not disappoint you.  The entrée is an item that I always order, but the entire menu is full of incredible dishes.  In regards to the restaurant itself, it has a prime location in the heart of West Village with giant garage doors that are open on the warmer days and allows tables to overflow into the streets.  Reservations are sometimes hard to come by, so plan in advance or go for an earlier dinner to walk on the Westside highway or The High Line afterwards to see the sunset.  Great date combination!
