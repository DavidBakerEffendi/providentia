One of my friends recommended this place because their uncle owns it! I've been going back every time I'm in Philadelphia. Thousand-layer bread and Jungle anything is so delicious, so I rarely order anything else. I usually get take-out but eating there is very pleasant, great service. Can't wait for my next visit!
