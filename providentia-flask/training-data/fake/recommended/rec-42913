Cute restaurant with easy to make reservations on Open Table. I went with two girlfriends and it was the perfect ambiance. Wine was good, food was good, service was decent, dessert was great. My only complaints were: - the waiter gave really poor descriptions of the wine - we had to ask for bread It was a nice evening, but I just wasn't blown away by the experience and probably don't need to come back
