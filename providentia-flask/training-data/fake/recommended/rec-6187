I am a regular at Salt & Fat. The reason I go so often because the menu is always changing and never boring. You can really tell that every dish was thought out really well because the flavors are so explosive and unique. The small dishes makes it an excuse to order everything on the menu (and I have) without getting an eyebrow raise from the waiter. Among my absolute favorites are: the yellowtail with yuzu gel, scallops, blt buns, lobster citrus salad and the Long Island duck breast. Do yourself a favor and order dessert (lychee panna cotta!!!) no matter how full you are. Trust me you will make room.
