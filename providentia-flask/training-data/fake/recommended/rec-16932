Really liked our experience here recently! The food was above average and the service was very friendly and entertaining! I had the juegos rancheros and added jalape√±os and avacado to it. These were super tasty and very filling! I'd deff recommend these, but the whole tables food looked great and I'm sure anything you order will be tasty
