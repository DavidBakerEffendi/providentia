i'm just going to echo all the reviews and say oh mah gaaahhhh the pho real!!! granted i did destroy a full sandwich in a drunken stupor after already demolishing a bacon wrapped hot dog and pizza, but it was THAT good that I said i would only eat half a sandwich and then unwrapped the second one. Roast beef sandwich to pho delight? impossible you say. BUt there is something magical about the marriage of siracha hoisin Â roast beef and avocado, top that with the cilantro, basil, sprouts and onions on a soft torta bun and BAM, you got so much deliciousness for 7.99. I've also had the Pho 2 and the sunny breakfast sandwich, and I can say while they don't measure up to the pho real, they are as loaded.
