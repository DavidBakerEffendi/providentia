We ate breakfast at 9 and headed into Parc for our noon reservation. It felt like we were setting ourselves up for failure given that we really weren't hungry. Eyeing everyone outside on the patio, we were disappointed when we were taken into the back of the restaurant. But then, I saw the menu and found the Mozzarella and Tomato Baquette. It was delicious. The iced tea was great and our drinks were refilled constantly. The service was almost overwhelming. The bathrooms were beautiful. Would like to return when I wasn't so full!
