Raw fish and I just don't go well together, but it doesn't mean that I can't eat sushi!!! My friends and I decided to go to Fuji Mountain because another friend of ours suggested it. AND WE ARE GLAD TO HAVE GONE!!! The sushi was DIVINE and the Shrimp Shumai...OH MY GAWD!!! Â The service was incredible and time efficient; plus, the workers actually greed you ( HELLO AND GOODBYE)!! The only down side is the price of the food and the smaller than I'd like quantities. But, it is sushi!!! Overall, awesome place to go for sushi night and I WOULD DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN!!!
