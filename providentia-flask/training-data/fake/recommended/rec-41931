We went last night for UC Dining Days and Vientiane was terrific.  A lot of restaurants slack off for Dining Days, which I always think is a big mistake.  It's a great opportunity for restaurants to lure you in, which Vientiane did!  They had great choices on the pre-fixe menu.  The food was terrific and the service was very good.   Great local byob.  Can't wait to go back!
