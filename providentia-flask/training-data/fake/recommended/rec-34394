I mentioned the staff in my review of Hotel Vermont - but extremely friendly and helpful. We went in for breakfast, and I had a yummy bloody mary with house-made jalapeno vodka, and the red flannel hash (corned beef with potato and beets), eggs, and toast. Everything was delicious, with appropriate portions. Hubby liked his breakfast too, standard eggs, toast, bacon and homefries. I really liked the atmosphere, the set-up and decor is kind of modern-rustic, and they have a nice fire pit in the back at night. We came back later in the night for birthday dessert, and the bar was full on a Tuesday night. Coconut cake was tasty and they put candles in it for me without making a scene and singing :) if we return to Burlington, we would eat at Juniper again.
