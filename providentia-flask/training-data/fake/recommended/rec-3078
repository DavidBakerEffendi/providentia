I have visited this place 3 times... And I have a few things to say.. I really like the montaditos, some better than others but it all depends on your own taste. For the price there is not much you could get wrong. I half like the anchovies montaditos. I am an anchovies lover, and the anchovies at this place taste old and saltier than normal, which means they aren't fresh at all. So don't try those. Also, I wish the sangria would be better. Sangria in Spain is awesome, and here it sucks. First, they need to add more wine because right now you can only taste de whatever else they adding to it. I know this place is busy, but I hate to see rude employees. There is girl that works there, she is Spanish (from Spain, I can tell by the way she speaks Spanish, her accent), and she is always so rude. Maybe I haven't been lucky with her, but it doesn't mean she can treat customer like they are bothering her. On the other hand, I like the ones with Serrano ham, manchego cheese, and chorizo... The croquetas are great to share, or could eat them all!! I should give it 3 stars now that I think it better, but this place is fun nonetheless.
