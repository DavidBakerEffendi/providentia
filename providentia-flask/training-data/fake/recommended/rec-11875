The food was great, but the culture and hype around this restaurant are ridiculous.  We had about a 2-hour wait, and when we were seated, we noticed that there were many empty seats throughout the large dining room.  The service wasn't great, either.  There are other delicious ramen places in New York that are not obnoxious, so it would take a lot for me to return here.
