My family and I decided to come here because we wanted to try out a new place. We walked in at around 12:30 and there was no one else there...on a Saturday during lunch time. It seems like this restaurant did more take out food rather than in restaurant dining. Perhaps this is because driving around New Jersey is not that pleasant. Anyhow, yelp said that the restaurant had a private lot but it doesn't, just wanted to clear that up because my brother was jaded about that. This is absolutely not at the fault of the restaurant or anything, but yelp users who said that in the first place. The restaurant seems like it was run by a family so I really liked that. + the have a long menu + there is a Vietnamese TV station playing + the avocado shake is really good, I don't know if they have boba though because I didn't ask + the owners are really nice, really attentive + I liked the quiet atmosphere of the restaurant + the restaurant is fairly spacious + the food is good + my brother said the bun Bo hue is good + flowers next to the bathroom entrance + clean + friendly + the durian shake tasted like real durian (good thing if you like that fruit...) - there was a fly but the owner lady wasn't happy that the door was open to let the fly in in the first place so it's not due to the dirtiness of the place or carelessness of the restaurant
