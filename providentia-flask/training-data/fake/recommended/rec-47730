Awesome food, inexpensive, but not fancy. Went with a friend tonight for the first time. I got the number 88 which was noodles with chicken and veggies (recommended by the staff), she got a curry tofu soup, and we split the scallion pancakes.  There were many gluten-free and vegetarian options.  We sat at the counter, and really enjoyed watching them cook right in front of us. Those cooks are really talented! We both agreed that we will be back soon.
