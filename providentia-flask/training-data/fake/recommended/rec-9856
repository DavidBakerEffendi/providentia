Since moving to 9th Avenue a few months ago, I've tried lots of good places locally but this is the only one that I find myself coming back to again and again. Sergimmo is a little neighborhood Italian deli that seats about 15 that I doubt I'd have ever found amongst all the other restaurants, delis and bodegas along 9th if it weren't for yelp. The Il VIP is quite simply the best sandwich I've ever tasted. Absolutely top notch ingredients prepared in the perfect ratios. The sweetness of the fig spread works perfectly with the salty prosciutto and creamy mozzarella. The bread is also truly excellent - light and fluffy inside with a satisfyingly crispy crust, all whilst being solid enough that you don't need to worry about the whole thing falling apart. Also has decent coffee. There's no table service. Make your order at the counter and have a seat (you pay when you leave) as it can take them a little while to prepare things. Most of the staff are great, on one occasion was given some mozzarella that they'd just finished making to try. One word of warning, it's certainly not cheap (think $20 a visit for a sandwich and drink with tax and tip) but it is worth every last penny.
