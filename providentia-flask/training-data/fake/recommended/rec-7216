THE UNI!!!!! It's been several weeks since I visited Ssam Bar, but I have thought about the uni everyday since. That is approximately 30 days straight of uni-lusting. It's served on warm tofu with wasabi peas and some salmon roe, but the combination of the warm tofu and the cold uni and the crunch of the peas is flavor/temperature/texture NIRVANA. It's a travesty that I'm sitting at work writing this review instead of eating the uni right now.
