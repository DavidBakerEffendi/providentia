I was in charge of planning a company event and loved the space at The Bar Room. It has a great sophisticated atmosphere and beautiful lighting. We reserved the back dining area for a cocktail hour and dinner. Â Everything was perfect! Our cocktails were delicious and the food was excellent. I had the braised short ribs with sweet potato with the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. Everyone found something they liked on the menu and the staff was very accommodating and knowledgeable. We had a great evening! My family is coming into town soon and I'll definitely be taking them here for a nice dinner.
