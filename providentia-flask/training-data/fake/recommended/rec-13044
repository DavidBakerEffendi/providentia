I visited Clinton St. Baking Company my last day in New York, it was a great place to stop for breakfast! We went on a Monday morning, so fortunately no wait. As others have said, not the best place for groups, we crammed five people at a table for four, but it worked. Based on the reviews (and Throwdown with Bobby Flay), I couldn't resist ordering the blueberry pancakes. Actually, everyone in my group ordered them! They were very good, nice crust on the outside but moist and fluffy inside with the perfect amount of blueberries, and the maple butter was delicious!! We also ordered scrambled eggs, cooked well (I'm super picky about eggs, a lot of places over or under cook them), and the sugar cured bacon (amazing!!) If your craving pancakes, I'd recommend paying Clinton St. Baking Company a visit!
