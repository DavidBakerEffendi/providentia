I took a German friend to The Smith last night and was very pleased with the whole experience.   She loved the vibe and thought the customer service was amazing (which while it was very good customer service coming from a German perspective it would be like night and day compared to how poor the service is in D-Land) We enjoyed the Smith Ale which is brewed in Brooklyn.  A nice wheat style ale with a fruity tang. The Tuna Tartare and the Beer Battered String beans were awesome.  The oysters were very good but one type was quite small,  I can't remember which so ask before hand as $3.00 for a tasty but quarter sized oyster isn't really worth it. I had the Chicken Pot Pie which was huge ( it was nice breakfast this morning) and she had the shrimp entree which to her palate was incredibly rich and creamy. We had a sample of the cocktails, I had the Lavender Sidecar which was just lovely and she had her 1st Midtown Manhattan which she really liked. All in all a great evening and I highly recommend The Smith.
