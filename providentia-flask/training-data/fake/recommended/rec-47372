Love this place. It's a good date-restaurant, nice atmosphere, although, once it fills up you feel kind of like you are on a double-date with the neighboring table. Definitely an awkward table-moving squeeze to get out. However, the food was fantastic - and the wait staff was really helpful in making decisions (she didn't even make fun of me when I couldn't pronounce the menu items). I also heard Tom Brady and Giselle have been spotted there and if it's good enough for Tom... I'm in.
