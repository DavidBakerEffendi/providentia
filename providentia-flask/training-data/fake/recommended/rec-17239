Wow.  I was really surprised.  We went with another couple.  We got 4 different appetizers and 4 different main dishes, and 2 desserts. The crawfish cakes were unbelieveable.  I really mean amazing.  The others loved their salads, soup (some kind of chowder mix) and oysters (a variety).  We all were so impressed. Then, my fish.  I had the Suzuki Mulloway.  I did not want the sauce it came with and the chef made another sauce that was great.  My wife had the scallops and she stated: "These may be the best I ever had."  The other couple had a shrimp dish and Etoufee.  They also said great things about their dishes. The desserts were disappointing.  My lava cake had no lava.  The key lime pie tasted a little funny. The service was outstanding.  Our waitress was friendly, helpful, etc., etc. It was an hour drive, but well worth the trip.
