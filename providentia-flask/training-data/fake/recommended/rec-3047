Best delivery Chinese I've found in New Haven. I went a bit safe with my order, and everything was very tasty. Fried rice seemed like homemade -- not too oily or salty, and no weird coloring. Chicken Chow Fun was fat noodles with a good variety of veggies and a dark sauce. Crab Rangoon had a ton of crab! Delivery came fast.
