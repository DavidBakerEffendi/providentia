Great spot! Casual atmosphere with exceptional dishes and pizza.  My girlfriend and I pull off a dinner for 2  in the $40 to $70 range depending on drinks.  Sadly, booze costs.  Food here is great.  Glad to see this place is being more recognized for their outstanding products and great service.  Not so stoked that i will have to be needing reservations on the regular.  Damn you philly Inquirer. Go here, try everything because you can't go wrong.  From a table for two to a farm table that can handle a large party they can accommodate.  Awesome waterfront outdoor seating on the patio when the weather complies. Plenty of parking. Go to meal: Insalata-Beet Panzanella or Burrata Caprese.   Antipasti- Pepperonata.   Pizza- Margherita add prosciutto. But, come on. Everything is great at In Riva.
