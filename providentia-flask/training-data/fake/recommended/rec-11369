I remember people like Tanner S. - maybe it was actually him. Grouches that seemed like they were wasted off of one Mary each. Some people are simply never going to be happy with anything. It's the policy of many restaurants not to seat until the full party is there, because people often lie about how soon the missing party will arrive, or lie about what they plan on ordering, etc, etc. I know that N. 3rd is packed for brunch, so get over having to wait. You ain't that cool. And, if the server drops off the check (WITH your credit card inside, after you've already paid for the meal), it's your own responsibility to open up the checkbook (gasp) and sign the bill and tip accordingly. If you're too engrossed in whatever amazing discussion you are having amongst yourselves to even hear the server say "thanks so much guys, have a great day", Â it's best not to blame the server that has 9 other tables of people that aren't snots like you. Standard policy also is to apply gratuity for people that leave their unsigned credit card slips AND card. North Third is great. Great food, great people, great atmosphere. North Third loves it's customers and we love Notrh Third back. Glad to hear the likes of Tanner S. won't be back. Save room for the lovely people that make this spot the great place it is.
