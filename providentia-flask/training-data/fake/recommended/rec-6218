One of the cheapest option in Chinatown! 4 dumplings for $1! You can get pretty full with just $5! There's a few tables for people to sit and a place for you to stand to eat. If it's not packed, the food comes out pretty fast. This place use to be a lot better before it became so popular. Must try - Chive and pork fried dumplings and the Sesame Pancake with peking duck.....yummy!
