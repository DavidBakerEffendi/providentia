For dinner, we got the patatas bravas, croquetas de jamon and croqueta del dia, lamb skewers and squid in ink. The squid was definitely the stand-out dish. We couldn't get enough of it. I also enjoyed the croqueta del dia which was with piquillo peppers. The lamb was tender and tasty too. Â On the downside, I didn't enjoy the patatas bravas because they were too heavily drenched with mayonnaise. Since we had a reservation, we were seated in the back room which has two communal tables and seats with backs. I don't think the dining experience would be as relaxing if I had to sit on a stool, but the back room was lovely. My friend was running late and they were nice about not giving our table away. They recommend 4-6 tapas per person and our meal was around $30 per person. I'll definitely be coming back!
