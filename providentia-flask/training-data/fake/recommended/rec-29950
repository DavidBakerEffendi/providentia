All I can say is Wow! I was really impressed with this wine bar. I was in the upstairs section with my miditto wine group. It was very warm and cozy. I tried 3 different wines yesterday evening. My favorite was the Riesling. I also enjoyed the Grenache, a red wine, which I was told is not on the menu. It was very smooth, fruity and light which is why I liked it. For my meal I had a cold plate of the Truffle Deviled Egg and I also had an opportunity to sample the Phyllo cheese rolls which were yummy! This Midtown location was great and I'm interested in trying out the others.
