I love this place. My boyfriend and I stumbled in on accident and we were very happy we did. There are so many places to eat in the city that it takes something special to make it memorable. They have a great spin on Mexican food and though they do have a dinner menu we prefer to choose from the tapas and ceviche menu. They serve plantains with the tortilla chips, yum. Lobster quesadillas, yum, yum. Great mojitos and margaritas too! yucabarnyc.com
