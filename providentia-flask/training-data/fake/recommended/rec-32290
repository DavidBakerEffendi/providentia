The Price. I heeded Yelp's advice and went at lunch time when the meats were the same but the price was substantially lower.  What I conveniently ignored however was the fact that the restaurant is "not good for children."  I mean 2 adults and 2 kids that eat like adults at an upscale meat buffet for 80ish bucks?  One kid (under 5) eats for free?  Hah? I'm in.   The service. It's impeccable.  I would say though if you're looking for quiet conversation then head elsewhere because it borders on over attentive here.  Towards the end of our lunch the damn card was red and the gauchos still kept bringing out food.  I tried to decline one guy and he said "But you request."...he made me eat the meat.  I began hiding bits of food on my plate like a scared child.  Who does that? *raises hand* The food. The stars for me were the chicken legs, the ribs, and the picanha.  The fillet Mignon was meh.  The rib eye, alcatra, and frildanha were also tasty.  Couldn't bring myself to eat Mary's little lamb so no comment on that.The cheese bread was gross IMO.  In fact their entire lineup of sides could use an overhaul.  I wasn't there for that though so I'm not deducting stars based upon that observation. The tips.  Visit at lunch and save money.  Drink tap water instead of the overpriced bottled water and tiny bottled sodas.   Don't load your plate up with a bunch of stuff at a time.  Otherwise you'll end up loving something but not be able to identify what it is.  Go hungry! Oh, and your kids WILL embarrass you.
