IRAISHIMASE!!!!! I am welcomed to this boisterous, underground cave where men and women down sake, beer and Japanese finger food all night long. Their yakitori menu wasn't as extensive as their competitors like Taisho and Kenka. I was happy with their 2 sets but wish they could put a bit more on the plate. The okonomiyaki was a bit doughy and it lacked the texture and a few other ingredients that makes it delicious, it almost tasted like frozen food. But I still enjoyed this place. The atmosphere was lively and the servers were quick and friendly. They carry Yebistsu, a brand of Japanese beer that hasn't made mainstream yet in most izakayas, so I was happy to try. It is located in the heart of midtown which is a good move, sometimes it's just too troublesome to travel all the way downtown. If I am in the hood; which is always, I will return to give it another try.
