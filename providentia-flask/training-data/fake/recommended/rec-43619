We were visiting from the Bay Area and our tour guide reminded us to visit Grimaldi's. It was totally on our agenda since we first discovered Grimaldi's in Scottsdale. We were a little disappointed by the pizza here though. The one in Scottsdale was so much better. We went on a Tuesday afternoon and it was 30 minute wait at around 3pm. We even heard people leave the restaurant and say "over-rated". Once we finally got in, the staff seemed pretty miserable. Our waiter was not friendly at all but the service was ok. Â The pizza selection in Scottsdale was so much better.
