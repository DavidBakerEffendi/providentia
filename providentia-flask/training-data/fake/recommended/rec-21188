Had a really nice dinner at Perilla - it has a very elegant but casual and friendly atmosphere with excellent service and fantastic food. We had the requisite duck meatballs and calamari salad - they didn't disappoint. I also had the hangar steak based on the recommendations here - it was cooked perfectly and the sauce was very tasty, although I don't think I'd rave quite as much as others do. But in all, it was a very nice experience and I would definitely recommend Perilla - especially for the price.
