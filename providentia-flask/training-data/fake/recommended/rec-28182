Finally, I found good BBQ in NYC. I'm from Florida originally and I've been searching for good BBQ here for the last 4 years. Why it's taken this long is beyond me. I'm a big fan of Carolina BBQ and Kansas City style... not a big fan of Texas BBQ. I ordered from Butcher Bar last night on Seamless. Wow. Pulled Pork sandwich with a side of their baked beans. Boom goes the dynamite. The pork was perfect and the sauce was incredible. I can't describe how happy I am that I live just 4 blocks from this place. If you like good BBQ, I urge you to try this place out.
