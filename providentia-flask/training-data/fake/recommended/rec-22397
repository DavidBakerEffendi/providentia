Tried their lunch buffet today after reviewing Yelp reviews. It's definitely a hole in the wall type like a previous reviewer mentioned. The dining room is pretty clean which was nice. Buffet spread is not much to comment about although the food tasted good. They had two meat dishes, one appetizer and I believe 2 veggie curries. I guess that will be similar to a nice home cooked meal. We did enjoy the south indian style chicken curry. I wish they had more meat cuts (like thighs and breasts) in the tandoori. Just drumsticks. Will we go there again.....maybe. I am still hoping to find a better Indian restaurant in the area (Coromandel within stone's throw away from this place is pretty decent and comparable to this one).
