Great ambiance, with beautiful huge chandelier in the middle of the place. The food though was underwhelming. A rather plain tasting papaya salad.   It looked great but really needed a tastier, tangier dressing. The ginger chicken entree again lacked any ginger flavor.   Curry dish was good, but not as good/flavorful as other places on 9th avenue. Rice was served in cute little heart shapes.  Loved that.  And their lunch special prices.
