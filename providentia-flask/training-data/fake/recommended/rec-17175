Pizza taste is somewhere between a good New York style and one of those "fast food" pizza joints. I rate the taste a B. The atmosphere was very lacking. I thought I walked into the wrong place. No pizza in sight.. Just empty tables and a counter. Dimly lit, too - it was strange. They had slices available but they hidden away in the oven... It was an uncomfortable conversation with the three gentlemen behind the counter. All not sure what they should be doing and almost frantically reacting to my questions.
