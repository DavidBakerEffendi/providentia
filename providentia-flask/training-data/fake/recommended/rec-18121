TL;DR - they have cheese steak spring rolls. I'm from out of town however Ten Stone is just a hop skip away from my sister's place. I came here with my girlfriend and my sister in tow. It has nice open seating along with tables outside for those that want to breathe in the "fresh" philadelphia air. The tables inside weren't packed together so it felt like you actually had some space to yourself - a nice change for once. I ordered their ten stone burger. It comes with bacon, mushrooms, and jack cheese. I also requested a side of peanut butter as well. I substituted a side salad for the usual fries. It was ordered as medium done. The girlfriend ordered the tuna salad and my sister got the fish tacos. I was impressed with the food that came out! Was not expecting that for bar food. My burger was big and thick. A real sizable patty, almost an inch thick in places. It came served on a nice puffy kaiser roll. The only negative in the whole burger was that it came a bit under done. Under done can be ok for thin patties; it doesn't fly well for thick ones. The side salad though was GREAT! Real salad greens, none of that iceberg lettuce crap. Also came with bits of chopped cucumbers and tomatoes. Wasn't expecting a "side" salad like this. Girlfriend's tuna salad came with a large tuna steak cooked perfectly (seared on the outside, pink in the middle) on a bed of spinach greens and other veggies. Very good! The sister really likes the fish tacos and orders those consistently. I think more important than all of the above - they have cheese steak spring rolls. That's right. CHEESE STEAK SPRING ROLLS. Yes, they are as good as they sound. GET THEM.
