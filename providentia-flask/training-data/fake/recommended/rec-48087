Like others before said, get an appetizer. The entree portions aren't really that small...they're just right. I came in wanting to try the Boar/Pasta/Chocolate signature dish as suggested here, but when I asked, it was removed from the menu. Instead, I had the Penne with prosciutto which was excellent. You could definitely tell they make their own pasta. Our server suggested the 2005 Valpolicella pairing with the Penne. A friend had a glass of 2004 Di Gino. Both wines were great. Ambience of the place is great...even the door that has difficulty shutting properly scraping along the floor. The servers and people working there joked that it would be fixed, but I think it's fine and adds character to the place.
