Excellent experience! My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday night with reservations. They were packed, but say us right away. The two top was a little cramped but it's a french bistro, whatya expect? The Christmas decorations were beautiful, really set a wonderful tone for the evening. I ordered the lamb shank. It was HEAVEN. Braised to perfection. The man ordered the filet mignon- a perfect medium rare. Wines are totally reasonable, $10 glasses. Such a great spot for a date night. Absolutely will return as often as I can.
