Great addition to the hood. Very cleaver eats.  I ate this spot before the liquor license and the gentri-patrons. I was lucky have the opportunity to taste the majority of this menu before word got out. At that time the foie doughnut was on point, the duck with the kiwi sauce was dope in addition to the District 9 (prawns).    I recently went back and had a great Mackerel dish.  Unfortunately the octo-taco was flavorless and was confirmed by the couple sitting next to me. No matter.  After a couple of house cocktails it was all good. I dig what these guys are doing here and i welcome them to the neighborhood.
