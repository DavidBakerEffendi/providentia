Oh, how I missed late night runs to the taco truck in my native Los Angeles, but Brooklyn you've managed to spoiled me yet again.   Best tacos I've had anywhere in NYC and this is coming from a girl who was raised on them and has incredibly discriminating taste when it comes to Mexican food.  My favorites are the Tacos Al Pastor, Tacos de Lengua.  I've tried all of the meats and the compas keep it real.  Wash it all down with a Jarritos or Sangria (Senoral).  Hijole! Wish they had more on their menu but it's definitely worth the trip and the $1.50 per taco.
