Friendly, fast, phenomenal service.  Very tasty Mediterranean fare.  Blockbuster affordability. My wife and I dined here for a 3rd wedding anniversary and could not have had a more romantic or special evening.  We were seated ahead of a waiting crowd when we told the host that we were out for an occasion.  The grilled radicchio is out of this world and great to share.  The portobello special, fried artichokes, and eggplant all looked first rate from where I was sitting by the window.  Oh yeah, the house comp.ed us tall glasses of sparkling white wine that could only have come from Sonoma County, CA.  The Pinot Grigio I ponied up four bucks to help wash down the fish was well balanced and not over oaked. The better half ordered the tagliolini with fruit of the sea.  The pasta was homemade and was therefore slightly al dente; both the pasta and the sauce had excellent flavors and a perfect amount of very fresh basil.  Yours truly had the brodetto stew and it was spot on.  The broth and baguette long cut croutons went great with the wine.  Every protein was clean and cooked perfectly in both dishes. Neither of us could finish the giant portions dished up at this NoHo gem.  Great for a night out for a couple but there were strollers being rolled about too.  We will unquestionable return.  Note that credit cards are not accepted, you must bring cash.  Check these links for pics of the meal: img682.imageshack.us/img… img580.imageshack.us/img… img821.imageshack.us/img…
