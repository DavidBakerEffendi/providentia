Came here for brunch after watching the NY marathon.. Bottomless boozy brunch!! $9 unlimited mimosas or bloody marys. They don't have their fried burgers on the brunch menu, but you can still order it. Unfortunately, it was too early for me to eat a fried burger so I got the german hash. Got sufficiently buzzed & food was good = successful boozy brunch. Returning in the near future to try their signature fried burger.
