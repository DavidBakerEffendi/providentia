Tried this restaurant during the Fall 2014 restaurant week and enjoyed everything. Our party of 7 dropped to a party of three but we're quickly accommodated with new seating. They put your bottle of wine in ice on your table so it's chilled when you are ready for it. Everything from the appetizer to dessert was delicious. The delivery of our food was timely, our server was pleasant, and the venue is very cozy. So I would return.
