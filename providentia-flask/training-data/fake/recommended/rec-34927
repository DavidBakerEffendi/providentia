Overall the place is finally something different in little India. Fusion and traditional food with good ambience and music. It's perfect for groups and there were many large tables while we were there. The food is about a 7 / 10 . Large menu with Chinese, Thai and indian items. My Favorites were Ginger Chili Tofu, Paneer thandoor and veg spring rolls. Did not enjoy the Tom Yum soup and although not too bad the veg dumplings seemed made from frozen . Staff was nice. My only advice to the restaurant is to focus on quality and don't cut corners. We will be back!
