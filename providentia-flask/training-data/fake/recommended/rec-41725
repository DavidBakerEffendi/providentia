Get better vegetarian options! It's truly not hard to make great veggie ramen. The have one veggie bowl and the waiter admitted it is pretty bad...plus it's smaller than the meat based ramen and yet more expensive ($18)! Plus they force you to have gluten free noodles (rice) if you get the veggie one. Â Well what if I want regular, delicious noodles with my veggie ramen instead of gluten free? Seems it wouldn't be too hard to make this customizable options for customers. Do yourself a favor and go to Totto around the corner instead!
