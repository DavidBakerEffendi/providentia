Came here Friday night after bar hoping and I was very pleased with the food and drinks. I really like that the bar and resturant was separated and that the resturant area looked like a retro diner theme. I got the Cesar Grilled Chicken Salad and fried calamari with their spicy mayo sauce. It was really satisfying for a late night snack and great for two people to share!
