The ambience was great, little noise level and unfortunately they ran out of pork chops by the time of my arrival. I'm a G but in hearing the news I cried real thug tears.  However, that didn't stop the show. I had the seared black sea bass, fennel and potato hash, salsa verde accompanied by a three headed sangria. So good!! I also had samples of the roasted half chicken, cole slaw, smashed potatoes and onion CRÈME FRAÎCHE so good stomach joy.
