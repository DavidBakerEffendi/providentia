Yes, there is a huge chandelier in the room. With expectations managed (thanks to fellow Yelp reviews), dinner at Room Service was a pleasant experience.  We had a 7 o'clock reservation and they insisted on everyone being present before seating us, which is understandable.  When everyone arrived, about 10 minutes later, the hostess competently seated us within a few minutes.  We sat all the way in the back, the restaurant is surprisingly long. They had many selections on the menu; most offerings were pretty standard and some creative choices as well.  We ordered the tempura calamari, the flank steak, and chicken satay as appetizers, and had the pad see-ew, lar nard, squid ink spaghetti, and red snapper.  Nothing was especially memorable; all 5 of us were full after the meal.  They don't take reservations for small parties, and I wouldn't linger around to wait for a table - there are plenty of options for Thai in the area. Best part of the meal was the iced honey green tea with lychee juice ($4).  This was refreshing, delightful, and not too sweet. Room Service is loud, not conducive for dates or an outing where you want to carry on a normal conversation but is fine for a small group outing.
