Dinner at Cookshop = One of the Best Meals Ever. You wil NOT be disappointed. We made a reservation for 11pm (which gave us the perfect amount of time to see a show, get a cab, and make our way to Chelsea on a Friday night.) They treated us like royalty and made wonderful food recommendations. The rabbit liver is INCREDIBLE and the wine list is lovely. We will definitely be returning to Cookshop in the near future!
