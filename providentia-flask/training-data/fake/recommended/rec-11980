Went here last night and had the Totto Chicken Ramen (Chicken base broth with sliced pork) / added seasoned avocado and egg. The chicken broth is so good! The avocado was so good but the egg was kinda bland but cooked to perfection. I truly enjoyed the ramen. We got there at 6:30 and it was packed. When we left there was a line to get in. It is really hot in there if you are at the bar. I will definitely go back!
