This is the best roast beef sandwich that I've ever had and will likely ever have.  It was knee-bucklingly good.  The gravy fries were ridiculous.  I've never eaten anything like them before.  I wish I got two orders, but I had to save room for the roast pork sandwich that I split with my friend, which was also delicious.  The place is a complete dive, but who cares?  The bar is very small, but it doesnt matter.  I cant believe it took me 28 years to get to this place, but I am sure glad that I went.  It is a slice of old school philadelphia.  I can't wait to go back.
