my first time here and CANNOT STOP RAVING about the generous and courteous waiter and ambience! I ordered the Tunisian Eggs and they were absolutely DELISH- pita cooked to perfection and my friend ordered the Middle Eastern eggs and gobbled the whole thing up. DESSERT WAS ON THE HOUSE. We had the gelato and sorbet combo: bloody orange, vanilla and blackberry cabarnet- so so tasty.Couldn't have been a better brunch. Thank you!
