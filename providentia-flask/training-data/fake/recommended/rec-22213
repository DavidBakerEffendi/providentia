Very cool place. Crowd's neat, with lots of different types of people hanging out. Bartender is friendly but not over friendly. As everybody else already mentioned, fries are good, but their dipping sauces are truly impressive. I've never seen so many different kinds of sauces offered for fries. I liked their Samurai sauce, which was full of spice and Â kick! My husband liked the Curry sauce. I guess all that fat is good for soaking up beer to make a great combo.
