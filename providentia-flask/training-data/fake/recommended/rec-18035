Service was friendly, and the server had recommended the huevos rancheros for my friend which she seemed to enjoy. I ordered the shrimp n grits with fried egg + pork belly. Deliciousness in my mouth! The grits were creamy, cheesy as they should be. The egg was cooked perfectly so all the gooey-ness dripped into my grits. The pork belly was nice and crispy and added an additional texture to the dish. YUMM-O. Would definitely return to try other items if I was in the neighborhood! :)
