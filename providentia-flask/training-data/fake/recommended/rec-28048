It was exactly what I was looking for -- a chill, cozy little place to grab dinner without breaking the bank. The food was delicious. I had the Mushroom pasta. A good chunk of the menu was dedicated to vegetarians. I also had the tiramisu for dessert. It was delectable. Our server was lovely and attentive. The food came out quickly, and we weren't rushed out. Enjoyed it very much.
