Dinner menu review only - menu choices were complicated, portions were MINUSCULE ( other reviewers called them "dainty"), service was a bit confusing. Our waitress was very nice and the beer selection was fine but if you go there with a hearty appetite for dinner thinking that the menu will be similar to the lunch menu (ie. great creative sandwiches, burgers, funky and tasty sides, excellent choices of satisfying portions & reasonable prices) you would be sadly disappointed. I felt that the dinner menu was very limited.  Our waitress said that two people usually order 6 or 7 plates to share. That surprised me a bit because at $8 for a bread and butter plate and other choices between $14 to $18 a plate that would mean dinner for two and a few beers would be nearly $175. When you leave hungry and both have to get a slice of pizza - that's a concern. The food came out one plate at a time - forcing two adult men into sharing a $12 bay scallop crudo  ( 4 spoonfuls each!) an $11 squash salad  (3 spoonfuls each ) a $16 butterfish entree ( three fork fulls each) and a rabbit plate that was tasty but was not what I had imagined $16.  Not surprising - the taste and quality of food was very well done and the chefs clearly know what they are doing and are very creative - but to have such different experiences between lunch (5 stars) and dinner (1 star) I think is a problem. I guess we could have ordered the $32 fried chicken (for two) but I wanted to hope that my previous lunch experiences would be duplicated at dinner.  I can only imagine that all of the five star reviews are talking about their lunch experience. I do not disagree with giving them 5 stars for lunch, but they need to rethink their strategy for dinner before I would ever think of returning for that.
