Rangoon serves fantastic, flavorful, amazing Burmese food with impeccable service! I have nothing but fondness for that place and have been quite a few times. The thousand-layer bread with potato curry dip = blows my mind! Reminds me of homemade roti yum! Also a must-try is the tea leaf salad! I usually end up getting the pork in mango curry ... and then all of my friends end up eating from what i get haha. Another nice touch -- the communal feel of having a big bowl or bowls of rice at the table. Will continue to go back again and again!
