Perfect Japanese dining experience. Food and service were excellent. The atmosphere is a little spartan, otherwise Ginza would have 5 stars. They have changed the space so the hibachi is now cooked in the kitchen; no longer at your table. But that's OK, since I was served a huge, flavorful dish of salmon and shrimp. My guests also ordered sushi rolls which were also large and fresh. Definitely will go back again!
