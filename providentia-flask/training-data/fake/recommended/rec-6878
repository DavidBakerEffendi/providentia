I hate to do this. I've been a loyal supporter of TMS for years now. Have at least dined in 5+ times and each time I had a blast. But this time...it was different. Put down a name for a party of 6 on Friday night at around 6:30pm. They said it would be a 45-60 minute wait. Having been to TMS plenty of times before, this was no surprise and no big deal. We get it, you're busy. We went back to a friends apartment and had a few drinks to kill time still excited to go eat some delicious balls. Although the hostess informed us she would text us 10 minutes before the table was ready, we walked over after an hour already passed. We arrived at 7:45 (an hour and 15 minutes later) to find out that the table was not ready and that it would take 20 more minutes. Â A little annoyed at this point but we grabbed another quick drink at Arlene's and headed over yet again. Well, the table was STILL not ready and we waited another 15 minutes outside because it was too full inside. Since it was cold, we tried waiting inside and grabbing a drink, but we were told no, its too crowded and we need to wait outside. Ok...? While waiting, our friend had to use the restroom so went inside to wait in line. Well, we saw him quickly exiting and heading next door. Apparently, he was by the one of the servers that he needed to use the restroom at another establishment because he was blocking the servers. Now, 2 hours later when we finally got seated, the server came over to ask if we had any questions about the menu. We did not, but needed time to look over the specials and decide. He came back again, and when we weren't ready to order yet, rolled his eyes.... When our food finally came, it was cold. Overall, a huge disappointment. Gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because the other 5+ times deserve something...right?
