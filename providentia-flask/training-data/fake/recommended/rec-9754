I would really give this place 2.5 stars but there is no such option. This is the second time I've been to Pio Pio. Both times I was lured there by a combination of the good ratings and $$ price listing on yelp. I also like Peruvian food in general. I had forgotten that the place did not live up to the hype. First of all, this place should be $$$. At $26 for a small plate of lomo saltado $$ is just inaccurate. Its by no means cheaper eats. Even if you go for chicken, once you add the sides in the prices go up quite a bit. The place is a bit on the cheesy trendy side. Has a serious B and T vibe. There is a series of smaller tables that go by a bar and then a larger dining room in the basement. The owners should be seriously embarrassed by how many tables they try to cram in. There is almost no space between the tables crammed into the basement so no matter where you get seated, someone is going to be pushing by you the entire time you are dining. Some tables are worse than others. They range from annoying to completely intolerable. The sangria is awful. Ours was served warm with ice cubes in it, just starting to cool it down. Super sweet and syrupy. The beer selection also sucks. The fish cevice was decent but not served with the spices in the description.  I had the lomo saltado both times and its pretty good but overpriced considering everything  else. I have to remember not to go here again next time.
