I love this place. I'm a little bewildered by the bad reviews. Every time I've gone the food and service has been fantastic. I was a bit disappointed when I heard they were no longer going to be BYOB, but the (admittedly cheesy/novelty) Flaming Volcano cocktail I had there yesterday was great, and actually had alcohol in it, which is rare for those type of beverages :) I love the spring rolls, the Nem Nuong was delicious too, perfectly seasoned and great for sharing. I generally get some version of the rice vermicelli, yesterday it was the house special with pork, chicken, meatballs and spring rolls- absolutely my favorite by far. The tofu vermicelli is decent, but the accompanying sauce lacks the punch of the fish sauce and is subsequently a little disappointing if you're expecting tangy and spicy. The Chicken Basil was great too, the bok choy perfectly cooked. I always feel as if everything here is ultra fresh. Our service was great too, fast, attentive, and I left my gloves on the bar (second time I lost a pair in two weeks, I have the short-term memory of a goldfish) and our server came out after us with them. Super great.
