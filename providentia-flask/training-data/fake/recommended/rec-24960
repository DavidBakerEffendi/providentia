I brought my husband here for his bday. I cannot explain how thrilled we both were. The food was EXCELLANT!!!! And I can be very critical but everything was just so tasty and perfect. We ordered the grill octopus and lamb shank followed by shell steak and salmon. Ended with a dessert yet to be on the menu but out of this world, fried mozzarella with strawberries. The chef Julian brought it over himself because we wanted to give our compliments. Very nice atmosphere. Enjoy your meals while watching enormous cargo ships flow by. It was romantic and a great Â night. Def would go back and recommend to others.
