Nice lunch-dinner spot.  I just stopped by there today and had the barbecue corned beef sandwich with gruyere and onions.  OK, not the healthiest meal, but it was delicious.  I also tried the peanut butter -chocolate parfait - a must for anyone who loves this classic combo.   Chill atmosphere and nice, attentive staff.
