Definitely try this halal truck out. You'll love it and will most likely be just as addicted as me. Get mixed with both sauces, which includes rice, chicken, beef, lamb, and lettuce. If you don't eat beef or lamb they have a chicken and rice option. If you're willing to try things, go all out. If you don't like spicy then use the red sauce sparingly. And be careful when your adding the sauces yourself as they also have a red bottle of bbq sauce which I haven't tried but can be disappointing when you think it's hot sauce. Every time I'm in New York I always stop here - as much as I can. So much good food in NY and I always try to have this for dinner at least twice and my latest addition to my NY trips I bring some back with me in tupperware. Lol It's definitely one of the things I look forward to whenever I'm in New York. I've tried to venture out to other trucks, but they don't look the same and they don't give as much as these guys. Now if only I could find one here in SF, I wouldn't have to travel across country for this....
