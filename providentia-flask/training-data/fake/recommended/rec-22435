Just reopened after renovations. Looks nicer but ambience is not what this is about. Food is as great as ever as are prices. Chinese comfort food. Fish slices in congee was so delicious, not fishy smell, just fresh slices of meaty fish fillets in flavored rice porridge and hint of ginger and green onions. I also ordered shrimp cheun fun, steamed cannelloni but rice flour pasta so delicate that it's like a veil. Stuffed with whole shrimp and served with a aromatic soy sauce topping. Hit the spot on a rainy day
