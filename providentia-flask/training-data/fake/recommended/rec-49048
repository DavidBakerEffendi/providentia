We found this place through Yelp, and by golly was this place good. It definitely had a laid-back, quiet ambience to it. (From our feel of the place, it seemed like it was a family-run business, but that's just a guess.) We ordered a short stack of blueberry pancakes (served with toast) and a custom made omelet, and that was plenty for us. The pancakes were quite fluffy, and the omelet was so flavorful. We were able to stuff ourselves full for just $17 for the whole order. Make sure you bring cash and otherwise, bring a big stomach! Can't say anything bad about this place (there's even super convenient, spacious parking lot behind it), so five stars! Looking forward to trying the cinnamon roll pancake next time :) tl;dr Great tasting breakfast food at a cheap price and with friendly service. Will definitely come back for another relaxed brunch in the future!
