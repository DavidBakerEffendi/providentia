Love this place! Whenever we go we always start with the Guacamole which comes with 3 side dips that are delicious. I generally try the enchiladas in particular, and definitely get whichever margarita is on special that day. They are always delicious--i particularly enjoyed a basil-cucumber one I had recently. It was refreshing on a hot day and compliment the bit of kick the food had nicely.
