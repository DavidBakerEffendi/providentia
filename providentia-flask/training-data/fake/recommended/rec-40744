Not much more I could add to the 400+ reviews.  I was a local off and on for 10 years.  Always loved Pats but for logistical reasons started to hit Ishkibbles at the end of my Philly tenure.  After a return trip to Philly, I was slightly disappointed in the Pats steaks my family orrdered.  Seemed to skimp on the meat.  Rolls were not as fresh as they could have been.  Because we were there late on a Sunday morning, and on an Eagles home game Sunday non-the-less, I bumped up from 2.5 to 3 stars.  OK, but not as good as it has been.
