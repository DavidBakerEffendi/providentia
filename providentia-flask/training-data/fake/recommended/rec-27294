Food was surprisingly sophisticated, service excellent.  Branzino with saffron sauce - delicious and the sauce was layered and complex, like it would be in a WAY more expensive and formal restaurant.  Hamachi crudo and foie gras torchon - both, again, disproportionately refined for a little informal spot on West 12th Street.  Portions perhaps a bit small, but fine for me - for a big strapping guy, maybe you need to go to Mighty Quinn.  They have a nice little wine list, attentive host and waiters.   Small and cozy.  I would go back in a heartbeat.
