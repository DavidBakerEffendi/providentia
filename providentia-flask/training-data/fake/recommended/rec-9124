This is hands down my favorite restaurant ever. The wait can be long sometimes but it is well worth it.  The menu is changing every day to accomodate what's fresh, and I've never had a meal that was anything less than one of my best meals ever.  Can never resist the french fries, dare I say they are the best I've ever had?  And that's coming from a french fry snob... The pork chop, when they have it, is always amazing no matter how it's prepared.  And the cheeseburger, which you can get every day, is my favorite burger in NYC.  Brunch is fabulous, dinner is wonderful, by far my favorite place in Brooklyn. Great place to take foodie out of towners, parents, friends....anyone and everyone. LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.
