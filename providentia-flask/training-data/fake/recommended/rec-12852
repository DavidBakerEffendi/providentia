food: this is one of my favorite places to eat in new york. i have dreams about it and wake up craving it i had the shabu shabu dinner course with prime ribeye and ribeye. next time i'll just order 2 orders of prime ribeye - it's so freaking juicy and tasty it comes with rice, vegetables, and ice cream. perfectly portioned for 2 people comfort: waited only 10 mins on a saturday night, table was spacious, romantic atmosphere for a date, and the bathroom is clean.
