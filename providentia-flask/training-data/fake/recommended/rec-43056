Wandered in as a walk-in with my boyfriend around 8:30 last Saturday night. The adorable hostess told us about 20 minutes (ended up being 30-35) and to grab a drink next door at barfly. Two drinks later she called and we went back and she gave us some yummy tomato bread to snack on while the couple leaving us their spot paid the bill. Food was INCREDIBLE. I'm salivating thinking of the gnocci with shortribs--wasn't too heavy and shortribs deliciously tender--and my boyfriends bacon-wrapped scallops were also wonderful. He had lamb shank which comes with gratin potatoes that are so out of this world that I devoured most of them off his plate, and I had the flank steak which was generously sized and perfectly cooked. Great wine list too. We sat at the bar which I actually preferred. It's cozy on a windy winter night...
