This place is awesome. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I feel I need to explore more of the menu before committing to an "As Good As It Gets!" rating. We went there late night (after midnight) on a Saturday, so we didn't have to wait more than a few minutes for a table.  Our waitress was nice and really helpful, especially since they were out of a lot of the menu. We pieced together two dishes - Spicy pork meatballs with spicy meat sauce on polenta.. this was ridiculously good and the polenta added some unique texture - Beef meatballs with spicy sauce on rigatoni.. which was also ridiculously good. They should be given an award for attention to detail. The pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente even at 2am. The menu is easy to navigate and you can create many unique combinations of meatballs with pastas or on sliders etc. The interior has a nice warm feel to it, and the music they were playing was lively and added to the ambiance. I am definitely returning to try out the sliders and more of the menu.. and especially the build-your-own-ice-cream-sandwich desert. !!! Great date spot, but I've heard if you show up at peak times there can be a significant wait.  Probably not good for very large groups unless you can secure a reservation.  Also, the prices are very reasonable for the quality of food and ambiance.
