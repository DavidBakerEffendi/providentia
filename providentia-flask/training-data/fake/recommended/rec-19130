Mmmmm. Penelope's. Is. Good.  Good eats.  Good peeps.  Good vibes. The service is among the friendliest in the city I must say.  It's a small little spot but the food is oh so worth it!  We even tricked some of our "hardcore" boys into falling in love with this place as well.  They do the take-out so they don't lose their "image", if you will.  This has become the "get-together" spot for me and my girls. Our favorites include the "When Harry Met Sally" salad (bits of veggie burger, goat cheese, etc etc)--yum! A must order for me is the spinach-artichoke dip and if I'm feeling dangerous their macaroni and cheese. But honestly, you can't go wrong with anything you order. Go for the whole package and order a glass of wine while you're at it as well! They have a lovely selection. Oh! And did I mention their fabulous brunch?!??!
