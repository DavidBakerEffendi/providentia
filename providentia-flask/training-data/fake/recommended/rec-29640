This was another stop along the Insomnia Tour (my birthday in NYC). Amy Ruth's is so cute inside...I love the murals on the wall!!!! Great service....really good food, I enjoyed something from just about everyone's plate, salmon patties, catfish, greens, cornbread, mac & cheese....oh and red kool-aid! Ya just gotta try it!
