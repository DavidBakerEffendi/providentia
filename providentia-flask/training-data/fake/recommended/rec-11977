I really wanted to like this place. The decor is cute, and the menu seemed like they put a lot of thought in it. The cornbread was very yummy...and I am not much of a cornbread person, so maybe I am not qualified to judge. My husband, though is southern and really went to town on it. I ordered the polenta with baked eggs. Okay, full disclosure, I don't like my eggs undercooked. I like them with a well cooked yolk. That said I can eat them with the yolk a little runny like most restaurants serve them at brunch. I don't LOVE them that way, but I will eat them that way from time to time. I forgot to ask that the eggs be well cooked but since I can deal with medium cooked eggs I didn't bother to change the order with the waitress - I fully expected them to have runny yolks. But these eggs were beyond runny. The egg was so undercooked white part was still clear and gelatinous on top and it smelled like a raw egg. It takes a lot to turn my stomach but that certainly did. The blood orange mimosa was just alright. It felt like it was trying too hard - if a mimosa can try too hard- I would have expected it to taste a little more blood-orangey. My husband ordered the corned beef hash. I had a nibble and it was good. I will say the lady next to me was enjoying her mean tremendously. She ordered two entrees and seemed to enjoy them both. At least she finished them both - but that may be because she was pregnant. It's not a fun brunch place. It's cute and quiet. Its for civilized brunchers so not really my scene as a brunch place. I would go there if my parents are in town, but not with my friends for raucous afternoon fun.
