Wow! A few friends brought me here late one Friday night before going out.  Let me just say, this is one of my favorite places to grab a burger before heading in the west village area.  The restaurant and bar area are very small but the beer and food are cheap and delicious.  I'm talking about $3 bud drafts and I believe $8 for the bistro burger complete with bacon and cheese.  We waited about 35 minutes after putting our name on the list but the cheap beers made the wait go by fast.   Overall, I really enjoyed my experience here and would be glad to take an out of town friend here for a NYC experience.   Tip - They take cash only!  There is a Chase ATM a few blocks away.
