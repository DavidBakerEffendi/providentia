Terroir Tribeca is a lively wine bar with an excellent wine selection. Their menu is extensive with wine from many obscure regions and whimsical descriptions of some. Most of their wines can be had by the half glass for just a tad over 50 percent of the price of a whole glass. A lot of those half glasses can be had for between $5 and $10. Pick a bunch of different ones and do your own wine tasting. They offer a free glass of wine for people who arrive before 6pm. How cool is that?
