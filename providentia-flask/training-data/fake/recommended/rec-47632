Stopped here for brunch and a bite to eat after my hair appointment - what an adorable little hidden gem! I had a breakfast crepe with ham, Swiss and a runny egg- absolutely superb! And cheap, too. I really loved that the barista knew how to make a super frothy cappuccino too- so many places fuck them up and make a latte. Brownie points! I will definitely be back, and next time for a croissant!
