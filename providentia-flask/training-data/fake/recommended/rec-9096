I really wanted to like this place, I was so excited to go. Dragged my hubby all the way from  Rockland County  to eat mediocre food.  The fried oysters were really good, but after that , all I can say is "Meh".  The hangar steak was a pathetic  cut of meat, more mushrooms than steak. I had the skate fish which was literally   pan seared fist  plopped on top of  little diced potatoes and overcooked shrimp. It had these capers thrown carelessly on top. Who ever made this dish had no enthusiasm to make it. Last but least. the creme brulee. Totally  forgettable.  I still have hope for La Sirene which I'm quite excited to try ...
