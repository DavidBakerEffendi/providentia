The donuts are awesome and the cookies are to die for.   My favorite is the chocolate donut and my fav cookie is the ginger flavored. I have 2 fav dishes the rob Evans (biscuit with sausage gravy egg and cheese) it's Very hard to find good sausage gravy this side of the mason Dixon lol The chicken biscuit is something I can eat everyday literally!!  I MEAN LITERALLY!! Only thing that disappointed me a little was the fried chicken you can't choose your pieces and I have had better.   This is a must if your in BROOKLYN THE BEST BORO IN THE CITY
