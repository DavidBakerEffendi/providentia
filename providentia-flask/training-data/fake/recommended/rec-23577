Talk about a hidden gem - not only is this place tucked away in a strip mall, but it's not very well marked so you must either be in the know or a yelper to find this great little cafe! Had breakfast here my last morning visiting in VT and boy was it hard to choose from the wide selection of offerings. From fresh baked pastries, to french toast topped with Vermont maple syrup, to breakfast paninis the possibilities were endless! After much internal struggle I settled on an egg frittata with mushrooms and spinach, plus a chocolate croissant for dessert. What, doesn't everyone have dessert after breakfast? The frittata came out piping hot and perfectly cooked, while the the chocolate croissant was light, buttery and had the just right ratio of chocolate to bread. One standout worth mentioning is the coffee is self-serve, and I was delighted to see that they had iced coffee at the ready! How awesome is that? No need to melt glasses and glasses of ice to cool down hot coffee here, they've got brewed coffee cooled and on tap. In an attempt to try and sample as much as possible from the bakery I also picked up a house made energy bar that was chock full of nuts, raisins, dates, coconut, carrots and the kitchen sink...it was sooo good and the perfect healthy snack to en route back to California. Oh, did I mention that it's only 10 minutes to BTV airport? Which makes it the best place to stop for either breakfast or lunch before flying out - save yourself bad airport food and eat here!
