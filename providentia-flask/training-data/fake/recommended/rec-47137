Whats not to like about bacon? :/) So we came to NYC for a day and needed a quick bite and stumbled upon this place, bar atmosphere, plenty of tv's and NFL on     Ordrered the bacon sampler flight with beers to start   Comes with 2 slices each of 4 different types of bacon    The jalapeno was definitely my fav     Also had a brussel sprouts dish with pork belly bits and greek yogurt    Sounds odd but wa actually quite good   My wife had a bacon chili that was good but spicy     I had the bacon burger that comes in a grilled pretzel bun, so good     Nice place
