You can tag up the walls, has the best bathroom graffiti I've ever seen, Â they manage to play the Notorious BIG each time I come (which was pretty constant this past summer), $1 PBR deals, $4 mixed drinks and plus opportunitites to do arts and crafts while wasted? SPLENDID! The prices are comfortable, bartenders are cool, and you meet a miscellany of interesting people each time. I've come here with different crowds and no one feels out of place. For the record, you can smoke in the back. Bring a sharpie with you and profess your love or hate for someone on the wall.
