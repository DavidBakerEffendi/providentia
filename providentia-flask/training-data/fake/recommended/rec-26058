This is absolutely my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn-   I go here whenever I can.  I will deliberately not buy groceries for dinner if I think there's a chance I may end up here instead.  I would trade a week vacation for a week of work with dinners here.  I can't even really explain it.   Let's just say this.  La Seguin:  Goat cheese, bacon, swiss, cream, chives, whatever else, in a thin buckwheat crepe.  mmmm. Every crepe here is good and I've tried at least 10.  Super sweet staff, very charming vibe, great for a date,  nice outdoor seating if the weather is good- right on the sidewalk of a quiet street.   Affordable at about $15 per person with a drink.  Nice place for brunch! The best.
