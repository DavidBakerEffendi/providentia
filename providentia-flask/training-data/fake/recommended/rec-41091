Great food but lackluster service. First of all they need to turn their heat on. Shivering during your meal is not pleasant. Then it took 25 minutes to bring our guacamole. 10 minutes later they brought our appetizers and entrees out at the same time! Â There wasn't even room at our 2 person table for the 3 large plates. There were many waiters wandering out with cleary nothing to do and only 4 tables with people at them. I they get their act together I'd come back again as the food was quite good.
