I cannot say enough about this lillte gem of a restaurant, Â from the start there is Mama, who is by far the most amazing woman and Chef, hands down in NJ. Her restaurant is a pure reflection of her love for family, friends and food. There has not been one meal (and we drive over 2hrs round trip & go there often) that we have had there, that we have EVER had a complain about, everything from the fish, chicken, vegetables and fruits is beyond fresh and absolutely delicious. My favorite is the Crispy Talapia fish, OMGOSH the chili sauce is to die for. Her portions are so generous, that I always have Mama's food for the next day (I actually have containers marked Mama). Now I dont want to forget dessert, her Mango and sticking rice is pure heaven and so are her daughter's cupcakes. We love when Mama comes out and does the ording or surprises us with our meal, the excitement of not knowing combined with the thrill of what she serves makes for a perfect meal and evening. Now I would be remiss if I did not mention her incredible staff, the service is beyond exceptional. I absolutely adore this restaurant and we love Mama and her amazing talent as a Chef and friend!
