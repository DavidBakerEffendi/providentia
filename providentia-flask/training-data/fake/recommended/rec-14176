The thing about rooms that are painted vibrant violet, with big red features slotted in, "hip" accessories and the like, is that you need to change the decor way more than every three years. It's tired. And when a place is more about the decor than the food, then when the decor gets tired the shabbiness of the food really shines through. Thai food in the last couple of years in New York has really begun to step up, unfortunately not at Room Service. The chicken and ginger dish I had was simply lack-luster, chicken so overcooked that it was rubbery and the recommended vegetable dumplings just didn't surprise me. Honestly it is time for a complete makeover - food and decor. In the mean time head down one block to Silom where the equation really does work.
