I really like this place.  The food is delicious.  However, BEWARE! They cut their burritos in half!  I think this is an absurd practice and I've, unfortunately, recently lost half of a burrito due to this.  Once you open the foil wrapper around the burrito, the top half will flop over and wind up on your floor if you are not careful.  I would recommend that they stop this practice immediately, for the sake of all of our top halves.
