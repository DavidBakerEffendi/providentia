I would of have given this place a 2.5 if I could. Went out last night with a few loved ones for drinks at the bar, music and dancing. I had an irish whiskey with ginger ale ($7.50) when I tasted it I felt that it mostly contained ginger ale, so i asked the bartender if he can add a little more whiskey in it and said he can give me a shot for 7 bucks. What an a$$hole, this is after I tipped him 5 bucks. My second drink was a long island iced tea(11 bucks) came in a big glass and was really good. I had ordered another long island(from a different bartender) and this time the bartender made it with a tiny glass and charged me the same as for the big glass. I confronted him about it and he said he ran out of big glasses and can charge me less (9 bucks) so I said whatever. Those guys suck. Dance floor was a good size. Plenty of space for people to dance. But I didn't enjoy the music as much. I like all music but the variety that the DJ put together just quite didn't hit the spot. There were plenty of times the music had the people dancing then the DJ changes it up and everyone stops with a confused look. DJ Legacy has got to read the crowd much better, especially the females. Too much staring, not enough dancing. Security guards were cool. But I will have to say that that was probably my last time going out for drinks and music at NIX
