I enjoyed one of the tastiest meals ever last night at Jones. The atmosphere was inviting. Lots of low lighting and cozy booths. Although we did make reservations, we still had to wait for five minutes. Considering it was dinnertime on New Year's Eve, we didn't mind. The food was on point. By far the tastiest onion rings I have ever had. I loved creating my own salad as I don't like lettuce and was able to get all spinach. My milkshake was creamy and perfect to sip through a straw. I ordered chicken and waffles for my entree. The waffle was good and the chicken was decent. Not the best, but high up there. Our waitress was also wonderful. She kneeled down on the floor so we could hear her over the din of the crowd. She was attentive and served us quickly. Would go back again!
