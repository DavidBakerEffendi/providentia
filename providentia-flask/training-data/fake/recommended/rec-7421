My friends and I tried this place because one of us is severely allergic to gluten and it pitched itself as a gluten free Italian place.  The two stars here are for the service and the ambiance, the food was just mediocre.  We sat outside in the front and the atmosphere was quite nice.  The waitress, although possibly not the most experienced was very nice and attentive.  However when we asked what the gluten free pasta was made of she didn't know.  Not to mention the only gluten free options were spaghetti or penne.  I had the risotto with scallops special.  The scallops were tiny, and incredibly salty, and the risotto was under done.  It wasn't inedible, but I had to force myself to continue taking bites.   Two friends got the short ribs, and one got the pasta mixto.  All felt that their meals were bland and nothing they'd ever order again.  I really wanted to like this place, but probably one of the more disappointing meals I've had in New York in a long time.
