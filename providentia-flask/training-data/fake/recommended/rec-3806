We got dinner from The Meatball Shop on one of those Saturday nights when we were at home, building Ikea furniture, drinking Miller High Life, watching Netflix. I had the veggie balls on salad, he went for meat. I'd heard the buzz and walked by the bursting restaurant many, many times. We decided to not wait for a table and ordered takeout. The place was uncomfortably packed and I hated having to walk to the back and stand awkwardly as I placed my order and then waited for it. The guys were really nice and I didn't feel at all like I was being dismissed, despite how crazy the room felt! Order was up in about 15 minutes and the meatballs were yummy at home. I will say that this is a place where everything is 100% dead-on. It is so trendy and pretty and comfortable. The food is great, it looks great, the bar is perfect. It stinks of cool, which I'm totally not above even a little bit. I love it. Now I have the text message number to make reservations, I'll definitely go back.. maybe at an off-peak hour.
