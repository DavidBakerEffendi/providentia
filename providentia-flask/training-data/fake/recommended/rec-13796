went back recently, eh.. So here's the verdict, I haven't been here in awhile, the pancakes got smaller and it just didn't ooo..and..ahhh me the same way it did during my previous visits.   Me and sister ordered the blueberry pancakes, eggs benedict with smoked salmon and a side of cheesy grits.  I wasn't crazy happy with any of them.  meh.  However, we did go on a weekday when there was no line, which is a good thing.
