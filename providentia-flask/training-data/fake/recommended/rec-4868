The food here is excellent. Although on a hot July night there's not enough AC for a packed establishment and I mean packed. It was extremely rainy and humid for our trip. As in many NY places the tables are on top of each other. We arrived about 5 min before our reservation. They said about 30 min. There was not even a place to squish in standing at the bar. We went outside to wait. I was so hot I could barely enjoy the food. We ordered about everything and it was all good. Â We ate and left asap to go cool off at Off the Wagon. I'm not sure I would go again. I don't like to spend that kind of money and be uncomfortable. and I didn't see Chris Noth.
