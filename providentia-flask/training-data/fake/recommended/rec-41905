Simply Amazing. Go for the $35 Turista prix fixe menu. Totally worth it as they do not skimp on quality or portions. Its the same as if you ordered al la carte. You get to taste your choice if different course and you feel full when you're done. Its a BYO to bring a good wine to enjoy. The complimentary bread is baked on the spot with heirloom yeast from the previous batch and its just so warm and delicious. A bit cramped (at least for me as I'm a big 6'3" 300lber) but ambiance is very warm and romantic for a date night. All in all, a top notch place. Enjoy it!!!
