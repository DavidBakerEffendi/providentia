I've been occasionally going to Black Bamboo for a couple years now. The food is decent and the prices used to be good. They recently changed their menu and pricing. I called ahead for two lunch specials (used to be $5.50, now $6.35) and ordered them by number and by name. Knowing they changed the numbering, the should have caught that when I said L24, Sweet and Sour Chicken, that I was actually ordering Sweet and Sour Chicken, not the new L24- Hunan Chicken... since I said Sweet and Sour Chicken. I didn't have time to go back after returning to the office so I ate what they gave me. I called to let them know people still use older menus and since the number have changed to maybe double check upon ordering since I said the name along with the number. The response I received was, "Oh, we changed those awhile ago." Â That's disappointing. My advice: order by name only
