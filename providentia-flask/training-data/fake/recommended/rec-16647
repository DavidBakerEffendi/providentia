I often order the lunch special from the Room Service in Chelsea, so when they opened one down the block from my apartment in Hell's Kitchen I was excited. The decor is super modern, with seemingly every product from DWR layered around the restaurant. Acrylic "ghost" chairs, cowhide, mirrored walls, chandeliers--the works. The lunch special is an amazing deal- $6 something for a large sized entr√©e and appetizer. However, when I finally tried the Hell's Kitchen location for dinner, I had a terrible experience. It was so super loud, music pumping, that it was more like a club. Apparently other people mistook it for a club, too because there were two couples full-on groping and making out at the bar. Not the most appetizing view when you're eating dinner. And this was before 9pm. I ordered a tom yum with steamed tofu and they brought it with fried tofu. Small mistake, I understand, but the waiter was not even willing to apologize, just simply said, "I never knew there was a difference." Okay.... When my main dish came, it had the wrong protein. I asked them to bring it out with the correct protein and over twenty minutes later I still had no food. My boyfriend had finished his main dish by then. We spent the entire time trying to get the attention of the waiters, but they didn't pay any attention to us at all. When my dish did come, at least 30 minutes had gone by and I was not interested in even eating it anymore I was so annoyed. After screwing up both dishes, they still didn't apologize or even take anything off the bill! Annoying!! Needless to say the only reason that I'm still giving 3 stars is because I really like the Spicy Basil noodles dish they serve in Chelsea. I think unless you're wanting to party during dinner (not a bad thing, but it was in this case!) and have bad service there is no reason to eat there in-house.
