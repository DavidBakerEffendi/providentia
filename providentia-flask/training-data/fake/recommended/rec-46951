Love the rustic theme. Had the Gnocchi which was good but not too heavy.  The garnish was perfectly saliferous to balance the dish.   Also had the clams which were good.  The white wine sauce that the clams were swimming in was heaven.  After devouring every clam, with much guilt, I would scoop the sauce with the bivalve shell and slurp away. Service was excellent.  The owner, on a very busy night might I add, went around to the tables checking on everyone's dining experience.  My fellow dining patron was unsatisfied with how her fish was cooked and he more than happily replaced it with another dish from the menu.  He was very personable and kind.  Not sure if it was Giorgio Giuliani or not.   Gotta love it when they actually care about how your meal is going.   And of course, BYOB!!! No corkage fee!!! An unusual delight for a Southern Californian.
