I have to give this place a million stars. Yes, the place is a little small, but the "Pirate" reference on the door by the entrance immediately made Â my day before I even sat down. We went there for my bday celebration and I couldnt have picked a better place! Our waitress was really attentive (especially for a Saturday night...it was pretty busy) and their fries are amaaaaazing! Not to mention the prices were very reasonable. My friend and I ordered lemon drop shots and they were served to us in tumblers, so not only are the drinks cheap, but theyre generous with the amounts. But the best part of the night was when Rob and Kaitlin randomly walked by our table. My boyfriend and I are huge (and I mean huge) fans of the show, so randomly seeing our favorite actors 2 feet from us was amazing. They were even nice enough to pose for a picture. I dont know how my bday could have been any better! My friends and I loved this place and we plan to go back soon!
