This is a great place, worthy of 4 stars for sure. I like the Japanese simplicity of the menu and food. My favorite is the raw tuna with ponju sauce. Service is great and crowd is mostly asians. They have a good selection of saki as well. Good service, but the wait is typically 20-40 minutes, so be prepared to wait to get a table. Definitely authentic.
