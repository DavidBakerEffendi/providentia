Charming, quaint place that seems like a longtime favorite among locals. Interesting menu of different Italian sandwiches. Unique in the way it's arranged and the menu looked delicious. My friend and I shared an Americano & Manderra. Both super tasty. Small space but they have custom made furniture to fit it. Cute cute. Service was good. The paintings on the wall could be updated though. For some reason I couldn't stop singing Phil Collins tunes in my head. Tres dated.
