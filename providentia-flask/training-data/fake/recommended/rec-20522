Sad to say, but I am probably one of the few people who has tried a Roast Pork sandwich before a Philly Cheesesteak (from the big names).  Either way, this was a terrific sandwich, the flavors complimented each other very well.   The only thing that bothered me a bit was the sharp flavor of the provolone, but coming from an Asian background, cheese/dairy products aren't something we're really used to (mild cheeses please).  But it was so good that I was able to ignore it and just wolf down the deliciousness within, how can you pack so much juiciness into a sandwich?!?!
