Very small restaurant, so if you have a large party you will have to wait. I tried the Brazil, Viagra and Cuban. All were very tasty and def worth the wait.  The yuca Frita gave the meal extra substance along with the mango shake. My only beef with this place is that they forgot to bring some empanadas to our table and we had to remind them 5 times about it.  Other than that, this is a great place to get a late night snack or meal
