To be honest, I wanted to hate this place. Stephen Starr makes everything into Epcot Center. Plus, valet parking in Fishtown? Seriously?? That said, my partner + I went a few weeks back + I hate to admit that we enjoyed giant beers on a lovely summer night. We also got fries + a salad -- which, for everyone's complaints about the prices, were very big portions for what they cost. The crowd was odd + mixed, but it is what it is. It's definitely nice to have options to sit outside + drink beer on a summer night. I hope they keep the outside open in the winter, too, though. This would be the perfect spot to bring a group + play games, drink beer + just hang out.
