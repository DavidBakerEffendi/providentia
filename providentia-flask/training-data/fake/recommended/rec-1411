Dissapointing! My wife and I were in town visiting from San Francisco and wanted to "eat a Philly Cheesesteak in Philly". Â We heard alot about Geno's and decided to try them out. It literally took 30 seconds from the time we ordered until receiving our food. The meat was pre cooked, onions already grilled and bread was cold. It was all slapped together in seconds. We were extremely dissapointed!
