Oh Doc's.  Your food is pretty good, but the lunch service is just not good enough. I WANT to love you.  You're so close.  Your decor is amazing.  The menu SOUNDS good ... but the layout is oddly broken up.  You seat the front of the restaurant exclusively so that we're on top of other guests when there are other sections that are totally empty every time that I've been there.  You don't pull down your blinds to save us from the sun glare.  Your service has been lacking EVERY time that I've been in. We sat for 10 minutes today before a server asked us if we'd like beverages or appetizers.  For someone that is trying to respect the 1 hour lunch, that's a large chunk of my break.  And then the appetizers  took another 10-15 to come out ... so my break is half gone, and I have yet to eat a thing.  When they finally came out, the soup (the simplest part of the meal) was the wrong one.  The servers (at least at lunch) are slow, uninformed (didn't mention to us that you were out of the Oyster Po' Boy until AFTER we tried to order it and had our hearts set on it), and just give an overall sense that they don't want to be there.  I don't know about you, but I like a server that has a little pep in their step, offers me items that I might need - like ketchup - refills my water glass before I have to specifically ask for it, and checks on me at least once during the meal.   I really do want Doc's to be great and to succeed, but until the lunch service improves, POD is going to be my go-to for a nice lunch out ... and it's going to be everyone else's too.
