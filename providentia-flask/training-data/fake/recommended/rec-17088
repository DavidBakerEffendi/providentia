Ok I finally had a chance to go after hearing about it for the longest,  I love it!! In fact I've been twice in one week and contemplating going back today although I was just in there last night.  Alex the bartender is fantastic ask him to make his off the menu special martini which is like a strong piña colada using Ciroc pineapple and Ciroc coconut, it's smack your momma good!  I also enjoyed the pumpkin martini as well as the mango martini.   The food is great too. My favorites are the buffalo wings, calamari, Cajun calamari, grilled chicken Caesar salad,  the catfish is great and I absolutely love the Mac n cheese which has a hint of garlic in it as well as the collard greens which are a bit spicy!! You simply cannot go wrong good food and good drinks!!
