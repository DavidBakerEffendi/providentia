Nice cozy neighborhood spot. Relaxing environment and our waiter was very friendly. Had delicious white sangria. The food was surprisingly good. They had some sort of pre-fix where you can get three courses, which is good value. The grilled corn was very good and not overpoweringly cheesy. We had some pork organs, which was super flavorful. Everything was pretty delicious overall and plus the environment made for quite a lovely evening.
