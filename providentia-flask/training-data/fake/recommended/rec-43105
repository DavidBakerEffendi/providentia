Came here on a Sunday at 11am. Turns out the menu is available after 2:30PM and before that is a brunch buffet. Ew. Sorry but buffets are very peasant like. But because of the decoration and atmosphere we insisted on trying it anyway. Enjoyed sitting outside, but after going back inside to grab a plate of fruit, I noticed flys sitting on the food and other misc plates. Not very sanitary... Food wasn't too bad, but not outstanding... At least as far as the buffet and eggs go.   Great atmosphere, extremely pleasant outdoor seating and design. This place is extremely cute and cozy but has a lot to improve on. If The Bahche open beyond its operating hours, with a cocktail bad, and possibly some hookah for outdoor smoking would be killer. Awesome place to hang, get desert and coffee/tea, not so much for when you're starving, at least not for brunch.  Might come back to try the menu after 230pm.
