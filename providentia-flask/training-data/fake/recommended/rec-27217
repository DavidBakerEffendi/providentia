Incredible hole in the wall in Lower East Side. Super small Mexican restaurant with seating for maybe 30 ppl including the bar. The atmosphere is low key hipster with no decor to speak of...my friend and I ordered the hibiscus, elderflower and raspberry Paloma margarita between the two of us. The hibiscus and elderflower were our favorite. Potent, well constructed and flavorful. The raspberry was tarter than either of us was expecting but still good. For lunch/brunch there seem to be only 3 wait staff but they manage the area very well. No pause in service and no one hanging over your shoulder. We also ordered the guacamole and chips, steak sopresita and pollo tacos. The guacamole and chips were good - I've had better but still not disappointing. The salsa that accompanied it was appropriate. They do charge for the chips and a refill... Now, I should probably qualify and say that Mexican - in any form - is my favorite type of cuisine. Authentic or American, it rocks my world. So Barrio is more authentic and wonderful. Corn flower tortillas and four different salsas to accompany the plates, we had a yummy experience. Steak and chicken cooked and flavored to perfection just as you would expect. HIGHLY recommend stopping here and enjoying the culinary experience.
