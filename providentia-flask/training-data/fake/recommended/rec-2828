My dad used to own this place with a partner. Back then they called it Jo Jos #2. My cousin Fran has so many stories of the OCI that I can't begin to tell you. They lived not too far from this ICON in N.J. I was born and raised in Orange, went to school @ Bloomfield Tech. now reside in Roseville Ca. I wish we had places like this to go to. All the best to the owners and all I can say is keep up the great work. Joe Novinski
