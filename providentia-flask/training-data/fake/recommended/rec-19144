We wanted to like this place.  Family friendly, friendly attentive service, spacious and very clean.  But the food was mediocre to subpar.  I got corned beef hash and eggs - both of which were subpar to me and pancakes.  Pancakes were not bad but how do you mess that up.  The hubs got french toast which he said was totally subpar - he said it just tasted like regular toast.   Hash browns were below average.  Probably won't be coming back...
