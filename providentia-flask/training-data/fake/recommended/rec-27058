The bus boys were very good & attentive. It's a shame I can't say the same about the wait staff. You practically have to grab the waitress by the arm to get her attention. You want a water? No problem! You have to get up from your seat and walk up to the beverage station to ask for a refill because the waitress won't come around to ask you for one herself. I think this place is more suited as a deli as opposed to being a restaurant. This is a pretty good place to order a burger from if you enjoy eating hockey pucks. Especially the sirloin angus burger. Burnt charcoal goodness. Brutal.
