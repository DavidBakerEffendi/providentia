I had the Spicy Ramen - it was good, but not great. I had the chicken option - found the meat too dry. The char siu the boyfriend had was better, if still a little tough. Loved the broth though. And the green tea (canned hot green tea) was surprisingly good. The wait was ok (we were there just before they opened for lunch, and there was already a queue, of course) and the service staff were pleasant. Bottom line: this place is probably a little overrated in my opinion.
