I absolutely LOVE this place! It is hands down one of the best local restaurants in New York.   The decor is very simple: wooden floor & furniture, a white ceiling with the back wall of the room painted red, featuring a painting of a Carmen Miranda/Chiquita Banana type of figure. The food is outstanding and very moderately priced.  This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants. I have dined here many times and I've tried almost everything on the menu.  If you are thinking about checking this out, I HIGHLY recommend the yuca frita (fried yuca) as an appetizer.  The dipping sauce is unbelievable. For entree it all depends on what you like.  The steak with mushrooms is very good (also comes with the infamous yuca fries) and the other dishes are very good as well.
