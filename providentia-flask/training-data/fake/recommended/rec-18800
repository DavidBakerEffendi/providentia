Cute but not too small - teensy-tininess seems to be a plague affecting cute UWS wine bars, but this place seems to have escaped. It's not huge, but it never feels super-crowded (being on the street side instead of the avenue seems to help). Even in larger groups (5-6 people) we haven't had too much trouble finding a place to sit. A nice wine selection; not huge, but that can kind of be a good thing when you just want to scan down and pick something you know you like. And the staff seems to have a good handle on the wine list, for the more indecisive or inquisitive members of your party. Although I haven't personally tried the food, the menu (both small and larger plates) is tempting, and my dining companions who did eat said everything was great. Service can be a little slip-shod, especially when it starts to fill up with customers, but overall, everyone is very nice and adequately efficient.
