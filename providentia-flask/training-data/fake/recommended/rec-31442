Have to admit I was disappointed. Heard a lot about this place and went on a brunch Saturday for the first time. The place was pretty empty. There was one server running the front and the tables. Service was ok. Food was ok. Nothing to write home about. It also seemed dirty...under the tables, the inside of the window sills and even the table we sat at was not even wiped off well with visible remnants of smeared eggs still on the table. What blew me away was a mimosa we ordered that was served in a champagne flute cost $9!! It was not top shelf champagne or a large size it was in a champagne flute and we all know how much that holds!
