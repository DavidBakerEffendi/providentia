We dined here last evening as a group of 7, so it's a little hard to compare this experience, particularly the service aspect, to a more intimate meal with just my wife.  That said, most everyone in this group enjoyed their food.  We had dined at Just Sonnys several times before and we really enjoyed that place.  We were sad they closed, but glad to hear the chef and staff had resurfaced at Bella.  I was tempted to order the daily special of acorn squash ravioli, but my wife & I decided to split the veal saltimboca with a side of pasta with the "same sauce" (as the saltimboca).  We learned the "same sauce" trick at Just Sonnys.  We also learned that their portion sizes are quite ample. For our appetites,  either we share a meal or take home left-overs.  We've had this dish at Just Sonnys and loved it again here.   Dishes ordered by others in our party were the chicken rolatini, which was described as very good, although I'm told their veal rolatini is even better, but it's only available from time-to-time as a daily special. A breaded veal cutlet special was ordered, but came out with chicken instead.  It was topped with broccoli rabe and mozzarella and was described as tasty, but a bit dry.  It would have benefited from a gravy or sauce. The order of chicken scarpariello, however was described as overly lemony.  The remaining dish ordered was shrimp francese and it was described as very good. Service was good considering the size of our party.  We had several bottles of Ruffino Chianti, which was reasonably priced.  Can't wait to come back!
