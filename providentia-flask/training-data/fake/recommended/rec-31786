My boyfriend and I used a Restaurant.com gift certificate to go to Race Street for brunch. I had been twice already for dinner and was curious to try their brunch. My excitement was increased when I noticed online a few twists on traditional brunch cocktails that Race Street offered. Unfortunately, when we received the drink list, it did not list any of what I had seen online. My boyfriend and I attempted to politely mention this to our waitress as a "head's up" and were met without any any thanks and were told what was on the menu was what they had and if we wanted something else they could probably make it. There was no attempt to even "up-sell" us on the specialty cocktails they could supposedly make. The food was very good, just as we had found it to be when we've gone for dinner. But, after three visits we've decided never to expect very good service. We've never received a warm welcome and just feel as though our questions, and even presence, is an imposition.
