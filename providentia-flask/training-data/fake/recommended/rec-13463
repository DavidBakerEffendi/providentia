Every time i go to NY, i make a pit stop here. Best cart food EVER! I get the lamb and chicken plate with plenty of white and red sauce. (careful... the red sauce is a bit spicy, even for me) There's always a line but it's worth it! by the way.. i've always eaten it sober, so it's legitimately good. lol
