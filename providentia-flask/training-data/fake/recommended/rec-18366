This place is badass.  I never knew I liked pita and hummus that much.  That's probably because I was eating crappy pita and hummus my whole life.  The pita and hummus are both made fresh and it's like night and day.  Closest thing I could compare it to is if you get grocery store sushi your whole life and then you go to Japan and get some Sushi from that ancient little Yoda dude Jiro. We tried two hummuses...hummii? and they were both amazenuts.  The pitas were redonkified.  Come here to get lunch.   It's fantastiballs.
