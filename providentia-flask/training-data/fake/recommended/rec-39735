Ever since spending a month in Spain a few years ago I have become a tapas addict.  Which can be tricky since I am a vegetarian.  That being said, this is one of the best tapas bars I've been to in the city. Reasonable prices and lots of choices on the menu.  Even though we got the table in the back next to the bathroom it was still a good night. The service was prompt and helpful, which as of late has been my number one complaint of eateries in the city. Definitely a fun environment. I will go back.
