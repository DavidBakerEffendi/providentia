No sign, No hostess, No problem. This place is awesome, the owners are so nice and welcoming. The food is cheap and absolutely delicious. It's obvious these recipes are family recipes. They've been open for 26 years in the same spot and there is no sign. A place that can survive 25 years without a sign and run by 2 people in the front, is amazing. The red sangria is fantastic, very fruity and served ice cold. We had the black bean soup, very smokey, all vegetarian and organic; the guacamole, very fresh, creamy and delicious; and one of the combination platters. The mole is very good and more than enough food for 2 people. Even though the service may be on the slow side for some, the ambiance is cool and relaxing, and the food is well worth the wait.
