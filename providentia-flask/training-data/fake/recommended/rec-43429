One of the better choices in sushi in the area. The wait was respectable, which is usually the problem with sushi places. The sushi was delicious. I do not recall the exact name of it but it was one of the specialty rolls. They had the typical American Chinese take out menu items as well. Not sure why, but I'd recommend getting sushi.
