We've been coming to Modo Mio regularly for five years and have never been disappointed by the food or the service.  We use Modo Mio as both our "go-to" restaurant and as our "special event" restaurant.  We've never had to wait (reservation,  reservation, reservation) and have dropped in and been accommodated.  EVERYTHING is great. The array of unusual dishes in each of the fixe prix categories does create a desire to be more than one or two people in order to try the many ways seemingly disparate ingredients are combined to make amazing flavors and textures - chicken liver and figs - wow!  The lasagna is really specially, as the vitello - veal and anchovies?!  If the portions were larger, very few people would ever reach the secondi course.  Noisy when crowded? Yes, but even with my poor hearing, I can carry on a conversation at the table. It is crowded and table are relatively close to one another, but if they had fewer tables, then fewer of us would be able to enjoy an outstanding dinner.  If you want to go to a quiet place with only a few diners, I would guess that the food there wouldn't be drawing in customers.  An empty restaurant usually means one thing....  Modo Mio should be a big secret, but the word is out, and we'll just have to live with that!
