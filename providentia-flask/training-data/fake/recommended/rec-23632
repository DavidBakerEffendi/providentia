**Note to the uninitiated like myself: The address of this place is a tad misleading -- it's NOT on the Pennsylvania side of the building, but rather on the Fairmount side. So, if you're say, a tourist visiting Eastern State Penn, this makes Little Pete's an optimal spot to grab a bite just before or after.** This is a solid 3.5, but more to the 4 side than the 3. Be still my Jersey heart - Little Pete's is a straight up Greek diner, and for the Mister and me, it was the ideal spot for a quasi-brunch on a windy, cold holiday-week morning. Service took a minute to get off the ground, but once it did, it was quick. Yes, it's a haven for fussy seniors, but most good and affordable diners are. The coffee was okay... nothing stellar, but decent enough. I had the Eggs Benedict, which other Yelpers recommended with good reason -- nice portion size, eggs poached to yolky perfection and the hollandaise is delicious, with a tangy, mustardy kick. The home fries were sort of bland, but there was just enough hollandaise left in the gratin dish to where I was able to plop the taters in, coat them in the sauce and relish my concoction. The Mister opted for a grilled cheese with bacon on whole wheat and a couple of eggs over light (accompanied by those ubiquitous potatoes). He's a tough customer to please, but he admitted that while the eggs were standard, the grilled cheese was among the best he's had -- crisp, melty and just plain good. We received the lunch specials menu, and they didn't look bad at all... maybe next time!
