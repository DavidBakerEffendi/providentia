Growing up in NJ, I've been hearing about Geno's steaks for years! I finally had one yesterday and I have to say I was underwhelmed. The meat has ZERO flavor, they were skimpy on the cheese, their ketchup container was empty. For $9.50 I would expect a much better sandwich. I also didn't like how you had to go down to a different window to order & pay for your drinks and fries. Also very inconvenient that they only accept cash. I had to pay an almost $3 fee at the ATM. Glad I finally got to experience Geno's, but wouldn't recommend it and won't be a retraining customer.
