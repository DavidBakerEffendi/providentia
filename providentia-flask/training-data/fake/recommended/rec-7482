Nice surprise at the foot of the Queensboro bridge. We sought this place out actually, because my husband had read about it and wanted to sample their craft beer selection.  The first thing you notice when you walk in is the smell (wet hops?).  Kind of a turn-off at first, I can't imagine that smell is a constant or they wouldn't be doing the business they are.  If you're able to push past that, the place is great.  Attracts an eclectic crowd - lots of UES suits as well as football jerseys.  Crowd ranged from early 20s to mid-40s.  Not hard to feel like you fit in somewhere.  Seating is first come, first serve.  Outdoor garden was packed. Beer selection is awesome and we stuck to that.  They have quite a few cocktails but can't speak to those as much. We split an order of the blue-cheese stuffed, bacon-wrapped dates and roast beef sandwich with truffle chips.  The dates were okay but over-priced ($2/piece!) and the blue cheese flavor was completely lost.  Roast beef sandwich was delicious.  Truffle chips were TO DIE for. All in all, if I'm in the area, would definitely be back but not sure it'll be the sole focus of another adventure cross-town.
