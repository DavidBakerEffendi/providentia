I have a built-in homing beacon that makes me start walking to this place every time I'm in New York.  There's no nonsense: here are some damn fried potatoes, and a bunch of things for you to dip them in.  I writhe on the floor craving these fries when I've been away too long.  Oh Pommes Frites, what narcotic substances are in your grease that make my individual blood cells beg for you by name??
