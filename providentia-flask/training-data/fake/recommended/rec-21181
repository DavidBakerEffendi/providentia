Voted as one of the most hidden restaurants in NYC.  My husband googled the restaurant and found the number online.  We made a reservation about two weeks in advance.  Located behind a Japanese butcher shop.  We arrived 10 mins early for our 6pm reservation.  We were asked to wait outside which was fine.  We were asked to come in at 6.  There were four of us.  When we walked in it looked like someone's living room very cozy.  Our table was more like a coffee table then an eating table.  The chair was a couch.  So to eat we had to hunch over the table not totally comfortable.  The rest of the tables were normal height with what looked like comfortable chairs.  The waiter was helpful in answering our questions.  Since we aren't big drinkers my husband was the only one that tried one of their specialty drinks, which was really good.  Can't remember the name but it had earl gray in it.  We opted not to try the tasting menu because everyone at the table had to do it. Uni Croquet $13 a piece- I thought it was pretty good the texture is creamier then other croquettes.  The rest of the party thought it was ok. Oysters $32 for a dozen - These came with an apple vinaigrette which was ok but not a huge fan of East Coast oysters Mac and Cheese - It was ok not much more to say about it. Miso Cod with pickled vegetables - a little on the sweet side but cooked well Garlic shrimp with house made shrimp paste - This was really good!  Shrimp paste was excellent. Mini Beef Sliders - Really good Burgers were juicy and the buns were toasted Pork Loin - This was eh not my favorite but the others thought it was ok. Short Rib Sashimi - This was really good a piece of the meat with a piece of roasted garlic, fresh wasabi and a little soy sauce.  Melt in your mouth with a piece of pickled daikon. Foie Gras sushi - wasn't a fan. It just felt heavy but I guess thats Foie Gras for you. Overall it was ok.  Nice to have tried it for the novelty.
