Loved Uva. Sat outside in their back patio and had some great reds from their huge selection of wines. The waitress was great and helped us navigate thru the cheeses that would match what we were drinking. There was also plenty of tasty appetizers to choose from and from the looks of it, a great dinner menu. It was the perfect early evening/before dinner location and a great date spot.
