Ambiance is cool, you're seated promptly, service is decent. I ordered the Lobster, Shrimp, & Grits it came out watery. You could barely taste the grits, I asked them to take it back, they were prompt and immediately allowed me to order something else, I got the basic dish that they are known for: buttermilk fried chicken & red velvet waffles as well as an order of Mac and cheese, it was good. Overall 3 stars nothing special about the service, they need to reassess that recipe for lobster, shrimp, & Grits.
