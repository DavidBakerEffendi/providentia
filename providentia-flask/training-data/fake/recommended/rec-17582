I really like the food at this place which is why I am giving them 3 stars. In reality though they deserve less after what I witnessed the last time I was there... I was at Empanada Mama's the other day and you would not believe what I discovered: they recycle the sangria!!! I was waiting to use the bathroom and saw the kitchen worker Â fill up a pitcher of sangria half-way (they pre-make it and then put it into this huge container to pour from) and then top it off with what was left from a pitcher someone left behind!! I know that people don't drink from the pitcher and instead pour the sangria into their cups from the pitcher, but still, that's just gross. I do not want to drink anything from an open container that's been sitting on someone else's table. So while I really do like this place, I'll have to think twice about going back. And if I do, I'll definitely be watching them as they pour my pitcher :-)
