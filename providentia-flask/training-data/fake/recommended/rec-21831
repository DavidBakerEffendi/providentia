One of my favorite places to eat in the slope. The food is quality and fresh with a different taste for when you have eaten too much "American" food at the pubs and pizza joints. Menu is small and changes fairly regularly. Their starters would be great as tapas with a bottle of wine. We usually get three between the two of us, as we have a hard time deciding and then are stuffed. Â The service is usually very friendly, but they are slow on refilling water and drinks or following up at the table. Downside is they are often crowded during prime eating times and have limited seating.
