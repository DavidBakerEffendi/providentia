I've ordered from the Hamilton restaurant for years. Love everything. But... NYE I made an order and went to pick it up to be thoughtful and save the the drive. I ordered the buffalo calamari which is my boss' favorite, but they gave me the regular. I didn't realize until I got home. Called them and asked them to deliver the correct one. Person who answered phone said it was his mistake, but that he was gonna have to ask for the original calamari to be returned. I honestly thought he was kidding. Then delivery guy said he hated to ask but had to take the other order back to his boss. I don't really care because I didn't want it and returned the whole thing, but this is unprofessional. Tacky, tacky, tacky. I'll wait until Hamilton one opens again before I order from here.
