I like Tom's but I don't love it. I think the only reason I'm super down with Tom's is because when I'm there I don't feel like I'm in NYC. More like home.. this diner close to my house in FL is similar to Tom's. So it's a nostalgic thing. Overall, the breakfast food is nothing too special. The eggs, bacon, sausage taste like most any other I've ever had. However, they have multiple types of pancakes you may have never seen before. The pancakes are good (not great). They are good.. not out of the ballpark good. I think if you are going to Tom's you should get the pancakes though.. The prices aren't that great. I mean 9 bucks for 2 pancakes, eggs, and bacon isn't that good of a price. On the weekends there seems to always be a wait and they have irregular hours on the weekdays.. that's why it's packed on the weekends. The service is pretty good and it does not take long to get your food. It's a laid back, fun dining experience. If you want breakfast at 6pm on a saturday it's a good idea. It is also decorated pretty cool too.
