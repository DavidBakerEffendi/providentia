Ok, the food is good. Not the best sushi you can find in New York though. But the restaurant is terrible. We went for dinner last night. The place is a little smelly. The service is below standard. The menus are dirty and worn down. The waiters are rude and it takes forever for you to get what you ordered. When I asked the waitress that we've been waiting for our main course for 15 minutes, she said "everyone is waiting for their food, sorry its' a little crazy tonight!". And the restaurant was only 2/3 full! Additionally, there were too many mosquitos flying around us and our food and we were bitten several times by the mosquitos. Again we told one of the waitresses about it and she said "I know, it's because the doors are open!" These guys do not even know how to talk to their customers. I'll never go there again and would recommend you to only order to go if you want to try their food.
