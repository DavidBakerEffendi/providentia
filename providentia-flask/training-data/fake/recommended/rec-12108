Pat's is the greatest place to purchase food on earth. There, that's out of the way. I love Pat's.  I lived in downtown Philly for six years, and I've had every variety of cheesesteak the city has to offer, from big restaurants to famous places to carts on the street.  None of them can add up to the glory that is the King of Steaks. The bread is perfect.  The meat is perfect.  The copious amounts of delicious, dripping cheese whiz is perfect.  Everything about this meal creates an orgasmic eating experience.   They also have the best cheese fries in the city. Oh, and by the way, come late at night and be greeted by Andre.  Andre may seem like a bum to you, but you'd be mistaken.  Andre is the man.  He will chat it up, tell jokes, get you napkins, and clean up your trash.  Better than any waiter I've ever had.  He'll even clean your windshield. My gripes: 1) I miss the yellow lights.  Really, I do. 2) The price keeps going up.  But if the people keep buying, they'll keep doing it, I don't blame them. 3) They used to have their own sodas as well as the brand name ones, and they were fantastic.  They're gone now. 4) Across the street from that abomination known as Genos. Of course, these gripes are not enough to lower my 5 star rating.  I'd rate them 10 out of 5 if only yelp would let me.
