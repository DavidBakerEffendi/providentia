What a great spot! I came in as they were opening and got terrific service by the owner. The space is comfortable for homework/work. The music isn't too loud and there are outlets a plenty. They have a 2 hour limit at the tables though I'm sure this is flexible esp if you're spending $. I think I found my new study spot. Oh! Brooklyn Roasters coffee served here and the food was delicious. Hot and cold options!
