It is definitely not a place to go if your are starving - sat for 20 minutes, then had to wave down the waitress to place an order. Orders came out nearly an hour later with undercooked pasta and ingredients that were requested to be omitted from the plate. Overall would be a good place if they did not have such poor service.
