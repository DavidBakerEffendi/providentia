4.5 Stars?  Oh please! Alright, since no one else will say it, I will: This is the worst cheesesteak anywhere in the world.  It skimpy, over priced and barely edible (on a good night). Pats and Genos compete with each other...Yeah, they certainly do.....to see who can charge the most for disgusting inedible food! It's embarassing that our famous (and yummy) chesesteak is so closely related with this place! PR at it's very best. That is all....
