This is almost a rite-of-passage for any visitor to NYC and I've made it a point to come here every time I'm in the City. First of all, don't let the long lines deter you.  They've gotten it down to a science now and it moves along pretty quickly.  Plus, the fact that you can smell the yumminess a whole block away should tell you that this is a place you NEED to dine at. I always get the lamb platter but my friends do like the mix of chicken and lamb so I think that's just personal preference.  Love the white sauce (easy people...) and they've calmed down a little on their hot sauce.  I used to not be able to use it at all but now it's not as bad.  Don't get me wrong though, it'll still burn a hole in parts of your body so be gentle with it.
