Stopped by this little gem one late Friday night when it wasn't open and swore to come back given the fact that it seemed like a wonderful novelty coffee shop and wasn't disappointed. Small place that brews pretty solid coffee. Limited selection of pastries and a typical selection of lunch items. 3 stars for being a solid place with good selection but 4 stars for excellent ambiance. The place was packed around 10am on a Thursday which was pretty cool to see. Not too much space to sit at but just seemed like an excellent complement to the quirks that you would except form a place like WRJ. Yes, it's just a typical coffee shop. But it's a good one.
