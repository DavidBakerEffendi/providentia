The scene:  multi-racial hipsters with the coolest hair you've ever seen.  Local watering hole for the neighboring Fort Greene artists. One of the bathrooms has no ceiling.  It's tranquil and clean in there.  You can look up and see stars and planes, a fantastic restroom experience.   The cuban sandwich didn't look very cuban, but the fries are freshly cut, and the grilled corn is sweet as summer with generous cheese, paprika, and a wedge of lime.  The music is straight up Latin and facilitates a steady drinking binge.  A note on the mojitos and margaritas:  both are $7 each and only available frozen from a machine, like alcoholic Icees from 7-11.  The mojito is surprisingly tasty, but sweet and quick-melting. The margarita is strong and bitter on the rum (or is that every margarita?). The tables are made of recycled cans and bottles.  They compost the leftover food.  And after you eat the corn, they use the cob to make the plastic cup for your mojito.  This last part is speculation after reading the disclaimer on our plastic cup ("This cup is made of corn").
