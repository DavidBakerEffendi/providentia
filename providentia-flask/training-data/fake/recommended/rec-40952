I have always loved their pizza but decided to order calzones. I had them deliver my order which is always convenient. As soon as they delivered the ordered I anxiously opened it right up but I was very disappointed to find that the it was barely luke warm. The cheese was solid, not even melted. Also the sauce was cold which did not add to my enjoyment. It was almost as if it was cooked an hour ago and left on the oven to stay warm. I had to reheat it in order to get any enjoyment out of it. Also the topping that I ordered, meatballs, were limited to the center and not spread out. I am very disappointed in their calzones, stick to their pizza.
