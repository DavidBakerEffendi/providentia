The best plantain chips and guacamole I have ever had. I have been In NYC for five days and already I've eaten here twice. The food is fantastic, the empanadas hot, and the service is good. It's a very small place and wait times can be long, but they will try to squeeze you in any seat they can as soon as one becomes available.
