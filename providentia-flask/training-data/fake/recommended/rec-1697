4.5...Stopped in on a rainy Sunday afternoon on a recent trip to Philly.  The ambiance was great.  Old, comfortable, warm...maybe it was Alfred Hitchcock's "Vertigo" playing that I found comfort in...reminders of home?...it was more basic actually... it was the perfect combination of a great, hospitable, and knowledge staff... and the Shrimp and Grits, with pork belly, and a fried egg.  My brother had cornmeal pancakes with a side of ham- which he thought were great...thinking my best tasting of the trip.
