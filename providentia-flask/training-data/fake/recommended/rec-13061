I had a great experience after spending an amazing evening with my friends. I ordered the Vegetable Enchilada, its super yummy! and my friend ordered Duck Tongue Taco, she said its good too! Food is very tasty, the decor is very romantic and price is reasonable. Basically you wont't go wrong with anything on the memu. Recommended for dates!!
