I knew I was going to love this place the moment I walked in. The fusion of glorious smells and the friendly staff won me over almost immediately. The sizzling pork head is a must! The jasmine rice is very good. But the soi koi dish is probably the tastiest dish I've had in a long time. I tried to get a bowl to go, but they told me the kitchen was closed, that made me sad. But to be fair, we showed up 15 minutes before they closed and they did not bat an eye. They gave us great service and treated us very well.
