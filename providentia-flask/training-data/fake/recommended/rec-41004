This place is terrific in many ways - and consistent, too.  Pizzas come out of that oven fast, hot & blistered and the right amount of "thin" every time - they've got this down so well that it's easy to forgive them for not having anything beyond pizza on their menu.  Even the little bar area has turned out to be a fun neighborhood hangout. The only thing to fix?  Please dont make your staff introduce themselves with that robot "...and i'll be your server tonight" line.  In a place that does so much so well, that's a touch of Olive Garden mediocrity you dont need.
