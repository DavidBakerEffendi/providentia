such a charming restaurant.  dropped by for some tacos on a sunday morning but they were only serving brunch.  what couldve easily been a disappointing experience was turned around by astounding service and delicious food.  from the mimosas to the pupusas to the pigs head hash... every thing was on point.  there was a short wait for one of the dishes and they gave it to us on the house!  i wish every restaurant experience could be this pleasant.
