I had the catfish nuggets and grits, wheat toast and scrambled eggs, very delicious, I had takeout this time but its a very nice small cozy place ! Also, the staff is very friendly :) I live up the street so parking is not an issue for me, but for those that has to drive to get here, you will have to deal with parking meters or the numerous no parking signs or no parking at all.
