Probably, most likely, maybe, always sometimes the best Thai food in the area. They don't take reservations and won't seat you until your entire party shows up. However, they seem to have a quick throughput.  (read either 1. Great wait service or 2. A business trying to maximize profit by serving as many people as possible). The food is great and cheap (for the area). The cocktails are pretty tasty and I get the testosterone often. (it's a red bull vodka). Oh and there is a huge chandelier in there. It's wow factor died after the second time I went there.  But at least the bathrooms are clean.
