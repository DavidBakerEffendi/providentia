Context: Weekend Lunch Time of Visit: Saturday, 12:30PM As a fan of cajun food, it doesn't get much better than Beck's. They have many cajun/creole favorites: red beans and rice, jambalaya, gumbo, and po-boys.  If you are looking for more standard fare with a cajun attitude, they have blackened chicken alfredo, bread pudding, and awesome cornbread.   They also have an interesting version of a Philly Cheesesteak called the "Train Wreck"; it is huge.  Also, most of their dishes do have a spicy kick, so sensitive palates should definitely sample before ordering. If you are unsure about what to get, ask the staff for a sample: they will be more than happy to oblige (I didn't ask, but was given a sample anyway).  They are very friendly and can also help you pair dishes if you would like to mix-and-match.  I sampled the Gator Gumbo, and while it sounded like something I would shy away from, it ended up being my order for the day. Portion sizes are very generous, with most entrees coming in at just under $10.
