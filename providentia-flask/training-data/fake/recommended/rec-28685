I travel all the way from the comfort of my Downtown apartment to this Upper East Side spot.  I don't care about atmosphere or service when it comes to vegetarian food this flavorful!  Although, their service is decent.  The lower level of the restaurant looks like a Mediterranean Cafe and upstairs has a bit more of a sophisticated feel.  Please note- you must love garlic to appreciate the magic of their food!  I really LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place.
