i took my husband and friend to Pig and Khao last weekend because I enjoyed the first time I went there.  My husband is not as adventurous with food so we ordered the grilled sirloin.  The dish came and it was really rare, so we asked the waiter if they can put it on the grill for a few minutes.  the waiter instantly told us that that is they way the check cooks it and the chef will refuse to cook it for us without even asking the chef.  Considering that was the only dish on the menu that my husband can eat, I really believe they should have cooked the grilled sirloin according to the customer's preference since we are paying for it.  But the restaurant didn't budge and my husband ended up eating just rice.... what a let down also the music is too loud and there isn't enough ventilation!   Being that this is a new restaurant and they got 2 stars in NY times, if they keep up with this arrogance, i really honestly believe they will lose a lot of customers in the long run....
