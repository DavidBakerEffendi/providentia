This is my favorite French bistro in NYC! The very first place I go every single time I hit NYC!  It was also John Belushi's favorite spot to have a burger.  And yes, the burger is fantastic!   Last time I was there I got out of a cabby at the corner in heels and fell in a big hole in the NYC street! Damn! I hate it when that happens! Lol I got up and was like I'm fine I'm fine, I'm not drunk people :) Anyway, I went in and the bartender gave me a cloth for my bleeding knee and poured me a big glass of Pinot noir while I waited for my hubby who was cabbing from across town.  He was so nice to me and b4 you knew it I forgot all about my injuries and was having a blast!  We even make a few toast to Mr. Belushi's favorite booth! Lol The place hasn't changed in the 30 plus years I been there, it's the same beautiful old deco restaurant with the same timeless, fabulous, French bistro cuisine, chic feel and nyc ambiance.  It's very romantic at night, kinda dark with candles flickering everywhere reflecting off the old French mirrors.   It's def a late night place, by the time hubby arrived around 10:30-11:00 pm the place was packed! Both nights we were there this trip :) Jeff had the steak frits and I had the salmon in the miso both were excellent as we shared both (cleaned our plates) then shared a couple after dinner drinks and ordered dessert and some espresso. The dessert. as everything else was, 2 die For Amazballs! Check pics! Yes, it's expensive! But NYC is expensive everywhere.  Only you KNOW when you dine here, you get excellent food, excellent service, excellent drinks, excellent ambiance, EVERY TIME!  A real glamourous & historic NYC place.  It's just perfect!
