LOVE brickyard. Their bison burgers are the best I've had in a while and I love all the options they have for additions to it. Sadly one of the few restaurants I've been to in the city where they know how to cook their burger temperatures perfectly, without fail. They have a great beer selection but I have a love/hate relationship with their rotating taps - they feature amazing beers but they are gone so quickly. Get in before the happy hour rush or its tough to get a seat.
