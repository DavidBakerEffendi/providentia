best food EVER! sharwamas are the best. Outstanding! Great servers. My favorite is the chicken or lamb shawarma Lebanese style. The humus with beef is quite delicious as well. I've been going to this restaurant for about 7 years, they are warm, friendly and very reasonable. Everyone I take there loves it
