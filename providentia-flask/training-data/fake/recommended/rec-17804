HUGE shout out to Mama and her staff for this fine establishment. And she often leaves the kitchen to come mingle with the customers; so if she recommends it, try it. The tacos, spring rolls (and I hate spring rolls) everything from the curry selection, fried rice and pad see ew are hands down the best out of the.....errrrrrrr 19 Thai restaurants I've dined numerous times. The (soft) iced drinks are just as amazing. In addition, you're welcome to BYOB and they provide a bucket of ice for your convenience. Don't go nights or weekends with a party of 10 and complain it took forever (although worth the wait!) to get seated. It's a small place. It get's busy. Chose wisely when to go in and sit. Or call to pick up.
