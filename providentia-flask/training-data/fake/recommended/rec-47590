Hands down best new bar in NYC.  The corned beef sandwich served on rye bread with Colman's mustard is as good or perhaps better than what they serve at Katz's Delicatessen. I also recommend the "USQUAEBACH" punch made from Tullamore Dew Blended Irish Whiskey, lemon sherbet, lemon juice, spice.  Very nice!
