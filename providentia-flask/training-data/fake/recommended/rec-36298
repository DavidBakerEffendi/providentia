This restaurant is, hands-down, my favorite restaurant in New York City. I've gushed over other restaurants before, but this one takes the cake. I've been to Tia Pol about ten times now (actually, I've lost count) and I can't get enough! I love their tapas-style platters, especially the patatas bravas, crema de h√≠gado de pollo, and almejas al vino. My favorite dessert is the flan. They also have specials that are not listed in their menu, but are equally absolutely delectable. All of the dishes are sized just right, so that everyone at the table can share with each other (or surreptitiously hog it all to yourself -- that's what I do). There's a pretty good wine menu, but their house sangria (choice of red or white) is what I always order; it's fruity, but not too sweet, plus you can order a glass or a whole pitcher. The restaurant's layout is good for traffic-flow as well. The space is small, but they've done a great job with it. Patrons can sit at the bar, at a small table in the main area, or at a larger table in a backroom area. If you're going for dinner, I definitely suggest making a reservation because this place gets quite packed. Not only do I keep coming back here because of their ridiculously tasty food, but also because the atmosphere is relaxing, fun, and intimate -- think: old, modernized warehouse. And just in case I haven't fully convinced you to go here yet... Did I mention that their pricing is excellent for my grad-student-sized wallet, as well? This is my go-to spot for any occasion or hangout and I am never disappointed.
