REALLY, REALLY, enjoy this place. It is an easy atmosphere of tasty food and good service. --- Gourmet, no. Good diner food, if you are from North Jersey, yes. --- Reasonably priced for food quality...cheap prices, given location. --- Enjoyed dessert more than meal, but was not disappointed by anything the restaurant offered.
