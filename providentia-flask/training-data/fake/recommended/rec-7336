Went tonight for dinner. It's a small spot but since it's summer they had tables outside. We only saw one waitress when we got there so she was all over the place fetching/refilling etc, w/c was no prob since my friends and I were catching up and basically weren't ready to order. I have been to almost all the Filipino spots in queens and already have a favorite but I was curious about this one since my friend's roommate said it was good. It's hard to be impressed with Filipino food when you're Filipino, this place though def became an instant favorite. We ordered: chicharon bulaklak, bokchoy with shrimp and garlic ( really good!) lechon kawali and fried tilapia. For dessert: flan (of course): one of the best Flans I've ever had. I recommend it def to whoever is in the area who wants to have a quick Filipino meal. Good to know it's close to my job. Might get it delivered if they do.
