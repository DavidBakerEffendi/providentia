I'll keep it brief.  Overrated.  The line is too long, and the food is too bland.   There are so many good carts-- many of them zabihah/halal-- in the City.  Do some research (here: newyorkstreetfood.com), and find something better suited to your tastes. Im happy to see, though, that these guys are making halal food such an integral part of new york tourism. :)
