One of the most disappointing dining experiences I have has in a while. OK, so the menu for this place is extensive, and the offerings seem interesting, but the service is really slow, the portions are really small (comically so if you chose a low calorie option) and the food is just, well, bad. The entrees were on par with any offering from lean cuisine, there was really nothing positive to say about the place. Dont waste your time or money here.
