3.5 stars The wait is so crazy long. They only have 10 tables or so so it gets pretty crowded quickly. We were told that we would need to wait about 45 minutes so we went to grab drinks at a nearby restaurant. The host told us to call in to get an update. When we called he said it was an additional 15 mins. We went back to the restaurant and he apologized and said they needed another 15 mins. The strange thing was that 2 groups that came after us were already crossed off his list, which means they got seated before us (and it wasn't an issue of party size). He offered to give us free drinks (since we already drank at another restaurant) but M asked for a discount on the bill instead. He seemed a bit reluctant. We ordered the beef shabu shabu and a mushroom bi bim bap. I don't feel like there was anything special about the shabu shabu and the two dipping sauces didn't taste great to me. The bi bim bap was super salty. There was so much soy sauce in it. When we got our bill surprisingly there was a 20% discount so I bumped it up half a star for customer service.
