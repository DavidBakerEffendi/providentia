First time in Burlington, VT Downtown. Went with a group of 4 for dinner on Saturday. The outdoor seating was nice and life alive. Wait times could be longer (we waited for 40 minutes). Service was nice and friendly but could be a lot quicker and attentive. Food is your normal pub food with no frills attached. Appetizers took heck lot of time and the side plates were never given(when asked, the waitress said, "we are looking for those"...seriously!!!). Food portions are ample and share-able. You may want to go to this place for its location but not just for the food. Among the multitude options out there this is one among the herd IMO.
