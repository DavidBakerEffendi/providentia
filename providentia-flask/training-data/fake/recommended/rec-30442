Came here because M brought us here - it's been her favorite place since high school.  We got here around 1:45p on a Friday and it was crowded - don't New Yorkers work?  I guess we hit the late lunch rush hour. Anyway, I initially ordered the spinach and beets salad but they had run out of beets! I got the Veggie met Sally one and the server added avocados to it since I really wanted everything from the spinach and beets salad. It was really good -- I'd say it's the best veggie patty I've ever had, and with copious amounts of goat cheese, crunch apples and red onions, it was delicious.  The avocados weren't very ripe and I guess the salad could have done without it, honestly.   Also, the accompanying "handmade bread" just tasted like normal store bought bread. So, why the 5 stars?   Service here is AMAZING.  A ordered a sandwich without honey mustard because she hates it.  The sandwich came with the honey mustard, and she told the server and just asked them to change the bread, and that they didn't need to go to too much trouble.  They just made her a new sandwich.  Also, my friend C came to stop by and say hello, and they just let her pull up a chair and chat away - they were so chill about it (and in NY, sometimes servers get huffy about adding people etc).  The checks were also weird and all over the place, (we split credit cards, cash etc,) but the server was chill about that too.  Also she was so accommodating about my salad. The atmosphere is clean and brightly lit.  The food is delicious, fresh, and well-portioned.  I can imagine that it can be difficult if crowded, but I'd definitely recommend giving this place a try!
