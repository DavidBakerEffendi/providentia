Went on a Thursday at 8 pm, no wait. To start: a free bag of popcorn cooked in bacon fat. DELICIOUS. Plates are small and tapas style, priced between $10 and $15.   My husband and I ordered four:     a fuji apple salad (delicious and crunchy with prosciutto and goat cheese),         yellowtail tartare (a must in my opinion, this was fantastic)     seared scallops (disappointingly, only 3, but they were cooked PERFECTLY)     pork belly (quite tasty, but I guess less memorable than my other dishes) Each bite really felt well crafted and balanced in flavor, very satisfying to my palate. Dessert was strange and unimaginative; but I tend to feel that Asian influenced restaurants have a hard time getting dessert right.   After dinner, you are served a complimentary yogurt digestive from Korea which was yummy.   2 beers + 4 plates + dessert = $84 Would totally go back.
