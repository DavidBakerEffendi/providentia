Ordered pork spring rolls and the house special noodle bowl.  Being a self proclaimed spring roll aficionado, I give their fresh pork spring rolls high marks.  The pork is crispy with a great BBQ flavor adding both texture and taste to the spring roll. The dipping sauce also compliments this appetizer very well.  Next, I had the house vermicelli noodle bowl, number 45 on their menu.  Unfortunately, my phone died and I was unable to snap a picture of this beautiful dish.  Not the best I've had but still very good.  The dish included fried spring roll, chicken, BBQ pork, Vietnamese sausage and pickled vegetables along with the noodles, sauce and cilantro.  I'd definitely order it again.   As for the restaurant itself, I thought the dining area was clean and very comfortable.  Service was pretty good and prices were reasonable.
