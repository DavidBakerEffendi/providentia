If you want some cheap chinese you come here. I always come here for the noodle soup and the fried fish fillet, but everything else is good over here. The only downfall is the tiny space, but it's really not bad. I never have to wait. Everytime I take my friends over here they really like it. Especially when we are really hungry and not really willing to spend more than 20 bucks, that's right 20 bucks. You can come here and have only 10 and you'll be satisfied =)
