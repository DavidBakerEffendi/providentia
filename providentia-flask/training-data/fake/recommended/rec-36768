The restaurant is 4.5 stars but I rounding up to 5 because of the boulangerie. The cakes are moist and flavorful, the cookies the perfectly sized and not too sweet. The coffee is amazing, but not because of the taste(it's good coffee), it is because of the lid. They have a re-sealable lid that's really re-sealable. Are you listening Starbucks? The bread is great if a bit overpriced. Good bread is easy to find in Manhattan so I would buy my bread elsewhere.
