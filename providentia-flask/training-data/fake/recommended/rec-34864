This is one of my favorite spots in the area and I tend to send out of town friends here whenever possible. A great sense of humor to go with a great wine list. While not the most budget wine selection, there should be a few choices for most any budget. The staff tends to be very knowledgeable and helpful, so the extensive list should be seen as an opportunity to try something new rather than a daunting. The small plates are quite good, though vegetarians may find their options rather limited. This should not be a hindrance though, it is well worth it to just enjoy a cheese plate.
