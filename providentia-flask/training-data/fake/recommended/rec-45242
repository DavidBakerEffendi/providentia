I live in the area of Kafe Neo and have been hearing much buzz about it, figured I had to check it out! Well all i can say is I'm hooked! I was there twice last week and plan on going again this weekend with friends from out of town. To be honest I thought this was going to be a typical cafe like all others in the area....boring atmosphere, medicore/slow service, pre-made/frozen offerings......I WAS WRONG! This place is the real deal. They have an awesome menu that includes a create your own section! Coffee is great, food amazing and desserts are ridic!! Definitely try the homemade soups...unbelievable! They offer such a variety of breakfast lunch and dinner ... they even have specials of the day! My friends are going to LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!! I highly recommend Kafe Neo!!!!
