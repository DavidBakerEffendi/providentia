Ever since moving to the East Village, I have always been looking on Yelp for the best brunch spots in the area. I've gone to a good number of the top places, and they have all delivered to a certain degree or another. I told my girlfriend how popular Cafe Orlin is and how we must try it because of its ever so glowing reviews. I was pretty excited to go to this place finally! Also, since we arrived a little late for brunch, we got a table on the patio! My girIfriend ordered the salmon salad because she had a snack beforehand. She didn't feel as if she could go for an eggs benedict or any other brunch set entree. But dang, her salad was extremely boring. Salmon, which actually was okay, some leaves and really light sauce. That was her salmon salad. But isn't that what a salmon salad is? Yes, it is. But I guess I expected more flavor, various greens, or perhaps some cheese. A more "Cafe Orlin" version of a salmon salad I presume. I ordered the popular pumpkin pancakes with cinnamon yogurt. Those pancakes had a mushy texture. After the third bite or so, I just felt as if I were eating mush with a bit of pumpkin flavor. I heard from the previous Yelpers that you get bored with the pancakes after a while, so I also ordered canadian bacon(delish). The cinnamon yogurt was just sour. I'm not sure if this was due to the fact that we came a bit late(3pm), and the yogurt sat around. Anyways, the fact is I was pretty disappointed. But the orange juice was good! And I guess the scene too if that's your thing. And maybe I am being too harsh on this place. Probably from very high expectations. The next time I go for brunch, I will get a "brunch" entree but not from here. There are better brunch deals for around $9 or $10 in the area.
