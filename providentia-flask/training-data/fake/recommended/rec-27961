I'm having a moment with my breakfast bowl. I had to take a break because I'm full. But, I don't want to give up the moment. I will finish these two other tater tots. Yes, those ones smothered in pulled pork, spinach, and drippy fried eggs. I even cut each one up into quarters so as to force myself to savor every last bite. This moment joins the ranks with the steak and eggs and home made sausage. I don't eat gluten or lots of dairy, so my options seem limited. But, they're not. This is a place I'm building a long lasting relationship with. They make modifications. They added spinach to this pulled pork breakfast bowl. My arteries feel better.
