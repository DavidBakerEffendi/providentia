This place is great! Thank GOD they opened a new one with tons of space. I went to the original one once and was too uncomfortable to really enjoy my experience, but I have ordered from there several times because the food is so yummy. Also, this place has a full bar! I indulged and got two margaritas, only $5 at happy hour, and I was perfectly tipsy upon leaving. Really good service too, food came out really fast. Other than the screaming hipster children next to me on both sides, It was a great experience! Will definitely return.
