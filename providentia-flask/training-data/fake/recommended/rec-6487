Finally a 5 star place...Yoohoo... The ambience, crowd, staff, service and last but not the least the food are all as perfect as can be! Tried the spring rools, basil noodles and massasam curry and they were all yummm! The sake has to be the best sake I have ever had!! Very very excited about this place....cant wait to go back!
