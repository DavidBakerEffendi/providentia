Our party of 5 each ordered different entrees and all were perfectly prepared and enjoyed.  My rock fish (one of my favorites) was cooked to perfection with a delicious quinoa sauce which did not overpower the fish.  The duck meatballs as an appetizer was unique and delicious.  We ordered the Chocolate souffle with the entree as it takes a while to prepare---what a superb dish!!  All of our desserts were also delicious.  And did I mention that the service was excellent?  Our waiter was very attentive and helpful in explaining the wine and dinner menus.  I will definitely return. :)
