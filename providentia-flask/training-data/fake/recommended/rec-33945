This place loses a star solely because I was finally able to sit and eat after 5 times of going and being greeted with a crazy wait time. Once you're in however, you're good to go. The communal table is crowded but I don't mind it a little cozy- everyone was nice and considerate. I've had the smash sandwich at the Brooklyn location and was happy I branched out into the Everything but the Kitchen Sink. Meatballs smothered in mushroom sauce on a bed of delicious veggies is basically heaven in my mouth. I could have done without the the risotto and side salad but no regrets, right? I wish this place was just a tad closer to work, I'd be here all the time. Definitely give it a try but go on off hours.
