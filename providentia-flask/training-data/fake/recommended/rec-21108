My wife and I took a mini-honeymoon to Vermont this winter, and came across the Inn at Weathersfield through a Google search. It was our first time at a B&B, and we were both impressed by the Inn at Weathersfield. The room was beautiful, immaculate, and well-appointed. The entire inn is welcoming and cozy, especially the two dining areas. The staff, from Chef Jason to the owners, made us feel welcomed, comfortable, and quite at home. Everyone was gracious to a fault, but not at all intrusive.   And the food...Oh, the food.  While the Inn itself was excellent, the food was exceptional. Locally-sourced artisinal ingredients, and all that jazz.  But bottom-line: delicious meals.  From the breakfast (I've never eaten so many pancakes at one sitting in my life) to the pub menu (a veal burger? Come on!) to the tasting menu, the food really took our stay from outstanding to out-of-this-world. Highly recommended.
