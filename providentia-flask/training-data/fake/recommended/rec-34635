Like taking a trip back to Brussels, this pub serves up Belgium beers and various traditional food items. Most notably are the mussel frites (mussels, fries and house made mayo). Also true to Belgium, you pick the preparation. Wine and garlic? Tomato? Wine and cream? Wine and bacon? They even add a couple new styles (ehem.... Coconut lemongrass). All for $20 for 2 pounds! Also on tap is a very decent selection of Belgium beers! The atmosphere is markedly publy but with with a distinctively America pop/grunge rock background. Extra points for Soundgarden's "black hole sun". Best of two worlds?
