Keith McNally's classic French bistro in the heart of SoHo continues to crank out incredible food.  Macaroni au gratin with bacon, Balthazar's dialed up version of macaroni and cheese, has legions of followers (me included) who call it the city's best.  Ditto for the French fries, which are a must order for anyone's first time. Don't expect a lot of quiet, or a ton of space, but if you are searching for an exquisite meal at any time of day or night (kitchen's open until 1:00 Friday and Saturday), Balthazar is a great option.
