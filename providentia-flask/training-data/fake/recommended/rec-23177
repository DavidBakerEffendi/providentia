We went there on Saturday night to celebrate a belated Valentines Day.  I would not receommend this place.  first of all, the waitress refused to acknolwedge me and barely looked in my direction.  She spoke to my husband the entire time.  My husband ordered the Filet Mignon medium well done.  He got it medium rare. So it had to be sent back to the kitchen to continue cooking.  By the time his steak was cooked, I had already finished my meal.  As parents we rarely have the time to go out so when we do, we want good food and a nice experience.  I have no idea why these clueless peeople would give this place a good rating. Maybe they are employees posting reviews so the restaturant looks good.  Anyway, we won't return and we left a tip of $1.38 for the idiot red headed waitress.
