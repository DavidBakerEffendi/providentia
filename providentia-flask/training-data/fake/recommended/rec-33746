We've been here many times.  Only downside is that it's cash only.   If you are looking for Thai food that is more authentic than other places, go here!  I am told from my Thai friend that the food is more northern style Thai but I can't comment on that.  The place is clean and the service is good.  There's a large parking lot in the back.  Everything I've had there was good except the mango sticky rice dessert.  The mango was sour and hard. Other than that, the food great!  Try the Laab pork.  Soooo good!  We keep going back!  5 stars for sure!
