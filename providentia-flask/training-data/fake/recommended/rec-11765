The tacos come with a fistful of crunchy cucumbers, radishes, lime wedges, and a weird grilled onion. Â Squirt some green and red salsa all over everything and then text your friends that you're about to eat THE BEST TACOS IN NYC. If you're looking for the truck on 44th street though, it has moved. They park at 37th and 5th now.
