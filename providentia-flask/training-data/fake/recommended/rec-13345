I came back for the tenderloin!  It was so much food, but I Kobayashied my way through! The goat cheese fritters really balanced out the meat well, and the mushrooms were excellent.  I wasn't thrilled sitting right next to the kitchen during a humid day, but I think this is a new go-to for a nice meal in a great area.
