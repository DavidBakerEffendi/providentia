Can't say enough good things about this place. Â My girlfriend and I have been regular patrons for over 2 years now and it's become a special place for us. The service is phenomenal and knowledgeable about the food, the menu is excellent, and the portions are huge. Great wine list too. They play great music, and the backyard is beautiful in the summer. The atmosphere is warm and unpretentious, but still appropriate for a fancy dinner out. Highly recommended.
