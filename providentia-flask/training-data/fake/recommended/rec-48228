I'm just going to get straight to the point. The steaks were awful. Maybe we went during a bad time but they weren't as delicious as everyone said. Â My father and I ordered the mushroom steak and my mother ordered the chicken steak. My steak had more fat on it than meat, highly disappointed! My mother barely ate her steak. We will never eat here again...waste of money.
