This is, remarkably, Philadelphia's best kept secret.  You would think that word would travel faster and the place would be cramped.  But the lack of trendy yuppies that tend to order Pomegranate Martinis contributes to the appeal.  Kip, the bartender and co-owner along with his wife, Sheri, the chef, is an old-school bad ass with a penchant for gin and rye whiskey.  Ask him to help you expand your horizons and he will happily oblige.  Just don't ask him for a Mojito.   The food is not to be outdone, especially for the price.  There are ritzier places in town that charge over $50 per entree that do not exceed the quality here, with a price cap of $28.  An emphasis on Buy Fresh, Buy Local assures crisp salads, refreshing soups, and in general an inventive menu.  Bear Stew?  'Nough said.
