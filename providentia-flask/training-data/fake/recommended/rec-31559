I'm from out of town and I loved this restaurant! The food was amazing and so was the coffee. I also asked to substitute white potatoes for sweet and wasn't charged extra. We had a fabulous, attentive waiter and even another waitress who wasn't waiting on our table smiled at us whenever she passed. When I originally called to make reservations, Courtney who answered the phone was a doll! A very happy experience and will be back when I'm in Philly again.
