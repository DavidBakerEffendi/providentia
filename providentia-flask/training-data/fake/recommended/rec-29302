Been waiting a long time to get a real Philly Cheesesteak. It just hasn't happened for me every time I've been here. Visited a friend and she took me here and, finally, my moment has arrived. The bread is slightly crusty and perfectly chewy. The finely ground steak is mouse and fatty and infused with cheese once it all melts. I got mine with banana peppers and crushed peppers (these are essential and I mean that). Perfect amount of what I've seen referred to as "the drip factor". Very satisfied.
