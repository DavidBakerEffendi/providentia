The decor is really what people come here for. It's like stepping inside some kind of glitzed out harajuku story book. The chandeliers, the metal interior, the crazily dressed waitresses. Phillip Treacy would be proud. There's something so fun about champagne and chandeliers with your girlfriends but everything else is abysmal. It's hard to mess up Thai food and this place had the worst pad thai I've ever had. It was bland, unflavorful and dry to the bone. It seemed like a popular place to have birthdays so if you're looking to accommodate (and impress by decor) a large group, this place may be suitable. Otherwise, skip it. Pipa has chandeliers AND good food :)
