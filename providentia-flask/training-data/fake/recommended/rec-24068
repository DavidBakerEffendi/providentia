My new favorite! I wish I could have ordered everything on the menu, but since that's not realistic, I will have to come back very soon. The red velvet pancakes are out of this world - along with the coffee, home fries, service, and cleanliness of the restaurant. Green Eggs Cafe...I think I love you.
