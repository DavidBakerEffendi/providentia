Excellent. It's comfort food, so you should already be expecting a hefty meal when you walk in - and with that, you will not be disappointed. For starters, it's BYOB - always a plus in my book, though the creativity at this place would have me interested to see what they'd do with a drink menu. The food was really delicious - the short rib grilled cheese was the most mouth-watering dish I've had in awhile. Disco tots were a great share - and yes people, there is a bit of white gravy mixed in with the cheese - I personally appreciated them not swimming in gravy. The chicken and eggo was a great combo of flavors, maple and tabasco. Pulled pork sandwich was very tasty, but as a warning, it's a dry bbq and not what some people expect (sloppy joe?) when they order pulled pork. Grilled corn was also a pleaser - I'll be ordering that again certainly. Service was perfect - very friendly and attentive. I will definitely be back, and for brunch!
