This restaurant is trying and they do a good job.  Ambiance a little less comfortable than I was expecting (unless you're the lucky two sitting next to the fireplace!)  Expect to sit close to your neighbors, but not so much that you feel like you're in Manhattan... Service very friendly and hospitable.  Menu items all assumedly fresh and all that jazz.  Didn't ask where my fish was raised or caught, but I felt like I could've been in that restaurant in Portlandia.  Sardine appetizer was really excellent - three big fillets and not stereotypically salty at all.  For entree they agreed to make me a dinner-sized portion of one of the tasting menu items and it was very good and appreciated.  Didn't drink anything but the tokaji with dessert, but the wine and drink list looked small and of high quality.  Dessert chocolate hazelnut torte and butterscotch pudding was nothing special, should've skipped it.  Complimentary truffles and cookie square on way out were pretty darn good, though - don't skip those!
