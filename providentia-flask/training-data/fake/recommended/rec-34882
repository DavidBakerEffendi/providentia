yummy - indian burritos! ahaha - i love love parathas so when you can have it all rolled up for convenience - why the heck not?! ordered 1 lamb and 1 chicken tikka on account of the reviews and have to say they were both very good. the chicken definitely kicked my butt in terms of heat - but it was well worth it. a nice mango lassi woulda been nice to cool the palate... my friends had the egg/potato which they said rocked so i shall give that a go next time.
