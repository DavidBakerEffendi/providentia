Love this place! I must warn you its always packed so your pretty much guaranteed a wait. Its well worth it though. The environment is great you would think you are in Cuba. The food is so good I've never been disappointed. The appetizers are perfect because you just get a small plates worth so you can still have room for dinner. Its byob. And the outdoor seating is perfect when its not too cold or hot. Overall a great spot.
