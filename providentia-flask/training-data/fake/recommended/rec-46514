This place was perfect.  The rustic ambiance, the service and the food were spot on.  We had a very sweet and down to earth waitress who was food knowledgeable. My wife and I both went to "The Forge" after seeing Chef Forgione on TNIC.  His food lives up to the hype and he is a great guy.  We went one evening for dinner and two days later for drinks.   The bartender, Kerry, is an awesome guy who can really mix it up and will not rush you out of the bar.  Best sweet bourbon I have ever had. Chef Forgione, who was there both evenings, even came out to our table to say hello, 2X.  Humble yet confident, very kind and a rippin' chef.   We had the duck breast and the sea scallops, both registered out of this world.  If you are in NYC, Marc Forgione should be at the top of your culinary list.
