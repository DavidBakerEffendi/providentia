Went in on a busy night last week. Mac and cheese was great. My burger was medium rare by default, which was strange. The only other place that doesn't ask how I want my burger cooked is McDonald's. My blonde bartender, did not catch her name because she never introduced herself (nor did she ask how I wanted my burger cooked)... Was unfortunately a bit all over the place. I did try one of their signature cocktails, the Yellow Plum, as per recommendation of the other female bartender working, Alisha. She was very attentive considering I saw her taking tables as well. She used jiggers to make my drink as opposed to the free pour the other bartender used. I hate to nit pick what some may see as a small detail but I know proper pour is important when making a signature drink, so her taking the time to properly measure my drink was appreciated. Overall, nice atmosphere but it seems service is both hit and miss. I can only hope that it's a hit next time I decide to patronize the yellow plum with friends.
