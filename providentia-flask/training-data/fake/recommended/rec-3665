I love this place..the menu has most of the things that I crave in a Chinese restaurant...BBQ meats on white rice, BBQ meats on noodle soup, Young Chow fried rice, lo mein, hot meat over rice (squid, beef, tripe, pork chops,etc). Nice, quick service, tasty and cheap... Â  This is a great gem in Chinatown.
