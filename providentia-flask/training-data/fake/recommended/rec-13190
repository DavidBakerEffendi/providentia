I went in January 2012 on a Saturday night date. The location is annoying to get to but once inside your mood changes. The decor is dark, intimate, sleek and not too noisy. The food was delicious, absolutely delicious. Â They start you off with a potato and chocolate soup (not extraordinary but different which I liked, I mean potato and chocolate, who thinks of that!), the calamari as an appetizer was amazing, so crispy and that dipping sauce they had was YUM. The best calamari I've ever had and I've had lots! For the main course I had the Pan Seared Black Sea Bass with Grilled Maitake Mushroom...WOW. I love seafood and this sent me over the moon. If you're a seafood fan, you MUST try this..you won't be disappointed. The mushroom was so delicate and flavorful I wanted to order it again ( I didn't). And to finish we shared a dessert but i can't remember what is was..some type of ice cream..it was very good. The cocktails were good also, I had a bellini. Overall, one of the best meals I've had in NYC. Yum! P.S. The waitress pissed me off a little, she tried sitting us next to the door. Really lady? It's freezing out. Luckily, I was with a gentleman and asked if we could be seated further inside. She said we had to wait a little. "That's fine, we'll wait" :)
