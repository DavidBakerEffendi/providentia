this is a really lovely place.   pros - warm, sophisticated atmosphere - fantastic bar + drinks selection - varied menu with someone for everyone - professional and knowledgeable service - beautiful presentation of food, and everything tasted really fresh cons - we had issues ordering wine, some bottles were out and others had substitutions of different years compared to what was listed - the food was so lovely, it was almost surprising that some of the sauces were just a little bit bland.  the skatewing dish had a beautiful bright red sauce artfully placed on the plate, but i was surprised to find that it just had very little taste at all. the dressing on the chopped salad had no bite to it, either. i'd definitely come back, although i'd probably opt to order something else.
