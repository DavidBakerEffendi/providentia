Tasted and reviewed by: Cake Addict The entrance to Pio Pio's Hell's Kitchen outpost belies a spacious dining area that's cozy despite all the straight lines and rough concrete. Surprisingly, for a place wrapped in wood planks and sticks it's quite noisy even when the dining area is half empty. They seriously need to invest in some sound dampening. Host's are quite responsive and friendly, smiling more than the typical New Yorker. The service isn't the fastest, but staff is usually friendly and on top of it. The food is great for the price. The matador combo is a sure-fire hit that has a little bit of everything. It comfortably feeds two (if you're ravenous) to four. It comes with their signature succulent roasted chicken and green Peruvian sauce on the side. Ask for extra sauce. It's deliciously creamy with a manageable spicy kick. Other dishes also deserve a try, especially their Peruvian style Chinese fried rice and seafood salad. Unlike the entrees the desserts are not consistent. On unfortunate days cake is dry and stale and the flan slightly rancid. If you're feeling lucky, put your bets on the Pio Nono and/or the Tres leches. Both will satisfy most dessert cravings, but for hardcore cake addicts the portions are too paltry to share. Ample seating options and the menu's adequate variety makes this Pio Pio the perfect place for indecisive groups or a casual date. Overall, Pio Pio is not the most consistent, but the 8 out of 10 times that it is on it's very good. A note from Marisa V.: A quick call to Pio Pio and the manager informed me that they can accommodate food allergies, just call ahead and be specific!
