Outrageously overpriced and disappointingly Mediocre.  The smoked trout salad bordered on send-backable, being garrishly overdressed with a seemingly pure-sugar sauce, which drenched the greens to soggy and overpowered the smoked trout.  For $17!  Entrees are $25 and up, desserts are $12 and up and nothing stood out, except for the price.  The table bread was stale.   The couchy seats are too deep.  The staff was the best part, friendly and attentive.  If I'm spending $50 - $75 a person, I want to be starstruck.  Sad to waste money and a meal.
