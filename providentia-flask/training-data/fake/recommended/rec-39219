I'm not a vegan, but I love this place. It's looks like a crappy little hole-in-the wall restaurant... and I guess it is, but the food is great. I love that they offer sushi as well as traditional chinese food. And, I can finally go out to eat with my vegan and vegetarian friends! The food is fresh and delicious. Definitely check it out!
