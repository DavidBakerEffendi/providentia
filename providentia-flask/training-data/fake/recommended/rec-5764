This is the first place in Philly that has the sophisticated taste I'm looking for.  I took a friend out for her birthday (and for the UC Dining Days) and was incredibly happy with my choice.   We started out with 3 amuse bouche of suger and chocolate covered fried dough, a cucumber mint with tapioca drink, and a bite sized cheese filled pastry.  Then we had our first course.  I had an amazing goat cheese and beet dish with pesto sauce on the side.  My second course was fish with quinoa and mango sauce, which was good.  Then, to cleanse our palates, we had a blackcurrent sorbet - again delicious.  Finally for dessert, I got a tomato creme brulee, which was interesting and a nice twist to the usual.   Overall, I was impressed by the innovative ways the chefs were able to put ingredients together and still made it work amazingly well.  I'll definitely be coming back!
