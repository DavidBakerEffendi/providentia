We always bring our customers here for cocktails after work, and they do a great job. This visit, the server was pushy, and I probably would not have given the 20% automatic gratuity if given the choice. Â But normally, it's good service and a fun environment. It's fun to share the different apps with clients, and they always seem to have a good time.
