Have to agree with previous reviews that this restaurant is at the top of my Philadelphia list. Coming from the Jersey Shore we take the AC Expressway just as all the Philly people are heading the other way. One of the great things about Philly is the BYOB small Italian restaurants. Friendly and accommodating we find these restaurant to be reasonably priced with good food and a friendly staff that is easily engaged. Having been to at least 25 in the past several years this one has to rank among the top. Food was excellent, reasonably priced, and to borrow from another reviewer portion sizes were realistic. The owner Jo-Jo (hope thats right) and wait staff were easily engaged in conversation. We will be back
