I return again again and again for my favorite sandwich in NYC. Consistantly the best Pork sandwich knocks me out every time. The Salads are fresh and tasty with bold flavors. All the best things you would expect from this magnificent cuisine are reduced down to the perfect lunch. Don't be impatient if it takes a couple of minuets the attention to detail is evident in every bite. Banh mi Zon is a tiny immaculate jewel of a place with kind and warm owners who are always there.
