FRESH and delicious seafood! Great selection of appetizers as well as entrees. The only problem with the menu here is deciding what to have! Luckily, the staff is mostly friendly and willing to make recommendations. Outdoor seating, BYOB, and parking round out a great experience. Make reservations, especially in the summer and Fridays during Lent.
