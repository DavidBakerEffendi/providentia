Hello Salt & Fat. Goodbye to my  waist line. I felt like I gained an instant 5 pounds after my dinner here but it was worth it! We were a table of 4 and these are the dishes we had: Pork Belly Tacos - *one of my fave dishes* I loved the crispness of the tacos. Each of the ingredients in the taco worked so well with each other. Super tasty. Thinking about it now makes we want to run out and get an order of these babies. Pulled Pork Sliders-  well seasoned, tender lovingly simmered to perfection and served on tasty buns. The pickle adds just the right amount of acidic balance. Crack & Cheese -this is not a dish for everyone. It is really heavy since its fried gnocchi smothered in bechamel sauce and topped generously with bacon. This is probably one of the restaurant's signature dishes so I think its at least worth a try. For me two bites were enough but I still appreciated this dish. Caesar Salad- this was a decent salad. The dressing is homemade with fish oil and eggs. Oxtail Terrine - oh the crust. The crust on this was amazing! i could have eaten this dish all by myself. Its not your typical terrine since it comes in a cube shape and hot. The terrine itself had all the beefy fatty goodness you expect from oxtail. The roasted mushrooms and sauce were the perfect complement. The only thing I wished is that they would serve this with some slices of bread. Meatballs - very tasty and fresh although nothing really innovative or special about this dish. Fried Chicken - very crispy and moist but the flavors reminded me a bit of Shake'n Bake. The portions aren't huge. Most of the small dishes come with 3 pieces but the flavor and the richness made my belly feel as I had eaten a huge banquet. Next time i might try to make more room for dessert .
