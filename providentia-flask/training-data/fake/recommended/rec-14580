"VEGAN" chickpea burger had BACON in it!! Was really excited that there was a place in the neighborhood that labeled and served food as "vegan", but will NEVER eat at this place again. I was chewing, tasted something off, quickly spat it out into a napkin and saw chunks of bacon and bacon fat. SO AWFUL and insensitive business practices to either share equipment or make huge mistakes like this. If you're a veggie, DO NOT EAT HERE.
