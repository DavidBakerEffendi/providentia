Boy is this place packed during lunch!  The line goes by pretty quickly.  The space is so nice and clean.  My girlfriend and I shared a pan of pizza topped with proscuitto, onions and mushrooms.  I honestly could have eaten the whole pan of pizza but I hadn't seen my girlfriend in awhile, so it was hard to eat and talk at the same time.  Also, she was on her lunch break so we were limited with time.  I need to go back!
