Great selection of beers and hearty German fare.  I ordered the spicy sausage and kraut with an IPA, which definitely hit the spot on a cool fall afternoon.  I'm always jealous of the people who can spend their time whiling away at the outdoor tables in the summer -- such a good place to sit and drink and watch the South Slope traffic pass you by!
