Even though this was my first time eating here I am giving it five stars. My boyfriend and I had a really enjoyable time here and the food was excellent. When we pulled up to Castalia 997 we were u use because it is located in a little strip mall. We entered and were pretty impressed. It was nicely lit and had really nice decor. We were given a wine and martini list. I chose the fignilla tini and if you like a sweet, smooth martini I recommend that one. An older man also greeted us and shook our hands. I'm assuming it was an owner or manager. That was really nice. Our waiter was also really nice and hospitable. We later learned his name was Andres. We decided on an appetizer and got the speidini(sp). It was the perfect size for the two of us and was absolutely delicious. We also go complimentary bread and olives, which I never seen before but they were good. The menu has a lot of choices for chicken, pasta, fish, veal, etc. I chose the salmon which had a champagne reduction, was topped with crab meat and along side it was spinach and potatoes. The portions were good, and the entree was amazing. The crab meat was what really topped it off. My bf had the pollo arrows to which is chicken with sage, rosemary, and garlic with a white wine butter sauce. His entree also came with spinach and potatoes. He loved it and cleaned his plate pretty quickly I must say. We had no room for dessert but when we come here again we will def have to try! There was also live music which was really nice. My only little complaint is that it isn't that big of a space and the music just over powered and it was hard to talk/hear. The same older guy came back and talked to us again, too. We were really glad we found this place (:
