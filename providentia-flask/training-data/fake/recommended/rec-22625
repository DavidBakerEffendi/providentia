Pretty damned good comfort food. If you're on a diet you probably want to go somewhere else. Good craft beer, cool people and good value. Definitely stepping into a different place for the neighborhood which is a nice change of scenery (not that the scenery here is bad, it's great - this place is just nicely different).
