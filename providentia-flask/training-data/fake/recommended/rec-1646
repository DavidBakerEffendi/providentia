Visited geno today, what a WASTE'!!!!!!!! I ordered meat, provolone and mushrooms. The mushrooms were straight out of a can, terrible, they don't even grill them. Barely any provolone and the meat was fatty and tasteless. Â The worst part was I asked for hot peppers, they are outside and guess what, they aren't even sliced for sandwich style. Never again.
