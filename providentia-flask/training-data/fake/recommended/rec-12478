Such a friendly, low-key restaurant! My boyfriend loves coming here for a quick casual dinner and it's definitely our favorite place in the area. Even though it's close to Times Square, the prices are reasonable and the people here--waiters and other patrons--are always so friendly that it feels like a small neighborhood pub. I've never had to wait for a table and it's the perfect place to watch a game over a great meal (although the booths are slightly uncomfortable). I've had most of the pasta dishes and the only one I didn't love was the gnocchi--it was a little bland for me. Anytime you're in the neighborhood for a Broadway show, skip the overpriced, overcrowded, super-touristy places and come to Cielo for a casual, intimate meal.
