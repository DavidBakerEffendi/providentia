Went here on a whim with the hubby and my 2 year old on a Saturday night-ordered a few appetizers for us all (cheese, olives, salami, calamari) had a really nice meal. Â About a month later-attended a family lunch there-again, great meal, great service. Highly recommend. family friendly, laid back bistro setting. Not at all fancy or over the top.
