Just got back from having dinner here and I gotta tell you, for a Saturday night, this place was not busy at all. There was 2 other parties there when we arrived and by the time we were done, we were the only ones left; it was about 8:30-9:00. I got me questioning how they're going to stay in business with no traffic. So we went here for the first time based on the reviews here. To my surprise, it's inside a plaza so I didn't have to worry about parking.  Food was just average for us.  The Roti Canai was good but I wish they had cut it up a little for us so that we're not tearing apart. The Tom Yum soup was watering, not too much flavor to it.  The Golden Sack was good.  It's like eating a spring roll but with a dumpling version.  The Som Tum was good and very fresh.  The Seafood Curry that we request to be a 5 star spicy was not at all spicy.  The Green Curry with chicken was good and so was the Yum Nua.  Nothing really stood out for us, hence the 3 star rating.  The atmosphere was nice and the service was slow but wasn't bad.
