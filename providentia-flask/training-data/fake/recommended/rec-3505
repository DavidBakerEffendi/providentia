I wanted to like this warm-farm-fresh, red-and-white place. I'd been there several years ago and I'd liked the crowd and the food. Now, however, the prices have gone up and what was solid then is now overpriced ($10-14 for apps, $26-$36 for an entree). For this price point, you're looking at the top restaurants in the city, which this place just isn't, for several reasons: (1) It's overcrowded and VERY noisy. "I can't hear what you just said" was a frequent refrain to my dining companion, and he was half yelling. I was afraid to move for fear of knocking over the next table's water glass and I could not breathe. (2) The service is slow when it's crowded. It took a long time for them to give us our menus, and when there was a problem, it took the restaurant forever to get my food back to me (the pork was red in the middle, indicating that it was undercooked). My companion had already finished most of his food by the time mine came back. (3) The food is not imaginative enough. It is solid -- the pork was tender and juicy and the thyme on it was very nice -- but that isn't enough to get me in the door, without some other surprising combination of flavors. The zucchini saute, which was reviewed well in NYMag, had some nice nutty bite, but it lacked the freshness of really top-notch produce, plus the cheese on it was slightly overbaked, which made the dish too oily. I'd rather go elsewhere. (For these prices, Telepan, on the upper west side, for example, has consistently served me amazingly tasty, creative and fresh food, there's plenty of breathing room, and the service is much faster. The one time they ever goofed up in the kitchen, they apologized and comped me the food. Â Or if you want closer, Westville is only a few blocks away, is $5-$10 cheaper per entree, has food at about the same quality of the Red Cat, and they, too, have elbow room.)
