I have not eaten here in some time, but even now I remember how bad this place was. While visiting Philadelphia with my family, I asked a passer-by where I could get a good authentic Philly Cheesesteak and he kindly pointed me in the direction of Abner's (telling me it was the best place in town).  Well, I apparently asked the only other tourist in a 5 block radius or had some local playing a cruel joke on me because Abner's was anything but good. The beef was flavorless and rubbery (I almost stole the salt and pepper shaker to take with me), the cheese only exacerbated the problem, and the bread roll was terrible.  I could have microwaved a piece of beef jerky, thrown it between 2 pieces of Wonder bread, squirted some cheese whiz on it and still made a more appetizing sandwich. If this is best place to pick up the city's signature food, I'm surprised there has not been a mass exodus out of Philly in search of sustenance.
