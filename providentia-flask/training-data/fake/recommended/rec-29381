As I said in my first review, the food here is top notch. I went back again because I really did enjoy myself, until the check came (see previous review). The square roll was quite interesting and the ceviche app, while not necessarily ceviche, was really good. It's simply pieces of fresh fish with a little marinade. But to start with such nice fresh fish is great. The green tea is also a winner, for $2 with refills, I would go back just for it! All-in-all it is a very nice restaurant, good fresh fish, and rather quick for a sushi place. It seems that my first experience was an anomaly. The price is a little high, but the quality is to match. I am excited for their new space, just 3 doors down. I wish them the best of luck in their new location.
