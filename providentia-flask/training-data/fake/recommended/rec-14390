Rude, stupid assholes. First, I am a NYer, born and raised here and my age is probably higher than the total number of reviews written for this place. I know all about rudeness, I am a rude MFer, but being rude when you are running a business is a major sign of assholism. I never ate there and never will. I read all the reviews of this place and was pretty excited about going there. They sounded like they had it together. Their web page lists "Curb Side Service." In other words, since you won't find parking, they will bring the food out to you. Smart. I phoned in the order (several items) and showed up 20 minutes later on a hot, B USY, summer night. Two-land street, but one is for cycles. And tourists eating outside, yammering and shouting everywhere. Pulled into the bike lane in front of 31 Prince St. (NOTE: they are 2 stores away at 27 Prince; it's no more than 20 feet west.) Phoned to say I was there and would someone come get my credit card. Middle-aged bitch w/attitude says, "You have to come in. We can't send somebody out." I mention the web site and curbside service. I say I'm in front of Double RL (a shit RL store) and she says, "Pull up in front of the store." I'm 20 feet away, mind you. I decided fuck this shit and leave. Stupid assholes. How to lose a customer, who really fat and eats a lot of pizza.
