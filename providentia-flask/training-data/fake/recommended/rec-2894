What can i say? Green rock will you marry me? I love this place, and I'm pretty sure it loves me. Cash only you say? Who cares- the ATM across the street is free for you to make a whole lot of poor decisions you might regret come Monday morning (or lets be honest on any morning cuz weekday drinking is fun here too). Â Drinks-strong and not too pricey, bartenders- probably the most awesome bar staff in the universe, food is good too. Only warning is beware u don't get stuck in between the dartboard and dart throwers on the way to the bathroom, u might get popped. Green rock, thank you for being my neighborhood go-to.
