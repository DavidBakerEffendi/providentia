My girlfriend and I randomly walked by Vin et Fleurs tonight and figured why not give it a try.  We are extremely pleased we went in! We were greeted right away by the manager (or maybe owner) who greeted us in French and sat us down right away.  The manager/owner was very friendly and praised my girlfriends native level French skills, and seemed humored by my Americanized French accent.  I guess i better work on my phonetics for next time. We had a couple Chimay Bleus, which at 8.50 each is a great price, especially in New York.  I had the Tuna Salad Nicoise, which was perfect.  The tuna was the best piece of grilled Tuna I've had in quite a long time.  The remainder of the salad had a perfect balance of flavors and was just a big enough portion to be filling, but not too large.  My girlfriend had the salmon croque monsieur, which was rich, full of cheese, and had fantastic flavor.  Overall, we thought the dishes were executed extremely well, and were very reasonable (12.00-14.00 each). The service was excellent and the waiter and bartender were friendly.  Overall, it really did feel like stepping into a home in France and enjoying an intimate meal with friends. As we left, the manager/owner said "a demain?," or, see you tomorrow?  We won't be back tomorrow, because one can only eat so much rich French food per week, but we'll be back next week for sure.
