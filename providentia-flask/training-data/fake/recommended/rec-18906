Horrible.  Just horrible. I should've taken all the empty seats/parking spots as a sign. After the waitress went on and on about how horrible the veggie burger was and how I shouldn't order it, we both ordered the grilled "veggie" wraps and a side of mixed vegetables. Aside from the carrots none of the other "steamed" mixed vegetables were the original colors of the vegetables.  They were WAY overcooked and soggy. The wraps only consisted of mushrooms, peppers and a crapload of American cheese.  Tasty but not exactly the health conscious meal we were looking for. Oh and no sweet potato fries.  What diner doesn't have sweet potato fries??   We couldn't wait to get out of there... but we couldn't.  Had to wait for our waitress who was chatting over in a booth somewhere.  When she finally came back we got our check and went to pay and whoever was taking our money was chatting on his cell phone the entire time. What a crappy establishment.
