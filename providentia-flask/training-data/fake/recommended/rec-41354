Wait. Is it just me or does everyone that works hear have a stick up their butt? Went there last night 1ish maybe and the waiter was a huge jerk- acted like we were just really bothering him. It was me and my roommate and trust we aren't demanding. There were about 3 tables full in the backroom. This is the second time I've been here and I forgot what it was called but I knew it as the place with the cocky a-hole bartender. We were leaving a bar and were hungry and I liked the decor so thought we'd give it another try. We sat, waiter was a jerk and then the bartender came over and took some glasses off our table and I asked for another stella and he said "blah blah bulgarian cha cha" and walked away. I kid you not. WTF. Are they acting like that for ambiance? Are they trying to preserve some nonexistent small pub/tavern attitude? I don't get it.
