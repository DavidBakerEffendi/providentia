My toddler son is allergic to peanuts and tree nuts so eating out can be stressful.  Cross-contamination is a big fear.  The staff answered all of my questions and more.  They were SO NICE to us.  I could tell that it was genuine. Our waiter knew about our issue before we even told him because the hostess made him aware immediately.  Staff communication really made this a great experience for my family.  Our waiter assured us that the kitchen staff was alerted as well.  Another member of the wait staff came over to chat with us about her experiences with kids with food allergies.  I'm very new at this so it's great when people show that they care!!  Thank you so much to the staff at Sabrina's Callowhill!  You made my week! Oh, and as usual, the food was awesome!  We will be back!!!
