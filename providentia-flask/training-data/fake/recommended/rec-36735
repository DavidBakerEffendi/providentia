OK, I got to give it up to my friend Chef Brad Farmerie.  Public is pretty freaking fabulous! Here's the back-story...I am a forever fan of the Thomas & Fagiani's in Napa, where Chef Farmerie is also Executive Chef.  So no doubt, this super foodie just had to check out his original Michelin-stared digs when I was in NYC. It's everything super sexy, industrial-chic with service to the nines. I arrived and had to take it all in. Our server treated us super special, and you know I'm a sucker for that VIP feeling...and that's before we even had any food!  I knew I was in heaven once I saw that there was a 5-course vegetarian tasting menu complete with one of the same stellar dishes that I eat every time at The Thomas. OMG! The vegetable crudite is like being home (in Napa) all over again.  And trust me when I say that rest of the dishes are worth every pretty penny we spent. Paired a light Pinot with it all...done and done! To cap it all off, we were offered a lovely glass of dessert wine (Sherry, I think). Sent me off with good vibes and more importantly, good memories. THANK YOU BRAD & EVERYONE AT PUBLIC WHO MADE OUR EXPERIENCE FANTASTIC!
