Really excellent. Sit in the front, not the back! There's plenty here for vegetarians, and although it's expensive, it's well worth it. If you sit in the back, though, you'll miss most of the experience. Try the yuzu honey drink even in summer, it's really awesome. So is the goma tofu agedashi. And if you speak to them in Japanese, they will answer in Japanese, so if you're not confident in your Japanese, watch out! But the staff is very friendly, the food is quite good (if, again, a bit expensive), and I will definitely be back. !
