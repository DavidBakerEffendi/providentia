The ambiance was actually not bad. My husband enjoyed his burger and Imperial pint. I ordered the chicken pot pie. It's one of my favorite comfort foods and I was fully ready to indulge. It was really disappointing. It tasted liked canned chicken soup reheated with a slab of puff pastry slapped on top. It made me sad. I'm not saying don't go here; the service was generally friendly. Just stick to the burgers, I think.
