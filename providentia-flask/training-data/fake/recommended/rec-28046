The Shio Black ramen is delicious! I just got back from a trip to Japan and the noodles here really hit the spot. The broth is really rich and oily, a sign of high quality stock and the ramen itself was perfectly cooked. I did have some problems with the spicy gyoza appetizer. It wasn't on par with what you'd expect from Japanese "pot stickers." The bottom wasn't crisp at all and essentially it tasted like kimchi wrapped in soggy dough. Also, the place is relatively small so it may take a while to be seated. Keep in mind that they only accept cash!
