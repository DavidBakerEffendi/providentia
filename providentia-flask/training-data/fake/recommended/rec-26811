The quality used to be good but not my last visit on Mother's Day. The clam they served need to be in the garbage can. They use BLEACH to wash the clams or seafood so their is no smell(not fresh). You can taste the bleach. Never order any seafood in this restuarant. Matter of fact, not coming back any more.
