So this is my other five-star Italian restaurant (tied with La Locanda del Ghiottone). I just can't say one is better than the other. I've eaten at L'Angolo well over ten times in the past two years and it's always been good.  Food is consistently tasty and service is always friendly. This review is based on my last time here which was this past Friday.  We made reservations for 3 for around 7:30.  My boyfriend and I took my mother as this place seems to be my go-to spot for taking Mom to dinner. I need to rave about the Orecchiette all'anatra.  There is shredded duck in this pasta dish which I was on the fence about as I don't remember ever having duck.  However, I like to try new things and boy am I glad I did!  I will now get this dish every time I go.  I loved the flavor, the pasta cooked al dente, and the duck-  I am sure duck conoisseurs will cringe at this description- but it tasted like the best chicken I ever had...so moist and flavorful. Don't forget this is another little BYOB and I believe it is cash only (double check when you call for reservations).
