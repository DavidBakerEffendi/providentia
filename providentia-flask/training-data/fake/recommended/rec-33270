This is a fine, fine establishment. Myrtleberry Margarita and bacon wrapped dates are superb! Go for tapas or an entree. Go for yummy homemade goat cheese croquettes, red wine  marinated hangar steak, sangria or oysters.  You won't be let down with any aspect of food or service. Olea is a precious gem.
