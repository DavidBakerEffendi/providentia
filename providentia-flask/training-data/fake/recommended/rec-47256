Great brunch... Had the salmon benedict which was full of flavor.  The baked eggs looked huge and *fantastic as did the Banana French (both of which I'll be back for). I got there by noon and by 1 it starts getting busy and fills up quickly... I'd suggest getting there on the earlier side for a Sat brunch otherwise there's a bit of a wait.  Crowd is laid back but quite a buzz to the place as the brunch crowd fills in.  Heading back for sure...
