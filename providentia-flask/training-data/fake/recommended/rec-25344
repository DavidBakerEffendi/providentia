I had my birthday dinner at Alta last night and the food was OUTSTANDING. I had read a bunch of positive reviews and was skeptical that the quality of the food would actually live up to the reviews-- but it did. The brussel sprouts & avocado relleno stand out as particularly awesome. They honored our reservation for 8 and provided great service. Of note: Â it is a little hard to find and can be a bit noisy, but if you're up for awesome food in a cozy environment, it's the right choice.
