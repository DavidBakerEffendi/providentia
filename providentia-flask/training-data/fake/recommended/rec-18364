I have tried almost every hot dog on the menu, as well as many of the specials, and all have been great. The dogs are cooked well and have a great snap when you take a bite. The french fries and dipping sauces are also delicious - I recommend the HD sauce. I have also recently tried the burger and onion rings, however both were just ok and probably a bit overpriced. Stick to the dogs and fries.
