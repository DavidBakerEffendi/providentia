My best brooklyn homie took us to this place on a late sunday evening after falling in love w. his new apartment. Holy crap..can we just talk about the space and location. First off, he has a washer and dryer in his apartment w. a backyard. I'm not done...he has a huge living room but his bedroom is even bigger. I'm not even exaggerating for ny size..it's big for california. Oh my life sucks. Back to rye: The service was okay  but the food was unbelievable. The meatloaf sandwich was so good and I cannot stand meatloaf. The fat bf ate the whole thing. I had mushroom lasagna that was spectacular. Let's not forgot my favorite: MAC AND CHEESE. A little on the salty side cause the fat guy added bacon but  I ate around it. However, they did charge my bf twice, which made his hate for ny even more intense so I'm taking applications for a new bf that loves ny.
