I love Ruthie's for their pizza--it's a hands-down winner for me and I compare all other pizzas in the area (and there are a million) to it. Their BBQ food is good, although there are definitely others in the area that are better. They regularly feature specials and are usually pretty unique and good. This place is especially charming during the warmer months when they'll play live music on the patio at night and you can grab an outdoor table (though you gotta go early since they fill up fast!), open up a bottle of wine, and enjoy a casual meal. I do laugh when I see other reviewers comment on the surliness of the owner. I think he would probably turn to stone if he ever smiled and he def could use a lesson in customer service. But nonetheless, the food is great and I keep coming back for that regardless. Take the casualness of this place for what it is and enjoy!
