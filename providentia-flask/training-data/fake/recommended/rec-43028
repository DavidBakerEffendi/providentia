I blame this restaurant for a significant jump in my cholesterol. While my doctor isn't so pleased I'm still relishing the incredible eats and treats from this fantastic little shindig. I love that there's a fortune teller front, I love that the doorman is suited up complete with a fedora. Between the two of us we started with oysters and bone marrow poppers. OH MY GOD - bone marrow poppers. I wasn't excited - I'm picturing some gooey fried number. It was puff pastry with a dollop of marrow on top, it was creamy buttery, coronary causing goodness. Followed that with and ENORMOUS steak and a perfect paella relative. Add in a couple more perfect cocktails, a fabulous waitress and a totally reasonable bill and you've got the perfect stop two on Elektra's ridiculous manhattan mixology tour.
