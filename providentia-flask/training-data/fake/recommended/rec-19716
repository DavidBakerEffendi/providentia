I've been wanting to try this place for so long and finally got to go here today. I ordered a Maine style and Connecticut style lobster rolls. They were so good. The bun was perfectly toasted and buttery. There were so many chunks of lobster in each roll and it really exceeded my expectations. The price of $16 is cheaper than most places and I will most definitely be back here!
