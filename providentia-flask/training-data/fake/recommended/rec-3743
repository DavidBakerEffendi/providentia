Some of the best food I've eaten. Popped in by chance with two friends from work. The Mussels are to die for, I'm going back just for those alone! But of course we didn't eat only those, the salmon, pork tenderloin not to mention the Profiteroles, yum. Atmosphere is just as lovely, intimate, friendly and laidback. Recommended in a heartbeat.
