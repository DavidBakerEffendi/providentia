Ever go to place and everyone is ordering the same thing, but its brunch so you want something brunchy?....Yeah....I should have had the chicken.... Because brunch here (specifically their egg dishes).....I can't even put it nicely....was absolutely disgusting....and while I FELT like throwing up, my friend actually DID throw up her food....so now I also question the cleanliness and preparation of the disgusting food we had. I considered going back to this place to try out their lunch or dinner menu...but the fact my friend's body simply rejected the food....there is something WRONG...and I'm not going to give this place a chance to make me throw up.....
