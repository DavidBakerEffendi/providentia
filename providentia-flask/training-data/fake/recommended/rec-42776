First thing you'll hear from anyone who has been to this place is the WAIT TIME. I mean it is RIDONCS. We showed up around 7.30 and had a 2 hour wait so we just frolicked in the neighborhood because with my new found Ramen obsession, I just HAD to try this place with the 5000 reviews (oh and Kanye loves it too). I think I had gotten the Tori Ramen and the broth was so spicy/flavorful. Just writing about it makes my mouth water. I had also gotten the pork buns (normally I hate pork) but decided to try it based on our waiter's strong recommendation and I was so surprised because I loved it. Also, this place is pretty loud because they blast the music so don't get overwhelmed if think you just walked into a club.
