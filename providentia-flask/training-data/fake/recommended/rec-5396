I do really like a few things about this place: A fine place to grab a drink on a weeknight. French fries are like CRACK I can walk there Friendly staff:) But on the other hand the rest of the food I've had has been mediocre. And I had one experience that got under my skin... It was my friends 30th birthday (morning after). She was about to head home but we decided to go out for ONE mimosa. Walked by BSBH and saw the chalkboard outside for $5 mimosas so we went in and each ordered one. When the bill can it was for like $20 and I mentioned the chalkboard, The bartender looked confused and looked outside, Turns out it was the chalkboard for the place next door Bistro La Minete that had the $ 5 mimosa's .The sign was right in between the two buildings, it was an easy mistake. I playfully suggest that they give the drinks to u for that price.. like come on you need to be competitive if the place next door has the same thing for half the price?!?! AND it was my friend's 30th birthday, we were practically the only two people there and we each got ONE mimosa,COME ON. needless to say they didn't give us the $5 mimosa's. :( thats the only reason we went in there in the first place. Shame on us I guess!
