We got a groupon and went to dinner last night for bbq and what a pleasant surprise! I had the bbq combo platter which has ribs, pulled pork, chicken bbq, and brisket. It also comes with a corn bread and two sides. Everything on the plate was DELICIOUS. The ribs were tender and juicy. The pulled pork was so flavorful and the brisket I couldn't get enough. My husband ordered steak medium rare and it came perfectly the way he wanted. The sweet potato fries were excellent and the collard greens were close enough to what we had in Charleston. The waitress was very attentive and helpful. We didn't need to use any of the bbq sauces there because everything was so flavorful already. Overall it was a great experience. Even my 18 month old loved the ribs and the fries. Would definitely recommend to friends.
