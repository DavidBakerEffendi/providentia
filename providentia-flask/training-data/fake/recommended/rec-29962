Had lunch at the Mediterra after hearing about it from a friend. Have mixed reviews from good service to over-salted food. The menu was not too exciting either and seemed a bit lacking in what I hoped would be some tasty mediterranean-style choices. The appetizer plate with three different middle eastern spreads was very nice, so we were off to a good start. However my family, friends and I all had different main dishes and found them each of them to be over-salted. One of our party had a seafood stew that was a daily special, and it was so salty she could not eat it. My brother's french fries were cold, but the waiter brought another order promptly that were nice and hot. I did tell a manager that we thought the food was good but way too salty, and he said he would tell the chef. So despite a nice location, ambience and wait staff, don't think I'd return. Because 3 hours later I'm still feeling thirsty!
