I came here with the whole family on Saturday night. The place was PACKED, but luckily I made a reservation...or so I thought. Our reservation for 5 was for 8:30, but we were not seated until 8:50. The host didn't really seem to care we were waiting, and when I went to check on how much longer it would be, he told me "it's not even 8:30 yet" at least 10 minutes past our reservation time. Finally we were seated and ordered our meal and a bottle of wine. The Malbec was delicious. Then we waited...and waited. We waited an hour for our food. The food was all delicous (salmon, ahi tuna, roasted chicken, NY strip - a little more fatty than usual), but the wait time was ridiculous. I will probably be back, just not on a weekend.
