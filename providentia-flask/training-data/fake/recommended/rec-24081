I'd like to preface this review by saying Mexican food - authentic or not - is my absolute favorite cuisine. I came here with my boyfriend because a friend recommended it but I was little disappointed with the food. It was very pricey for ordinary, nothing special Mexican food. Also, the portions were smaller than usual so that added to the fact that it was expensive. However, the guacamole was really good and well worth it. The meal itself wasn't particularly good or bad though - so 3 stars. The restaurant itself was beautiful and the wait staff was attentive. It was a fun atmosphere and I would go back for drinks and guacamole - but not anything else.
