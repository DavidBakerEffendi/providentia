I had the pleasure of eating at Parc last weekend while visiting Philly. We were a large group and they ended up seating us in one of their general dining rooms at two tables. We found this to be very nice, because it can sometimes be overwhelming to have 18 people at one table. I also enjoyed being among the other diners. We ordered off a set menu and had a couple of options for each course. To start the evening they brought us a bread basket. It was hard to stay out of because the breads were tasty. For my first course I went with the escargot. They came out in a hazelnut butter sauce in a small pot with a little bread on the side. I found the dish to be quite rich, but in a good way you would expect from escargot. I thought the flavors worked well together and overall enjoyed the dish. My entree was the New York strip with garlic spinach. The strip was cooked perfectly and had a great, buttery crust. It cut easily and had a great flavor. I very much enjoyed the steak. I am not a huge fan of cooked spinach, but this one I liked. It wasn't overcooked, which I think helped a lot. The disappointment of the night for me was the dessert. We got a small variety plate and nothing stood out for me. I thought this was a great option for a night out in Philadelphia and would happily return to check out the whole menu at a later date.
