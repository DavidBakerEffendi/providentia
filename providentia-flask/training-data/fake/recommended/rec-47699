People, let's not kid ourselves! This is some of the best pizza in America. I've been to "Modern" at least five times and this pizza is better. My friend and I split two half and half pies, four different combinations, all absolutely delicious! The beers...pretty average, which is why I can't give the fifth star, but the vibe here is quite nice!
