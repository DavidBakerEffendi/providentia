I had a wonderful experience here. The food is really delicious. I recommend trying a seafood appetizer - the tuna tartare and kampachi are amazing. The main courses are also very good though I wasn't too adventurous and just took the burger. However the duck fat fries were also great! Overall a great experience. The waiter was very attentive, maybe a little too chatty, but very kind. Maybe because there weren't many people there.
