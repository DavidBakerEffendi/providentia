I've only been here for lunch. They have a small, weak vegetarian selection. I don't eat meat so I can't speak to most of the menu. The token veg option used to be a deviled egg sandwich, which was disappointing: egg and mayo slathered between slices of mediocre, crumbly bread. That's no longer available (gee, I wonder why?), and they've replaced it with a margherita pizza. The pizza is honestly the worst pizza in Hanover -- and that's saying a lot considering EBAS. It tasted reheated -- the crust was sort of stale and the cheese too firm and chewy. Â  The last time, I ordered the gnocchi without the bacon. The gnocchi was soggy (I prefer it with some bite), and the sauce bland. The caramelized onions are a nice touch, though. There are no vegan options at all, FYI, unless you get a salad. Hanover is conservative in many ways, and I understand Pine is not trying to cater to a cosmopolitan demographic, but it needs to wake up to the 21st century and start offering a larger selection of veg*n food, as well as more exciting, flavorful fare. I've never heard anyone say they want to go to Pine for the food. My rating for the food alone would be a 1, but I'm giving a 3 because of the decor and presentation, and because the lunch prices are very reasonable for a "fancy" restaurant. I also love the way they bring out your tea.
