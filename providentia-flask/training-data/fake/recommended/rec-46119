Help! Been sitting at my table for an hour and no food yet! Place is only half full. Will we ever get out of here? Wrote this Saturday at about noon.  Arrived at your restaurant at 11:00 on the dot.  I could understand the wait if the restaurant was full, but there were several empty tables.  My daughter loved her burger with truffle oil and my irish benedict was good also.  The hollandaise sauce was excellent but the hash was a little dry and bland.  Ordered an iced tea half way through my wait but it wasn't delivered until I asked again after my meal was delivered an hour after ordering it.  If this review was based on your food alone, I would give it another try.  But an hour wait for food when the restaurant was only half full was asking a little much, even though the waitress was very friendly and apologized multiple times for the wait.  I still left her 20 percent because I didn't feel like it was her fault, but I won't be back.
