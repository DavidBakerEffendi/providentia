Excellent and reasonably priced, this place is a hidden gem right along the River in East Falls and the Chef is always changing the menu and adding new and exciting things to try!  The Pizzas are excellent especially the Margherita  and dare I say, better then Vetris?  The Gnocchi and Ravioli are two of my favorites and  the Mama's Meatballs are to die for.  Try the Crisp beer if you like, it's one of my favorites as well.  I've tried a few of the cocktails and the Manza was quite good!  Also, I tried their brunch and can't wait to go back when I'm in Philly!
