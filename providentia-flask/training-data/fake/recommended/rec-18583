The worst alfredo pasta i have eaten in my entire existence. I made this account just to warn others of the garbage that is prepared here. I ordered take out & after trying a few bites , i heated up some alfredo sauce i had at home and mixed it in with Savvis pasta. I can imagine everything else here is also unbearable.
