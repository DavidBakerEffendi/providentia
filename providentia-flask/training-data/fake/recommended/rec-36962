We walked into Pommes Frites and told one of the Filipino ladies working there that we heard one of the sauces tastes like kare-kare (pronounced ka-reh ka-reh, a Filipino oxtail soup with a peanut butter-based sauce). This immediately grabbed her attention and she said, "Kare-kare? You mean the peanut satay?" She gave us a sample, and yeah, it was pretty close to kare-kare, but a little bit sweeter. The frites here are nice because they're a bit thicker than the shoestring frites I've seen at other places, and I think the extra surface area is ideal for all the dipping sauces. We tried the peanut satay, parmesan peppercorn and the mango chutney, as well as the standard mayo. The mango chutney was my favorite because I liked the sweet/salty combo. My wife and my best friend both liked the parmesan peppercorn best because of its strong peppery flavor. I actually preferred a mix of the standard mayo and the parm/peppercorn because the mayo mellowed out the pepper so it wasn't too strong. My only gripe was the fries seemed a bit "old." We did however get a hookup because my friend speaks Tagalog and talked them into giving us the sauce on the side so it wasn't too messy. So if you plan on going to Pommes Frites, bring a Filipino friend who speaks Tagalog and see how far that takes you.
