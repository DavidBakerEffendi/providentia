First thing you notice is the storefront is in the style of a Caribbean joint. Inside the decor is mostly comfortable with booths and tables, though the disco ball spinning on the ceiling is kind if distracting. The food itself is really good. We split a bunch of starters such as the foie gras doughnut, lamb, fawntans, and frog legs. The first three are very good but I've never had frog legs before so I don't really have a point of reference. The cocktails are also very good and pretty strong. I ordered the flank steak which was cooked really well. Red and juicy. The chicken and waffles also tasted really good. About my only reservation is that it took awhile for the entrees to arrive, about half an hour, and the place was just about half full. I can't imagine the wait during a full dinner service. That being said if you're interested in a long and comfortable dining experience this is a good place to check out.
