This is my first time to give a restaurant only one star. If you are American, maybe you would like this place because the updated decoration and the relatively clean environment comparing with other Chinese restaurants. However, the food is terrible. I happened to sit at the table where you can see what's going on in the kitchen. As far as I observe, all the food is pre-made or frozen. They are NOT fresh! I saw the chef in the kitchen took a piece of scallion pancake from the refrigerator, which from Â the package you can tell it's the frozen scallion pancake you can get from supermarket. Then the chef took a small bowl of mapo tofu from refrigerator, he heated it in the microwave, 2 mins later, mapo tofu is served.... I don't know why this place is so packed especially on weekend. The service is ok, the food is horrible, besides the food are all pre-made/frozen, they add MSG in every dish. The only good thing about this restaurant is the price is reasonable, but hey, you are eating frozen food, how much you would pay for it?
