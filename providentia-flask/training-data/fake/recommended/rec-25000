I have been a frequent diner at beso..... Until tonight. Once a month , my girlfriends and I go out to dinner. This time we chose Beso. Reservations were made for 6 pm. On the phone the individual took down out reservation for a party of five. It ended up that two of the girls ran 10 minutes late. They would not sit us until our complete party arrived nonetheless, we had no other option then to order sangria at the bar when it would have been easier to sit at the table we would eat dinner. Food was good. Service was horrible. We had just finished eating dessert. Mind you, we had drinks, salad, appetizers, entree and dessert. It was obvious that our waitress did not enjoy her job. Midway through dinner I even commented how unpleasant she was. Literally we just finished eating dinner and the waitress comes over and tells us.... I'm sorry did you guys know there is a party after you? In so many words, I'm not quoting her, she was kicking us out. As no time when the reservation was called did the gentlemen say on the phone there would be a time limit. Asked to speak to a manager when the host claimed he was one. He looked like my 18 year old little brother. He said he would make room for us at the bar to eat. We didn't want to sit at the bar and ps the bar is so small people were already sitting on top of each other. When asked to speak to someone higher than him , a man came from the bar area. When we explained to him our disappointment he said it wasn't his fault that people are waiting. How about correcting the situation? Its not our fault either that people are waiting. In a nutshell he did not make the situation better. It's a shame because I was planning on booking a bridal shower there for my sister. Made me think all they cared about what money not customer service. I will.never ever ever be back nor my 4 other girlfriends. So much for a girls night out which with time constraints. He can BESO my you know what!
