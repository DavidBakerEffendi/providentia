Tight space, 6-8 counter top seats tops. Excellent service, (flirty order guys/cooks) letting me charge my phone RIGHT NOW as I continue to type this review (n me not allowing my phone to actually charge). Greeted me in Mandarin (I speak Canto tho...), chitchatted w my friend en Espanol. Food smells, looks and tastes amahzing. Love E Vil! p.s. photos to come...
