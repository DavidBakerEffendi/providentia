We waited an hour for our food. 1 crying baby, 1 very cranky teenager and 2 melted milkshakes later we received salty over poked food. I understand it's a holiday but it's still dinner time. It's not worth it. I left disappointed and with a belly ache. The wait Staff was great so it's a shame their quirky fun menu doesn't pan out.
