I've only been for brunch but it was awesome!  First off - mad props for the brunch panini names such as Sweet Ass, Sir Oink-a-Lot, Wake and Bake but my favorite was the Notorious P.I.G - word! seriously though - food was great, service was great and the backyard patio was really nice!  I had the Pass the Hash which was great!  Highly recommend this place for some good eats!
