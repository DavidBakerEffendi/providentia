I like it!  The staff was cheerful, helpful, and excited.  They laughed at our group's antics as much as we did and gave us complimentary dessert! The food is delicious and nothing felt greasy.  Our European friends who have traveled to the middle east said it is very authentic as well. When they get approved for booze it'll be perfect!!
