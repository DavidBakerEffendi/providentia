I want to give this place 4 stars as I feel it has potenial however my experience was just OK. Everything I tried was tasty but in very small portions. I understand where they are going with the tapas theme but still too small to really enjoy. Even their drink the Pumpkin cocktail was delicious but mainly all froth. 2-3 sips and all left in a big Mason jar was cream. The 2nd drink I ordered was an improvement (can't remember the name but it was a bourbon type. Maybe called the Duck Buck). We had the oysters which was my favorite, a salad and ceviche but all it did was tease our taste buds. I think for the price they should beef it up a bit. I will give this place another try as their menu does seem interesting but I will be sure to go with a light appetite as I do not want to go for pizza after my meal.
