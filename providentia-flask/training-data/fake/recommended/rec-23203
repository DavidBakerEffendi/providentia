I generally give very generous reviews.  So if a place gets 1 star from me, there's something very, very wrong. For some reason, people who live and/or work in the Princeton area seem to think that this place serves up incredible food just because the menu items are pricey.  And you know what? I just smile and nod, but I never am the one to actually -suggest- eating here. So SCG gets plenty of chances to get it right in my book. But EVERY time I'm here, the meat is simply overcooked.  I've had the pork chop, which used to be the best thing on their menu until they started overcooking it to death. Likewise with the steaks and burgers.  Apparently medium rare means "cook it grey with a sliver of pink in the middle."  I want my beef juicy with flavor, not dried out, thank you. I will have to say, though, that the service is always pretty good and the decor looks quite nice (though I see that many people complain about the acoustics of the room).  That, however, is not enough to warrant anything above one star in the face of overpriced and overcooked meat.
