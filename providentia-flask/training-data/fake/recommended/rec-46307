I'm not a restaurant reviewer type, but I know what I like and I know what stands out, and MP Taverna nails it in all categories. Service is caring and present and attentive and detail oriented. Food is best in category: Best calamari I ever had ... best scallops ... best mussels ... best rack of lamb ... best quail. Slam dunk. Plus ... and it's a big one: lots of eye candy, lots of energy, music was loud but never too loud. Prices are excellent for the quality ... Only one item was ordinary: my roommate's salmon ... it was fine, but not spectacular like everything else we had.
