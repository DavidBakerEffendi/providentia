Food: ~pork bahn mi (5 stars): with thick chunks of nicely barbequed pork, some even with fatty pieces!  Lots of veggies with nicely crusted bread, this huge sandwich is now one of my favorites.  $5 ~traditional bahn mi (4.5 stars): best traditional one I've had.  The cold cuts were thick and balanced in flavor, the pate was not overwhelmingly livery, and the sauce was delicious. $5 ~pho (4 stars): decent bowl, clean tasting, not too much msg.  I just wish they'd had tendon in the bowl.  Noodles had a good chew, perfect for a cold rainy afternoon. $6 Wait: ~a table just cleared when we came in.  This place is tiny, but off the main strip, so turnaround is pretty quick.  Staff is very nice. Definitely coming back, especially for the bahn mi!  You really can't beat this quality for the price!
