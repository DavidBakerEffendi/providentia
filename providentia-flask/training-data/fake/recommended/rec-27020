hands down some of the best Indian food I've ever had. their samosas and chutneys are literally mouth watering and their main dishes are always fresh and delicious. My husband often orders lamb dishes on the spicier side and they're always perfectly seasoned. I order the chicken and veg dishes and have a difficult time choosing the preparation! their Korma is one of my favorites as is their chicken tikka masala. after poor experiences and extraordinarily high prices at the Jewel of India, this authentic takeout place is truly a gem.
