Bakery - YES - EXCELLENT - can't go wrong and the selection is fantastic for pastries too. Deli - well, not so good.   If you follow my deli reviews here is the lowdown: Bread - Star Meats - Star Service - well, not so hot.  Rude, pushy and don't understand english well and don't care to Toppings - okay, not all that I would like in a deli nor all given. Overall - Star, which really comes from the bakery side...
