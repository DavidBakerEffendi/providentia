I had such a great experience at this restaurant that I wanted to write a quick 5 star review. The decor is really colorful and neon-ish, sorta like you're in a new strip club, but a classy one--if that's a compliment, which I totally meant it to be. The dish I ordered was very flavorful and filling. I have no idea what it was called--I still have not memorized Thai dishes, other than Pad Thai. I also loved the house music being played even in the daylight (4pm). I really appreciate places that play electronica in the daylight! Great find. Thanks yelp!
