Fell in love with Osteria Morini the night we got engaged. It came highly recommended and did not disappoint! The staff is highly knowledgable on the menu and wine list. We started with a pork sausage pasta dish that was really great. Next the Petroniana- a crispy veal cutlet covered with prosciutto truffle cream and spinach, it was unbelievable. I would highly recommend Osteria Morini and I can't wait to create new memories there.
