Amazing food! Great location, great place.  Horrible service! After having an incredible meal, our waitress asked if we would like dessert to which we said maybe, just need another minute.  The host, Ben, then proceeded to bring the check to our table immediately and tell us that they need to use the table for someone else.  After spending over $200 for the meal and then being asked to leave by the host so they could sit someone else was unbelievable and unacceptable.  The food was so fantastic and I would almost consider not going back because of the host, Ben.  A place like this should be ashamed to have such poor service
