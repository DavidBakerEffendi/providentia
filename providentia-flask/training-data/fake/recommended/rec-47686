Excellent food, embarrassingly horrible service.  The waitstaff attitude is not unlike Mean Girls.  The first few times I've been there I've gone in the afternoon when it wasn't crowded so obviously we didn't have to wait, and the food was amazing.  I was very impressed by their thin crust pizza and walnut/apple salad.  The aesthetics were quite unique, especially the bathrooms and I liked how they handed your change to you in a glass - pretty cool.  The last time I went there was early on a Saturday night with my husband. We were told there was an hour wait yet I saw an open booth and there was no line.  The hostess was curt, condescending and somewhat aloof, like we were bothering her.  So we left and I'll never set foot into that establishment again.
