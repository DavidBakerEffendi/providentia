Based on yelp and nymag, I tried this place last night and was very pleased with the meal. It's a cute neighborhood restaurant, and as other reviewers have mentioned, it's a very good value. The food is simple and classic and very fairly priced for the neighborhood. We got the three course prix fixe for $26 (before 7pm) which was a very good deal. I had the caprese salad, the chicken piccatta and the tiramisu. The salad wasn't the best, but the chicken was delicious and the tiramisu was excellent (house-made). Service was a bit spotty, I think because it was so early. But the staff was very nice. In a neighborhood full of mediocre food, this is a low-key spot I will return to.
