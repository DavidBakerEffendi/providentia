I'm a foodie from San Francisco.  Everything was good.  They did not accommodate special requests but did give a half order of meat balls.  The noodles were fresh and delicious. The artichoke appetizer fried well and the thin slices of lemon were perfect.  Us west coast people desire clean bathrooms as NYC has old buildings and? W/C,  Lavatories superb.  Wines were good.  Need more by the glass wines.  A must try.  Meat balls were like home made.  And not over cooked.  BELLA it's my word for Antonio's
