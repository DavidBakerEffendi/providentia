Mmmmm!!! A friend and I came here one summer evening! I really like everything about this place Â - the service was on point, the decor is simple and the food was wonderful. We had the Shrimp Provencal, Lobster, and Chocolate Bruno. The portions could have been bigger, but most semi-swanky places like this don't pile on the portions, so that's fine. I'd go back!
