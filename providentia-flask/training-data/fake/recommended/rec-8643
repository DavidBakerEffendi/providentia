Simply amazing pizza and wings. Unless you're looking at some fancy, gormet wood or coal fired competition, this is the best pizza around. From the crust, to the sauce and cheese, each individual component is good quality and tastey. The line can get loooong, but it moves quickly and runs parellel to the bar for your sipping enjoyment.
