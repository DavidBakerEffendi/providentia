Came for the first time 4 days after hurricane sandy and had an extremely pleasant visit . Â Our waitress was very helpful and answered all of our questions . The food was absolutely delicious especially all the specials . I would defiantly come back here again, even though the prices were alittlemoresuiting step it was totally worth it !! Thumbs up !!!!
