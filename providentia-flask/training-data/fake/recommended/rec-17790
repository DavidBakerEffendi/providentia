This a great place...thank you Yelp.  The service was excellent the food was wonderful.   The rodizio was excellent.  The chain Brazilian steak houses have nothing on this place!!!!  The cod stew was salty, but besides that all good.   Atmosphere is great...please do not judge the place as you drive to it!  It is a jewel amongst rocks...
