They have great ideas for their sandwiches.  For example, they made Turducken sandwiches during the Thanksgiving time. My all time favorite is the steak and egg sandwich. They have specials all the time. Monday is $5 sandwiches, Tuesday is a bbq meat plate.   They have ice cream cone with candied bacon bits for $1. They are featured in Food Network's Outrageous Food. They are awesome. The End.
