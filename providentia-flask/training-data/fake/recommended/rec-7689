Entering Sabarsky is just like entering a Viennese cafe.  Deeply carved wooden walls, Wiener Werkstätte accents, and large wooden hangers for the daily newspapers.  The food and "relaxed" service is authentic as well. They offer a selection of German/Austrian entrees and desserts.  Most of the entrees are simple but very tasty.  The wursts, spatzle, sauerkraut, and veggies were excellent.  One Americanization is that Weisswurst is available at any time.  The coffee is very good, but not exceptional.  The one downside was the poor pretzels. Overall prices are reasonable, the food authentic, and the atmosphere pleasant.  This is a nice stop when visiting the art museums in the area.
