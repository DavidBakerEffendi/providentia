Why they received 2 stars. First time we went had a awesome waiter,  who was very well spoken and knew his stuff.  We each ordered 3 items and that was the perfect amount to fill you up from these small plates. The octopus was awesome,  pasta dish with mushrooms and eggs fantastic and my small steak great.   Same waiter who is fantastic.  The food was disgusting!  We both looked at each other and said this waiter is gonna have a tough night.  I never send food back and in all fairness I should have just mentioned the food was way off.  When serving such complex dishes if your off with  a ingredient things can turn for the worst.  So save your money and move on.  Another Princeton flop.  Only one we like is the Peacock Inn.
