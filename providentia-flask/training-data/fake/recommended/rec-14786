I love this place. We've been coming here off and on for years. We are talking seriously fresh Mexican street food. I've seen some complaints about the prices in some previous reviews, well all I can say is, you get what you pay for. I've always had fresh lettuce, freshly chopped onions, cilantro and tomatoes, and homemade salsas. For me it's worth a couple bucks more than I've paid at other taquerias that use packaged ingredients. It is cash only, so be prepared. Oh yeah, the best part is, it's a BYO with a great outdoor seating area. Perfect for chilling on a nice summer night.
