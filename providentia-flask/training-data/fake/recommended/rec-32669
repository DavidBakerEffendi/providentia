Las Ramblas would probably get my vote for best tapas in the city. It's about the size of my cubicle, but definitely more comfy and inviting. Â We were there on a crowded friday night and didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes - the bartender was really nice and knowledgeable about their impressive wine selection. Always try one of the specials, they are sure to please. The staff was incredibly attentive and kind. A great spot for a date.
