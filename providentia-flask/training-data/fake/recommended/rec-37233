Lunch was delicious, a real treat!  Service, not so great.  I think there was only one waiter for the whole restaurant!  Perhaps since it was sooo cold?  Perhaps since everyone is partied out from the holidays?  Maybe the other waiters on the schedule called in sick?  Who knows?  All I know is that the quality (and the price) of the food was not helped by the quality of the inattentive, very busy waiter.
