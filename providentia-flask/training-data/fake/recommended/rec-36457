Balthazar is French brasserie perfection!  They are open late in a perfect soho locale, with an extensive wine list and exceptional French cuisine. The building was converted from a leather wholesaler's warehouse to a gorgeous airy space. I dined here during a sister's weekend gathering in January; three of us from Washington State and the fourth from Southern France. Although we had a late reservation, we still had to wait for a bit to be seated. -Not an issue with such a fun bar and lively patrons. This is definitely a noisy, trendy, crowded restaurant teaming with chatter. While a popular and glamorous place, we did not spy any celebrities or their paparazzi.   The quality of our food was superior!  The salads were made with incredibly fresh ingredients, the entrée's cooked to perfection, and dessert we shared, exquisite!While I understand the wait staff constitute some of the most elite of waiters & waitresses, ours must have been assigned too many tables, as we were given very poor service. I will definitely make a trip back here next time I'm in NYC!
