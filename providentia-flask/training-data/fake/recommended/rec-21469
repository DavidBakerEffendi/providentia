I saw this place on Food Network (will prepare to be booed or have things thrown at me), and we decided to go check it out one day after spending an afternoon drinking at frankford hall.  That was maybe 6-8 weeks ago, and since then we have gone back 4 times since, and am currently working on tasting every single thing on the menu. The beer selection is always top notch, if you're a "beerie" (not sure if that is even a word, but it is now) you will love it, they always have a selection of great craft beers, and knowledgeable barkeeps to make sure you get a beer to moisten your pants. Enough about beer, now to the food... The beer battered pickle spears need no review, if you need someone to tell you how amazing they are... check your pulse.  The onion "rings" are amazing too, however be careful with the sauce... I watched a gentleman on a date take an over ambitious dip and place it in his mouth, and proceed to damn near choke to death because of how spicy (and amazing) the dipping sauce is. In regards to the entrees, I have probably had damn near everything... and everything has been top notch, sadly I have only had lunch / dinner here, and never brunch, but hopefully that changes. Honestly the most amazing thing I have had there, is the smoked coconut tofu club, I have a friend with the palette of a 6 year old, and doesn't eat anything, and he asked for another bite after trying it, so if youre in a group, grab it, and try it, and enjoy. But again, all the food there is great, do not hesitate to order anything
