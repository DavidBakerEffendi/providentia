So Delicious. I had been here a couple times and decided to choice it as the venue to host my rehearsal dinner, which hasn't happened yet, but I know it will be great! My fiance has never been there, so I took him last night so he could see what him and his guests were in for - a treat! The staff was so much fun, nice, and fast!! I can't say enough wonderful things about this place, but I hope it speaks volumes that I trust the success of my rehearsal dinner in their hands. Can't wait!
