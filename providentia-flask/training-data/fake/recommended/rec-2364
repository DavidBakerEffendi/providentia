Place has no sign so it's Little difficult to find. Had the original, chicken, and pork. Had all 3 spicy. Original : not a huge fan but edible Pork : good but I've had better. Missing the bbq flavor. But still very good. Chicken : definitely the best of of the 3 and the best chicken bahn mi I've had. There is no radish/daikon in the veggies but I'm not complaining because the veggies are delicious. The bread is ridiculously good and it comes out nice and toasty. At $5.00 to $5.50 it is fairly priced.
