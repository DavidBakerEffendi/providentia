This place was so so great! My boyfriend and I went at 5 pm on a Sunday and didn't have to wait at all. In a city where I feel like I perpetually wait in lines, it was particularly nice to sit right down. This place is also super hip! You don't typically expect a Thai place to be cool (at least on the UES) but this place was decorated so nicely and the staff was young and very polite and helpful! I loved just being in the restaurant haha. Ok now to the actual food. The Up Thai spring rolls were amazing!! Let me say it one more time - amazing!!! Stuffed to the brim and light and crunchy. Best spring roll I've had in recent memory and the dumplings were really good too. I had the panang curry which was perfectly flavorful and had just the right amount of spice. My boyfriend had the pad see ew and it was also amazing. Oh and the best part - it's affordable! My bf and I each had two beers, we split two appetizers, each got our own entree (with enough leftovers for lunch and we aren't light eaters : )) and paid less than $40! Where does that happen?!?! Needless to say, this will certainly be our go to neighborhood Thai restaurant. So happy to have found this gem!
