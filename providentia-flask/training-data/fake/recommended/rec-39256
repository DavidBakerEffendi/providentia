My husband and I tried this place last night for a very rare "date night". We're both full time working parents of a 1 1/2 year old with another on the way, so these nights are coveted. I had read amazing reviews of this restaurant and was excited to go. We consider ourselves "foodies" and have been to most of the high end restaurants in the area. When we arrived, right on time for our reservation, we stood at the host station for about 3 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. We were seated in a very small side room, which didn't give us much of the restaurant ambience, but was okay. We started with the Mussel app, which was decent, a creamy, white broth, but nothing special. We also ordered the cheesy bread, which was amazing. I could have just eaten that the whole night and have been happy! My husband had the hanger steak with mashed potatoes, again just ok, potatoes very bland and nothing special. I had the diver scallops with shrimp fried rice. It was very salty, the rice wasn't anything I couldn't get at a Chinese or Thai restaurant and the scallops were again, just ok. Our server was very dry and short, did his job, but not personable. Honestly, I really wanted to go crazy over this restaurant, but it just didn't do it for us. Maybe it was what we ordered? I wouldn't say I'd never go back, but with a number of really great restaurants in and around Hartford and West Hartford, this wouldn't be a top spot for me. Maybe we'll try again in the future.
