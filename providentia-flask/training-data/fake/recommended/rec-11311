As my days become counted here in nolibs/philly, I have to reiterate that N3rd is my ultimate FAV resto in this city! The ambiance, the beer and the food. I can NEVER go wrong (yes that's a hard statement to come by). I still go for the yoush, but more often I find myself trying (very hard) to change it up - so with that.. I now LOVE the tomato soup (has just the right kick), CHILI AND EGGS OMG is all I have to say, and the interchanging specials get me from time to time. I will miss N3rd dearly when I move, but I know whenever I come back - it will be my first anddd last stop =)
