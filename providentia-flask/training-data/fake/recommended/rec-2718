My best friend and I came here to split a pizza and grab a cocktail late one Saturday afternoon. We had such a difficult time deciding because we wanted everything on the menu but we chose the Neapolitan Meatball pizza and it was to die for! The service was kind of meh. We had to flag down our waitress a few times. Â However, she did recommend a drink from their awesome cocktail menu that I truly enjoyed.
