As far as I can tell, Penelope is an adorable place with decent food and a great vibe. The decor is really quaint-- perfect for a brunch-- which is what I had here. The food was not anything to write home about, but it definitely hit the egg-spot. I had the penny-egg sandwich (why is it called this?), which was sort of boring, but the bread was delish. My friend had the "I am Sam," which was dryyyy.. they overcooked the eggs pretty bad. But that's ok. We had a fantastic time and I'll have to come back to try out their lunch stuff.
