I really love this place. It's always packed and I often have to sit with strangers but this is actually kind of fun. You may have to wait for a table on obvious nights & times. The service is uniformly friendly, which is very unusual for Chinatown where a "here's your food, now get out," attitude often prevails. Now, the food - AWESOME and CHEAP. How can you go wrong? I usually get the tofu & vegetables = amazing. They are famous for dumplings but I'm a part-time vego, so I haven't tried them yet. One of my Chinatown faves.
