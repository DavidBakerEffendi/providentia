Hands down best falafel AND hummus. The green falafel is made with cilantro/parsley but you will not taste that notorious cilantro/parsley taste some people hate!! The hummus is served warmed, falafel hot and both made on the spot. Another thing I love about this place is that they use actual silverware instead of plastic utensils if you eat in. But large windows and the sun hitting the front makes this place stuffy.
