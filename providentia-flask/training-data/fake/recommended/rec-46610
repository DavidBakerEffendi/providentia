Short review: The first time I went to Moshulu's was in 2009.  The dinner was so fantastic that I still rave about it to this day. The second and third time I went to Moshulu's was 2011 and 2012.  Went for lunch both times and, well, was not that impressed.  Not sure if it's due to it being a lunch and not a dinner menu, but the food seemed adequate at most compared to a lot of the other food I've eaten elsewhere.  But this is coming for a veg*n-- I don't eat meat, so I'm not sampling any of the finer cuts of meat that people probably order when they do go there.  But for a veg*n eating there, it's just "okay".  If you're a veg*n, I would recommend spending your money elsewhere.
