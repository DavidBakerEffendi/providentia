I'm going to have a mixed review on this restaurant. The staff is great, very attentive & on top of things... The food was just so so.... We ordered the tartare as an appetizer & it was very bland.. But the octopus appetizer was good. We ordered the pasta and steak as our appetizer & they both were lacking flavor!!!! I really can't figure out with how small the menu is, how bland the food is, & how overpriced it is, how there so busy? The only nice thing is the decor...
