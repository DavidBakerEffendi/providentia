The food was delicious. We got the frisee salad with poached egg, the gnocchi, and the scallops. we ate every single speck of food on our plate, payed our $85 bill, and were starving. The portions are teeny tiny for the price, especially the frisee salad for $12 which was nothing more than lettuce, an egg, and some lardons. Good but minuscule, almost laughable small. They also have a corking fee which makes no sense in a city with fabulous BYOs. We won't be returning but it is not because of the quality of the food.
