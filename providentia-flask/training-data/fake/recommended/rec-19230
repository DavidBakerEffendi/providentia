Bourbon IPA Burger Total cost? $15 on Wednesdays. Seriously this may be the best dinner deal in Philly; two drinks and an entree for way under a Jefferson?  I love it.  The only reason why I'm not going with the 5/5 the burger was the hot girl at the bar but not the Kim Kardashian (weird analogy I know, but it works here).   Service was spot on, thank you to the girl who filled my water 7 times.  It's people like you that make me happy; simple things people and this place does it right.   I had my reservations about the bourbon being any good; i was expecting Beam but whatever it was it was delicious and perfect when served neat. As someone from Austria once said; I'll be back.
