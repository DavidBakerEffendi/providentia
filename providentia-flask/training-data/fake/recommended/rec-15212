It was our first time in Philly.  My daughter picked up a menu and we all decided to just go with it.  That turned out to be a great decision.  The cheesesteak was delicious.  My son ordered the grilled cheese.  He said it was the best ever.  The bacon cheesesteak was delicious and so were the fries.  You would think that a place this busy would leave no time for the employees to take their time and talk to the customers.  Not here!  The employees were so nice to us!    When we go back to Philly, we will definitely come back.  I recommend it!
