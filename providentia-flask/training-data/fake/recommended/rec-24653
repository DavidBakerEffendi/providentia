I seem to have severely underestimated this place. The first few times I went, I thought, eh, pretty good, but nothing to write home about. Then, somehow, Il Bambino got to me. I drank the Kool=Aid. And boy was it good. The paninis are excellent (even for those of us who don't eat pork!) and the desserts are delish. There is nothing I have had here that wasn't awesome. They make a lot of the non-meat things with truffle oil, which automatically gives them an extra star. I also really like the atmosphere. The guy with the hat who seems to run it (owner? manager? I don't know) is really nice and accommodating. The place tows the line between hip and homey. I dig it. It's comfortable, but sharp. I don't know what happened, but every weekend now I crave the Fun Guy (that's a rec--you're welcome). Il Bambino, you really get me.
