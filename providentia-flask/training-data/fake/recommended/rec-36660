I just moved to SoHo so of course I had to try this New York landmark.  I decided I would start with breakfast because it looked like it was easier to just walk in without a reservation.  I was by myself and they put me along a bank of doubles in the back and I was facing into the large room so I could see all the goings on. So imagine having breakfast on a movie set and you're in a scene in a Paris bistro. The couple next to me was from Buenos Aires (there's no mistaking that accent.)  The only part that was missing was the Parisean rude.  Actually the staff was very nice and didn't mind my asking more than a few questions about the menu.    I had the egss en cocotte.  The place was full and everyone seemed to be in some kind of intent conversation.  It was fablulous.  The eggs were perfect.  The coffee was delicious.  You have to like strong coffee.  I will definitely be back.
