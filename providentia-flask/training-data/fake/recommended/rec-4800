Urika! I've found the ideal lunch spot where I only have to spend $6 to get full on super delicious lamb, rice, lettuce and pita bread. The line may look long but they are very fast at taking your order and sending you away with a wonderfully smelling to-go bag. (I would recommend getting a platter of anything over a sandwich just because it'll be very likely that your sandwich will get messy.) I've only ordered the lamb, which I was so incredibly happy with, but I also had a bite of someone else's falafel and it was rather dry and not so flavorful. So if you're a vegetarian, maybe look elsewhere for your falafel.
