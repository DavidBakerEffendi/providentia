Why does one write an update when it's 5 stars both times? Because I need to give 5 stars to the Memphis Taproom Beer Garden, of course!! I love this place. For the record, I hate hot dogs, but the Memphis Beer Garden serves some amazing, and completely gourmet, hot dogs. Love 'em, and the selection of canned beer in the beer garden is as much fun and interesting as the beer inside. Thanks, Memphis, for being a great place to hang out in all seasons!
