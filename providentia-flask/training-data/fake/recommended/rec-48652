Went on the first night last Friday and they ran the place as if they had been open in that location for years. Flawless. We even tested the staff by showing up with a party of 8 which grew to 10 and not having a reservation! They fit us in without batting an eye even though they were hoppin'! Highly recommend getting pitchers of margaritas as it saves you a few ducats. For eatin's I had the seitan/tofu fajitas which were incredible. I ended up sharing the meal with a friend and it could have fed a third had anyone else been hungry. I will be haunting this place more often than I care to confess.
