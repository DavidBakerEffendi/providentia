Guac (de la Hoya) was amazing! The corn was unbelievable! Black bean enchiladas were great. They even made one of my kids a cheese quesadilla (those with "selective palettes" will understand how wonderful that can be when such simplicities aren't on the menu). This place is hopping and for an hour I felt much cooler than I really am. ;)
