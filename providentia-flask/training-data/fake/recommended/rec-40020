I was a huge fan of the good dog and would give it 5 stars until very recently. I couldn't stop raving to everyone about how incredible their grilled cheese and burgers were. When I arrived today, the waiter told us that the chef had made changes to the menu on Thursday. I ordered the grilled cheese, which did not come served on delicious bread and with fresh greens like it used to. Instead, it was very basic and plain tasting. The burger and BLT both looked rather basic as well, but no one had any complaints. I'd say that with the changes they made, this place is moving towards serving more basic diner food than fresh and unique dishes. It's still a cool bar to check out in a great area with a nice selection of delicious beers, but I'd say you should get dinner elsewhere and stick to coming here for the drinks.
