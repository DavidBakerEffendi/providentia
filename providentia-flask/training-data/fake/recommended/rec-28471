After spotting this place on the Dine In Brooklyn spread and checking out their menu, what started as calm anticipation blossomed into full grown juvenile excitement. I headed there with the girl (she made us reservations for 8:30).  When we arrived it was quite apparent that the reservations were not necessary, but we were told a few hours before it was quite crowded.  Regardless, reservations are a good thing as I forecast this place gets big. The lovely waitress greeted and sat us.  Currently, they don't have their liquor license so we brought some lovely beer to pair with our dinner. We placed our order. (1) Watermelon Salad to start (2) Fried Chicken (Spicy) and a side of Crispy Grits for the man (3) Shrimp and Grits for the woman Watermelon Salad was quite delicious and refreshing.  Fresh arugula was the base.  The watermelon paired so well with the lime and ginger it was fantastic.  Ginger pieces added a nice touch. Crispy Grits were crunchy on the outside and smooth and creamy on the outside.  Sprinkled with some sort of red pepper for that lovely touch of heat. What I had of the Shrimp and Grits was sweetness.  Grits were creamy and well seasoned.  The mushroom cream sauce was gravy like and mushroom heaven.  It was obvious the shrimp was fresh and not from a bag. Now, finally the fried chicken.  The macaroni salad was nice since lethal levels of mayonnaise were not used.  The chicken meat was so juicy.  Unfortunately, the batter with the spice had an odd sour aftertaste.  Maybe too much buttermilk, or spice?  The non-spice version probably has potential and the fried chicken was decent in terms of flavor.  It was just a little off. All in all a great experience.  Fun wooded decor and sparsely decorated with exciting black and white pictures of people having a good time.  Go here. Love, Joe
