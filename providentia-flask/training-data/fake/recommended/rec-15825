this place is awesome if you are going on a romantic date, it was a bunch of friends and I and its really cute sitting area in the back in the summer time for outdoors. It is a bit crowded so you are literally yelling across the table to hear or have a conversation, the food was really good however not worth the price, so if you dont want to sink the wallet I would go else where unless of course your date is paying for you. lol they make it seem more hype than it really is!
