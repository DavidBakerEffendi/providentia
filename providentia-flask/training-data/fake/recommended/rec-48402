Seriously overrated.  The only reason to go to Grimaldi's is if you're in Dumbo anyway and need a quick and reasonably priced dinner. The pizza just isn't that great.  (For a famous pizzeria that really *is* that great, try Di Fara in Brooklyn or Pepe's in New Haven.)  It's bland, not always crispy, and not nearly salty enough to be considered New York style.  It's passable, and consistent, but nothing here screams "good pizza" except maybe to tourists.  (Which explains why this place is full of them.)  There are dozens of better pizzerias in New York.
