This place used to be my favorite thai restaurant, but after living in the area now for some time, I have changed my mind. First of all, it has a C HEALTH RATING, I've heard they have 20 or 30 health violations including COCKROACHES, etc. Beware. Yet, this place is always packed. Also, their service is pretty rushed and subpar. The servers won't even talk to you/greet you. It's just a "what do you want?", food appears, check appears. Literally. That being said, I really love their shrimp peanut fried rice entree. It's got a lot of cool ingredients and I haven't seen this dish done at any of the other thai places I've been to. I think their pad thai and pad see ew staples are a 6/10. Their decor is really nice, dim lighting, chandeliers, swanky.
