I had previously had reservations about Bottle Bar East, but mostly held them to myself. Their Brussels sprouts are average at best, and I felt Brussels sprouts are not an adequate starting point for a review, so I tried to be open minded, A friend of mine and I stopped by today and enjoyed a few drinks. We were eating, and on accident one of the bartenders knocked a glass over, breaking the glass and spilling water everywhere, namely all over me. It was clearly an accident and he apologized and moved on. However, as we were getting ready to leave, I sliced my thumb open on a piece of glass. I got a bandaid from one of the bartenders, but it still really hurt so I went to the restroom and pulled a small shard of glass from my thumb. As I was walking out of the restroom I asked another guy that works there for a bandaid, and he checked with a couple people working in the kitchen, and then told me they didn't have any bandaids. I asked if he was sure, because I just had a bandaid, and he got really rude. He asked if I actually expected him to check with every single employee to find a bandaid for me. I tried to reason with him, and explain that I wasn't asking for a free drink or anything like that, and I know that no one intentionally cut me, but that the least they could do was get another bandaid. He said that because it was an accident he wasn't really sure what my problem was. If you're going to Bottle Bar East, Frank, the bartender is a nice guy, their grilled cheese is pretty good, and make sure you bring your own first aid kit.
