First time here & can't wait to return! Dinner was delish! Duck Buns & Octopus starter--Yum!  Steak was tasty & fries were pure perfection. Brussel sprout side order is divine and Bow tie pasta w/shrimp & pesto sauce was really good.  Blueberry cobbler was a nice way to end a great night of food with great friends.  Getting hungry just typing this. Can't wait to try other items on the menu.
