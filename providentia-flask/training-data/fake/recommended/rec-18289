Empty on a Saturday night when all other nearby restaurants were busy. Service was mediocre. Waitresses also bartended. No one seemed to know the menu well. Dropped the bill off after clearing main course plates - without saying a word, asking how it was, asking if we wanted anything else. Food was adequate, but nothing special. Scallops, meh. Lamb Burger (special) was greasy, bun was wet and pasty. Tilapia special - watery. Tempeh and tofu - ugh (and that one is from a vegan) - the curry sauce was flavorless. Potatoes too garlicky. Generally, food bland, watery - lacked flavor and depth. No wonder why it was not crowded. No one seemed to care much about a good restaurant experience - not the kitchen or the service staff. The mixed reviews here are generous.
