Old school NY classic. The ultimate dive bar - up there with the great dive bars of NYC. Great burger - small, thick + juicy (pause) patty - I had it with the bacon and cheese ('natch), lettuce and tomatoes, and pickles.  Fries are crispy, hot, and arrive on a small SOLO paper plate - #winning. Bud Lights FTW.  Nothing wrong with this at all (except maybe the unexpectedly high number of douches in suits).
