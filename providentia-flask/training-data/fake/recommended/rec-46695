Go for the fish tacos, black bean soup, cerviche, gnochi, cheese and spinach empanadas, mojitos, mojitos, and more mojitos.  In particular, I love the mojito martini.   Now it's open for lunch with a more limited menu, but everything is fantastic.  I would go there whenever I get the chance.  I've been there twice for lunch and twice for dinner.  Each and every time it was fabulous.
