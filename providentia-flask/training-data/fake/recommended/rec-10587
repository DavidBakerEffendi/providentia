Been here 2 times.  Loved it the first time, went back last weekend w/ the Mrs and our 2 year old son for brunch.  Was told by the gracious owner that we had to wait in the tiny vestibule for 20-25 minutes for a table.  We were also told we could not order a juice while we waited or sit at the counter stools to wait (again w/ a 2 year old with us)!.  There was nobody else waiting in line behind us.  We are rational people, but being talked to like a child by a business owner who obviously has no idea how to treat customers is a shame.  We live in the area and will take our repeat business elsewhere.  Whatever happened to service with a smile?!?
