Really good. At first I didn't like the way the pizza actually tasted (even though the history and the ambiance were awesome), but it really grew on me. I recommend the pepperoni because it can taste a bit bland without it. Also, there is often a long line at dinnertime, so don't go if you're in a rush. It's worth the wait!
