YAY! I am definitely a FAN................ woo hoooooooooo................. I so loved this place - the small, cute, and chilled out restaurant. The service was excellent. There is nothing fancy about it but this place is like a great place to go with your significant other - dimly lit atmosphere....... Cash Only...... Bring Your Own Bottle Of Wine.... Oh and the menu is on the wall - LOL! First off I have to say that if you are a seafood lover and you want to try a new place that is not in the spot light and quiet........ but want 5 star cuisine as if you were in a busy expensive restaurant - TRUST ME (In CAPS) - Â this is your place. My friend and I started out with the seafood chowder - VERY GOOD! The Olive oil dip for the bread - VERY GOOD! We both had the CIOPPINO, signature dish at the restaurant, Lobster, scallops, shrimps, and mussels in a light tomato broth....... YUMMY YUM YUM....... the seafood was so fresh and very tasty......... I will definitely be back to try the rest if the menu.... Kudos to small businesses with 5 star food and service.......... Merci Beaucoup! And one more thing the restaurant is actually on the corner of Hicks street and Union. I almost left with out finding the restaurant. Happy Eating...............!
