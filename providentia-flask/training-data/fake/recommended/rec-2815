This place is so hit or miss... My wife loves it I think it's ok....being a former chef. I Â am little tough on people and the quality....never had a outstanding meal here but always a so so meal....in my opinion there are a few other places pretty close by where can get a fantastic meal......it is worth a shot just hope you go on the right night....
