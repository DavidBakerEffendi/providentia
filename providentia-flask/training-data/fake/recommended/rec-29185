Amazing ! I typically daydream about this place on a weekly basis. We were here on a Saturday evening about a month ago and it was DELICIOUS !! The atmosphere is really cool and I was fascinated with the unique decor! We stood in line for about 30-40 minutes. However, if you are not alone, you're able to leave a friend as a line spot holder and go get some drinks from the bar to help pass the time. Bar service was prompt as no one is really hanging out sitting there hogging up the space. Everyone has the same idea in grab a drink, go back in line and wait for smoked meat ! I was especially impressed with the way they managed the line - there was a girl that was actively monitoring the line movement and talking to you along the way to see how many were in your party. Reason being - once you got your food, she had a table ready for you ! The people behind the counter serving the food were awesome too! For such a busy place with a constant flow of customers, they were more than happy to tell me about their food and give recommendations. I went out on a limb and had the pork belly and it was aaaammmmazing ! Just as I was promised it would be. Broccoli salad was light and so lemony good too! Everything we had was top notch and the service was awesome ! We will definitely be back !
