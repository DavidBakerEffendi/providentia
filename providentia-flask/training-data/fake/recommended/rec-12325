I've been here a few times for lunch with the girls from work whenever we are celebrating or having a "girls' lunch". The restaurant is fairly small, so it can get a little crowded and a little noisy.  However, it has this really calm nice vibe to it, so even when it's noisy it's still relaxing and nice. I've ordered a few different types of pasta here and all were very good.  The salads and wine were also delicious.  The desserts were - - - AMAZING! Service was attentive and quick. My only complaint - if I have one - is that there is no "lunch set".  It would be nice if they had a smaller serving of pasta with a small salad or soup available at lunchtime.  Sometimes at lunch I don't just want a big plate of pasta, and to order a big plate of pasta and a big salad is just too much.
