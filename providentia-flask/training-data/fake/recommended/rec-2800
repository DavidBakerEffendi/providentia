PJs has been a Princeton staple, but in August 2011 it was sold to new group. The new group fired all the servers who were excellent and part of PJs charm and replaced them with inexperienced kids who are more interested in hanging out with each other than serving. The recipes are the Same, but the new owners now charge for real syrup and provide individual Smuckers syrup with your order. The previously plentiful coffee refills have been replaced with a catch your server if you can policy. All things change. This new owner is focused on bottom line. It explains why PJS was empty on a Saturday morning. I know I won't be back.
