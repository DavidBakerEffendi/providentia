I am a Kim's sushi addict. Before coming across this place I never really liked sushi, but after I came to this place I must say I go to Kim's at least once a month. The atmosphere is nice, its a small place so don't expect much privacy. The service is great! I love how the girls are super attentive and I also love all the small details that make your experience at Kim's exceptional every time.
