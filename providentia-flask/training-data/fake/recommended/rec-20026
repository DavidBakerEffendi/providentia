I visited this restaurant last night for a friend's birthday.  Upon looking at the menu online, I was unimpressed, but was pleasantly surprised with what Feast had to offer.  After much deliberating, my table decided to choose the French Feast tasting menu.  Our waitress was friendly and informative, and the presentation of the dishes was great.  All the dishes were delicious, but some rose above the others.  Everyone at the table enjoyed the meal, and although it was pricey, we did not leave hungry. Favorite dishes: Lobster Choucroute Foie Gras & Sweetbreads Coq Au Vin Pomme Dauphinois Eclaire Gateau
