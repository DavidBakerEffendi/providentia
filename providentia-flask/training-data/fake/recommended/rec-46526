Had dinner here outside on a beautiful July Thursday evening. The food is absolutely incredible, particularly the Kona Kampachi Tartare, which is a divine combination of yellowtail-esque sushi with Saratoga chips, Avocado, and pinenuts.  We also had lamb and cod, both of which were amazing.  The restaurant has a very cool, swanky feel and a phenomenal cocktail menu with one of the best Bulldog summer cocktails I've had.  On top of all this we had impeccable service with a smile. Highly recommended.
