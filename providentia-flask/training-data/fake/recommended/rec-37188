It's a toss up between Red Hook Lobster Pound and Luke's Lobster for best lobster roll. This place is definitely out of the way though, so it's not as easy for the mass NYC crowds to get to, but if you can make it over, it's worth the trek.  Definitely fresh and delicious, and what's great is that there is a picnic style seating area next door where you can enjoy your meal.  At Luke's, unless you're one of the lucky 6 people who get a seat, you're still eating over a counter, and not at a table.  For a big groups, try to make it here. The lobster roll comes in 2 ways: Maine and Connecticut.  The Maine style is your typical lobster roll, served cold in a bun.  I opted for the Connecticut style, which is served hot w/o mayo.  I loved it, but unless you eat it fast, the bread can get kinda soggy.  I didn't have really have a problem with that, as I scarfed mine up in like 2 minutes. And the people working here are so friendly!  No matter how great food tastes, if I get bad service, the most I'll give is 4 stars, but the extra friendly service is worth .5 in my book :)
