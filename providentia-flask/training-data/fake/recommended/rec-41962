Nam Phoung is heaven sent. The fish stewed in pot has got to be my favorite. Typically it's a tilapia fish in a sweet and sour sauce. You can never go wrong with this dish. Ofcourse Beef Pho here is simply amazing. Cheap, filling, fresh and tasty. A fantastic meal for cheap and always hits the mark
