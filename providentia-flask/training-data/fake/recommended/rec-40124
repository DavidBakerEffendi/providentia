Garces can do no wrong. I have eaten at Village Whiskey several times - many times before I was a vegetarian and once post-veggie.   1) Though I feel as though some of the alcohol is a little steeply priced, you get selections from things you've never heard of before.  No KJ Pinot Noirs here!  And, obviously, a brilliant whiskey selection. 2) The burger is to die for.  When I came here to eat (post veggie) I was so sad that I couldn't eat the burger any more!  It literally melts in your mouth, it's that damn good!  So many toppings to choose from.... *sigh* 3) There has not been one thing here that I have no liked.  The pickled cherry tomatoes are one of my favorites - served with ricotta cheese, tapenade, and crostini. This is worth the wait. Believe me.
