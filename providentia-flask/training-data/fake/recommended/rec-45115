This is a fun restaurant but not much different from others in the area. Barbuto serves a variety of salads, pizzas, and pastas for lunch. I enjoyed the calamari salad with pomegranate. My gnocci was good if a little low on flavor and moisture on the whole. This is a casual yet trendy restaurant in the Meatpacking district. It's garage doors and subtle ambiance makes for a nice meal out.
