This was a tough decision between a 3 and 4, but ultimately I decided to go with a 3. My friend suggested we go here for lunch while my boyfriend and I were staying in the area. She late me know she called to make reservations, but she was running late so she arrived after we did. I stated that we were supposed to have reservations under my friend's name when we arrived, but the host was very curt in saying they did not accept reservations for lunch. Anyway, the other person working behind the counter said my friend did call, so that made me feel less silly. We were seated promptly and able to choose our own seats. My boyfriend and I started on drinks while we waited for my friend. The coffee was nice and strong. Once my friend arrived we ordered food. I had the kale salad with baked eggs and a side of buttermilk biscuits. My friend also ordered the kale salad and my boyfriend ordered the pulled chicken sandwich. The buttermilk biscuits with homemade cranberry apple butter were amazing! I really liked my salad. I'm not a big salad person, but this one was good! It was a bit too salty though and could have used something sweet to balance it. My boyfriend liked his sandwich, but thought it was a bit too salty as well. I rated this place a 3 instead of a 4 because the prices were a bit high and the menu in general was a bit limited. Many of the same ingredients were used for many of the dishes, so there wasn't that much variety. This is a good place for vegetarians though! So, while I rate it a 3, it's more of a 3.5.
