Great food and prices. I hate the decor at room service - it seems like it is trying way too hard for me. that being said, i go there all the time because the food is good and thr prices are super reasonable. The food is fresh and flavorful - not your greasy thai that you can get anywhere. the service is good and the place is busy. definitely check it out.
