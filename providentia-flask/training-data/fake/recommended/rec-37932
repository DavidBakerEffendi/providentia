I've been wanting to try this place since moving to Philly over a year ago; finally made it over Christmas break. Street parking was easy to find, they also have valet, and it's enough on the subway. Getting into the sketchier end of Broad St tho, so use your discretion on getting there. The decor was nice, very wine cellar-y, very chill. Our waiter was very well versed in the offerings, and was eager to help us all decide on what to order, going through descriptions of many dishes before we made up our minds. The food was all delicious. We sampled a lot of pasta dishes, and a pizza. The pastas were very well made, delicate but al dente, the sauces and whatnot were very flavorful. And the servings were teeny. Three of us got half pasta orders (for what we thought would be half price) so that we could try more than one dish. When the bill came, they were a little more than half price, and when I asked the waiter about it, he said it was because the servings were a little more than half. Which, while should have been explained at the onset, made me wonder what a full portion would look like and if I'd want to pay full price for it. The pizza was a good size and very tasty, and if I go back I already know I want to try the zucca pizza. So, predictably small portions for the $$$, but at least the food left me wanting more. There were lots of tempting things on the menu, which, if I could afford to eat more of it, would probably have left me happily satiated.
