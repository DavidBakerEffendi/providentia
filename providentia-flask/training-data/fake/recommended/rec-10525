Once described by the Times as a dump with dignity !, a step into The Ear is like a step back in time.  The food is quality pub fare and the beers fresh and cold.  Prices are very reasonable indeed.  Overall a great experience enhanced by a cool Jazz band playing smooth. Not usually my part of town but I will be back someday.
