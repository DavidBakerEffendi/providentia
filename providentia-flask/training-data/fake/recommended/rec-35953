Went on the recommendation of a yelp elite and holy smokes, it was everything she described. Trendy ambiance but not pretentious, everyone was very friendly. The cocktails are a must try!! I ordered the My Thai and was amazed that a drink could be so artfully crafted. Appetizers were smaller than usual portions and we came with friends so we were able to share a few plates. We were a table of four and ordered 4 appetizers including the kangaroo carpaccio which was really small but delicious. Foie gras torchon was executed well, wagyu beef tongue was exciting and the oysters with shiso leaf is now the only way I want my fried oysters. We had a few snacks before coming here unfortunately and were too full to try the entrees but rest assured, we are coming back soon to try the rest of the menu. Knock it back with their cocktails and you'll be one happy chap.
