After using Yelp to find someplace to eat and drink wine, I ended up at Uva, not really knowing what to expect. What I got was a fantastic meal at a great price, a long wine list, relaxed atmosphere and amazing service. Walking into Uva, I was pleasantly surprised at the dimly lit, cozy dining area with candles in the brick walls. This is a great place to bring a date. While there isn't a ton of room inside, I did hear someone show up for a birthday gathering in the back, so parties larger than 4 are definitely possible. The exposed brick and the older yet classy tables and chairs helped set the mood, and coat hooks built into the walls were a nice touch in order to help make more room at your table. As far as the meal goes, it was excellent. We got the Insalata Di Ruspante (mixed greens with apples, grapes and sliced chicken breast in a mustard dressing), which was extremely tasty for what was essentially chicken on a salad, and the Canelloni Alla Emiliana (veal cannelloni baked in a pink sauce), which was terrific as well. Add a bottle of white wine and a dish of the tiramisu, and a fantastic dinner for 2 came out to just $75 with tax, much less than I would've expected. And the service? Spectacular. When we couldn't decide on a bottle of wine, our server suggested 2 bottles and, without hesitation, brought us a sample of each to try. By the time our bill came, I was more than willing to leave a $20 tip. Would I go back? Without a doubt.
