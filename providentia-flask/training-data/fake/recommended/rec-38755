I fell in LOVE with this place the second I walked in. I had just been back form studying abroad in Italy, and Giorgio's took me back to Roma instantly. Everything in this restaurant is authentic Italian from the decor, to the noise, the friendly staff, the smells, and of course, the homemade pasta! The gnocchi and squid ink pasta are my favorite! I also love the bread and the garlic oil. I will definitely go back to this place over and over again to get a true taste of real Italian food.
