LOVE this place! The prices are really good for drinks. The cover $5 and $1 coat check is great. Its a great place to go for a low key fun night. The music is really great. I've only had great times here. The only con is the bar near the DJ booth could take a while to get a drink but its understandable if it's crowded. The diner section has great food & a great bartender.
