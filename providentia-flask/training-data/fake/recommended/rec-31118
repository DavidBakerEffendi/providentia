After all the very postive reviews, we were quite disappointed in our meal at In Riva. The service was attentive, but the food was clearly below expectations. The meatballs were unremarkable and while the pizza topping Â (sausage) was excellent, the crust was soggy and tasted like a piece of undercooked pita bread! I am not sure if I will return.
