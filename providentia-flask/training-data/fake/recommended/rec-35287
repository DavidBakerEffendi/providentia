It's really hard to beat what they have going here. You can't get as simple and tasty as chicken and rice (or lamb), with the price they ask ($6), at the speed they serve it. I had chicken and rice, and the following night lamb and rice. At 3 am, they had a line that was probably 100 feet long, but you would never know it based on how fast they serve the food. We got through the line in probably less then 10 minutes. Now the food absolutely hits the spot, especially when it's late and you're craving some grub. Depending on how hungry you are, you could share the $6 meal with someone else. It is pretty filling. IMO, lamb is much better, and it's the same price as the chicken. On the side of the truck are 2 sauce bottles, white bottle and a red bottle. The white bottle sauce (which is like a sour cream/ranch mixture) makes the meal. Douse your food with the white. If you can take fast, intense hot, then go for the red bottle. I can take some hot, but this hot was instantaneous and I was begging for mercy. I just poured my white to combat the red.
