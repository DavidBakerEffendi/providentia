Great pie!  This is another favorite place of mine for pizza.  I have been going here for over 20 years and it is always good for a few stops while I am home on the east coast.  I do have to say though, on this last trip home it was not as good as it normally is.  We took a couple pies to go so that may have been part of the problem.  It is always better when you eat it fresh as it comes out of the oven.  In any case, the pies were a bit under cooked and doughy this time around which was really unfortunate because I dream of those pies when I am out in San Francisco.  They are normally very good so I will just chalk it up as a bad day for them.  But this did prompt me to write them a letter just to let them know.  I like consistency and it's always disappointing when things aren't what you expect them to be.  Normally the crust is very good with a nice taste of salt, crispy on the outside and a little but of sponge in the inside. The Spot is a more casual place to eat in back of the main restaurant and I actually think it is better for some reason.  It's the same pie though. Go check it out for yourself.  When it's good, it's really good!  Enjoy!
