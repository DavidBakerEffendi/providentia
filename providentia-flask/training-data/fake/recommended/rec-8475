Theres nothing bad about black and brew. Their service is so friendly, their food is awesome and coffee is fresh and hot! My boyfriend and I love their yogurt fruit and granola bowl and their variety of wraps, pancakes, and lunch sandwiches can accommodate anyone's dietary needs. Vegetarian, vegan, omnivore. They have you covered. Get something quick to go or sit for a bit. Either way, get here!
