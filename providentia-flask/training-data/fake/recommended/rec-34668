Totally loved it !!! Â I spent a few months in Manhattan last year and I used to visit this place at least twice a week. Although am more of a chicken fan but I loved the veggie rolls (chick peas, and cottage cheese) much more than the non-veggie options. With $5- $8 per roll, they are possibly the best Indian Kathi Rolls I have had in the US. The only (very slight) negative is they don't accept AMEX credit cards!
