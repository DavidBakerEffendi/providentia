Okay food for a city restaurant with city prices. A little gimmicky. Service was casual yet professional and friendly. Food did come quickly in spite of it being weekend business. Dessert selection is very sparse. Decent alcohol selection if you're into that sort of thing. Â Overall, worth a visit.
