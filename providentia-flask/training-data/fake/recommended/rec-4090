Delicious! Totally defines what I think is pizza from New Jersey. I think of pizza from Jersey as thin crust, not crisp, cheese is light but both Parmesan and mozzarella with provolone. Sauce is tasty and pepperoni is fresh. I asked a local resident where to get good pizza, but she didn't act like she knew. I was really close to Bruno's. I got on Yelp, there's a lot of Italian places in Wayne. So glad I chose Bruno's. The large was 1$ more than medium. It will serve me more than a couple of meals. The pizza is near perfect. They also sell pizza by the slice, and it looked fresh. They have a complete sandwich menu as well.
