Their sandwiches are great. Their fries are great. The hire from within the neighborhood, and aren't overpriced (yet). I'd suggest trying this place out. I've ordered from them many times (I always do takeout because the space is small) and will miss them terribly after I move in a few weeks. Recommended: The duck confit sandwich and the cuban sandwich. And to the other yelpers posting negative reviews, I guess technically you CAN write a review without ever having eaten at a place, but seems a bit irresponsible to me. If you want to complain about racism, I think you might want to build your case a bit. One insensitive sandwich board does not mean they're too racist to function.
