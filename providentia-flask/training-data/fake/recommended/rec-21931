This place is my absolute favorite for sushi... And not that it matters, BUT the owners are Chinese. If you head here enough times, you'll get to know one of the owners, Ren, and he's super hospitable and grateful for your business. The restaurant may look like a hole in the wall, but they've remained in business with a loyal following of customers for a reason: Their food is excellent. All regular rolls are 50% off so you're looking at a spicy tuna roll that costs about $3.75. They have an entire menu of specialty rolls that all are phenomenal. Some of my favorites are the Godzilla roll and the Honey roll (which is NOT on their regular menu, but instead is a recent creation by Ren written on a whiteboard when you walk in). Specialty rolls are often $10.95-$12.95 with about 10-12 pieces to them. Their Fire Ice Cream (green tea flavor is my favorite though my family also loves the red bean) is different but yummy. Â They pretty much scoop out ice cream then cover it with panko bread crumbs, a chocolate drizzle, whipped cream, AND alcohol to help light the crumbs on fire which also conveniently gives the ice cream a bit more of a daring taste. Take note of when you go for dinner: Friday nights at around 7:30-closing can be super busy so expect to wait a little longer than usual for your food. Any other night of the week is usually a good time to go, though they also accept phone orders for take-out.
