I don't know...I had a "fine" experience here. My husband had some pretty decent pancakes... I had a fried egg sandwich (hard to mess up).... I came for the frites! And they were pretty good...they didn't blow me away or anything, though. We ordered a large (we were HUNGRY!!), and it came with a choice of three dipping sauces, which were good, but the sauce quantity was a bit stingy, as in, it covered about three large fries before it was gone. AND....our server seemed a little cranky. And honestly, it smelled a little funky in the place. Can't really identify the sour-ish smell/ For the most part, I'm not a super-picky person, but I just didn't have a great experience here.
