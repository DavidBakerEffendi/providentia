Was there for brunch today, it's sooo yummy and the service is great. Split the country flatbread, Nova benedict and doissant (their answer to the cronut) with my fiance and we were full and happy. We liked their coffee too, which was a big plus... A couple months ago we came for dinner and split a half dozen dishes with another couple and we devoured everything they brought to our table. A GREAT local spot and we can't wait to go back for ANY meal!
