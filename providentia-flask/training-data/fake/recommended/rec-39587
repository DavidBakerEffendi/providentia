Torsu has been a very tasty life saver during the semester. Food: I cannot remember the names of what I ate, but they did put up numbers next to dishes for those who cannot say it right or those who are afraid of butchering someone else's tongue (I am the second). I've had number 16, 14, 15, 7 and 13 are amazing! I find the food very flavorful, but not over powering. The portions are huge so you can order some for lunch, save half in a fridge and eat it for dinner. Or, if its finals time eat the whole thing in one sitting. Service: When the food truck parks outside of the NYU law building I usually just see the older man, a complete sweet heart, he even tried to help me pronounce one of the dishes and smiled, nodded and told me good, good, lol. I'm pretty sure I didn't get it right, but it's the thought that counts. There was also a younger lady, nice and quick. From a few observations I found this food truck to be conscious of sanitation. They wore gloves. They took the gloves off when dealing with cash which a LOT of food trucks in NYC need to start doing. Price: Under $6 for a filling meal! YEAAHHS I recommend eating from him!! I know I will continue to eat here through out the year if he comes around the NYU campus, or if I spot it somewhere in lower Manhattan.
