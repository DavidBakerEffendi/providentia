Wow, this brings back memories!! So many cool, autumn evenings spent savoring an individual pot of fresh-brewed tea and my favorite chocolate chip scones in New Haven~~ ^___^ Their olive oil ciabatta is to die for as well... Located on that beautiful stretch of Chapel Street that filled with cozy, little shops, nice restaurants and the Yale Center for British Art-- man, this place is all about good feelings! Even when I'm only there browsing for a book, the warm smells of coffee brewing and bread baking make it one of the nicest, coziest places in New Haven~ Every Yalie needing a change of scenery from the old dorm room desk should pack up their books and head to Atticus. ^^
