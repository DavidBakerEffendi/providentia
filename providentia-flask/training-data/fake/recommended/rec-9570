Weather Up was closed for a private party so we found our way here.   Van and I met up with an old friend here - one that I have always thought of as a little sister - it was a nice place to sit back and reminisce and catch up on old and new times.  We talked a lot about all our friends having children and how it's changed them ... and we discussed what we might talk about 5 years from now. Anyway - a few months back I had decided to stop making mixed drinks and I had stopped ordering cocktails as well.  I decided to stick to the tried and true: wine, martini or whiskey neat - but after this trip to NYC, I'm changing my mind again.  Damn. Ward III was a respite from the cold night.  We found a great corner to sit and chat and attempt to read the menu by candlelight.   We enjoyed a number of cocktails that evening - Asylum, Georgie, Hemingway martini (?) ... all deliciously crafted.
