I have been eating food prepared by this chef, Arthur Cavalier, for a long time. He served delicious entrees at Parc, and Al Vez to name a few. I have been waiting to see his name billed at the opening of a restaurant here in Philly for years now.  Tonight the wait is over. In Riva is going to be the new hot spot in East Falls. ------------------------------------ ------------------------------------ ------------------------------------ Well I was right. In Riva is officially a hot spot. I personally love everything I have had. The atmosphere is laid back and the food is rockin'. I highly recommend trying it all. My personal favorite is the Vasi. Mason jars filled with pure deliciousness served with delectable toasted bread.  Slather it on and await a flavor explosion. I love them all so picking just one to talk about would be unfair. I have had no fear when recommending In Riva to everyone I speak to about food. And they have all loved it. I have been in so many times that I have tried the entire menu at this point several times and have to say....Yum!
