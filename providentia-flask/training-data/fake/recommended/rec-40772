If you are in the mood for crispy chicky with spicy green sauce, and you don't mind too salty or too greasy chicky, this place is perfect for delivery.   $9 for whole, but small, chick;  maybe order two.   It tastes better cold the next day.           3 and a half stars.    Not impressed with other items;   stick with chick.
