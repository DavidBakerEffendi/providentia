Avoiding the rush times, we settled in on Thursday afternoon for a late lunch and were quickly seated. We ordered the Original, Truffle burger, sweet potato fries and truffle fries. Truffle fries were delicious. Perfect amount of balance. Sweet potato fries would have been perfect too except for the crazy amount of sugar dumped on top of them. Spent most of the time brushing it away. Had issues with both burgers. The meat wasn't well seasoned and tasted quite bland. Also got a few pieces of fatty gristle. Also, the umami punch was inconsistent at best. There were pockets of intense flavor but for the most part just seemed like a plain burger. Also have to mention the kids meal. The burger was a good size but the burger was really bad. It was well done but there was something else going on. The meat tasted rancid. Not sure if they use old meat but I'd avoid if bringing kids.
