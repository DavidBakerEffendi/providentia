I went with a friend yesterday for a birthday lunch.We got there mid-afternoon and were seated right away. They were still serving their brunch menu and i was slightly disappointed because most of it consisted of breakfast foods, of which I wasn't really in the mood for.  The food was pretty good though. I got the grilled cheese and tomato soup which was quite good. However we felt that the service was definitely lacking. Everyone was very nice but our waitress was MIA most of the time. I asked for a re-fill on my water and that took like 10-15 minutes only after I asked again did I get it. It wasn't just that though, that actually wasn't even that big of deal to me. SHe checked on us once and then disappeared the rest of the time. When we had finished eating  she was no where to be found. We literally sat there with our finished plates for about 15 minutes and i would attribute it to being busy but it wasn't even busy because at that point we were literally the only ones in the section we were in, and there was only a handful of people in the restaurant itself. We had to call over a staff member to get our waitress  and they ended up just getting our check for us and making up some lame excuse about our server doing some type of stock in the basement. If that was really the case though why didn't anyone else cover her table? It was obvious that we were finished for some time and looking around for our waitress and like 4 different staff members walked by our table at least 5 times. Overall the food was good and everyone was friendly but the service itself left something to be desired...I just felt like there was no excuse because it wasn't at all crowded.
