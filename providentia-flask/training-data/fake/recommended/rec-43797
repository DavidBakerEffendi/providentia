Amazing! I love the idea of the local seasonal menu and all the ingredients were top-notch. The beer and wine list was inspiring as well! For an appetizer we split the beef Carpaccio salad which was inventive, light, and delicious. I had the pork porterhouse which was a huge portion and deliciously seasoned; it was too big to finish but I sure tried. The orzo and olives on the side was as delicious as the pork. The waiter was kind of weird and awkward, but other than that this place was amazing and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who's really into food for a nice dinner or a special date.
