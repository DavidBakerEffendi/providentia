This is a deli and grocery with hot and cold foods not a restaurant. This place is awesome! Deli meats and Kielbasa very good. Also ha a good assortment of polish groceries, and baked goods. You have to try the cheese Babka. I haven't tasted a Babka like that sine my mother passed away. Baked right there. The Paczki is good too.
