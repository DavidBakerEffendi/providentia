3 of us went to this place last night.  It's on 130 South near the Hamilton Marketplace adjacent to a Hilton hotel.  They weren't busy at all.  We sat at a high-top in the bar area and got this real spacey guy who was impersonating a server.  We ordered a couple of apps and they were not good at all.  "Server-guy" then took our order and didn't write it down. 25 minutes later, I'm asking where our food is and he seemed perplexed.....it didn't come out for another 10 or 15 minutes!  This guy must have never placed the order but wouldn't fess up. My girlfriend is allergic to red peppers and asked that her pasta dish did not include them but of course they did.  I ordered the "sizzling" fajitas and it was a lump of nasty sliced steak with zero sizzle - it was awful!  I've never had this experience at a Friday's before but rest assured I'll never go back to this one!  Terrible!
