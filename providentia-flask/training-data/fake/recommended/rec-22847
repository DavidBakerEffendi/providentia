The reason I have chosen to give it 5 stars is because this place served me a GOOD pad thai, has a good ambiance, a great location, and in my opinion great prices. The staff was friendly as well. Is it the best pad thai I've ever had? No, but close to it, and for the price it'll be hard to find a better place.
