Disappointed. I used to LOVE their smoked salmon panini, I've had the best one here, Â but since when they changed the panini bread, they don't taste the same anymore. The new panini bread is hard and chewy, believe it or not, it really makes a huge difference. This is actually the 2nd time I ordered from them since they use the new panini bread, hoping they might switch back the old bread, but disappointed once again. And the smoked salmon is way overcooked, the perfect one I had was kind of raw in the middle, I just hope they can keep the consistency.
