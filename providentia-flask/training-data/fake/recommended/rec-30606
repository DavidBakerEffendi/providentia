Probably the best dinner we had while in NYC for the week.  I had the suckling pig, which was tender and delicious.  But the real star was the side dish--drunken beans with bacon and dried fruit.  Doesn't sound that impressive, but it was prepared in a simple, but amazing way to really bring out the simple and delicious flavors.  Highly recommended.  Staff was very friendly with our large group.
