Was on The Best Thing I Ever Ate (in a bowl), and I love noodles, so I went to check it out with my girls.  It's a hole in the wall, so if you're looking for ambiance, this isn't the place.  But the noodle soup was delicious!  The guy in the kitchen can be seen through the door slapping the noodles, which is cool.  They come out piping hot and soft and delicious.  would be a great meal for a cold, rainy night like when i went, or when you have a cold.  the dumpling appetizers were so good we got a 2nd order, and wanted a 3rd.  oh, and it's super cheap.  we paid like $20 for 2 appetizers and 3 bowls of soup.  the restaurant is tiny, so not good for groups
