I can't say which was better, the super friendly staff, or the food. We had our dogs who were greeted like royalty and presented with a bowl of water. Fries and gravy are a treat from my childhood in upstate NY and were the best ever. We loved our meals, enjoyed the brews. A great unique experience that I highly recommend. Haddock and oysters does it get any better than this?
