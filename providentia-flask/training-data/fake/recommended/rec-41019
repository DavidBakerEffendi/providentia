Heard this was a good place to stop by and wow, not disappointed at all.  Everyone was friendly.  The staff was VERY knowledgable and very accommodating.   The selection of margaritas was great.  We tried one with shaved truffles and woah, it was amazing.  We tried quite a few different kinds and all were delicious.  The guacamole was all that they hyped it to be.   If you like spicy salsa, be sure and ask for the habanero salsa.  Coming from a guy who never finds anything spicy in salsa's this had a kick.  Kick with great flavor.   Afterwards, we hit the blues club walking distance around the corner.  I will return next time I am back in NYC.
