I had dinner at Cantina Dos Segundos late on a Thursday night and it was quite packed. We didn't have to wait for a table, but it seemed to be getting to that point... I hung at the bar for a bit, and was told by the bartender that many of the drinks on the current drink menu were getting tossed by the wayside due to them tasting awful. He said some of them were too experimental and weren't enjoyable at all...But there are loads of others on there to choose from, and more to come. Right away, you may be confused by the menu. The text is just not ideally layed out, and you're not sure what you're getting with each meal. But our waitress for very nice and explained it perfectly too us. I had the chicken chimichanga, which was excellent and moderately priced...Very tasty with some nice side veggies. If you're vegetarian, you'll dig the many options Cantina Dos Segundos has to offer. The lighting is dim, the decor is festive, and the ambiance is loud. Don't expect to have quiet delicate conversations here at dinner. But it goes along with the neighboring feel of Standard Tap.
