YUM! This place gets 5 stars for unbelievable Greek food for a reasonable price!  I never go to the UWS, but for Kefi...I may just have to come back more often.  Dined here on a Friday night, and it is jammed packed with fast turnover of tables.  But Kefi was nice enough to let us sit, eat, and drink for 3.5 hours.  Highlight of the night was definitely the mussels with diced tomatoes and feta cheese and flava beans, who would of thought of the outrageous combo? Sooo goood!!  Also got the mac and cheese, braised lamb shank which literally fell off the bone, and the heavenly meatballs in tomato sauce.  Oh, and they have $20 bottles of wine here, what?!  4 dishes, bottle of wine, and dessert all for $70!  The service is fabulous, and a complimentary glass of red at the end does not hurt =).  I heart Greek food, and this is one of the best in NYC.
