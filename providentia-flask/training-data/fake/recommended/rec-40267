Once again Chickie and Pete's delivers the goods. We get up to this place at least twice a year while in town on business. Had the cheesesteak and the famous crabby fries with white American cheese sauce. Co-worker ordered wings and they were phenomenal as well. Our waiter Nicole was phenomenal and she hooked us up with outstanding service. We WILL return again soon and we'll be sure to sit in Nicole's section!
