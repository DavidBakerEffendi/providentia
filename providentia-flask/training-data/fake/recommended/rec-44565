I didn't even order from here.  My buddy did. A couple of friends and I were in Chinatown waiting for our appetites to catch up with us so we could eat at a restaurant in the area we were meaning to try.  So in the meantime, my friend looked up on his Yelp app and saw that Prosperity was not only around the corner, but had raving reviews.  So we decided to give it a try. Man, if their little lobby was any smaller, they might as well have you order from the street.  But that's not a complaint.  I thought it was a great little spot.  He ordered an order of dumplings which, for five, only cost a dollar. We walked across the street to a curb and sat down to snack.  Man oh man they were great.  They were so good we were burning ourselves because we didn't want to wait for them to cool down.  I don't even recall which kind he got.  Plus,  5 for a dollar is a steal. Definitely if you need a snack and are in the area, drop in and order something.  It'll only take a few minutes.
