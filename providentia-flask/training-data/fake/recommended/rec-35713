Saw this place on Triple D. While Guy Fieri is obnoxious and his own NYC restaurant is the pits, he usually features good spots and this one did not disappoint. Looks a bit annoying (see: lots of mason jars) and you kind of expect everyone who works there to be a douche (see: the hipster beards and tattoos) but looks can be deceiving. The service was friendly and highly competent and the food was amazing. I can't review very much as I only had the pickles and goat neck, but both were phenomenal. Pickles were very different, a bit of a lavender flavor and in a slightly sticky pickling solution, and included some less-pickled veggies like okra and wax beans. I loved them. For our main, my dining partner and I had the goats neck because it was featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and also, when else are we going to eat goats neck? Best meat ever! Super tender, well-seasoned, and just the right amount of sauce. The coconut rice and yellow curry, while they may sound Asian-influenced certainly did not taste like anything I've eaten anywhere (Asian or otherwise) and we're delicious. The only problem with the dish was I wanted slightly more of the dried cherries served on top! Â We ate the whole thing in about fifteen minutes and debated ordering a second for take out. Unbelievable.
