I had the Manly burger which was just OK.  The patty is pretty small compared to the bun and it was falling apart. Service was lacking.  We ordered drinks, then our food.  Two minutes later we are presnted with three dipping sauces and told how awesome each one is.  Problem was we had nothing to dip.  We were starving and this was a tease.  There's no reason to bring out the sauces prior to any food. Burgers came next. We ordred fries but they came out last after we were almost done with the burgers. All of the burgers were ordered medium rare but one of them was overcooked.  They could do better on the timing of the food delivery.  No reason fries, burgers and sauces can't come together.
