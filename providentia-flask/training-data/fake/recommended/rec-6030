Exactly what I want in a neighborhood spot.  Actually, exactly what I want period.  The burger w duck fat fries were AMAZING!!  The garlic mayo sauce a great addition to an otherwise simple but exceptionally well prepared burger.  And the lentil, kale, cauliflower, sunchoke salad was warm and delicious.   Also got my 5 year old the grilled cheese and tomato soup appetizer.  It was a very generous portion.  Could easily be an adult entree.   This place is all win.
