I had just gotten off the train at Penn Station and let me tell you, the ramen here is very excellent. Reasonable prices for fancy NY ramen. My bowl was around $11. I also got steamed pork buns, and they were quite good even though they looked like tacos and weren't necessarily "traditional". I think this place is a good date spot. The atmosphere is just right, and the wait staff was excellent.
