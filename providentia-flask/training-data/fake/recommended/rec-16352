Delicious Thai food at an adorable little husband and wife owned and operated restaurant. They do a lot of take out, but we always stay and eat in. The service is great, but there is only one cook in the kitchen. Everything is homemade so don't go if you are in a hurry. Our favorite dishes are the Hangover Soup (basically chicken & rice made with ginger), the Tom Kha Gai (chicken coconut soup), chicken potstickers, Beef 'More Garlic' and the Traditional Chicken Green Curry. This is a worthwhile stop.
