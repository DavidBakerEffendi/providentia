We'll have to try them again at some point. All I hear are stellar reviews of their sandwiches, but when my wife and I went, they were just meh. Dry, not a ton of flavor, and just wholly unimpressive. Good enough to grab for a quick bite on the go, but not worth going out of our way for, and certainly not worth driving to Philly from West Chester. I will update if our next time is a better experience.
