I initially gave this place a harsh review (below), but I've since been back several times since, and they've drastically improved. This is now one of my favorite places in the 'hood... They must've just been having.... Growing pains.... Ya see?! First impressions aren't ALWAYS everything! +++++++++++++++++++++++++ Pretty underwhelming. I came for an early Sunday dinner with my family (5 of us in total). The restaurant was about half full with plenty of servers on staff... Which is typical of a restaurant at that time and day. Problem is, the service was incredibly slow. Like, scary slow. The servers didn't seem rushed or short staffed. But rather like they had been smoking pot in the back and had no clue what was going on. Everything was painfully slow. For example: Twenty minutes after we had finished our appetizers, our waitress returned to the table to finally clear those plates. And asked what we wanted for dessert. Ummm... Let's get through through the main course and see how we feel first. Forty minutes later, our main courses came out. You get the idea. And while we're talking about the food.... It was... Just okay. The menu items seemed inventive and we were excited to try a few new things. But the food was just... Bland. And, like I said, underwhelming. You'd be better served (no pun intended) skipping this spot and trying out any of the other (better!) New American or Italian places around the neighborhood. It's a shame, really, I had such high hopes for this place. Ahh... On to the next.
