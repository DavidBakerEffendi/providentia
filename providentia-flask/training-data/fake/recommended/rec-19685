Disappointment!! The last two times I've been here, they have seriously screwed up my order.  "Chicken enchiladas" have come one time as beef enchiladas, another time as black bean enchiladas.  Absolutely nothing done to make it right - e.g., at least give me 10-15% off the bill.... Nope, instead they charge an automatic gratuity on a group of 4 (really?!? - what restaurant does this on a party of FOUR people at lunch time?!?)... And this was done when 2 of our 4 meals were the wrong item.  I used to love this restaurant, but I'm seriously questioning whether I will come back.   The beef enchiladas must have been made with meat from a 20 year old bull - it was so tough & tasted very "gamey"
