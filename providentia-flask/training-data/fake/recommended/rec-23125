This was our 2nd choice option for dinner tonite, nothing looked too great for me on the menu, and I took a shot & ordered the Short Rib dinner, so glad I did ! The short ribs were break-apart delicous, served with a mac & cheese that was not too cheesy but was just right in the cheese flavor department, also 3 roasted asparagus that were not too thick but could have cooked just a tad longer. My guest ordered the lamb shank over mushroom risotto and judging from how clean his dish was, with just the bare lamb bones left on the plate, I must say he thoroughly enjoyed his meal. We were very hungry and didn't really want any appetizers, but it would have been nice to serve us some bread or rolls while we waited for our dinner. If I had more time on my parking spot, I may have stayed for dessert.
