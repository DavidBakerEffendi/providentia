Hubby and I went with a friend and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  We got there around 7pm on a Friday night and we were seated right away.  I really liked the modern all-over dark wood paneling and the music selection was fantastic (Morrissey, The Damned, etc).  Service was friendly and we never had to track down our server.  What we ordered: - Cured Hamachi (this was just ok -- should have gone for the special instead) - Steamed buns (two orders because they were so damned tasty) - Terrine Sandwich (banh mi) - Spicy sausages & rice cakes (love!) - Benton's smoked country ham (huge plate of goodness) With beer and wine, the total came to $115 (excluding gratuity), which I thought was quite fair given the quality of our meal.
