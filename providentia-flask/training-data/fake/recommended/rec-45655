While I didn't love the hour wait to get a table here (line out the door and a kindof scattered hostess who kept forgetting who was next on the list didn't make for a prompt seating), the corner booth in the way back made the experience worthwhile...that and the mouth-watering corn on the cob...sweet, buttery with a generous topping of cheese. Paired with a spicy bloody mary, you pretty much forget the annoying wait. I liked the overall ambiance--it's a fun place to have a bite, hangout with friends and maybe people watch if you care. The pork sandwich is a good choice, do it.
