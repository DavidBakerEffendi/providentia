For New Haven, this place is about the best around. It's a complete dining experience: excellent food, superb service, beer and wine to suit every palate, and an interesting decor. Chicken pimento is my go to dish here. Cons: not the best for holidays! We waited 45 minutes for our advance reservation to be ready on Valentines day. The entryway can get chaotic once they get busy.
