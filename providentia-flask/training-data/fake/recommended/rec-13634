One of my favorites in NYC! I am a Thai food fan, and the food here is always DELICIOUS! The prices are CHEAP!There is normally a crowd, but the wait is never long. Food: I usually order the curry puffs to start, and follow that with the Spicy Basil Noodles! It is so yummy and perfectly cooked. I get it with the chicken and shrimp, and it is not really spicy. Service: The service here is friendly and on top of things. The waitresses wear the cutest little outfits. Atmosphere: It is a laid-back, dim lit restaurant. BEAUTIFUL interior, especially the enormous chandelier in the middle!
