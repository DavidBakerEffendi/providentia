I came here for happy hour with a few coworkers, and tried all of the happy hour cocktails. The Twizzle , Astronaut,  Melon Drop and  London Iced Tea were amazing, sweet enough with a kick.On the other hand the Champange o-Rama (which is a sparkling wine with Smirnoff) was awful, and seemed like more of a college cocktail concoction rather than something I would find in a restaurant.  We also shared the BBQ quesadillas ( AMAZING, I will definitely be ordering these again, for myself), Cheesesteak Eggroll, and the Hummus & Pita everything was delicious. Overall an excellent experience.
