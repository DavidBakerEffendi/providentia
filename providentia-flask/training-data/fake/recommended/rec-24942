Went here the other night and couldn't have had a better experience. Ordered the pork belly app; entrees were chicken liver ravioli and roasted chicken in a jus sauce over turnips and brussel sprouts. I would have ordered one of the delicious looking desserts had I not been so full. Everything was amazing. Food was perfect. Conscientious, knowledgeable and courteous wait staff. Only cons are location ( a bit out of the way but not a bad walk from the theater district) and it's a bit pricey but for a nice date this makes the perfect destination. Head to the rooftop bar after a dinner for a drink and an amazing view. You'll be bossin' for the night.
