Great atmosphere. Really cute dim open restaurant/bar. Exposed brick and nice retro modern lighting. A great place to sip drinks and people watch. The drinks are really exceptional. Â They don't have their menu online, and I can't quite remember what was in my drink, but the first was a coconut, lime, basil concoction where the top 2/3 was frothed coconut milk (and creme?). It was delicious. Other great drinks followed, a chipotle one, which had a nice kick but not strong enough to obscure other flavors. Service was a little slow, but I wasn't there to rush.
