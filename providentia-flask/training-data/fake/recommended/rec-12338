15 minute wait on a weekday mid-morning in the rain. Was it worth the wait? OMG - Yes!! My order was simple: Blueberry Pancakes, Sausage, and Coffee. All 3 were outstanding. Maybe the best blueberry pancakes I've every had. Great fresh coffee. Everything on the menu comes with a distinctive twist that makes it unique to other breakfast restaurants. The pancakes have a tasty sauce on the side, not tried and true maple syrup. The sausage combines meat and spices for a flavor that sets them apart from normal breakfast sausage patties. Overall a wonderfully memorable breakfast.
