I've been here twice. The first experience was great! We came with a large group at 8:30pm on a Saturday. The place was packed but they took our cell numbers and called us as soon as a large table was ready. We order appetizers, drinks and entrees. The mac-n-cheese, gorgonzola fondue and the chilean sea bass were some of our favorites. I then went back recently after dreaming about the sea bass. I went with one friend for an early dinner around 5:00pm.  We quickly were seated but then after sitting for 20 mins no one even brought us waters! I finally asked if there was a server that could help us. Mean while there were plenty of waitresses roaming. Other tables that had come in after us were ordering.  After asking, we then had two waitresses which was confusing for everyone. I was beginning to think I was crazy for recommending the place. In the end we decided to spilt a dish and go somewhere else for apps. I guess the moral of this review is to go at dinner rush!
