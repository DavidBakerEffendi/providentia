We had a good meal here tonight, but the service was lousy. We waited while 3 other tables who were seated along with us were served and no food for us. Were we not cool enough? When we asked about our food... I mean, deviled eggs take how long to make?...they seemed surprised. Then a manager came by and disappeared only to have the food start to trickle out. No apologies. No offer of free dessert. My husband refused to complain, but I would have. If you want to pay a lot and have lousy service this is the restaurant for you!
