Had the Pork buns, the bar buns, an aspagus dish with sunflower seeds, and a nice pork dish with oxaca cheese. This was a little while back, but the dishes were pretty momorable. Only thing i did not like was how busy and loud the place was... A little out of hand... Maybe they could turn down the music just a bit. Great food though.
