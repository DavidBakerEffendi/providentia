So for our last dinner in New York City we were having a hard time deciding on what we wanted to eat. Well, we decided that we hadn't had a good, hearty Italian meal and decided to look for one in Little Italy. After reading multiple reviews on Yelp, we finally decided on Benito since it was close enough to our hotel. My wife ordered the 3-course dinner (24 dollars) with the calamari, linguine with clams, and the veal. I ordered the linguine bolognese but they were out of linguine by the time we arrived so I had it with spaghetti instead. So after seeing the first course my wife was pretty sure she wasn't going to be able to eat all of her meal. Well, she managed to eat everything and part of my meal. I have never been a fan of veal but I don't know what they put in the sauce but I managed to eat a third of her veal on top of my meal. It was one of the best Italian meals I've had and I'd go back just for the bolognese sauce.
