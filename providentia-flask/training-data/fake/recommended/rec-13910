We came to this place after it was featured in a throwdown on Food Network - the blueberry pancakes looked just too good.  After waiting maybe 15 minutes to be seated (about 10 am on a Monday), the menu was almost overwhelming - it is after all pancake month.  But we decided to go with what brung us, and that was the blueberry pancakes with warm maple butter.  Right choice.  The blueberry compote was delicious, the pancakes just the right consistency, and the maple butter brought it all together.  The coffee was delicious, although we had to ask twice to get it.  At $13 a plate, it is an expensive pancake, but worth it.  There are no signs saying cash only, so there was a hurried trip down the street to an ATM at the close of the meal.
