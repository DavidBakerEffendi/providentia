NO! NO! NO! Whatever they did to the old "The Office" did not help one bit. I have been living in Montclair on and off for a long time. After taking a hiatus from this place, which was a frequent spot throughout high school and occasionally since for me, I have decided to NEVER return. Salty, overpriced food. Horrible and LOUD music. I had the pleasure of ruining my new years eve at The Office. I had fish tacos that night and my boyfriend had chicken fajitas. Now let me ask you, how much salt is needed to flavor rice? According to The Office a dump truck full! And, who puts cheese on top of rice that is meant for fajitas? In addition, the tortillas were at best Pathmark quality. As I stated before, this was new years eve, and they were kind enough to give us complimentary noise makers and champagne (which is how they earned the one star). I questioned whether the champagne was real because they did not card anyone, and there were a few people in there that did not look over 21. The countdown was lackluster. A TV on full blast does not an exciting event make. Who are the people that says this place is fun? We went to Egan's earlier in the night and left realizing it was way too crowded to eat there. But after spending my new years at The Office, we quickly realized we should have stayed at Egan's! Oh and the music...wow! BAD. You definitely will not find ground breaking music from unknown artist here, or even new music, period. Oh, and they switch songs mid way ALL THE TIME, no transition necessary here I guess. So once again I ask, how do people party here, and who are they?
