I am TOTALLY shocked that people gave this place one star!!  I have ordered from Stephanie's III on Centre St MANY times.  I have never had anything less than a 4-star experience.   I have never dined IN the restaurant, so I cannot comment on the ambiance.  It looks like a classic retro NJ diner from the outside.  Their food is wonderful, though. I grew up in Kearny, and we had 2 REALLY good churrasco places nearby.  I have always loved the chicken, and pretty much kept to that with rice.   That is still my go-to.  I usually order the chicken and then some other stuff.  My family LOVES the ribs.  We also get the sausage (chourico assado).  If I have a big crowd, I like to order beans, potato salad, etc.  The potato salad we have gotten has always been a larger portion than they describe in the menu, BTW.  I also ordered the bacalhau house style once.  It was beautiful (and very large)! I cannot recall other entrees that we have gotten.  These are our favorites. I always order some garlic sauce as well.  I discovered how wonderful this was when we got the clams in garlic sauce as an appetizer once.  If I don't order that appetizer, I always make sure to get some of the sauce as an add-on. I am thrilled that Stephanie's Barbecue III is close to my home.  I highly recommend this place!!!
