LOVE this place. I really dont come here for the food - but the coffee and all their creative spins on it are all incredible. My favorite is the Peanut Butter latte - sounds gross, is actually delicious. Never really been impressed with the food. I last got a hummus plate that ended up being a poorly dressed salad with watery tomatoes and 2 pieces of pita with a small amount of hummus on them - yeah, just stick to coffee. Desserts are decent. The service is kind of slow but then again, it doesnt seem like the type of place that should have table service anyway. Its a great place to study or get work done, a very relaxed environment with comfortable furniture and nice music.
