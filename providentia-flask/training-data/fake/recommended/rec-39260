My wife and I went for our anniversary, and we were not disappointed. Generous portion of very good Italian bread with excellent olive oil or butter. Salads were well prepared. No iceberg lettuce. Balsamic dressing was excellent. I had Â Cotoletta alla Parmigiana which was cooked to perfection and very tasty. Cooked in that excellent olive oil. My wife chose Filetti Saltati Scarpariello, which is a chicken dish. Again, perfectly cooked and very tasty. Desserts were not as good as the main coarse, but still, satisfying. The waitstaff were very attentive. This restaurant deserves to be busier than it was on a Wednesday evening.
