Perfect place for a quick, no-frills meal, though it's a tad small. Quality menu, decent brews. We shared a roasted veggies salad, which was decent. I had a small bite of the Bronte burger and was really digging the sweet chili. I had the posh BLT, which was pretty damn good. I'm a big fan of their sandwich bread. Excited to try more. Ca$h only!
