The food here is amazing.  I had the duck confit and tried the skate wing, steak tartar, paella, chocolate-chip bread pudding, and banana walnut bread pudding. They also had sea urchin on special.  Everything was delicious and cooked to perfection.  My only complaint was the service, which was still excellent, but our server looked a little worn out/or new. (I am a server and this could be me being too picky).  Their house wines are delicious (we drank the Malbec), and their "Straight up Brooklyn" house cocktail is a nice alternative to a call Manhattan.  All in all, I can't wait to go back to this restaurant, or to try their sushi bar next door.
