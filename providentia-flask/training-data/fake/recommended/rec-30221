I've been here three time over the course of 2 years. The first time I went it was amazing, the second and third time were just OK. They have a good range of options for their cuisine, good drinks and really good specials. But there doesn't seem to consistency which is disappointing. If you live in NYC and want to try a new spot for dinner, go check it out. If you are not from NYC, skip it. Decor is cute. Tables very close together so if you are on a date, it's not as intimate.
