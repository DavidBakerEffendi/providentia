So maybe I'm tainted by the waitress telling me and a few guests that we could sit at the table out in the hallway "but we have a group coming in at 8," but yea, I guess it was sort of the opposite of the you-had-me-at-hello thing right there. Anyways, I had the mac and cheese...blah. Not enough salt, pepper, or any flavor for that matter. I can definitely make a tastier mac and cheese (Giada recipe). And I'm not digging the room temp. water either; I need ice, whether you consider that part of the organic food movement or not!
