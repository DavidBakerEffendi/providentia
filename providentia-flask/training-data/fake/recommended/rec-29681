Went for brunch on a Sunday - had to get the nutella french toast. The food was great! However, very small and you basically sit right next to the people at the table on either side, and I felt somewhat like we were being hurried to eat and get out. Not a relaxing brunch atmosphere. Again, however, food was excellent so you win some, lose some.
