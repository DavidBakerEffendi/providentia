This place is a fantastic value. I ordered take-out for my wife and I. We usually like to try several things, so we bought 3 entrees, a large soup, and 1 appetizer, thinking we'd have enough for dinner and one more meal from the leftovers. Let me tell you, we got so much food for our money. When I got there, I was surprised by the size of the box they gave me. Each of the containers for the entrees was filled to the brim with food; there was no skimping on their part. I weighed it, and I will tell you.. we got 14 pounds of delicious Chinese food for $35. And don't think that this was just cheap, greasy junk. We ordered dumplings, wonton/egg drop mixed soup, kung pao chicken, eggplant in garlic sauce, and orange beef. The food was good, and we were happy that a very reasonable (not too much!) amount of salt was used. Basically, this is not a 5 star Michelin Guide style restaurant. But the food was ready quickly, and we felt the quality was much better than we expected for the cost and amount of food we received. We will definitely eat here again.
