Hands down some of the best Middle Eastern food I've ever tasted.  The food is absolutely fabulous - tasty, well-portioned, and easy to share in groups of people.  This is a place to go to have a great time with friends or to impress a date. Seven of us shared the Mezza Royale, Mezza Vegetarian and Mixed Grill, and supplemented the meal with an order of brussel sprouts, lamb ribs, and duck shawarma.  We then squeezed in a couple of fantastic desserts.  This was a lot of food but we seemed to scrape every morsel off the plates. Everything we had was fantastic but I have to say the brussel sprouts and the duck shawarma really did it for me.  I highly recommend these. The only thing that wasn't so fantastic was the wine list.  If you're a fussy wine drinker, choose something you're more familiar with on their menu.
