Corner Bistro's a West Village landmark -- it's been in the neighborhood for as long as I've hung out here. While I love the vibe of CB, I'm not a huge fan of their burgers. They have a very short menu that includes burgers, grilled cheese sandwich and chilli. Personally, I judge a burger on both taste and function. CB burgers are very spiced and well marinated, but the flavor is a bit more complex than I like in my burgers. Also, I can't thoroughly enjoy a burger that's difficult to eat. At CB, they stack the burgers pretty high with toppings, and the whole thing falls apart over your hands as you chomp down, biting into the burger with your mouth open as wide as possible. Next time, I'll probably go for the grilled cheese.
