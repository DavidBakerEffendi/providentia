I'm going to throw my hat in the ring (review #2186) and tell you what everyone else already has: best ramen in the EV and pork buns rivaling those at Momofuku. Fears about the menu being overpriced are unfounded; $16 for the set lunch is a deal for the amount and quality of the food. The space is pretty cool too, very classy, and if you go for lunch...you may not even have to wait that long! We waited about 10 minutes at 1pm on a Monday. Bottom line, it's delicious, go!
