I signed up for Yelp to write this review. We were told enthusiastically over the phone that they had chocolate lava cake; strike 1, that was a lie. Everything seems to cost twice what it should, which only made us more excited for how good it would be. I ordered a coffee while I waited, which was served cold, and eventually replaced with hot, watery "coffee". We finally received our "lava" cake, only to discover that it was just a normal chocolate cake with a miniature scoop of ice cream, and more to the point it was the worst chocolate cake I've ever had, dry and bitter. The strange watery ganache they gave us added nothing.
