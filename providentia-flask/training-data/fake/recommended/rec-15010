I wasn't as impressed with Frankford Hall as most people seem to be. It seemed like a nice space, though. We ended up sitting out by the fire pit, which was really nice. The bar inside was fairly empty and it took quite a while to get our drinks and change. I would definitely come back and give this place another try, but for now, it's just three stars for me.
