Great food, drinks, service and ambiance.  I was wowed as soon as I walked through the door.  The place was warm with nice dark furniture and the outlay of the place was so cozy and unique.  The best drinks"  Jalapeno margarita and ginger mojito.  In tapas, the braised short ribs, skirt steak, brussels sprouts, bacon covered dates, bruschetta, and fried goat cheese were amazing.  I will certainly come back here.
