I've been here for both brunch and dinner now, and have nothing but compliments for this fine establishment. From the wonderful views to the friendly and attentive staff, this place is more than just a Cafe. Above all, the food is as outstanding as it is innovating. Can't wait for my next visit to Pingala Cafe.
