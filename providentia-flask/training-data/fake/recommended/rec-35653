Memphis is a great option for vegans that like good beer. The menu is marked with symbols that inform you what is vegetarian/vegan. In the past I've had the hummus and veggie curry over rice which were both good. I returned last night with a friend and we split the tofu coconut club and pumpkin potpie . Both dishes were delicious and I would order again . The pumpkin pot pie was a little overpriced at 14 dollars but decent portion. Atmosphere -the bar is extremely dark which I prefer but could see others disliking the lighting situation . Bartender was very nice and makes beer suggestions/ offers samples . If you don't know the place you can easily miss it from the outside so I suggest really keeping your eyes peeled on your first visit.
