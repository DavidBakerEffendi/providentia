I had no expectations coming here.  I love hamburgers---I didn't get the burger. But I got grilled cheese with tomato and bacon and I make a MUCH better one. The grilled cheese just looked like it was slapped together and the cheese was not even melted.  And I saw the burger it looked nasty.  The fries were so gross. And I was drunk, so you'd think that the food would taste good no matter what. I dunno my friends were telling me that this place was supposed to be awesome. Def dissapointed.
