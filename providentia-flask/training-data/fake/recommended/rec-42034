Just enjoyed a superbly crafted Dominican dinner with the family. My little guy had the ox tail stew which I was fortunate to sample. The gravy was savory perfection and the Ox tail melted in my mouth. I had the pork mofongo which was garlicky scrumptiousness with just the right amount if tasty pork crackling. My big guy had uthe bistec encebollado with white rice & red beans . The steak was flavorful & tender, again dressed in a delicious gravy /sauce that complimented the rice perfectly. My hubby had the chicharon de pollo with yellow rice & black beans . Best black beans I've ever tasted and I love my habichuelas guisadas . These black beans had just the right amount of tangy vinegar taste , I could have eaten them by themselves. We topped off our meal by sharing a flan with guava sauce and a cafe con leche. The service was five star , attentive , patient with my husband changing his mind 5x  and friendly. The food is off the charts , the prices are reasonable. & the portions healthy but not overly so. We were here  a year and a half ago after we attended a party in the neighborhood and  when contemplating dinner options this evening after our visit to Brooklyn Puerto Viejo was an easy pick as we had waited too long to re-experience this delicious food. Everything was memorable from the empanada apps, to the sangria. I would eat here again and again, but alas we live in Jersey so until the next time Puerto Viejo.
