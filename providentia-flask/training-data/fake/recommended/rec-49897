My boyfriend and I made reservations for this past Friday night weeks ago. Or so we thought. We arrived and said we had a reservation for two. We were met with looks of confusion. They didn't have us down. Our hearts sank. Then Charlotte, the hostess/co-owner, said she could make it work and seated us by the window for what turned out to be a beautiful dinner. Service was outstanding with attentive waiters and food coming promptly. I had the chilled shrimp salad with avocado mousse and celery root remoulade as an appetizer, followed by mahi mahi with purple potato puree, the artisanal cheese plate, and mango meringue pie with wild strawberries. Everything was gorgeously prepared with the freshest ingredients. The interplay of flavors was unexpected and complex in what looked like deceptively simple food. Although my meal was impressive, what was truly outstanding was that the chef improvised a vegetarian dish for my boyfriend (Bibou does not have many vegetarian options listed on its menu and my beloved is primarily a vegan who trained to be a pastry chef in Paris) and personally served it to him. Talk about accommodating! His food was exquisite to look at and taste. Boyfriend was thrilled. Our tab came to about $130 including tax and tip. Dining at Bibou is not cheap but for what you get in terms of atmosphere, service, and the quality of the food, you get a lot for your money.
