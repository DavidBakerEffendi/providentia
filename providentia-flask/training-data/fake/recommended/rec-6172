Had a wonderful meal! Four people for dinner, so we were able to share a number of small plates (Mezethes), followed by great entrees. Mezethes: 1. Octopus: Not the best I've had (The best in NYC was Casa Mono some years ago. The best anywhere was Barcelona), but very good. Grilled with just enough char for flavor. 2. Grilled sea scallops (from the cold mezethes): These were absolutely great - a total surprise and one of the best dishes of the evening. 3. Grape leaves: I never get excited about stuffed grape leaves, though these were very good. 4. saganaki tou merakli - three greek cheeses melted in a clay pot. This was delicious comfort food - even if it was summer. Entrees: At the table were the poached salmon, which was cooked perfectly; Â the whole fish, which was simple, but moist and delicious; the shrimp and sea scallops over pasta, which was merely very good; and the grilled baby lamb chops, which were the best I've had in years (and I'm a big enough fan to have them often). I can't say I'm yet a fan of Greek wine, but the glass I had was passable. The place was very comfortable, with a warm feeling from the ceiling of clay pots. Finally, the service was perfect - very friendly and professional, but never intrusive. All in all a great dinner and a good value.
