Ive eaten here on many occasions.  I always get the steak for 2 with potato, peppers, and onions. Carmines itself is a beautiful place and the staff obviously loves working there its a great place to sit and watch everyone enjoy their own "occasions". If you are lucky enough to get a table I promise you this its impossible to leave this place hungry.  I usually leave with the meat sweats Ive visited three of their locations and the food is the exact same in everyone.  As a professional consistency is everthing, well your food not sucking is something too. try them, you'll love this place.. i love looking at the pictures on the wall also of the owners family when they came here from italy. feels like im eating at my grandmas place.
