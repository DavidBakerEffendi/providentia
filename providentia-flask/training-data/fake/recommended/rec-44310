Good beer selection.  Had the Augustus and the another with the highest ABV.  My sister had a Pilsner-type.  All delicious.   For food, we shared the long-time marinated brisket.   It was good.  Pickles were delicious, fries were average. One complaint:  pretty ridiculous you have to get up from your seat to order your own food from the kitchen- particularly since our male bartender was walking around snapping his fingers, singing, and doing and re-doing his long hair.  Oh, and only brunch food on Sundays until 4pm.  My sister doesn't like eggs.   Awesome open layout and garage doors make you feel like you are sitting on one big patio.  Would re-visit
