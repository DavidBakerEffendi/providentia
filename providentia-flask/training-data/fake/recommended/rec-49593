I NEVER write reviews, so this is saying something. First off, before my friends and I even got our sushi, the girl behind the counter was SUPER nice and gave us the student discount even though we weren't NYU students and we already used our scoutmob coupons. I felt bad that I didn't leave a tip on my card when I first paid because even the service was great! But I will definitely tip the following times I come back! Anyway, so I had the spicy mang and the la fiesta, which were both deeelish!! I tried my friend's sweet tree roll, which was also yummy (i will have to order that next time!). I also tried a piece of the mighty mushroom, which I was contemplating on getting, but glad I didn't because I wasn't too crazy about it. My friends really enjoyed it though. Next time I really wanna try their wraps, particularly the nutty buddy, and the fresh lemonade!! So far, I'm sold! Props to Chef Guy and the amazing staff as well!
