I've had a few meals there that were top notch, but something has changed.  I went in there yesterday, Sunday, for dinner at the bar.  A friend and I were sharing fish tacos and a Rib Eye.   The fish tacos were very good.  Second course, the steak.  We had ordered it rare.  It came out medium.  Maybe even medium-well.  The presentation was eh.  We had no choice but to send it back.  It came back out without our sides (mashed potatoes and asparagus) and the sauce was on the side.   The bartender went back and got us more mashed potatoes, but we never saw our asparagus again.  Our parmesan french-fries arrived later in the meal.   The manager was accommodating, but considering the restaurant was absolutely empty, you would have thought they could do better - given it a little more attention.  I'm not paying $32 because I really want a piece of grilled meat on a plate.  Get it together.
