Beautiful wine bar. Staff seems to know their stuff when it comes to wine and cheese. Tasty small plates. Happy hour specials. For a wine bar it's actually quite roomy. They have outdoor space, as well. And not just four tables squished together while passerby are damn near in your eating/drinking space or a bus is spewing gas fumes in your face. Ordered the garlic shrimp, the pretzels, and three different cheeses and of course wine. I could have stayed there for several more hours eating and drinking but sadly had reservations for dinner elsewhere (which I gladly would have canceled if they were not with my family).
