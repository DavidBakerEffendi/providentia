Carmines is great! I had stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer, they're a bit spicy and delicious! Manicotti and lasagna for main entrees and chocolate pudding for desert. LOTTA food!!! For those who don't know, Carmines provides family size dining so every dish is supersized. It's my favorite Italian restaurant, the food is amazing. Please note, you may have to make reservations ahead of time. We barely got one as everything was reserved 4 days in advance. It may be the fact that it's on 42nd St and there are a lot of tourists in town for the holiday season...
