547 reviews? This is obviously a popular spot in Center City- and I thought I was being clever coming here at lunch- but it was just as busy as when I've been here at night. Got the guac and a lunch special (chop salad and bean enchilada) and all were very delish. Everything struck me as fresh, everything was very flavorful. I'd say the only drawback is that there are so many other Mexican joints in the city that are just as good, and far less expensive. I dined with the hubs and we put in $55...for lunch. As of today (1/13) at 1pm, the photo booth is working.
