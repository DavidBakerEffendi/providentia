I heard about this place from friends and coworkers and wanted to check it out. We walked in thinking it would be much smaller, but they have this cavernous space in the back that is surprisingly very large. I would give the food 4 stars.  We started off with the empanadas which were very delicious and then shared a plate of the matador combo.  LIke many mention, the matador chicken is pretty darn good. Not the best chicken I've ever had but still a satisfactory meal. The meal itself was a great value.  It came with an avocado salad, fried plantains(delicious), rice and beans, sausages with fries, and of course the Matador chicken.  The meal could literally feed a family of four for under 40 dollars.   My favorite part of the meal was definitely the green sauce.  It's one of those things that you crave and make you go back.  We would of asked for more, but our waiter was no where in sight. Which brings us to service portion of this review.   Although the food is about 4 stars, the service definitely brought it down a star.  Our waiter was pretty nice when we first sat down, but for the rest of the dinner he was no where in sight. No one came to check up on us or ask for dessert. At some point, we actually just sat there looking for him, but it was as if he was avoiding us. We ended up having to flag down another waiter to ask for our check.  Our waiter came with the check, didn't say a word and disappeared again. I would understand if it was a busy night, but it was not. All in all, good food, not a great service. I'll order delivery the next time I want some of that green sauce.
