I took my family to Philly and promised them we would eat a real Philly cheese steak sandwich.We should have gone to Pat's instead! The only reason I chose Geno's was because the line was shorter. Both are said to be the Philly tradition, however I unfortunately only had the opportunity to try Geno's. To start off, you have to know what you want! Or else you'll end up feeling like an idiot at the end like I did! After waiting in a very long line on a weekend, we were rushed to order and then charged for the sandwiches...no one said stay in line if you want to order more items! So we got out of line. So yeah, I didn't order us drinks or any side orders or even had any toppings :P The service was simply terrible!
