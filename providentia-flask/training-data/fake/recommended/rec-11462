Slap your mama fresh Bent Spoon ice cream for dessert Bring extra bottle Can't miss Blue Point, they have a Yelp Sticker on the door! You go here and you realize just how long it has been since you've really had good seafood. These guys do it right, with some 25 varieties of fish offered fresh in various forms of preparation on one side of the menu and appetizers ranging from Portuguese Sardines (my first choice and of course no longer available) to several versions of calamari and 16 types of raw oysters...a seafood lovers paradise. My girlfriend's pistachio crusted trout was amazing (and huge, I would not want to run into that sucker in a dark alley) and it came with the best mashed sweet potatoes I've ever had. My Bouillabaisse was outstanding. Their dessert menu had lot's of tempting options including fresh ice creams from the bent spoon! yelp.com/biz/the-bent-spâ€¦ I say bring an extra bottle because it is BYO and they don't take reservations. So get there early, enjoy a few glasses while you wait and get ready for a great dinner. I cast my price range vote at the $$ with the warning that one could easily get over the $30 a person mark...
