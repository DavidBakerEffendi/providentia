Wow - what a disappointment. I was in the neighborhood early and thought it would be great to have breakfast before work for a change.  Sign says open at 6:30, at 7:15 it seemed safe.  I went in and the seemingly very helpful counterperson told me that the kitchen opens at 7:30.  Not a problem, I ordered my breakfast, took my tea, and sat down to read and wait. At 7:30 she came over to tell me that the kitchen is just now starting to prep and my food "won't be ready" - she offered me a refund for the eggs, which I took but I'm still out the time I wasted, the cost of the unconsumed, then unwanted tea, the chance for breakfast and the $2 I put in the tip jar. What a joke. Get your act together.  Thanks for a ruined morning which you somehow managed to make a profit on.
