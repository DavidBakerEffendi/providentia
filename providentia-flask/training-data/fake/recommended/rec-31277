We chanced upon this restaurant, liked the d√©cor and came in for dinner. The food and service was very good, and the prices, including for nicely made cocktails were very reasonable. Both the non-vegetarians and vegetarians among us were pleased with the choices, preparation and portion sizes. The smiling servers were gracious and helped explain some dishes on being asked. All in all we thoroughly enjoyed dining here.
