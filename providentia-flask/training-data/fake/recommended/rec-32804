Came here for an early lunch. They open at 11:30, so when I got here at 11:25 I was told to wait outside. I was slightly offended, but the sign does say 11:30, so that was my bad. There was plenty of parking in their private lot, which was definitely a plus. They have lots of lunch specials from 11:30-3 with basic rolls (California, Alaska, etc) and miso soup or house salad from 8.50. I loveeee seaweed salad and places usually don't allow for substitutions so I promptly ordered my salad and checked out the special rolls. The special roll prices were good $7.95 and up. There are some places where the word "special" means they're going to charge at least $15 for the roll. The non-lunch menu looked pricey, so if I come back it will definitely be during lunch. I ended up ordering the rainbow roll, which was essentially a California roll with white fish and tuna on top. It was pretty good. Nice,fresh, and also filling but honestly nothing to write home about. The waitress was very attentive, always refilling my water and asking how things were going. When I was done she removed my plate and brought the bill promptly. All in all it was a good experience.
