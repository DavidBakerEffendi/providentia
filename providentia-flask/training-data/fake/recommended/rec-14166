It takes some talent to snag a seat here since there always seems to be a line, but do yourself a favor and wait for one because you don't want to walk around NY attempting to dip a pomme frite into one of your many dipping sauces.  My favorite sauce?  Mango Chutney.  So deliciously good that I would've dipped anything in it.  Yeah, the place is small and seating is cramped, but take advantage of the situation and offer your neighbors a dip of your sauces and maybe they'll return the favor!
