North Broad is a ballsy place to open a new upscale Italian restaurant.  It's obvious that these guys have pumped a lot of cash into this place because it's gorgeous and immaculate.  It has an open kitchen, two bars and a lot of seating.   The location could either prove disasterous or genius for Ventri and co. who already have an acclaimed Italian restaurant in Center City.  They certainly seem to appeal to and hit the post work business crowd who travel in from suburbia to go to their offices.  There appears to be plenty of parking for these folks and with the spacious restaurant, it's a good place to take a business lunch or dinner.  The problem with it is that there is nothing else around--some office buildings and the community college (but honestly, I don't know many college kids willing to drop 60/ a head for dinner). As for the food--it's really good.  I had a small plate of clams in a garlicky white sauce which were very good.  They are generous with their fantastic hearth baked bread and crunchy breadsticks.  Their wine list is a little problematic because #1 it's ALL Italian wines, which are somewhat unfamiliar to the American palate. And #2, there is no glass of red cheaper than $10.  I got a nice glass of white for $8, though, which complimented the clams very well. The beer list is ambitious.  With mainly Belgian beer and a few local micros, they seem to be banking on well-honed taste buds.  Like I read in a vacant storefront in Philly when I first moved here, you can go broke overestimating the taste of the American public.
