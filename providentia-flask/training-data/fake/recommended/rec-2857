Had such a great experience here just last week! I went with a group of 5 people and everything was perfect Three of us had the vegetarian wings and loved them so much. Another of us got the spinach salad and the last got the po boys. The atmosphere was great, the music was great, the service was supreme, and I can't wait to go back! I'm super picky about public restrooms, and theirs was mega clean :) Thanks guys
