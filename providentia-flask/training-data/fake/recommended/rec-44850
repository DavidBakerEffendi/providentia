For a laid back cool cocktail place, this is the spot to come to in Boerum Hill. Decor is awesome and very unique. They also have a great happy hour. Cocktails are usually $10 so you get 2 for the price of 1. Keep in mind, it is two for one per person, so you and a friend can't get one cocktail each for $10 total. Still, a good deal. Beer list is pretty good too. They keep a fire going in the winter, which is nice to sit by on these cold winter days. Their food is good too. A huge plus - they are open late which is not the case for most places in the area for when you get the late night food urge.
