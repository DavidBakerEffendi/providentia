That one time I stumbled into a place and subsequently had one of the top 10 meals of my life. Out. Of. This. World. Â  I started with my standard request for a spicy cocktail and they brought me a praise-worthy variation of their pisco drink that had a perfect kick (called a picantillo according to the check). For food we ordered the lomo saltado aka amazingly tender steak and shredded chicken (aji de gallina). Rounded it out with the Maduros plantains and avocado slices. Topped it all with green crack sauce and every single bite was heavenly. I highly suggest you follow in my footsteps.
