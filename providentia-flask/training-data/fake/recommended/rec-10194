I have to quote Rachel Ray when thinking about this place: "YUM-O"! I'm going to avoid the obvious puns here, it being a meatBALL shop and all. I'll get straight to the yummy details. Food: Great! I ordered the sliders so that I could get the best of both balls, ugh, I couldn't help it. My favorite was the beef meatball. It was nice and juicy, I liked that it wasn't Â rolled too tight so the juices absorbed all the wonderful Italian seasoning. I wasn't too impressed with the pork meatball it was okay, a little dry for my taste. My third slider was the special of the day. It was a lamb meatball, greek-style, very flavorful. It was a little heavy on the yogurt sauce though, which drowned out that lamb flavor that I always look for. I also had the arugula and apple salad. It was very simple with a nice light vinaigrette- a good pallet cleanser as you go through the different sliders. Dessert: Truly the best part of the entire meal. I was like a kid in a candy store. " You pick" your choice of a homemade cookie to go with your choice of homemade ice cream to create your own ice cream sandwich. Genius. I went with the chocolate brownie cookie with mint ice cream and the chocolate chip cookie with the espresso ice cream. They were both really good, the espresso ice cream was amazing. Atmosphere: I love the family oriented atmosphere. The selection of music is great. Its loud enough that you can hear it but not so loud that you have to talk over it. The menus are these fun laminated sheets that you check off your order on. Service: The service was a little sparse at times. In their defense it was a Saturday and it was extremely busy. They are still new, so hopefully in time they'll pick up the pace a little. Overall, I left very satisfied and eager to visit again.
