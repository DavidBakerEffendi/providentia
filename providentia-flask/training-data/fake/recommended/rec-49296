In town for a stopover between trains, I needed coffee. I walked in here thinking it was the coffee shop/bookstore down the street I found on Yelp. Coffee and a walnut scone for ~$3. Both were alright. You know, passable for what they were but not overwhelmingly satisfying. I didn't find a book for my next train.
