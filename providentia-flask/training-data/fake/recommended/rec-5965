So after reading ALL the reviews and even seeing it on Man vs Food, i had to try it. All I can say is this is the real deal. I ordered the cliche item, pulled pork, sharp provolone and broccoli rabe. Upon first bite I knew that this was going to be right up in my top 10 sandwiches of all time. I think by the end it was in top 5. I have to admit what made the sandwich was surprisingly the sharp provolone - god it was perfect. Service was also excellent - with a packed line order was taken quickly and sandwich followed soon after. If I had to name anything as a con..I would say it was TOO good and now I will probably neglect other stands at Reading Terminal because I will be in line at DiNic's.
