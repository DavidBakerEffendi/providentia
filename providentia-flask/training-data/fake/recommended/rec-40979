This place does, indeed, have the most kawaii (Eric A.). 45 degrees of kawaii. The most sparkly jewel in their crown, though, is not their grub, but their drink! Â They have a pickled apple smoothie that'll make your head spin. The Hiyashichuka was okay the first time I had it and excellent the second time. Make sure to mix in the mustard on the side. The Chirashi is pretty great, as well. The Sake Teishoku is a pretty safe bet. I like to think of it as relaxy snacky time and not so much of a re-fueling station. The perfect place to duck into while cruising around Williamsburg and you just wanna take a break.
