I saw pictures of Umami burgers on FB and Instagram before and I wanted to check it out. The burgers look small but they will fill Â you up! The meat is real thick and juicy. They will cook it perfectly medium rare, which is what they recommend for certain burgers. We tried three burgers: the Original, Truffle, Cali burger. I thought the truffle burger was the best, then the cali, then the original. The truffle is very juicy and you will def get the 'truffleness' from it. I really recommend it. I think I know why they named the cali one cali because it is refreshening. If you want a burger that feels less greasy in your mouth, I would recommend this. The Original is good as well! but nothing too special. The burgers are about $12 each. We also got the truffle fries on the side. The truffle fries come with 3 different sauces. The garlic aioli was my favorite. There is a spicy sauce that is spicier than what you'll expect. The fries were cut thin, which is not how I like my fries. They were flavorful but I can definitely get better ones elsewhere. I don't know if I will go out of my way to come to Umami again. I think it's better than Shake shack and worth a try. The place reminded me of Bobby's burger palace for some reason... maybe it's b/c both places are not fast food restaurants neither a gourmet place. They don't taste similar.. but the vibe is kind of...
