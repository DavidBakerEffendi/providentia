Great people, great food and awesome service!  A true 'taste of Italy' in a wonderful part of Queens. Intimate dining venue with a neighborhood air.  We enjoyed our second visit as much as our first.  Carmelo, Guiseppe and the entire staff are friendly, professional and welcoming.  We'll be back!!!   Buon appetito!  Mary & Jim
