5 stars for the steak tartare alone. Perfectly seasoned and absolutely delicious. The food here is outstanding. Also had the goat cheese and onion tart which was really tasty, and the croquettes for starters. For my meal, I had the mussels, which were very good, and I also got to try other dishes at the table, including the sauteed skate, which I liked a lot more than I expected to.  It managed to be rich and buttery but also light at the same time, with just the right amount of salty bite from the capers.  The fries were also good - although I must admit they were the one part of the meal that didn't blow me away. Maybe I just expected too much, but I think Balthazar fries are overhyped. The delicious food here was complemented by excellent service, all making for a really great dining experience. Highly recommend Balthazar!
