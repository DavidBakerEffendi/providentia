The food is good. I really like their stewed chicken, jerk chicken and curried goat. Oxtail was okay. Price is reasonable and portions are very large. My only gripe is the waiting time for food. Up to 15 minutes even when there are no customers...I don't get what takes them so long to just share the food out.
