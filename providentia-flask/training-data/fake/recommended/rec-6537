I really liked the inside of the place. The service was good. We got the Brussels Sprouts (per waiter), Eggplant (per Yelp), and something else which I forgot because it wasn't that good. The brussels sprouts were the best I've ever eaten. They were an amazing burst of flavors. It's a must get. The eggplant was also very good. We had lamb chops and grilled chicken for entr√©es. Both were very good. The rice actually was really good. We got the JJJ candy JJJ bar JJJ was ok but the banana bread was really good. Overall everything was very good. I look forward to visiting again soon.
