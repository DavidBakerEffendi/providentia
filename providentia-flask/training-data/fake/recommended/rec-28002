Great steak place and more.  We went hear New Years Eve.  Service was outstanding- friendly, attentive and professional.  Steaks were great - ribeye was flavorful and the bone-in strip was superb.  All steaks are served with fried and a choice of sauces.  Amazing selection of appetizers - endive salad, proveleta, salmon crudo and chorizo!  Can't wait to go back and try some others.  Good wine selection.  Only complaint was the wine mark-up -- 4x is a bit steep!
