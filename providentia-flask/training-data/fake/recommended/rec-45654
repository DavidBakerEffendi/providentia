Get there early or bring a book and wait a short while.  I got there early, we were seated immediately.  The place looks great, the appearance is a good fit in the bella vista area.  The waiters were efficient, friendly, and just noticeably busy enough. The food is in line with other good philly brunch fare - large but deliciously detailed egg dishes, fun sweet dishes, and nifty juices.  We had ginger lemonade, challah french toast with mango & banana, and breakfast pizza.  They aren't the best brunch I've had, but they're what I expect out of a good philly brunch. I agree with the previous poster's complaints regarding tin cups for coffee - one shouldn't have to burn their lips when trying to burn their throat.  I disagree about the ketchup though - yes it's homemade and yes it tastes nothing like heinz (more like a cross between barbecue sauce and marinara).  But what are you doing with ketchup anyway?  Good brunches don't need to be slathered in ketchup, but a little hot sauce never hurt.  There's also strawberry jam at the table - I don't know if it's homemade but it went really good on the french toast (and plain by the spoonful). The ladie & I were out of there for just over $20 before tip.  Slightly more expensive than a diner but a good deal for brunch.  If you're in the area and you already tried Carman's recently, go get your Glory on.
