A tasty caf√©, with an array of vegan sandwiches for lunch. We had an "ELT" whose secret ingredient is delicious "eggplant bacon," thin slices of deep-fried eggplant skin. Their French toast, with bananas, strawberries and a special "butter" made fm Earth Balance and crystallized ginger to go with the Vermont maple syrup, was delightful. All their baked goods, including cinnamon rolls, choc chip cookies and macaroons were fresh and full of flavor. Lots of salad/sandwich choices. Not much seating room, but they do have a few outdoor tables overlooking an old mill on the Winooski river. Great place for a casual lunch.
