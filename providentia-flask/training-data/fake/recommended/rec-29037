I love chocolate as much as any other girl and was so excited to try out a place dedicated to chocolate.... but was so disappointed by the lackluster food, overly sweetened desserts, and poor service. First, our waitress seemed nice enough in the beginning, but then it took her about 20-30minutes for her to come around and take our food orders. Throughout the whole meal, she only came TWICE: once to take our food orders and the second to bring us the check. Nice to see she only remembered us to take our money... The food was a solid 3 stars. Very very mediocre. For dessert, my boyfriend and I split the chocolate tasting for two. The concept of the little mini grill was cute to toast your marshmallows but totally didn't work in practice. Our table was so tiny I was scared someone walking by was going to knock the whole thing over, or even worse, have the grill sing my hair! The rest of the dessert was forgettable... the chocolate eggrolls were so sweet we could only eat half of one of them. My boyfriend said he liked the banana/chocolate/waffle thing, but everything else pretty much tasted the same. So disappointed with the food and the service. Dare I say it? The chocolate fondue at Melting Pot tastes better!
