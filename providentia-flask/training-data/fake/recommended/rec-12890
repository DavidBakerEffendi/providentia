Whenever I have friends visit NYC from the west coast, this is one of the few places that I'm guaranteed to take them. The food here is delicious, VERY affordable, and open late, which is perfect for those late nights when Halal Guys is just too far out of the way. Personally, I recommend the beef Naked Balls with Parmesan Cream over the mashed potatoes. You won't be disappointed.
