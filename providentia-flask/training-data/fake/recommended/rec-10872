This restaurant is right by my work so I've come a couple times, once during lunch and once for dinner.   For the lunch special I got the combination box and it was yummayyy.  It comes with salad, rolls, choice of meat, and rice...I really like the ginger too for some reason. For dinner I had the spider roll and the tokyo downtown noodles.  Pass on the spider roll...not so impressive.  But the tokyo downtown was veryy impressive.  Also, great service.  Will probably be a regular!
