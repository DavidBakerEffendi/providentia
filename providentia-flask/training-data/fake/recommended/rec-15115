Oh baby!  This place killed it!  We were visiting Philly for the weekend and didn't want to blow it when it came to choosing the right cheesesteak place.  So, we asked lots of people where to go and read many reviews first. We were told to steer clear of Geno's and Pat's as they are over-rated. As it turned out, we definitely made the right choice.   The steak at Sonny's was top quailty.  Not fatty or chewy.  My only regret was I didn't get extra whizz.  Also, the people who worked there were super nice.  Btw, their website is pretty kick ass too!
