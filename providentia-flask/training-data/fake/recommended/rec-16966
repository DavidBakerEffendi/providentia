Sometimes, the most beautiful rainbows come from the darkest of storm clouds. That describes my dining experience at Costanera quite well. I just posted a review of the incredibly poor experience I had trying to eat at Cuban Pete's just down the street. I won't repeat it here (pls check out my review), but my group walked in here as a second choice. Never again as it will be our FIRST choice from here on out! I'll keep this brief: Octopus. Never had it and never wanted to. And then BOOM! Costanera completely blew my bias against it to smithereens. The appetizer was one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten. And all of the entrees were delicious! Staff was completely on point as well and the prices were very good. I suppose my only complaint is that it is a bit cramped between the tables, but honestly if I could give 4.5 stars I would. EAT HERE!!!! EAT HERE NOW!!!!! EAT HERE LATER!!! JUST EAT HERE!!!!
