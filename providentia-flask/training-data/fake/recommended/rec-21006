Had lunch today with a friend. OCabanon is a really cool, down-town'esk french bistro, in area without a lot (maybe any?) good restaurants.  Don't be put off by the block (W29th, bet. 7th-8th) which is garment district, commercial looking.  Cabano is worth the trip. My guess is that they are ahead of the curve on the neighborhood, which is beeing taken over by young companies and condos.   We shared Charcuterie plate, frisee salad and the steak sandwich special.  All food was excellent.  Service very attentive, making a real effort. Ended up speaking with the owner/chef Michael who is really great. (from Le Bernardin).  Gave us a tour of the space which he renovated himself: kind of industrial chic, lots of welded metal, distressed wood, cool overhead light in the back.   I am definitely coming back and recommending to friends.   Want to try the rest of the menu and what looks like a cool, eclectic wine list
