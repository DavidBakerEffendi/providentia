The prices on the website are outdated: I believe the Bistro burger is now $6.50. I had a Bistro burger, which was supposed to be 8 ounces of meat but certainly didn't compare to the massiveness of Paul's burger. The meat was kind of dry and grainy, but it was alright, nonetheless. The fries were definitely disappointing. The shoestring fries tasted like they were frozen and kept for too long after being fried, and reheated again. They were tough and chewy. The service was pretty bad. Our server never placed anything onto our table - it was always dropped. Serviettes fluttered for a bit before settling onto the table; our burger plates slid for a bit before they came to a standstill a little too far from us; water poured from the jug splattered onto our plates. I don't expect great service from a dive like this but I don't appreciate having my things getting to me via gravity. Paul's over Corner Bistro any time, both in terms of service, quality of food, and price.
