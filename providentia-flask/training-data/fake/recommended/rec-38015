As long time sushi afficianados from Los Angeles I was overwhelmed by the quality and generosity of the sashimi platters. The quality of the fish was excellent, the preperations artistic, the wait staff both knowledgeable and friendly. five stars will deserved. BYOB but very nice ice and glass service.
