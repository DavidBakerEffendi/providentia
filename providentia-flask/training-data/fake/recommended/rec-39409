I love in Long Island - family lives on Grand - decided to try to head into the city for a birthday/new years eve dinner here...i called in to ask about dining - family also called in to ask about dining. We've tried in the past to make reservations and were told they don't honor them - to just come right in. On this night, both calls made to the cafe yielded the same result - to just come in and note that the kitchen would be closing early. I take the 2 hour train ride into the city, arrive at Petisco to be told that A. reservations were the only parties being seated & B. the folks eating made reservations days before ... while I stood there and looked around, there was an empty table for 4 with no table settings in one corner and set table for 2 in another. I decided to order dinner to go and not bother asking why we couldn't sit at either of those... while waiting for my to-go order, I felt they were annoyed with my standing there waiting. My family & I frequent this cafe. We're locals and appreciated the addition to the neighborhood ... not sure if management has recently changed or what the actual deal is with reservations at this place but we'll find somewhere else to eat. At minimum, when folks call to ask questions, especially ones like 'can i come in and eat?' make sure the person answering the phone knows what they're talking about.
