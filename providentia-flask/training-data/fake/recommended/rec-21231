I would recommend this place if you're in the mood for a delicious bowl of pasta and a carafe of red wine. The spaghetti noodles were doughy (which I looove) and the pomodoro sauce was great. I'd also recommend the Minestrone soup if available. To top it off the servers were attentive and the prices were reasonable.
