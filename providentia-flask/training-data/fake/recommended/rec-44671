The beer here was incredibly good. I came away with a new appreciation of imperial porters. I'm not sure that I would make it my regular place due to the space being too small. Everyone bumped into everyone on the way out (including the over-indulged guided out by their surprisingly patient friends). But I had a good time and it fit my mood! Also, the doorman (at least last night) was awesome!
