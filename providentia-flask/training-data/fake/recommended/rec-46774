This place always has a ridiculous wait time, even for a party of 2. The tea selection is very widespread and the teas are all very good (so much love for Chamomile!!!). Â However, the desserts are overpriced for a tiny portion and mediocre at best. Come for the tea, not for the food! Overall, it's a pretty cute place for a date or catching up with friends. Also, beware that Cha-An is cash only.
