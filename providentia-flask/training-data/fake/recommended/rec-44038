Got the lunch special: tomato tofu with veg fried rice. It was tasty! The down-side is it was 70% rice and 30% tofu dish. Since it was only $7.50, I guess I'm fine with that breakdown of rice/tofu. But I thought I should mention it since it is Chinatown and comparable places will give me alot more of the dish and much less of the rice... Credit card min of $15.
