The decor is lovely. All the food is very good. Service is very professional. A very polished, well-run restaurant. There's a vegetarian tasting menu too! I wish I had more to say. I guess I could go through every dish and tell you how good it was, or talk about the professional service (very attentive, by the way). But everyone else has already said it. Â The one thing that made it a four-star instead of a five-star experience for me is that the whole thing just seems like it wasn't meant for me. All the people wearing button-up shirts with shorts, spending what to most would be a lot of money for lunch, just kind of made me feel a little funny. Don't get me wrong, the restaurant is great. Just maybe not the place for me.
