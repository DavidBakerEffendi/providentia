Order the smoked chicken!  It was unreal...Juicy and flavorful!  It tasted like a chicken banged a smoked ham...Smokey mmmmmm...Nice smoke ring and dericious pink meat! Lamb pastrami was good, shrimp and grits were good, bacon and peaches were good, pork chop was goooooood! Dessert was dope! Key lime pie, chocolate cheesecake and bourbon pecan ice cream...Yeah I liked this place
