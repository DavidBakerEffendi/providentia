FOUR STARS AVERAGE!!! Are you kidding me! And granted, the "eco friendly" schtick is real High Concept... bicycle-powered blender n' all. But 4 stars.... really!? Maybe its me. Maybe I should have been drinking some 8-dollar Mojito/Margaritas from the fancy granitas machine. Perhaps that would have softened me a bit. And I haven't yet tried the corn everyone is raving about. Though they'd be hard pressed to top the Red Hook women and their fancy charred corn-ey goodness. I'm not turned off by the food-from-a-truck thing either. I just got back from L.A. where there are like A THOUSAND taco trucks all over town with about 990 of them serving up mind-blowing $1 Carne Asada and Al Pastor mini tacos that puts every NY taco mill to shame. How is it that this well-financed Fort Greene concept-truck-as-restaurant doesn't come close to what a family-run roachey ghetto L.A. parking lot truck is putting out? HOW INDEED? What was being peddled as a "burrito" was merely a wrap with the ends closed up. What am I - two years old? It ain't fooling me. It is NOT a burrito. Just stop. High concept: YES. Mediocre Food: YES. How to fix it: Let the dude in the truck cook what he cooks at home. Then it might rate 4 or 5 stars. And the saddest fact of all: you can walk 10 paces next door to Cafe Lafayette and get over-the-top excellent food. Sure they don't have solar cells to power their restaurant - they use dinosaur gas to cook it up. But at least you don't have to choke it down. (Here's my girlfriend's review: "dry chicken, wilted lettuce. I have NEVER had a salad in New York like this." She's not as bitchy as me.)
