BEST TOMATO SAWCE!!! I had the Eggplant Parmesan and it was BOMB. They slice it pretty thin, cover it in red sauce, mozz cheese and more of the delicious red sauce over it, side of pasta, soup or salad. $15 not bad at all. My husband had the meatball sandwich, I tried a bite, it's not my fave. The server seemed like it was his first day on the job, but we all had to start somewhere ;-) First time in NJ for me and it wasnt a bad place to start for good eats in the east. Compliments to the mom/pop who decided to make their kitchen a reality for Jersey noobs like myself.
