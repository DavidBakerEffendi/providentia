My fiance and I had to check out the famous South Philly Cheesesteak places, so we went to Pat's first, and got one "wit provolone" and a birch beer.  We liked Pat's style more.  It was a whole lot simpler looking than Geno's, which was lit up like Clark Griswald's house in Christmas Vacation.   It was definitely a good cheesesteak, but we were a bit underwhelmed, given all the hype it gets.  The meat wasn't as moist as I wanted it to be, but was still flavorful. The bread was excellent. We wondered if going the cheese whiz route would have made the steak better, and concluded it probably would.  Overall, a pretty good cheesesteak, and a really cool neighborhood.
