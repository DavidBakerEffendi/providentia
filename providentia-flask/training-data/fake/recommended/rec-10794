I ordered fish of the day. The fish was overcooked. The server did not ask for feedbacks on dinner. I wrote my comments on the feedbacks slip. The server did not submit my comments. Instead, she just put my comments slip in her pocket. Her name is Lizanne. I don't think the food and service more than 1 star.I won't go back.
