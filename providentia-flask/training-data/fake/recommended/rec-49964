What an amazing place! Â It was a crowded Saturday night when we went. As soon as I approached the bar, a very nice man stood up and insisted I take his seat. The staff was very personable and the service was great. The owner even came over and spent time with us and bought us a drink. The crowd was very friendly, and the atmosphere was perfect for a neighborhood bar. I would recommend this place to anyone breezing through Staten Island, especially if you are taking the ferry, because you can throw a stone to this hidden gem. Stop in here.
