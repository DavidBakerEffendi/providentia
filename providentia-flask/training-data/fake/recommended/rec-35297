My boyfriend and I went there for dinner recently and had a great meal.  The place is small and tables were a bit too close together, but since the place was so cute and romantic, I would have to describe it as "cozy".  Unfortunately, we did not know it was BYOB so we had nothing to drink, so be sure to bring your own bottle.  We had the special that night, the lobster taco and it was EXCELLENT!  We loved it so much we wanted it again instead of desert.  I had the ox tail and it was very good.  My boyfriend had the roasted pork and that was even better.  If we lived in Williamsburg we would be there all the time.
