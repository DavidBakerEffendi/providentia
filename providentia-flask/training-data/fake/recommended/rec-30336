Probably the most expensive restaurant I have ever been... Food was out of this world and service was awesome. Not a stuffy place either! I got the porterhouse for 2, smoked Brussel sprouts and the lobster bisque. My friend got the lamb OMG... Also do not leave without trying the lobster Mac n chs... You will not be disappointed in the place... I promise!!!! Â Just any FYI for the $ conscious... I spent $100 including tip on my meal alone...
