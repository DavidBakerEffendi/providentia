I can't get enough of Woorijip.  It's actually a perfect choice for most occassions.  The value, selection and authentic taste are all there. I live near here (a 10-minute walk).  And, as I've said in my other reviews, I don't grocery shop or cook which makes a place like Woorijip perfect for me.  I can pick up 3 or 4 to go platters (bibimbap, kalbi, spicy chicken over rice, chap che) and have food for the next 2-3 days.  And I'm eating all this good food without breaking the bank. I'm glad they've made recent renovations to mitigate the congestion in the middle of the place.  Heating containers for the food used to be in the middle between the cash registers and the buffet.  They've moved it to the side towards the back which has significantly helped traffic flow. When I do the buffet option, I usually load up on the kalbi with lots of kimchee.  I grew up with Korean elementary, middle and high school friends and their mom used to make the best Korean food growing up.  I'm hooked on this stuff. Tip:  there's this red sauce that they sell for .50 next to the bibimbap on the left.  Try it.  It's good on everything. Best value in all of Ktown!
