we had a terrific experience here.  the table side guacamole was a hoot, and all the food we ordered was delicious.  we sat on the deck, in nice weather, and the atmosphere was so nice we were transported miles away from the new england coast.  the only glitch i experienced was i tried to order a cocktail but alcohol free and was unsuccessful doing this, somehow this could not be accommodated or my request was confusing.  to this day, however, this is by far on of my favorite places i've eaten at in new haven, and i highly recommend it.
