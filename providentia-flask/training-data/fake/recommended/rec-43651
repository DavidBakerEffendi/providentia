I've been to BXL East twice now, once for brunch and once for dinner.  It was very quiet on the weekend for brunch, but this past Friday night every table and the bar was full!  The service was great.  I had a reservation for 6 and even though only 2 of us were there first,and they were packed, they still took us to our table and got us started with drinks.  When the bar ran out of the wine I was drinking, the waitress immediately brought a tasting of a similar wine to try.  Plus, she didn't charge me for one of the new glasses because they had run out of what I had originally ordered.  The mussels and fries are amazing. I could probably just eat the fries and dip the bread into the mussels pot.  The Provencal salad is incredible and I admit I had it both times I was there.  I love this spot and will be back for unlimited mussels on Mondays.
