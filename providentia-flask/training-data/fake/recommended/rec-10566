Plum on Park just started serving dinner, and the effort out of the gate is admirable. My girlfriend's cast iron roasted chicken was perfectly crispy and delightful. My "Zucchini Spaghetti" was prepared in a robust pesto. The chocolate panna cotta jiggled charmingly and was propped atop a slight brittle, which was a perfect complement to the custard. Outstanding. Dine in a quiet and low-lit setting a little Â suggestive of Hopper's "Nighthawk", romantically serenaded by Pops, Cole Porter, Ella. Maybe it won't be quiet for very long.....
