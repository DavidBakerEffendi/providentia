Taim is just that ...damn tasty (Hebrew corny joke). Yes the falafel is good but my go to is the Sabich which is just a messy gluttonous delight. Pan Fried Eggplant, tahini, humus, fried onions, hot peppers, Israeli salad, and the key here is the Amba. If you are not drenching this in the Amba sauce (pickled mango curry sauce) you are simply not enjoying this sandwich to the fullest. My only complaint is that the schug really lacks that spicy punch you want - can't seem to find solid Schug outside of maybe Queens in NYC.
