I had the pork belly sandwich. The meat itself was cooked well, but the bread wasn't crispy and there was way too much sauce. Overpowering sweet and creamy mayo flavors rings Americanized-Asian. It didn't help that the sandwich was expensive and quite small. If you like authentic Asian flavors, steer clear. On the other hand if you like P.F. Chang's, this might be your joint.
