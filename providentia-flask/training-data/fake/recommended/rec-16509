My husband and I went here for dinner via the Savored reservation, and it was absolutely mind blowingly good! The service was amazing - all servers were very nice/professional and made sure we always had everything we needed! The food was just out of this world... it had the feeling of good home cooking with just the right portions. With the French influence, everything also had a richness to it. It did start to get busy around 7:30/8PM, but that's a good sign of an awesome restaurant. If you go around 6:30PM the atmosphere is more low key and quiet, which is perfect right after work. Can't wait to go back!
