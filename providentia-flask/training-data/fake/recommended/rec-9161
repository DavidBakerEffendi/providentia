90% of the people in line for Dinics were talking about Man vs. Food, so that tells you two things: 1) this place attracts tons of tourists 2) only 10% of the people could possibly be regulars (or maybe they just love Man vs. Food so much that they can talk about it for 30 mins straight) "Adam Richman came more than two years ago."  I have that statement looping in the back of my mind as I write, because the guy behind the counter had it as the answer to the questions that were asked of him several times as I waited in line. Of course, the reason I was in line (and in Reading Terminal Market at all) was because I saw the Man vs. Food episode.  So how was Dinics?  It was okay.  The pulled pork sandwich was fine, with a tender texture and somewhat flavorful meat, though it was more bland than I expected it to be.  The bread was a regular footlong, and the cost came out to $8.25 with tax.  That's decent. Would I do it again?  No.  Not when Hershel's Deli is right across from Dinics, with almost no line, and with a heavenly pastrami sandwich.  And regardless of Hershel's, Dinic's sandwich is not worth waiting more than 10 minutes.  But, at least I can say I tried Dinics. Speaking of that line, the reason the wait is so long has much more to do with the inefficiency of the workers versus the demand for the food.  They could fire half the staff and still have three people effectively chopping up the meat, putting it in the bun, and taking payment.
