Be prepared to wait here if you come for brunch on the weekend - its packed!! But the food is awesome so it's totally worth it! Â I got the egg white frittata with turkey bacon, spinach, and some other ingredients and it was delicious! It also came with toast and potatoes! We took the first seats that came up so we ended up sitting at the bar but service was still on par and the full menu was offered. I can't wait to try the French toast next time! Update: I went again for lunch and their sandwiches are delicious! Big portions and can't go wrong with whatever you order. And less of a wait time this time around too :)
