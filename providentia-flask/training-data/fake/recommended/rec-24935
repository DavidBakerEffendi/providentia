Couldnt have asked for better service after a nice day. My in laws and I went here for lunch with my small son and husband, and were waited on by a waitress named Cayna. She was so friendly and had a great personality. The food came out fast, and was tasty. The views outside were nice as well as the sitting area outside. The passing boats kept my son occupied. Overall couldnt have asked for a nicer experience. Its a must go
