Just visited this restaurant for the first time. It was a wedding anniversary party for about 30 people. The food was fantastic! From soup to appetizers which included chorizo, bolinhas de bacalao, and entrees like ribs, paella, clams with pork... And so much more was beyond exceptional. The service was surprisingly good considering that the place was packed both in the restaurant and adjoining party rooms. The specialty here is steak on a stone cooked table side by you. I saw an smelled the end result and look forward to returning for a taste. If you get a chance to visit this place take full advantage by saving your appetite... There's no skimping here with any dish. Try the Sangria it's great!
