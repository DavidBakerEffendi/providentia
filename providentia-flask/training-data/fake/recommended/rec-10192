First, I love empanadas or anything that resembles dumplings. Sure I have been eating their empanadas way too many times since it's really close to my apartment and I can't get pass any restaurant that actually has "empanadas" in their name. but rest assured that their empanadas are not... good. It's decent like any other fast food empanada shops I've been to but nothing special. It lacks flavors and the shells are too thick and too dry some times not even crispy... I like mine thin and extra crispy. The stuffing is also not juicy either.. they tend to be a bit dry and flavor less in my taste. I am ashamed to admit that I tried every single one of their empanadas, but don't get your hope too high. If you just want regular empanadas and decent food, this will do just fine. Just nothing spectacular or memorable.
