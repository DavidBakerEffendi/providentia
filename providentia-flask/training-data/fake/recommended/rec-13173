i remember coming to Artichoke in the winter. i've never been there before and my friend told me i HAD to try it. i was a little hesitant because i'm not a huge fan of artichoke in general. (it used to scare me when i was kid and i would never dare touch one). so it was winter-- in new york-- it was cold-- it was rainy-- but my friend kept saying things like "you can't consider yourself a new yorker if you haven't walked in the rain at least once!" and "you're such a baby" so i had to prove her wrong and i had to prove to the city that i was one of their own. so we decided to do it. WALK to Artichoke in the winter new york rain. it did only take us 10-15 minutes, but looking back at it, i don't know what we were thinking... i'm just glad we did it because ever since then i can't get enough of this warm soupy heaven of a slice. i have to admit, it does taste better after a cold and rainy walk there, but sometimes a gal can't make it rain. so basically here's the deal: the slices are huge-its pretty pricey-- but DEFINITELY worth it. after a few bites you feel as if you've had a 3 course meal and ready for a nap. it is VERY filling, heavy, rich, creamy, all that good stuff. (good stuff for your taste buds, not for your thighs!) i've been going to Artichoke occasionally since then, but i'll always remember that one day in the rain where i got to taste this delicious slice of pizza for the first time.*sigh*
