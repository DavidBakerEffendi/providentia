Poor souls of New Haven, I cry out and share your pain!  As a former resident, I was forced to come to this hideous house of greed once when the craving for korean food overwhelms any shred of sensibility.   $14 for tasteless preforzen haemul pajeon?!! $19 for watery inedible spicy octopus?!!  R U f**king kidding me?!! This place should be called soul-less restaurant, a place of a parasitic horror show.  I grew up with koreans and will speak with full confidence and rage that this is not authentic korean food.
