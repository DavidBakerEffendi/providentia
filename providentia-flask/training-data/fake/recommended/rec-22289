I really, really wish that Yelp let us give 1/2 stars.  I have yet to give 5 stars to anyplace, because I like to think I haven't yet experienced 'the best of the best', but this place would be 4.5 stars! After years (literally) of suggesting we try this place, DH finally gave in for dinner this Friday night :). Suffice to say he is kicking himself for not going sooner. He ordered a clambake (special for the night) which was local steamers, house=made guanciale, roasted leeks, and an AH-MAZING jalapeño cornbread .  The clams were local out of Noank, and he said they were sweet and wonderful. I ordered the chicken and biscuit, which was lipsmackingly good.  they brine it for 24 hrs in a beer brine, and then cook it in some wonderful way, which makes the skin SUPER crispy.  I HATE chicken skin. HATE it.  It literally makes me gag.  This skin was so good, I actually ate it, and I was looking for more.  The biscuit was a chive biscuit and was so tender and worked to absorb the juices really well. Finally , we ordered a side of mac and cheese.  This was life-changing mac and cheese.  The flavors were just so good, I do wish it were a little creamier, though (just my preference),but it was awesome. We had wanted the cheese plate, but have learned the hard way that any cheese plate can be a belly-buster and we wind up not wanting dinner.  Next time  we will go for the cheese plate though. Service was great, not too intrusive, friendly and attentive.  Just the right note. DH can't wait to go back, and neither can I!
