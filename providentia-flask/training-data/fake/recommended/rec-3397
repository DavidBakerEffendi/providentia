BELIEVE THE HYPE.  Man I love this pizza.  I started going here way before food network and the popularity and the pizza is good.  Its so good it will ruin you for other pizza trust me.  It doesn't help that Lombardi's has some really hot waiters too.  Make sure you get plenty of the sauce and try the chopped garlic.
