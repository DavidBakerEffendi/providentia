SHORT & SWEET: can you imagine bringing an 8 month-old baby to a top bistro in Paris and asking for a high chair? Â They'd laugh you out on the street before you could get past the coat check; we brought our little boy to Balthazar and he was the life of the party; wonderful staff; exquisite interiors; flawlessly French in every way; try the frisee aux lardons salad, the warm goat cheese and onion tart, and close with the moule frittes or grilled trout; if you have a trust fund, try the seafood tower.
