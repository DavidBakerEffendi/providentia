The only bad thing I can say about this place is that they run out of food or simply do not serve the full menu daily. I often call later in the evening though so I't might be my fault. This really doesn't bother me much because no matter what they're out of you can't go wrong with anything here... seriously Curry Vegetables and Stew Peas are amazing if your veg. The Jerk Chicken is good, nice and spicy. Curry Goat is my favorite here, the sauce is well balanced, always tastes fresh and I've never had tough meat. I do wish they were more liberal with the cabbage, veg, and salad sides though. This place does one thing and does it well which is refreshing considering the countless inauthentic restaurants trying to do to much with their menus.
