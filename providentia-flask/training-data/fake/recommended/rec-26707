Whenever I go into B2, I almost always see a friend. It's a very neighborhoody place. Â There is the "everyone has laptops out and is working" element sometimes, but there's also that social atmosphere that coffeeshops had before the laptop age. The big tables are great to spread out at, but it can get cramped. One minor strike against them is that different workers will charge you different prices for the same thing. But they're all nice people, so I don't really mind.
