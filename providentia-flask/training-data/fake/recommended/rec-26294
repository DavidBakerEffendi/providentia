I came here for brunch with a group of four. Since we didn't have a reservation, we were told that we had to wait 35 - 40 minutes. We ended up with a table within 15 minutes. The waitress was accommodating and recommended some stuff for us since it was the first time for all of us to try Jane. She came back multiple times to check in on us and to refill our tap water. I got the Fried Chicken with Waffles and it was delicious. It was quite pricey ($17). With tax and tip I paid $23 overall. Definitely a nice place to treat yourself from time to time. I'll definitely be back!
