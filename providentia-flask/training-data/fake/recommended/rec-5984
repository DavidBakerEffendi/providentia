I have been here maybe 4-5 times over the years when I've been in town for work or play. I love the food. It is family style so good for groups. They also have an interesting martini line up. My friends go wild for the "Buzz Aldrin" it's a tangerine flavored martini with the rim of the glass dipped in Tang powder! Its also a good place to start out before a long night of bar hopping. The reason I give it 4 starts is because one time I had my card open at the bar and when it was time to close out they had given my card to somebody else, who then went and used it at another bar! So much for the "see ID" on the back!?
