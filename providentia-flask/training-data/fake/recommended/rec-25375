My husband took me to this place as a little surprise. Delicious delicious delicious. The ambience was very nice. Service was great. I really feel like the crepe that I made should be on the menu! I got mushrooms with mushroom sauce, roasted leeks, goat cheese, with lemon butter on top. I literally savored every bite. On the pricier end but if you're going for a nice night out its so worth it!
