Came here on a Sunday evening this summer, and it was a wonderful dining experience. We sat outside on the terrace, which was perfect for a warm, breezy summer evening. I would take off half a star from my 5 star review for two reasons: while it was lovely sitting outside, the view of the East River is not spectacular and the proximity of the highway is not ideal. However, I didn't really mind the unusual location as some other reviewers did. In fact, it was quite nice dining in a rarely visited neighborhood in Manhattan--it was a nice change from the usual downtown. The other reason for my 4.5 star review is that the Ceviche appetizer (cod, watermelon, cilantro) was a bit too salty. The flavors were nice but overpowered by the salty vinaigrette. The pros: our entrees were delicious. We had the Grilled Cobia and the Steak. I was hesitant to try a fish that I had never heard of, but it was an explosion of well-balanced flavors. Every bite offered a new taste sensation; the pine nuts and caramelized onions really took this dish to another level. The steak, although not plated as beautifully as the cobia, was great and the small piece of brisket on the side was even better. We also ordered a side of the market greens (kale), which were surprisingly flavorful. The service was friendly and attentive, the weather was gorgeous, and the restaurant is beautiful. Definitely recommended for a nice summer evening dinner.
