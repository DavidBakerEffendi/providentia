Found day by day on yelp but it was packed so the SO and I walked down to Slate. We hesitated initially because the reviews for Day by Day were so great. Go to Slate!! Day by Day was hot and loud inside but Slate is relaxed, great atmosphere, and cool breeze thru the open door and outside seating. The staff is super friendly and personable. They didn't rush us to order. The bloody Mary's are to die for!! House made mix that's just the right amount of hot and spice. We stayed longer to have another round - they kick butt so be careful :-) So happy we came here instead of being uncomfortable, hot, and rushed at Day by Day.
