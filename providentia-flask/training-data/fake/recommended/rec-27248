Hidden gem alert! I love low-key, great food and music. This place is so good and plays BEATS around the clock! Think Beastie Boys pandora! GOOD STUFF - I'm a sucker for an amazing Caesar salad. I try them everywhere and this place has a yummy kale one w a fried egg on top. - The borata is amazing. I are it all by myself. - The sandwiches look so good I immediately sent a bat alert out to all of my friends to get in on this place if ever in the lookout for fun, chill and under the radar. - If you're a meat-lover then this place should be on your list, because I hear the meat is very fresh. Â  I can't wait until this place expands, I hope they get a TV in time for World Cup.
