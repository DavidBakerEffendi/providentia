Smallish place but did not have to wait long for a table on a Saturday night.  The sangria is great, so it'll ease any pain of having to wait at the bar. Loved the Squid ink w/ Rice, Liver Paté, Lamb Skewers, and Garlic Shrimp.  Awesome Gazpacho- completely changed the way I feel about it, more of a fresh "liquid salad" than a tomatoey soup.  It's prepared by the cup on order. The chorizo was pretty good, but didn't have the impact of the other dishes.  Would have probably appreciated it more had it come earlier in the evening as opposed to being the last plate (when we were approaching fullness). Great service too.
