my nephew got the southwestern steak while i got the bbq ribs, both wrapped in wheat. they came out hot, fresh, and oh so filling. each crepe cost only $4.50! will def return. and in fact, we did return -- for dessert 3 hours later after touring temple's campus! for $4, we shared a generous crepe packed with blueberries and raspberries, lined with raspberry sauce and nutella. my nephew could not finish his half of the crepe; i was pretty full myself, but the crepe was so good i managed to finish it off.
