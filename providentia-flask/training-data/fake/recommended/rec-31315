This place was amazing. I organized a dinner party for my two friends because their birthdays are close and I found Obao from yelp. It was an amazing time from the minute we stepped in. Atmosphere is great and the services was too.. Very friendly and not too pushy. The food was excellent and the drinks were too. My friends enjoyed it and 15 of our good friends did too. We can't wait too go bck.
