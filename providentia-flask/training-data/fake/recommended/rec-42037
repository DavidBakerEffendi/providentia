They definitely weren't friendly but the pad thai was good. Not sure if the food was good enough for me to return when the service is so poor. I don't remember anyone speaking to me or asking if I was ok. Also, love the outside seating area. But then one of the workers came outside to put pillows into their storage area which was right next to my table. I think I must have been invisible because I had to move out his way numerous times so he would stop touching me and interrupting my meal. Very weird experience if I must say.
