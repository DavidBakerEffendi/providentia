I wondered in here hoping to see some good options without meat. I got the 'once bitten' which has goat cheese, mushrooms, beets and sweet potato chips and it was excellent. Large warm freshly made wraps. My SO got their take on a falafel wrap and it was also very good and large for the price. The brothers grimm is one of the best with some really good flavor. The owner is an awesome lady too. Update: I've gone here about once a week for a year or so. Definitely a solid quick dinner spot or for late night food when bar hopping.
