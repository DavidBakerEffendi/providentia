Where has this place been all my life? Ever since my coworkers and I went for lunch, I have literally had dreams about going back. This is not your everyday grilled cheese! Even though the amazing greasyness leaves your fingers nice and slippy after holding the sandwich, there's a sophistication to this grilled cheese. With choices like the "truffle melt" "aged cheddar" and "buffalo blue" (and more!!) you can't go wrong!
