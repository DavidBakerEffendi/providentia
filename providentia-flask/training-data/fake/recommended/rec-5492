Worst customer service.  This was a place we were very excited to try for the first time based on yelp reviews.  We made a reservation for a large group of 12 people for a Friday night and were told there would be no problem accommodating our group.  Then 3 hours before reservation we get a phone call informing us that our party would likely not be sitting together, but we would still be required to do the limited pre fixe menu.  Are you kidding me?? Why were we not told this in advance and why were we given only 3 hours notice??? Why would we go to a restaurant with a group of people to sit separately??  Really disappointing because this was a night my fiancee planned for my birthday that was subsequently ruined....
