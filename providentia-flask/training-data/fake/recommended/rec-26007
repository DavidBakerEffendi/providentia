- Good For Becoming a Meat Eater & Lunch- This burger is different from others and a perfection. One of the best berger in NYC!!! Many berger shops PUSHING and grill pates, so all of the meat juice and UMAMI flow out and the pates are dried out. However, about this berger, there is so much juiciness and UMAMI. You will be surly satisfied. Your hand will be covered with juice of meat. It is hard to bite it because of its high and so much stuffs in it such as cheese bacon, tomato and letters. This will be a fun time to eat a berger here. There aren't so much menus, mainly here is a sport bar. Yet, most people come over here in order to have the special berger. The line down the street is worth standing in. It moves quickly enough!!! I will recommend a basic cheese berger with fries, $7.75. The best match with beer. The berger is appropriate volume with a reasonable price. You will be excited when you get in the shop due to the good grill smell.
