I really was pleased with their beer selection as I sat at the bar. I''ve gone a few times and always been satisfied with the food and service. The bartenders really know their products and can always offer some great suggestions. So far, my favorite thing on their menu is the Sausage variety plate with the mashed potatoes. It features duck, wild boar and venison sausage which are all unbelievably delicious. I have always sat at the bar and usually during happy hour.
