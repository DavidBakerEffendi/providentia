I've never written a review here but my experience here provoked me to write one. Â Let me start with the service. I made a reservation thru open table for 3 persons at 8:15pm. We got to the restaurant at 8:10pm and the receptionist told us that our table is 'not quite ready' yet. So we sat in the waiting area while seeing 3 vacant tables. We waited for 20 minutes and repeatedly asked the receptionist if she can give us a table already. She finally gave us a table. We ordered Sisig, Crispy Pata, Mussels, Halo-halo and Vietnamese coffee. I was born and raised in the Philippines so I know how Filipino food should taste like. It is understandable that the food was going to be fusionized and altered in order to cater to customers that have never tried authentic Filipino/Thai food. The Sisig is the better one among everything else. But it was missing a lot of ingredients and was full of fats instead of pig organs. The Crispy Pata, that did not taste like Crispy Pata, came when we were almost done with the meal. The Mussels were okay because it had coconut spiced sauce. Then, the Halo-halo came. Since people here in yelp said that it was really good, we ordered it to make ourselves feel better about the bad entrees. However, the Halo-halo was like cereal(rice crispies) in milk topped with shaved ice, 10 pieces of coconut strips and old and hard cubes of banana, topped with ube ice cream. Halo-halo means "mix-mix". I guess they were mixing crappy disgusting ingredients. And we heard that several suggestions were already addressed by customers in order to improve the quality and the taste of the food. This place is fooling a lot of white people. I'll be surprised if it lasts another year (unless changes are gonna be made).
