We were very happy to find this place relatively close to our home.  We'd been having to go to New Brunswick, or even to NYC, in order to satiate our craving for Peruvian food. Food was good, especially the papa a la huancaina.  The menu included an ample variety of dishes.  I tried the sudado and was very good.  My husband had the lomo saltado and it was good too.  Too bad the didn't have chicha morada, although a cold Inca Cola is never a bad choice. The only real complaint we had is that we tried to return about a month ago, and even though it was only about 6:45 p.m., they were already closing!  I guess we'll have to try again sometime during the weekend...
