Before I comment on their terrible service, let me acknowledge that the food itself was pretty good. They have a good chef. Now the service, in chronological order: 1. They tried to fool us and pretended that there were no table available because we didn't make a reservation, so they let us sit at the bar. We agreed but found the chair too cold (the chair was made of metal). Then we told them we would rather wait for a table, and they immediately gave us a table. 2. They didn't tell us the still water was $6. We thought it was just free water until we got the check. 3. We waited for ~20min for the...appetizer! Yes, it was that slow. We didn't order anything special, just Chicken Satay. 4. We waited for another ~15min (so ~35min in total) Â for our entree. We didn't order anything special, just beef pho. That was the slowest pho I ever had. During the wait, I complained twice to the servers, and both of them lied. One said the dish was right there coming to us. The other said he would go check, but he never did (we watched him running around). No apologies at all. The food tastes delicious, but we were very unhappy walking out of there, and will never walk in again.
