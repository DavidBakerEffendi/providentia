Rudy's is the place I pick more often than anywhere else, for whatever reason. Their Cobb Salad is really really good. Try it! It's bacony-avocadoy-blue cheesy deliciousness can't actually be healthy but man, oh day, it is super tasty. Plus, the place looks great and is spacious and friendly. Good spot.
