The most important factor in me reviewing a Robbinsville restaurant favorably, is that the establishment must feel like it's NOT in Robbinsville. Ploy Siam did just this. Food was excellent although the spiciness was a bit inconsistent throughout dishes. But overall, the food tasted excellent. I will elaborate more when I've had it more than once, but needed to share my 2 cents in the meantime. This is the best restaurant in the vicinity and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. I can't believe I've lived here for years and settled for less!
