I went here last night for the first time... It was packed in the "happy hour" area (between 5-7 and 9-11), we ended up sitting at the sushi bar since they extended "happy hour" to this area too. I got the Sak√© Bomber and my friend got the margarita, both were really great and half off. Sushi was decent and the flat bread was good too. Our waitress (dee?) was pretty fun and easy to talk to... She seemed pretty busy but never rushed us and made sure we had everything we needed... Unfortunately, the part of the sushi bar we sat was near the kitchen and we could hear 1 waiter complaining about his job and customers as he walked by us.... The first time he said "I hate happy hour." Which wasn't great to hear since we were there for happy hour, lol... Then another time he passed us he made his own song about how his job sucks and was happily singing it... I mean it was busy and a lot of the waiters and waitresses looked a bit overwhelm but they were professional enough not to complain in front of customers and kept it moving. But this guy, what can you say about it other than stay your ass home... He is just taking up a spot that someone else, who needs it more than him, would be more than willing to take. Yeah, but other than that guy (no name tags) i'd go back again and thats why this place got 4 instead of 5 stars.
