Yes, yes, and yes all the way! You can't get better Pho anywhere else in philly as good as Pho Ha and I've tried. Every time I've been here the broth is consistant, the meat is fresh and tender and seems to be delivered to your table the minute you place your order. There are not enough words to describe the how their pho makes me feel on the inside. I want to eat it for every meal morning, noon and night.
