My second revisit at Doc Magrogan's was absolutely fantastic. And it will NOT be my last. My party and I did NOT get a window seat as I requested when RSVP, but the manager Carlos kindly offered us free dessert. And our waitress gave us helpful suggestions on oysters as it was my first time experiencing this wonderful creature of the sea. We enjoyed her service but there is 1 suggestion for her appearance: FINGERNAILS SHOULD BE CLEAN AND NICELY POLISHED with a clear/nude coat of nail polish. Because everyone can notice cracked and black polish even when the lights are dimmed.
