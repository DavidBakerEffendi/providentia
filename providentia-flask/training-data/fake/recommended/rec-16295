Went and checked this place out last night and I definitely approve. I liked it right away just because of the ambiance but, luckily, the food's good too! We started with the calamari and then had the spaghetti with shrimp and zucchini and the olive and sun dried tomato raviolis. All three were delicious. The portions aren't huge so definitely try out at least two of the appetizers or salads in addition to your meal.
