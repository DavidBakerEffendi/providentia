A must try for Italian in NY. This is one of the best restaurants that I have tried on the upper east side. The ricotta and honey appetizer is delicious and so is the gniocci with truffles. They both will melt in your mouth. It is a great place to stop and have a meal with friends on a week night or a weekend. It has an adorable atmosphere and is a cozy way to have a great meal.
