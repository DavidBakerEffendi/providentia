Dined with a few folks and had a great overall experience. Personally, I love the west village and this place didn't disappoint! It was pretty busy for a Wednesday night. The ambiance was great and there were four of us so we didn't have to make reservations; we only waited about 15 minutes or so. Let me begin with the drinks- I started with the pomegranate martini and was not really a fan. Another ordered the "jagger" and raved about it. We ended up getting the raspberry mojito which was delicious. We all ordered different dishes and tried every one- the lamb dish was amazing, the yellow fin tuna (my dish) was great and the sauce was light and tasty. The sea bass was another great dish and the fennel potato puree was so so good. Oh, and the chicken was just okay. We ended with the warm flourless chocolate cake with malted milk ice cream- let's just say there were no leftovers, not even a crumb left! The waitress was very friendly and attentive throughout the entire night and the bartender was super nice. I'll definitely come back! I hear the brunch is pretty awesome so I'm looking forward to coming back soon.
