Even though this place has some history (for a restaurant in NYC), it's still quite pathetic as a restaurant, since it should be about food. The menu choices are so limited that I was compelled to just leave. I ended up ordering chicken with fries, which was nothing special (both of them), and offensively overpriced ($27 for Â a small piece of chicken?!) As a side note, I found some hair in fries (tasty, huh?)
