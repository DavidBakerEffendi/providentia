My friends and I made reservations yesterday for my birthday, and I'm glad we did.  The place is super small  but it is the perfect environment for an intimate dinner with friends or a loved one. The sangria was delicious! First pitcher had a bit too much ice in it and when I asked for another, I joked about not putting in as much ice... believe it or not she listened.   The food was delicious, all my friends said the meal exceeded their expectations which weren't very high since they had never had Brazilian food.  Even so  the picky eaters cleaned their plates. Portions were small enough to start out with an appetizer or finish up with  dessert. (Tiramisu was different from some I've had but still super delicious, so was the Passion Fruit mousse-- sweet with some tartness) Overall it was a great experience, and a super nice place. It's worth the trip.
