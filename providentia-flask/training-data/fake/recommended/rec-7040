It's was ok. I felt that it was a bit pricey considering that it was fast food. As far as the dishes themselves, I've had way better fast indian food in NYC-- and as snobbish as that sounds, it's only meant to convey that once you've had good ethnic food it's hard to lower the bar for your palette. Nice layout, however, and very family friendly.
