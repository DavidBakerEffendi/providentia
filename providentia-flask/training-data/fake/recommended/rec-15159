My husband and I visited Philadelphia the last week of July and visited Osteria on recommendations from Frommer's Guide and a business Client from the area.  It was a Sunday evening and, surprisingly, the place wasn't very busy probably because of the storm that was brewing outside.  But.....oh my gosh....from the service to the dessert, everything here was absolutely amazing.   The restaurant is warm and cozy with a very rustic feel and beautiful decor throughout.  Though the tables were close together, you didn't get the feeling that you were being eavesdropped on by diners sitting next to you.  Kathleen was our waitress and she was friendly, helpful and very knowledgeable.   For the appetizer, we shared Grilled Clams with Charred Squid, Lemons and Chilis.  The Clams melted in your mouth and the Squid was perfectly cooked.  Both the Clams and Squid absorbed the flavors of the lemon and chilis perfectly.  We also shared an off-the-menu most amazing Arugula Salad with Heirloom tomatoes with an amazing vinaigrette dressing that was neither too acidic nor too oily.  Very light and flavorful. My husband had the Special...a Roasted Duck with Duck Skin Chicharones.  The skin on the duck was crispy as were the Chicharones and the duck was tender and succulent.  If he could have, he would have licked his plate clean.  I had the Polenta Gnocchetti with Chanterelle Mushrooms, Brown Butter and Parmigiano.  Kathleen told us that the pastas were all made in-house and it was very evident from the first bite.  The Gnochetti's practically melted in your mouth.  The Chantrelle Mushrooms added just enough earthiness to compliment the Brown Butter.   For dessert, we shared a platter of 3 gelattos--Pistachio, Lemon Verbena and Peach.  All were made fresh that day as well and were awesome.   When we plan our next trip to Philadelphia, we will definitely go back.
