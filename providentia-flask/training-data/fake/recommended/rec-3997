Tom's is awesome. They bring out food while you wait in line - french fries, sausage, cookies, fudge, strawberries and cream... i could go on and on. Anyway, the food is really good diner food, served very quickly. Everyone who works there is friendly. They have flavored butter for pancakes - peach, cinnamon apple, something with walnuts, maybe? The prices are low too, so its very recession friendly!
