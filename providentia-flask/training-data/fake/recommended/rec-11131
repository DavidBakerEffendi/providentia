Enjoyed with my 2 daughters a taste of food I haven't had since visiting Budapest to see relatives many years ago.This is unpretentious Hungarian soul food at its best. If you are looking for the real deal you have found it.in a little strip plaza in Ewing N.J. I even had a chance to practice my Hungarian with the very accomandating owners who started out at a flea market serving plates of hearty Hungarian fare such as stuffed cabbage, chicken paprikash,and my favorite pork cubes and kraut stew (Skekely Kaposzta) A Â rich creamy prefection of lean cubes of pork simmered with mild sauerkraut paprika , seasonings and smokey bacon.. Each platter came with a dollop of sour cream which I incorporated in my pork and kraut stew. You must order nokodli aka spatzel with your dishes to eat it like a real Magyar.It comes with decent bread and butter though I do wish it was rye bread.We had red cabbage salad and cucumber salad a real bargain $3.25 for a bowl enough for all to share. Ask the owner to make your dish extra hot because they eat their food more close to room temp. then an American would be used to.We finished with a single order of palacsinta ,crepe with apricot jam filling and covered with powdered sugar.I also found out all the colorful embroidered clothes and doilies were made by the owner. Lunch is only 6.99 for the same food in half portions. A great way to try out several dishes.They are closed on Monday.It's also a BYOB.So yummy and a good deal
