The yellowfin was okay, not very delicious.  Drinks were good, I don't know if I'd be back there again if it wasn't for a company function. We were there for a work thing, and the passed appetizers were pretty good.  The phyllo brie with raspberry compote was really good...but anything beef or meat related was really dry. The yellowfin entree I ordered was supposed to have a wasabi glaze.  Maybe they ran out of wasabi, because it was coated purely in rice vinegar...which has a really distinct taste.   Meh.....
