Absolutely beautiful place with great specialty wines and a wonderful menu. The staff couldn't be more attentive. I had the specialty white wine (can't remember the name but the taste was out of this world). We shared the wild mushroom, arugula and parmageano bruschetta and an artichoke, arugula and lemon dressing salad. Delicious! I then had the grilled shrimp and my husband had some whole wheat pasta infused with basil - both wonderful. Dessert was this white cake with Nutella and ice cream... I am getting hungry again! Only one star off for the noise level. Will return many times I hope!
