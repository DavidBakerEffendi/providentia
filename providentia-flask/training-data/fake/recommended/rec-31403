vegetarian choices ($2.50 each): seaweed salad avocado or sweet potato maki 6pcs inarizushi 4pcs (does not come with soy sauce/wasabi) though the concept of raw fish from a cart is sketchy, i have not seen sashimi, just california rolls, spicy tuna rolls, maybe another kind they also have a grill on the other side which makes chicken or beef skewers, and they serve udon soups (the "vegetable" is not vegetarian) and katsu - not sure of the prices but something like $5-5.50 sushi containers are aluminum w/ clear plastic lids, and they give out wooden chopsticks
