The food was incredible and (considering the price) in good portions.  I wasn't expecting much out of the coffee, but it was decent.  The staff, opposed to much of what I'd heard, was very nice and quick to help. The only reason I have not given this restaurant 5 stars is that it was quite noisy.  Nothing worse than a typical busy diner, but still, a constant din of noise.
