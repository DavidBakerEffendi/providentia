Debated giving 3 stars... I'm in love with the drinks [strong margaritas!] and the menu [love the variety and the mix and match style]. I was less in love with the flavor but its still good and is a fun place to visit. I'll definitely be back. * Good selections for vegetarians - tasty/healthy baked wheat mushroom empanada and cheese arepa * bf the meat eater had the chorizo [loved], spicy chicken [liked - verrrry spicy], and the tuna jalapeno [disliked]. * Shared tostones [tasty but def required the dipping sauce] very busy on a friday night and the waitress was definitely rushed, less pleasant but still satisfactory service.
