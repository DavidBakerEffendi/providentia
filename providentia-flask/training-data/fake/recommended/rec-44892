Fantastic service. Long waits for a table so we left our names and came about an hour later like we were told. When we got back the restaurant assumed we didn't want a table and was just about to give it away. When we told them we walked around for an hour they gave us the next available table. While we waited the owner gave us wine on the house. Service was great and so was the dinner. We were too full for desert but the owner insisted on giving us something on the house again because we waited so long! I was impressed by the extent to which they took care of their customers. It's not that often that restaurants are that attentive.
