I don't live far from there and it is NOT good. the kichen is in your face with old boiling pots of whatever they are cooking. Lots of what looks like armed Spanish gangstas hanging around looking out the windows. service was slow. Bad atmosphere. I have tried going in there several times because of all of these good reviews and it never changes: large old boiling pots of meat, a sweaty cook over frying meat no organization and no white people at all. Not a place for a singe white man to go to. also the food was bad. I had the steak taco and it sucked. It was dry and not remarkable at all. I flew to cinderellas' across the street which is not as bad as this grungy dirty joint. they must pay people for these good reviews. see it for yourself and observe the giant cock fight painting they chose to decorate their dingy place with.
