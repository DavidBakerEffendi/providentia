This place is deserving of an update.  Went last night for the happy hour, and I was not disappointed.  Though I didn't get too crazy on the beers - I went for the cheap Reading Premium - I had an AMAZING eggplant sandwich.  Perfectly breaded and fried, with mozzarella, marinara, and between two thick slices of ciabatta bread.  Don't forget a heaping serving of fries - for all of 8 bucks.  Amazing. I also tried a bite of Carrie E's lasagna - who knew it could be amazing here?  Oh, it most definitely was. I'll echo Emily P's sentiments that the servers/bartenders.  They recently expanded the downstairs, which is great - the new back room has a huge window overlooking East Girard.  Perfect views of the epic thunderstorms that hit Philly last night. Shows are amazing upstairs - the venue is aesthetically and acoustically out of this world.  Even sub-par opening acts sound like critically acclaimed bands in the space. You can't go wrong here.  All the more reason to hang out in Fishtown more.
