Had dinner here on a Wednesday night, and I'm so glad I made a reservation because the place was packed when we got there! The service was impeccable. I'm not much of a wine drinker, so I had to ask for the server's recommendation based on my taste. He had me try 4 different wines, before I decided on which one I liked the most. The wine glasses and the amount of wine served are bigger than most of the places I've been to. For starters, we got the cheese board. The menu had a lot of different cheeses to choose from. The board came with 3 big enough portions of cheese along with walnuts, dry figs/apricots, grapes and a small side of honey/jelly and bread. My favorite was the Humble pie. Totally worth the $18! Tip : the cheese board is big enough for about 3-4 people to share, if everyone is planning on getting an entree. My boyfriend got the duck leg confit for main course and absolutely loved it!
