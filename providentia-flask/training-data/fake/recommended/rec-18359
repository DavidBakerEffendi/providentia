Qamara greeted us the second we walked in the door and she was also our waitress. She was very friendly and very attentive. My fianc√© and I ordered the French toast of the day (apple filling..then rolled in cornflakes), the breakfast nachos, and the fresh fruit. The nachos were sooo good!! They made me want to come back for dinner! The refried beans on them were yummy! The French toast was also delicious! The fresh fruit was a little different than I was expecting....there was some kind of seasoning on it. I didn't love it. We then took a churro to go....yummmm! Great service and great food! I definitely will return and try out dinner!
