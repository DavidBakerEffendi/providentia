Up Thai is a nice addition to a neighborhood that lacks good asian food. The menu is mostly classic Thai dishes, my favorite of which is the Pad See Ew. Although, everything I've had has been solid. The restaurant looks very nice on the inside and the service is very attentive, almost to the point of being overbearing, but not quite. I once showed up unannounced with a group of 10, and they helped us get seating and were very nice about it. This restaurant doesn't try to be inventive or innovative. They serve the classics and they do them well. And as long as the prices stay as reasonable as they are right now, it will be worth many more visits.
