This place is actually really good, there really isn't any reason to not like it.   Highlights: - Oyster Bay fries - ORDER THEM! Incredible! - GREAT place for weekday lunch in a neighborhood sorely lacking in options - Cool ambinace - Great wine selection   - GREAT for big parties Not Super Awesome Points: - Can get very crowded in the evenings, make a reservation!! - Busboy service is spot on, water refills galore; waiter service... not super attentive but just ask that very eager busboy, he'll get you what you need!
