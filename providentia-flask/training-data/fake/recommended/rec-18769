I've been to Riposo 72 multiple times and it's always been great. The vibe is really relaxed and romantic, and it's a perfect spot for a date or just catching up with a friend. They have a really awesome happy hour that's from 4-7 where they have all the bottles of wine, certain wines by the glass, and all of their flatbreads for 20% off. Every time I've gone I always gotten a flatbread (I've tried 4 different types and they were all delicious), a bottle of wine, and a cheese plate to share with another person and it's always the perfect amount of food and drinks and yumminess. Do prepare yourself to at least drop $50 for your meal, but I promise you it will absolutely be worth it. Treat yo self! Side note: They have gender neutral bathrooms!
