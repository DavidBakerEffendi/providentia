Hesitant to give this place a 5* review only because I don't want to have more "non locals" go here.  It's small so they already get filled up on weekends.  You can call and reserve a table so if you have more than 2 probably worth doing.  The food here is awesome, and the prices are great value for NYC.  For people who have complained bout portion size, anyone have a app and pasta, or pasta and secondi, and the free bread with a dessert should be more than fine, and at their prices its still great value.  I have eaten or taken out here 50+ times. CASH ONLY.
