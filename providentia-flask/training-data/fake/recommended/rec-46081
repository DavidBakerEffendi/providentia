I think I am in love with Roast Pork.... I finally got a chance to try the much-talked-about Roast Pork Sandwiches... I went the Monday after the 4th of July and found out that DiNics had used up all their meat for that day as well as tuesday's ration..(they werent going to be open on tuesday as a result) I finally got there on a friday.. oh heaven~!! I am generally not a huge fan of pork because of that strong flavor that needs lots of spices to overpower it... but this.. this was perfect.  They have it down to a science I had 2 different kinds of roast pork sandwiches - you an choose from sweet/hot peppers, sharp provolone, broccoli rabe/spinach Spicy : Hot peppers with Sharp provolone and spinach The Mild: sweet peppers and sharp provolon and broccoli rabe. I have to say, that I was a huge fan of the meat.  perfectly roasted. The natural juices is incredibly balanced.  The amount of fat to full on flavor is perfect.  The meat is sliced thin and against the grain... I am telling you, this is my new favorite iconic philly sandwich. In the sandwiches, the sharp provolone is key in the spicy version. The pungent creaminess of the cheese works perfectly with the hot peppers.  I was glad to go with the spinach on the spicy sandwich because the broccoli rabe in the milder version was far too watery and made the bread fall apart  -  difficult to eat.. but worth it. if you are planning on trying both spicy and mild... try the mild first becuase the spicy will overpower the flavor of the milder one. If you havent tried this.. go... GO SKIP the cheesesteaks... (you can always get that later because Reading Terminal Market is only open until 5pm.) GO stand in the long line.. it is so worth your time.
