Went there recently for the first time and got the famous burger. It completely delivered and was indeed delicious! Every positive review here says the same so I won't dwell on it, but let me tell you; I can't wait to go try some of the other items on the menu which sounded great. * Also - they have an impressive selection of booze behind the bar. Not enormous or comprehensive by any means, but lots of really good well-chosen stuff.
