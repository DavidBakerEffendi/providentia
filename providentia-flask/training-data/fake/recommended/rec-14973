Yelp pointed me in the direction of Nan Zhou.  I have a particular love for soups, especially of those Asian-style.  How could I not want to try this after seeing NZ pop up on my feed on an almost daily basis?  Right.  Sooo.. to NZ I went. I got the Roast Pork w/ Shaved Noodles.  While it was good, I didn't really see a stand out dish.  The broth was minimally flavorful, but the duck didn't have much meat, and the meat that was on the bones was extremely hard to remove barring a third degree soup burn.  My counterpart got the seafood noodle, and she liked it-but felt it was run of the mill too. We also split an order of chicken dumplings.  Meh. Three cheers to NZ lovers.  I am stll ISO the perfect noodle soup..
