I really enjoyed this place. I went here for an anniversary and it is like stepping into an old farmhouse. They had the fire going which was very cozy. The bread and choice of spreads were excellent. We shared the beet salad which was very good and I had the goat dish which was cooked perfectly. To finish everything off they gave us truffles which were delicious.
