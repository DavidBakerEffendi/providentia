This restaurant makes my top three favorites of all time. After taking my annual pilgrimage here recently, I felt compelled to write this review. When I am in NYC, I seek this place out. Let me begin by saying that the food is authentic. Having traveled through Brazil, dare I say, the cuisine here is even better. Â If you are expecting waiters to come out with skewers of meat, this isn't the place for you. This is a quaint restaurant with classy ambiance. The menu is something you may find in a restaurant in Fortaleza, Brazil. Everything I have had here has been great. On my last visit, I had dinner on my own, from appetizer to dessert, excellent! It was so good I returned the next day for lunch with a co-worker before flying out. Lunch prices are unbelievably low for the quality and taste of the food you get in return. For dates or a nice dinner with co-workers, dinner is best. When friends and co-workers are visiting NYC this is the restaurant I recommend. If you haven't been there, you are missing out.
