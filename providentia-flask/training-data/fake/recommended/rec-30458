We live a few blocks away from here and have enjoyed watching it progress towards completion.  On the way home from the gym on Friday night, we notifed that the restaurant was (finally!) open, and decided to check it out.  We sat at the counter and ordered a number of sausages, the cheese spread, and the pretzel, as well as draft beers to wash it all down (Schneider Edelveiss and Sixpoint Harbinger).  I can't remember the names of each of the sausages that we tried, but they were all delicious, especially the ones served hot-dog style on toasted chewy rolls.  My favorite sausage was spicy and filled with cheese which spurted out as you bit into it (naughty!).  My husband got the ginger schnapps as well, which was delicious and way too strong for me!  This is a great place with friendly staff and a fun playlist.
