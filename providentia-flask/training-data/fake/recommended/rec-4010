I've eaten here twice, once for breakfast and once for lunch. Both meals were excellent, filling, and reasonably priced. I'm going to give you one piece of advice: order the crackbread. It's blue cornmeal bread made with butter and honey. It's even more delicious than it sounds. Just order a side of it with your meal and thank me later.
