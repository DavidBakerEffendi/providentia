This is really more of a 2 1/2 star review, but I don't feel like I've truly tried an Italian restaurant till I've eaten their pasta. The food was alright. The calamari was fine. The meatballs tasted like they were made out of good quality meats but were very under seasoned and bland, even covered in sauce. The prices are silly for the quality and portions ($14 for the calamri and $11 for three meatballs) but that's just Tribeca. My table split the Bufala and the Funghi pizzas. Both were OK, but I honestly prefer old school, classic NY pizza over the kind they serve so I don't really feel right in criticizing it too much- the mushrooms were fresh and delicious though I wish the crust had been crispier. The tiramisu was actually my favorite part of the meal. Service was excellent, friendly, attentive and patient. What I really loved is that they have a full bar and were playing excellent music. I heard Journey and two Bowie songs among other classics. But this place just isn't for me, I doubt I'll be back.
