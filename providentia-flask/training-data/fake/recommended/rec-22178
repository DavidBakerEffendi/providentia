Our experience at Zaroka never fails to be a great one. My wife almost always orders the Chicken Korma, as it is her favorite. She enjoys the sweet flavor mixing with some savory spices. I tend to vary what I get, but my favorite entree is the Palak Paneer. The flavor is fantastic and the texture creamy. I look forward to my leftovers! And yes, we have leftovers because we order a variety of items, including naan and appetizers. Our favorite appetizer is the Vegetarian Platter, which includes pakoras, alooktikki, bataka and samosa. The crunch and savory flavors are an excellent beginning to a fantastic meal. The naan is always well done and a great accompaniment to the meal. We usually get the plain, but the garlic is delicious as well. As for dessert, which we usually only get when we are there for lunch buffet, my wife loves the creamy rice pudding. It is a little thinner than the American counterpart, but full of Indian spices cardamom. I love the Zaroka delight, which is a homemade yogurt with nuts, dried fruit and spices. When we bring our toddler, the staff are very attentive and tolerant of her behavior (not that it is so bad anyway :) and even sometimes doting on her. The staff in general are very polite and nice. Never a problem with any request. Parking is on the street, but we do not have a problem getting parking on the same block. Sometimes we need to walk a block to the restaurant, but the neighborhood is good, right next to Yale. The menu is available at Zaroka.com but they sometimes have specials. They are often available on Groupon and Living Social.
