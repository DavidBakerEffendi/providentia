I used to live 2 blocks away from where Kickshaw is now, and so wish I was still there if only to be closer to it.  This is the kind of coffeehouse that I'd gladly skip Starbucks for any day.  The non-descript storefront hides a charming and spacious place to spend an hour or two.  Service was friendly and non-intrusive.  The iced coffee was strong and tasty.  I've so far only tried the grilled gruyere on rye with caramelized onions and a side of cabbage-caraway slaw, and it's pretty damn delicious.  Food/drink is slightly pricey for Queens, but you're paying for good quality stuff. They now have late hours, serve beer and offer free WiFi...what more could you want?  It's about the closest you'll come to a hipster-y Brooklyn-esque coffeeshop in Astoria.  Love you Kickshaw!
