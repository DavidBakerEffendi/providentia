this bar is awesome! Â we drove a half hour just to come here. the place is self is amazing with TVs everywhere. the staff is super friendly, the food is excellent, the service is great and the bathrooms are kept super clean. the owner makes the place even cooler! he runs around the entire game cheering the game and everyone on, playing the dolphin song! I'm not even a dolphins fan, and i had an amazing time. we would gladly come here every Sunday if we could! definitely a place to check out.
