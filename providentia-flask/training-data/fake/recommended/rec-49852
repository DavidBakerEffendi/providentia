I love the atmosphere here, it's a nice cozy spot and the food is pretty good with two exceptions. 1- she uses yams to clarify her pho broth. Pho is supposed to taste like star anise, cinnamon etc., not yams. Also, the beef she uses is too fatty. The fatty beef is often kinda nasty. 2- don't get the gua bao or fried pork bellies. These are also greasy and excessively fatty. It is so awful, it is possible that her chef simply does not know how to cook it properly. If it isn't crispy, it's not right. Please fix these issues!!
