I am a super fan of Umi! I will agree that compared to certain upscale sushi restaurants the sushi isn't mind blowing but it is still delicious and they offer an array of different specials. I think people need to keep in mind that you are paying anywhere from $1.25-$5.00 a roll, compared to, say $13 a roll at a specialty restaurant. The sushi chefs are always visible preparing rolls in the middle of the restaurant while the belt rotates around them. Plates are marked with numbers and if a plate doesn't sell within 15 minutes it is automatically replaced with a new one. Everything is fresh. Their happy hour runs from 3:30-5:30 with certain plates half off and other specials making an appearance for that time-frame. You can stack up quite a few plates for a great meal and small bill, which I love! The wait staff operate based on push-lights with different colors requesting different things (service, beverage, check). I personally enjoy this as you do not have a waiter or waitress hovering over you and making you feel like you need to leave, everything is on your own terms. I LOVE the conveyor belt set up, atmosphere, and just about everything at Umi. The owner is often present and warmly welcomes people in, along with ensuring that they are happy and well taken care of. As both a West Hartford native and current resident I was thrilled to see Umi go into Blue Back Square and I will most certainly continue to frequent this restaurant!
