I must say...great!!! The buttermilk fried chicken was so delicious, juicy, and the sea salt exploded the chicken with flavor. Let's not forget our waitress Debbra, she knew get stuff and made us feel at home. I think this is the best way to explain the atmosphere at butter milk channel...a southern warmth in a chilly city. Thanks buttermilk channel for a great tasting environment. See you soon+more.
