This place gets a three stars from the previous times I have went.  The first and second time that food was wonderful, however the service could be better.  However the 3rd times was a complete disaster!!! The first two visits I order the chicken parm and Caesar salad... everything was great!!! On of the best chicken parms I have ever tasted!.. The servers were inexperienced on customer service and the menu, but the food made up for the service. The third visit was a complete disaster!  I ordered the Caesar salad and there was no Caesar dressing, but a light vinaigrette.  The vinaigrette had olives in the mixture, so the dressing was leaving brown and black etchings in the salad.  I understand that mistakes happen, so I requested a new salad.  The waiter was rude and tried to explain to me that the croutons were causing the marks on the lettuce.  I was like okay, I heard enough!  Just bring me a new salad.  The new salad came back with no croutons and the lettuce l appeared the same.  Well to my surprise, the cook used the same lettuce and threw tons of Cesar dressing on the salad.  The Caesar dressing tasted old and it could have been because of the mixing of dressings.  I was so mad, I left the salad as is and placed it to the side. Needless to say, I did not have to request this dish to be taken off the menu, the waiter was smarter than he lead on...
