OMG. Expensive? Yes, I would say that ~$15 for a burger is expensive.  Was it worth it? YES OMG YES. I got here around 6:10pm on a Friday night and there was a slight wait, but really not too long of a wait.  My bf ordered the truffle burger (OMG LOVED IT SO MUCH IT WAS SO RICH AND JUICY) and I ordered the regular burger, which was also good, but I preferred his truffle burger.  We also ordered the teeny tiny french fries, which they were meh. I don't like teeny tiny fries, you can't pick up any sauce with them! I did enjoy the random spoonfuls of garlic aioli, etc so that was great.  Would I come back? HELL TO THE YES.
