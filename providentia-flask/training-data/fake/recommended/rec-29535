I stopped in impulsively after a not too delicious lunch elsewhere a few hours ago. It's happy hour so I chose two items from a small happy hour menu. Lisa made me a yummy drink called Beetlejuice which has Christian Brothers, prosecco, fresh beet juice and crushed blueberries. I hate beets passionately but they really work for the drink. I also ordered ricotta toast. The ricotta was lemony and a bit over salted. The toast was too crisp for my liking. I think a chewier bread would have paired better with the ricotta. Still, it was good as was the service. I'll be back next week to try the vegan crab cakes.
