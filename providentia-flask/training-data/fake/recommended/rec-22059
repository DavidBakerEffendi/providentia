Solid 4 Best burger I have ever eaten BUT... the sides could be better. We got the truffle fries, which were delicious but I couldn't help noticing that the bechamel truffle sauce was gritty- something that I probably would have done in the kitchen. Also what would be better was the wait service. We went and put our name down for 4, but the 4th person was running late and they wouldn't seat us until we were all there. I changed it to 3 because at that point, I didn't know if he was coming but lo and behold they sat us at a 4 top- what was the point of making us wait? The latecomer could have easily joined us and it did not disrupt service at all as we also got desert. Whatever. I liked our waitress... she was a little snarky, but maybe thats how they are told to act. I didn't mind that either- they could have terrible service and I would still be coming back to eat more Umami Burgers. I got the truffle burger and got a bite of the original Umami Burger- both so easy to eat with that delicious bread that I could have gotten another one if not for eating the fries and the smushed potatoes (on the secret menu). Will be back very very very soon!
