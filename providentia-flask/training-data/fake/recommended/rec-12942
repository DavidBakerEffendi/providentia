Came to chelsea market looking for something delicious eat and we ended up eating here because they were able to accomodate a large group of 8+ without a wait. The decor is very much so "cottage" on the farm style. Woody unfinished tables, dried flowers, rustic feel with dim lighting. If you want to relax and step away from the hustle and bustle of NYC, this is it! Â It's located by the restroom at Chelsea market as a point of reference. The service was good, they were really nice... which was what stood out about this place. Food came out at a good pace and they checked up on us. I would say come here for the ambiance and service, but not necessarily the food. I got a half grilled cheese and their soup of the day. Nothing really stood out flavorwise. I thought both the dishes were relatively bland. The kind of food you would eat if you had like nausea or a stomach ache... I had to add salt. The half sandwich/soup/salad is a good combo if you're not sure of what you want and need a taste. Felt pretty healthy and didn't weigh me down for the rest of the day.
