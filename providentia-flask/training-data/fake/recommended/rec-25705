My mom took me to Becco for lunch before a show. I hadn't researched this dining choice at all. Good choice, mom! Even though the location is very convenient to the theaters, this place isn't just coasting. I was a little worried that they'd just rely on the tourists to come, regardless of quality. But these folks provide a very good meal, for not too much coin, super convenient to the theater. And even though there are certainly tourists in here, it still feels classy. Mom and I didn't go with the popular pasta special, since we wanted something lighter, but what a deal. All you can eat, 3 different pastas, less than $20. Anyway, mom got a nice salad with walnuts, pear, and Gorgonzola. It was generously sized and super cheap, like 8 bucks. I got the Caesar. Classic, crisp, delicious. We shared the escarole soup, which delicious, almost as good as grandma's. It's hard to share soup, but whatever, we're weird.
