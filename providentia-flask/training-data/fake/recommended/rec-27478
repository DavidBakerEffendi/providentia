Jane has been a favorite for a very long time, but I officially fell in love during my last visit. Made a brunch reso for 4 on New Year's Sunday and due to the insane crowds, we waited over 30 minutes for a table WITH a reservation. We didn't even raise a fuss, but for our troubles, the wonderful & gracious hostess (Jessica) sent over an order of french toast on the house as soon as we were seated! (Seriously, no restaurant in NYC does this.) Obvi we were very pleased, as the french toast is outta this world. And as usual, brunch did not disappoint. If, like me, you're looking to satisfy your meat tooth at brunch, the best thing on the menu is the Benedict Johnny -- basically eggs benedict with a light, flavorful chicken sausage on cornbread with tomato hollandaise. To die for.
