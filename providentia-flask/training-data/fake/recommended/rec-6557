The name kind of says it all about this place. The hand-pulled noodles are indeed very tasty. I let my waitress use the thin default kind, but there are wide, flat, chive, and knife cut (dao xiao mian) options too. Two of us ordered the House special, which comes with ox tail, beef, tripe, tendons and a fried egg. Sounds like a steal for $6, right? Unfortunately, the tripe had a horrible hard-to-chew texture, and the ox tail was miniscule, fatty, and tough. The broth was forgettable, and seemed significantly watered down. On the bright side, I suppose, all the disappointing elements enhanced the yumminess of the hand-pulled noodles. Another dinner companion got the Fish ball soup, which she seemed to enjoy. An order of pork and chive steamed dumplings for $3.25 was made with the thin HK style wrappers, which although good, lacked the comfort of greasy potstickers. A thumbs up for the chili sauce and huge jars of cilantro floating around. And they offer the Chinese canned coconut milk drink! That, plus the pleasant-natured small staff give it that extra star.
