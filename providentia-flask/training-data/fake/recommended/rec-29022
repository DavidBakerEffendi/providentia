This is my favorite Restaurant in Philadelphia. Perfect Balance quality-price. Their indian pancakes are just amazing and I've never had anything there that I didn't like. The service is also pretty good, they always try to help you to make your choice. The portions are also the perfect size. It would be the perfect restaurant if it was BYOB!
