My BF and I have been there once a week after discovered this restaurant on spring2009 until now.It's very very lovely french restaurant.The owner are french who just moved to NY to opened the restaurant.The husband cooks the wife works on the floor and they are very very nice! The food is soooo perfect and i tell all of my friends about this and i take them there,all of them love this place.What else you could ask for more?? Good food great service and very very reasonable price just like you take a trip to france with a half price! Oh don't forget to try amaretto cup for dessert.
