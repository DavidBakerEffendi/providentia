I've never considered myself a pancake lover, but this place has made me fall in love with their pancakes.  The wait is horrible here--1.5 hours if you're lucky and come at an "off" brunch time.  But the pancakes are really the best and well worth the usual 2 hour wait and tight seating arrangement.   Lucky for you, you can buy a cheesy jalapeno bacon biscuit while waiting to get seated.  The biscuit will probably entertain you for only 30 seconds, cause you'll be wolfing it down from hunger (and mighty tasty).  My friend ordered the chorizo and eggs--not bad, but nothing really compared to their famous pancakes.  I also had a side of the ham.  Again it was good, but nothing to rave about.  The pancakes, on the other hand, come in a generous portion loaded with bananas and topped with walnuts...and the syrup...O M G.  It's nothing like your runny traditional pancake syrup.  The sauce is extra buttery and thick!  Almost like a spread for your fluffy pancakes.  Plates are big enough to share, so I recommend you convince your friends to share to get a sampling of the sweet and savory!
