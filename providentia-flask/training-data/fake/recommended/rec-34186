5 stars for the food (everything that touched my mouth was delicious and perfect.) 4 stars for value (reasonable prices) 3 stars for service (obvious week 1 staff, slow, inefficient, lacking of knowledge about the menu. Chewing gum. (health-code violation much?) But a pleasant attitude! There's potential here. Right now there's a yelp deal ($40 of food for $20) GO NOW, SPEND $40, HALF OFF. Full disclosure: I couldn't stop and spent $70. Food was so damn good. Oh! That Kenwood Sparkling Wine is outstanding. P.S. This place is relatively new, so let's give them some time to develop teamwork) I will go back in 6 months (summer) and update this review with the improvements in service I know this new team will develop Worth the trip for sure.
