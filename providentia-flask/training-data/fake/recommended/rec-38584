We were just in Philadelphia this past weekend during a history making heat wave.  We were looking for lunch and stumbled upon this place.  We walk inside and it was incredible hot in there.  My husband had the soy cheese steak, which he said was okay and I had a tofu wrap.  It was too expensive for a "to go" place, but the food still tasted like fast food. We actually went back a few months later.  Both times that I've been here, I've come home sick.  I think there is just something about this place that disagrees with me.  My husband was not sick, but just the same I think I'm gonna avoid this place.
