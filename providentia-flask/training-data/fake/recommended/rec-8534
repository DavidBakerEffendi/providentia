Not a fan of this place. Ive gone here about four or so times and each time I order a coffee and its always not that hot I mean its hot but if you dont chug it in under ten minutes your halfway to a shitty ice coffee. Â I would come here for the seating that black and brew lacks but If you want a HOT cup of good coffee go across the street.
