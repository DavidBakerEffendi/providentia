Had never had ramen soup other than when I used to get the packages of 4 for $1.00 in the grocery store many decades ago as a poor student and newlywed.  My wife and I wanted to try something new and see what all the hooplah was about.  We love pho and Thai soups.  We allowed plenty of time before we had to be at a concert because some previous reviews questioned the service.  We were delighted on all fronts.  The service was excellent. Servers went out of their way to explain the menu, different tastes, ingredients and options.  The food came out very fast and we both thought it was very good.  It is a student place.  So other than my wife, there was probably no customer in the crowded restaurant more than half my age.  But so what?  The ingredients really did taste fresh and it was a nice change of pace.  Vietnamese and Chinese noodle soups are cheaper.  But on some cold winter night, I will definitely go back here to get warmed up by the spicey ramen noodle soup I had on this visit.
