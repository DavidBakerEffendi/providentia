When we visited NY our actor daughter took us to this bar/restaurant. It is a small place but with a very friendly atmosphere. We were there on a Sunday night and the highlight of the evening was the very good Jazz group that performed, The Eargulars. The food was good tasting and reasonably priced for NYC. The service was very good, friendly and accommodating. This is a popular spot with artists. We got there at 7 PM and left at 2 AM. It maybe a different experience during the day.
