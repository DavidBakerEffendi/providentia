Eco Friendly environment, I love it! The Steak Sandwich is to die for. The Frozen drinks is amazing. The service is excellent. The spiciness is mind-blowing. The crowd is fun and hipsterish. It's a fun and relax place to chill with friends and although it gets a little noisy sometimes, it is still fun to be in this kind of environment.
