The brunch is awesome!  Everything is done right, and the service is good.  The bloody mary is great, and they bring you drinks in mason jars which I think is pretty cute.  They have homemade biscuits and donuts.  Simply put, it's a fantastic brunch spot.  I have not been there for dinner but would like to check it out soon.  I wish the tables weren't so enormous, but other than that I really enjoy the ambiance.
