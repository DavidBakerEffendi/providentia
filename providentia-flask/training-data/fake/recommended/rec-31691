Byob. That's number one. To me this isn't a huge deal, I'm just not a big driver and neither is my husband. But it is nice to have that option of having a drink with a meal. Otherwise, food is very good. This s coming from a Cuban. Great prices, great food. Pretty atmosphere. It's like an Asian Cuban fusion. The dipping sauces for the yuca fries and plantains is AWESOME. definitely worth a try!!!
