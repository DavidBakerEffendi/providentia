Had a "farewell" dinner with a small group of friends here on Saturday. Probably one of the best dining experiences we've ever had in the city. Inside, it's dark but you're not straining to read the menus. The service was top notch. We got there at peak time & no tables were available. Since there would be a long wait, the owner set us up with drinks, pushed together two bar tables & helped us pick out some snacks to share: the bacon peanut brittle was delicious and the homemade chips & onion dip were to die for. When a table opened up, the owner and several waiters helped us move our drinks and food to a much bigger and cozier booth in the back. Everyone was extremely attentive and friendly. For dinner - the majority of the table had the fried chicken w/ cornbread and salad. The chicken was really well-flavored, juicy, and the skin was perfectly crisp without being heavy. I didn't even finish all of mine. Others had the flank steak, the beet salad w/ goat cheese, and the mushroom flatbread pizza ... there wasn't a bite left. All in all a very satisfying meal, and the drinks were pretty affordable too -- $5 for beers and $9 for their specialty cocktails. Although we maybe over stayed our welcome - we never felt rushed. They even gave us chocolate chip cookies with our check. (Amazingly good.)I definitely plan to be back! It's a gem.
