I'm going to make this easy for you. Close your laptop. Put on your sneakers. GO. NOW. Amazing. Cheap. What more can you want? I ordered the rajas nachos and holy moly was it good. Also - HUGE portion that I couldn't finish (and I can eat, btw). My friend and I grabbed our food and walked a bit to Washington Sq Park to eat on a bench, which was nice. All the happy. I also tried the horchata - it was my first time ever having it, so I can't fairly compare it to horchata elsewhere. It tasted like milky Big Red gum.
