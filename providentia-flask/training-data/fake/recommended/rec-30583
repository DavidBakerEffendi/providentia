For Vegetarians: An airy, homey, country-kitchen feel that serves up masterfully executed classics like eggs, French toast and oatmeal. Their $14 pre-fixe (which comes with an apple cider mimosa or coffee/tea and juice) also features some more unique items like pumpkin waffles with cinnamon-cardamom pecans and baked apples or homemade granola made with coconut, dried figs, dried apricots and dried cranberries. This place scores extra points for carrying San Pelligrino Limonata (my favorite soda). veggiewala.wordpress.com
