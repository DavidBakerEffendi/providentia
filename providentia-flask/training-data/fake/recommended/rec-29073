We heard good things about this place so we celebrated husband's and friend's birthdays here. We liked it here! Louis was our server, and he was really cute, sweet and thoughtful- someone you'd want as a friend. Food was excellent. Grilled octopus was tender, flavorful and delicious (portion is small though just to warn you). The mussels were also lovely- white sauce with lots of garlic. We probably ate 7 baskets of bread because of the delectable broth. Pappardelle Tartufate... had to order it because so many yelpers raved about it. They did not disappoint. Absolutely amazing. I will dream about it tonight. Ginger creme brûlée and tiramisu were both really good and was a great way to end the lovely meal. Will definitely come back for special date nights!
