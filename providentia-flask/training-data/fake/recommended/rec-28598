super healthy, friendly for all sorts of diets like paleo, or gluten free. only catch is that it is indeed rather pricey for what is essentially (healthy) fast food in a coffee shop setting. compared to protein bar (not in ny yet unfortunately), it could do a little better on texture (quinoa was a little too soft) and flavor (reminiscent of energy kitchen).
