Went here for brunch the other day and had a very nice time with friends. The staff are friendly and when we went at 12:30, there was no wait. The food is pretty good. My husband is Mexican and an amazing cook, so their chilaquiles don't beat his but they're not bad. The salad was fresh and crisp. Their grilled veggie frittata only had green peppers and onions though, which I thought was a bit meager but it was still good. For $12 per person for some grub + coffee/tea you should definitely go! One thing I'd add is that we felt a bit rushed at points. For instance, the bus boys took away the guys' baked goods before they were even done. I was a bit sad about that since I was happily nibbling away at them and they were delicious. I guess I should be happy too since they spared me the calories? I'm torn.
