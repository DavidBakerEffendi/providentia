If you like rude customer service, lack luster margaritas, over priced tacos, watery guacamole, and a tight crampy space then go here!!!!!! I cannot believe this place has such a high rating I honestly feel duped!!!! I'm big on yelp and getting real reviews before I visit a place, and following these reviews were a big mistake. My boyfriend and I are Mexican food lovers and are always on the hunt to find the best guacamole. And let me tell this place by far didn't cut it. The guacamole was one of the worst I've ever tasted and was not worth the $5 bucks we paid for it nor was the tasteless margarita. I make wayyyy better guacamole and margaritas and would have rather gone to the grocery store picked up the ingredients and made my own before giving those rude disrespectful people a dime of my money. They had no respect or urgency for their customers. My boyfriend asked where the garbage was and the cashier rudely told him "over there" and rolled her eyes as if it was a dumb question. When we placed our order there was no thank you at all. I honestly feel sorry for anyone who said this place has the best tacos because clearly you have been deprived of actually tasting "good" Mexican food! If this place was the last place on earth to get food from my boyfriend and I would probably starve to death. I have zero tolerance for bad customer service period!! This place is a total fail and waste of time and money. PLEASE DO NOT GO!!!!
