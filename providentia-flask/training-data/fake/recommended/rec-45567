Amazing food.. was impressed by the authenticity of all of it. I don't understand why this place only has an average rating! The food was absolutely delicious. Service wasn't super amazing and we weren't allowed to sit outside, but the people were nice and the atmosphere was relaxed. I ordered two eggs with bacon and got way more than just that.. Homemade ketchup that went amazingly with the potatoes; Homemade applesauce with green apple chunks; Biscuits with homemade apricot jam; Boyfriend's pumpkin bread. Recommended!
