Took my college daughter here while visiting NYC. We both LOVED it. Atmosphere was comfortable and also current. Noise level inside was loud so may be hard for a large group, but the groups there seemed fine with it. The cheese/charcuterie selections were ample and well described - and were delicious. I asked my waitress to pair wines for me and she was spot on. I know there are so many choices, but Uva seemed like a favorite for locals - Will go back!
