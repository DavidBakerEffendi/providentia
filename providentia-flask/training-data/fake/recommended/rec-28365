I've had a good experience and a bad experience with this place. Considering, the second time, which is the most recent [and i mean like..a few hours ago], was IN the diner, and the first time which was bad was through Delivery, this is a good conundrum. I'm a firm believer in sitting in a restaurant to give it a proper review, but the first time i ate Jimmy's, it was snowing and i was lazy and didn't have a choice but to order for delivery. When i ordered delivery, my burger was completely rare. but the tater tots were amazing [and homemade], and their shake wasn't bad. I went to the actual restaurant with my friend today and ordered The Williamsburger [the nice waiter seemed pleased that i ordered it, so that was a good sign too]. which is a burger in between two latkes with applesauce and sour cream. it was amazing [and not rare]. i didn't want to fill up, so i didn't order fries but stole some of my friends from her platter. the service was good, there wasn't really anybody in there which is what i prefer, and it was much better than when i got delivery. i will be back.
