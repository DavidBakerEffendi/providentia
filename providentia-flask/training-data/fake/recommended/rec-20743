Chanced upon this place for brunch with some friends yesterday (it was cold and we wanted to go into the first restaurant we found.) Definitely glad we went to this place! Bread is amazing. Warm and toasted on the outside and slightly chewy on the inside. The Mezze platter is large and tasty. Also, THEIR HUMMUS IS AMAZING. I've had a lot of hummus in my life and this is the creamiest, most wonderful hummus i've had. I'd order a tub of this to go. We also had their Doner Kebab which can be split for two. Tons of tender meat and rice. The only drawback I would say is the cheesy 90s music playing in the background. With such a lovely place you'd want something more relaxing to play for brunch instead of boybands blaring out of the speakers, haha.
