B2 is half perfect, half not-my-cup-of-tea.  The perfect half is its fine location, big tables, nice owner, low key attitude, dairy smoothies, and good toasty baguette sandwiches.  On the other hand; the uncomfortable queue to order and pay, the flies landing on the food, the heinous over-emphasis on vegan baked goods, the feeling that it isn't very clean, and its tendency to at times attract an unpleasant breed of self-consciously aloof folks.  That said, I'm always happy to weather the less appealing aspects in order to have a generally nice place to meet a friend for a beverage and chat.  A good life is full of compromises that are worth making.
