I had a fabulous meal here. The food was exceptional and the service was great too. I am still dreaming of the artichoke and the decadent gnocchi. However I must commend the most impressive aspect, which I find to be a true mark of a great restaurant. Upon exiting the establishment it was pouring rain. While grumbling to my friend that we had no umbrella's and were going to get soaked the valet overheard and offered to get our car (we did not valet) so we wouldn't get wet. I still can't get over how impressed I was with his offer and the commitment to service this restaurant clearly has.
