I'm putting them right down the middle for a few reasons. We ordered from them for delivery last week, and it took over two hours for them to arrive. We actually ended up canceling the order before they even made it to our building because we were so disappointed. But to my surprise, the next day they stopped by our office an a complimentary wrap tray and their apologies. And I must say, the tray was a big hit, and all under 500 calories. I still have faith in this company. Maybe I'll give them a second try.
