I wanted to take my parents out to a nice restaurant in Philly that they've never been to and decided to check out Zahav. The whole experience was awesome and very unique. They basically serve tapas-style Israeli / Middle Eastern cuisine. All of the plates are very good, and most of them are not something you would find anywhere else, even at other Middle Eastern restaurants. The wine was AMAZING (we got the Golan Heights wine). We got a bunch of different small plates, including dessert. The food is just filling enough to make you feel satisfied but without making you feel over-stuffed. The service was very good as well. I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a trendy and original place to eat in Philly.
