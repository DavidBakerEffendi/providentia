It was the first time I had a Vietnamese sandwich.   I had the bbq pork and my friend had the Japanese slow braised pork belly, and both were very very good.  Make sure u add eggs,which makes it even better.  Price is very good too.  I wish the Vietnamese iced coffee was better though.  Coffee I get from my usual pho place was way better
