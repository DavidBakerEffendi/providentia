This is a take out joint only - no sit down area. They make a-pizza style (sort of - sort a cross between traditional neopolitan and a-pizza). Really excellent white pizza with tomatoes and garlic - I would recommend ordering it extra dark, as the crust is sometimes rather light and gets soggy with the tomatoes. But the flavor is fantastic! Really good stuffed breads. This is a specialty niche for them - they have a separate stuffed breads menu that you need to make sure to ask for when you walk in. Â  OTB's stuffed breads are HEAVY - like at least a full pound heavy, much heavier than any other stuffed bread I've tried in the area (but for the same price, circa $8), resutling from the fact that they put a lot more filling in and less bread. The eggplant parmesean stuffed bread is AWESOME. The broccoli/cheese stuffed bread, however, was not impressive - too salty to the point that I threw part of it out. My impression from meat eaters is that their meat-oriented stuffed breads are also quite good. Credit cards accepted for orders over $15. (Yes, this is not technically a legal business practice, but i figger it's important to support mom & pop businesses by paying cash!)
