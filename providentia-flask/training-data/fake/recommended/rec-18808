I don't typically give five stars, and let me preface it by saying that it's really a review of ONE meal and THREE dishes on the menu in particular. I've been to Perilla before and while the food has been good (3-4 stars depending on the dish) and ambiance decent, I was never really blown away. We may have just gotten a good night on the most recent visit, but what amazing dishes! So here's the deal - GO here, try the meatballs, and try these other dishes and hopefully you'll be very happy. In particular, the Baby Red Romain Salad, the Hand-Cut Tagliatelle with Lobster and Fra Diavolo sauce, and the Red Kuri Squash Agnolotti with the Truffles (definitely with the Truffles) were perfectly executed and tasted amazing! And again, we may have just gotten lucky but they were VERY generous with those truffles. Makes my mouth water just thinking about that meal. Oh, and I agree service can be slow, but if you sit at the bar there's no problem at all. I will definitely be back, but just with my focus now a bit more narrow than before.
