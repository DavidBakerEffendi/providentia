This restaurant was a pleasant surprise. We ordered the 4 course meal. We weren't sure about what we ordered but each course was amazing. Even better we got about 8 samples of tastes before we even started the meal. The chef is creative and the tastes are fun. Everything was beautifully presented as well. The service is also worth a mention. Attentive with a sense of humor. Expensive but well worth it.
