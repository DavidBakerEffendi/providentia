Terrific flatbread pizza that hits the spot and a great hand pulled draught pint too! Ok....I'm a pizza snob, lived in Italy for 2 years and ate the REAL stuff...not this flabby over cheesed 'pie' as some folks insist on calling them here. Well I hail from the UK ..not known for great pizza....and I've eaten some truly terrible ones over the years. However .....these folks do the subject proud! First time at this location and as I sat outside for lunch today, under a cooling tree in their small courtyard I was VERY impressed. I drank a pint of their real draught ale, served the British way at a cool but not cold temperature and pulled by hand This summer brew was delicious! Two flat breads; the heart an soul was the best, crisp light and wonderfully hot. Our server was a part time worker who only worked in the summer months as he was teacher, and he stated that working for the Flatbread folks was a pleasure....which is why he has done it for the last six summers. Praise for an employer is rare these days. 10/10 and as good as the original in Waitsfield!
