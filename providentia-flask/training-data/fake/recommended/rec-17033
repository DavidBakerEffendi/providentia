If Palisades Park is too far from you, try Keo Ku Restaurant.  I have found that there are not many great Korean restaurants in the area so all things considered this restaurant was quite a find.  Compared to K-town restaurants, Keo-Ku earns more of a 3-star rating. I have had the kalbi, Sam Gyup Sal and spicy Sam Gyup Sal (sliced pork belly).  The Kalbi is pretty good and the spicy sam gyup sal is more flavorful than the regular one so I'd recommend ordering spicy.  Also, if you order 3 or more BBQs you get a free small soon dubu jigae (spicy tofu soup) or Miso soup. Their regular dishes have been solid as well.  Their pajun (Korean Pancake) was pretty good, but I've had better.  The jang pong (spicy seafood soup with noodles) is tasty and the seafood is pretty fresh.  Nyeng Myun is good as well. Overall, the service is nothing spectacular but in no way makes my visits to Keo Ku less pleasant.  The food is good (considering the location) and is worth checking out for sure!
