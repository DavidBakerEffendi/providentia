Just driving by I feel my growing up in Brooklyn vibe. I'd only been here twice, and both was to pick up catered food for my office. If I ever thought I would get a parking spot, I'd be there every week. Food was awesome. Staff was nice. My mouth waters when I think if the eggplant rollatini. On a nice day, I'll take a walk over there and hoard deliciousness, when my Bensonhurst deli cravings are intolerable.
