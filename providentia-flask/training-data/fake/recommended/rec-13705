LOMBARDISSSSSS coal oven.... You would think a whole pizza would be a lot for 2 girls...YEAH RIIIIIGHT. we finished that thing like it was nothing! We got the classic margherita with the wild mushrooms. twas a good combo! the crust is light and just the right amount of crusty/crispiness? the texture is just different from ur average pizza place such as dominoes...papa johns they use fresh mozzarella so cheese is super melty and oozy. NOT salty at all..it's weird cuz you start eating...and after a slice, its not super filling at all cuz I'm used to thick spongey dough...def authentic Itlian pizza! OH! try the italian soda! really cute...comes topped with whipped cream and a cherry on top hehe. It will complete ur lil pizza experience
