the atmosphere was similar to cafes in vienna, but it wasnt anything special. i ordered the apfelstrudel, which was amazing, but a little pricey. i also ordered some grunertee, which i liked. the person with me ordered heiss schokolade and marzipan cake, very dissapointing....i cant say if the hot chocolate was similar to that in vienna bc i never had it there, but it was pretty tasteless and expensive. the marzipan cake was kind of dry, but it was ok. Â its not something i would order anyways so i cant really say if it was good or bad really. i liked the place because it reminded me of my time living in austria, i saw that someone ordered some almdudler, that is awesome that they have it! i used to drink it all the time when i was there, i will get it next time i go.
