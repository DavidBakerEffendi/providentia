Ughh this place was so good it made me want to take a warm bath of butter.  The scent of the place alone is to die for.  I'm know to have a bottomless pit for a stomach, so the portion size was a little small, but I made sure to savor every bite.  $15 for a lunch is a little out of my price range, but very reasonable for a lobster roll.  I wish I could eat here once a week, but payday only comes so often...
