This bar was very low key and loungy. My fiance had planned a surprise get together here to celebrate our engagement, and the place was definitely hip, clean, and spacious enough to dance to what the dj was spinning. I didn't eat the food, but I arrived on the tail end of their margarita special, and as a margarita connoisseur, I wasn't all that impressed. After a shot of tequila and spicy tomato juice, everything tasted good. Definitely a fun place for chilling. Next time I'll try the food.
