House of Kabab now has a new owner. Â The new owner used to run Asia Grocery, a halal meat place in Lake Hiawatha. We have been faithful customers in Lake Hiawatha for almost 14 years. Never disappointed. We went to House of Kabab last night (new name and new menu soon). The experience was wonderful. The food is so fresh and tasteful. A genuine family restaurant where you will feel really welcome. This is a place you really want to go back to if you like a friendly experience and great food. Btw, the butterfly chicken dish was absolutely great, as was the rice and bread. You should go there.
