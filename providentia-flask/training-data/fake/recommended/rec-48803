Just okay. Kind of overrated. Always walked by this place and wanted to see what it was about. Shared one pizza (the classic), had two drinks, an app and an espresso shot and the bill was $60. Definitely not worth it. The pizza (more of a Neapolitan style) was just okay, nothing to write home about. I still prefer the one at Luzzo's over this.
