The buttermilk pancakes at Cornerstone Cafe are to die for!  By far the thickest, fluffiest pancakes I've ever eaten.  The very prevalent tangy buttermilk flavor and orange blossom honey took these pancakes to a whole 'nother level.  That is, once I got them.  The service was slow, which isn't always bad, but it was exceptionally so here.  Oh, well, I guess you can't rush perfection!
