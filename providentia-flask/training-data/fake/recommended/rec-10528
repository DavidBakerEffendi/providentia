This is a great little place to get a drink or a good pub meal. One of the oldest bars in New York, it really gives the feel of a dusty Irish pub. You can sit outside in the summer which is cool, but be aware that motorcyclists frequent this place, at least on Thursdays. It's cool if you like bikes since they park them right out front, but it gets a bit crowded. The food is good, and perhaps a bit underrated, too. Great burgers and sandwiches, but don't hesitate to order something slightly less run-of-the-mill. Anything that seems distinctly Irish or English--like Shepherd's Pie--is bound to be good. Great beers on tap like Sierra and Boddington's and the taps are kept pretty clean. It's reasonably priced, but not necessarily cheap. Definitely worth the stop if you're in the area.
