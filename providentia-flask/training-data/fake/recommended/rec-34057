florence fabricant put it best: Do or Dine, or Don't. We weren't allowed to bring in beer on Monday, I guess they got raided over the weekend.   The best thing we ate was the nippon nachos, easily duplicated at home. I resent the self conception that this place seems to have, that they're so audacious and irreverent that it doesn't actually have to be... delicious?  For example, there were arbitrary black sesame seeds in our otherwise normal root beer floats.  The texture was really annoying and they contributed nothing to the flavor.  Why not take the conception of this dish ONE logical step further, and use black sesame ice cream?  That would be totally delicious, you could buy the ice cream from the Chinatown ice Cream Factory, which everyone adores, easy, a fun twist on a classic dessert drink.  But their execution, in this case and others, wasn't pushed far enough, and the results were sloppy.   the space was cute, but even if it was byob again, i can't imagine going back.
