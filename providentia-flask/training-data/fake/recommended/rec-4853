So this place really is a hybrid cafe/mini restaurant.  Instead of just ordering something premade or out of a case, they can cook you up something as well (such as their serious business Turkish Hot Dog). Their coffee was strong and bitter but good and the atmosphere is extremely well done and casual.  I expect Middle-Eastern/Med coffee to be potent so I'm prepared for that.  If you don't like strong coffee at all, I'd try a sugary drink to help cut it.   I've had a few of the dessert goodies and they were delicious.  Apart from that, the owner and her staff are very friendly and service orientated.  I'm not sure if it is because it's kinda sorta a restaurant/diner, but the place just looks and feels cleaner compared to most coffee shops in the area so if you really need that new fresh look, this might be your spot.  I personally like the "Gritty and Shitty" feel of Philly's cafes but it's nice to see something fresh once in awhile. The spot isn't very large but it typically isn't overly crowded either.  They get less foot traffic since they're a bit south of South st and somewhat placed in a more residential spot, but it's a nice addition to Queen Village! Give it a shot!
