Yeah unfortunately this place is usually just ok, sometimes worse. The coffee is bad. Omelets are thin and dry. Toast bread tastes cheap. Sandwiches can be fine, but nothing special and overpriced. Dinner entrees don't sound appetizing. There really isn't a good, inexpensive place to eat in downtown Princeton, so it's a real shame this place isn't any better. I think if they upped their game they could always be packed. Location is great so I would come a lot more often if the food were better.
