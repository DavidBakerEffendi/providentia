Found this place while looking for a place to eat near the garage that was mounting new tires on my car. It stood out among the other places on the block so I checked the menu, saw they had bacon and went inside. Ordered a baconeggncheezonnaroll and a large coffee and that's when I noticed the pastries. Chris, the owner, told me they just came out the oven so I got a croissant while I waited. I took one bite of the light, crisp, and tender croissant when Chris put my baconeggncheezonnaroll down in front of me. After finishing the croissant, I tucked into the sandwich. The sandwich was average, as was the coffee, but the attractive interior, warmth, friendliness and the freshness and quality of the baked goods pushed a 3 star place into 4 stars. Good to know this place is here when I'm in the area. I'm now a fan.
