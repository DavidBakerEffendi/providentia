Meeh.  It wasn't bad, I just wasn't particularly impressed with the sushi I ordered.  Maybe it was an off night, because for the most part the reviews on here were great.  First of all, the positive...our calamari appetizer was amazing, and our waitress was very gracious and attentive, and to top it off the prices are reasonable and it's a BYOB.  But the place is smaller than some people's closets (okay maybe not that small).  You are literally right on top of the people next to you...a little too close for me and difficult to tune out other peoples conversations.  The sushi was only OK.  Honestly, my Tuna and Salmon were not the freshest.  After practically living on raw fish in California, I expect when people say something's really fresh that you taste it.  I think for a nicer atmosphere and better sushi I'm better off at my neighborhood Umai Umai.
