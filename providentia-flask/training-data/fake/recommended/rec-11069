I went here two nights ago and last night, my stomach was still a bit queasy from all the exotic sashimi we had. Price is steep for the size of the items; usually tapas is cheaper cause you order many dishes and each are so small. This is the first time I've seen a sushi tapas though so maybe they would be more pricey. Place is very nice, with private rooms, bar, and karaoke going on somewhere. Lighting is too dark for my preference, although the music going on gave a cheery ambiance. Across 4 people, we had: - eel roll: barely had any eel - salmon skin roll: overly fried, tasted just crispy and salty - dragon roll: again, not enough eel - white tuna sashimi: pretty good. tasted fresh - yellow tail sashimi: I didn't try it, although my family said it was okay - karubi short rib: good, but way too expensive for one small stick's worth - mackerel pike: good, not too salty - tuna roll: good, nothing special - Chef roll: lots of crab, good - shrimp tempura roll: didn't try, although family said it was okay - ika yaki: much tinier than picture makes it look, okay - a special item of tuna over a salad: very good, nice slices of tuna and good salad - a special item of 4 or 5 items: roe in cucumber slices, sashimi with roe, i don't remember what else. Most of it was slimy, kinda sour, ehh. - green tea tempura ice cream: I've had better. Very plain, just ice cream battered and fried, no powdered sugar or chocolate syrup or anything. Ice cream was rock hard, tempura outside didn't taste spectacular.
