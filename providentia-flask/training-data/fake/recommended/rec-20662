This place is my new addiction. Spanish cured meat is so delicious. I recommend coming in on Wednesdays when all sandwiches are only $1. I also really like the mix cured meat from Spain platter. They give you a little bit of everything and it comes with warm, toasty bread. You wrap the cured meat with the warm bread and it's amazing. They make really good french fries too! Their fries are crispy and potato-y. Get them with the ali oli and the brava sauce!
