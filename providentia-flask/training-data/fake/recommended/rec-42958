oh cha-an, i adore you. with 1763259725 types of tea to choose from, i am truly spoilt. i felt i had been teleported into a teahouse in japan through the tiny door at 230 East 9th Street. do not expect  the same wide array to the food or dessert here, but you can certainly indulge in the idiosyncrascies of how tea being prepared and served.  the teacups were warmed with hot water before they poured the tea in for serving. each teapot seemed to magically only contained the exact volume of each teacup. don't ask me what's the whole point with the teapot thingie but they have earned the 5 stars for service, ambience, the wide selection of teas and the limited selection yet eat your heart out desserts. i could not resist zenzai dessert every single time i stepped into Cha An and it has never disappointed me so far. the chef has been creative to switch from green tea ice cream, served with a dollop of sweet red bean paste and utterly chewy and melt in your mouth mochi to black sesame paste with mochi. oh wait, i forgot to mention the thin sesame biscuit which taste all so exquisite. i had the Cha An dinner set, which was pretty good except the servings were so tiny. thankfully the dessert made up for it.
