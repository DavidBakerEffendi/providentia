Stumbled here on a first date drawn in by the gorgeous atmosphere.  My drink (a sidecar) was delicious as was my sparse yet tasty starter (crab croquette).  My date enjoyed his duck breast and cous cous while I had the perfectly cooked striped bass with a (warm not hot) lemon risotto. The service was decent but not as attentive as I like it--and my risotto should have been hotter.  But a lovely place and I'd come back here again for a meal-because I have tot ry the meatloaf and pork belly sliders! they looked amazing--as did everything I saw people ordering.
