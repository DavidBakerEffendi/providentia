Food was great but here is why I will never return: 1. Table tents at table that to paraphrase say basically "eat and then leave cause others are waiting" 2. They charge for "to go" containers 3. No modifications to specials 4. And worst: owner or manager pulled up in his Maserati, parked in front of a fire hydrant for over an hour, told an employee "too bad" when told about it. Then he bumped into a waitress, causing her to spill a drink on the floor, so what does the owner do? Not apologize but rather throw a rag on the spill and tell the waitress "you got that" Talk about a douche bag! "i would not pay for a box, they wouldnt change their special lox. I do not like green eggs cafe, I will not go there anyway! (shout out to Dr. Seuss!)
