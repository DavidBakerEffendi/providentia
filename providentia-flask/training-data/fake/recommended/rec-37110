I went here for my birthday back in November, and have been coming ever since. Â Their happy hour is fantastic for someone (like me) who gets out of work late. The only thing I've tried on their menu was the edamame (which was mushy) and the wings, which were delicious. Would definitely recommend coming here if you find yourself in the area.
