Omg. Get the peking duck pancake (not sure of the exact name). It is to die for, and the price is so cheap I wonder every time how on earth they do it. I've only ever gotten either the peking duck pancake or a bag of frozen dumplings (I think some 50 pieces for like 8$) - at roughly 8 dumplings a meal that means you're paying just a little over 1$ per meal! Â Unfortunately the meat inside the dumplings is of such terrible quality that I never ended up finishing the bag of frozen dumplings - it's just not that great. At all. If you have to wait (you most likely will) it's great fun watching the efficiency with which all of these dumplings are hand made (an excruciatingly fiddly business, if you've ever done it yourself).
