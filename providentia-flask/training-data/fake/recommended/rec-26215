Woorijip is a KTown staple. You can't go to KTown and not go to Woorijip at some point. Not necessarily for the food but you probably will end up here because of your friends. During busy times (aka lunch or dinner until the end of the night), it is really difficult to find a table to sit at, especially when you have a large group for a night out. If you come alone, there is a row of seats at the front of the restaurant. The prices for the prepared boxes that come with the soup or salad are definitely cheap for the area but the food is pretty hit or miss. The foods I tend to avoid here are the stale dukboki and the flavorless japchae. I like the buffet but it is really easy to get carried away with serving yourself, especially since each item is pretty heavy. That being said, they charge by weight and it's pretty expensive but the buffet food is better than the prepared meals. Whenever I come here, I always grab a $1 bottle of water to sober up. Probably the cheapest water in the area. If you're not looking to sober up, they have plenty of choices of alcoholic drinks from beer to soju. There's fruity yogurt drinks to mix your soju with too. Yum! The decor of the restaurant isn't really outstanding since the focus is on the ton of food there. The customer service is pretty standard since they only interact with you at the register. They have a $10 credit card minimum so bring cash if you don't plan on spending too much here. If you will come here often, they have a Woorijip card that they stamp every time you spend $5. Since so many people come here, people watching is pretty entertaining and you never know who you will run into. I always end up at Woorijip whenever I'm in KTown whether it is for a quick bite or drinking with friends and because they're open until 3:00 AM. Perfect for all of you party animals out there.
