I can't give this place 5 stars because the booths are so small.  However, as far as the pizza goes, this is the only place in central jersey that tastes like the Bronx pizza that I grew up on.   Sandwiches are very good too.  Fresh and huge.  Staff very friendly and always greet you with a smile.    A little on the expensive side but not terribly so.   Worth the extra few cents for the quality and taste of the food.
