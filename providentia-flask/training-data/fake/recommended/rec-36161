This place could be classed as a European tourist trap. The food is decent, but it was only okay for how expensive it is. The service was pretty good.  Still, more should be expected of a restaurant in this price range in a city with lots of other options.   The general sentiment of the group was "I don't feel like the food was particularly good but I feel quite full."
