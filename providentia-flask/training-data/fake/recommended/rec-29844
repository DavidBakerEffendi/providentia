The line outside stretching into the parking garage next door says it all; this place is very popular for a very good reason. 17 different soup options. 17! I had a difficult time picking between the Jambalaya and the Lobster bisque but eventually settled for the latter. I also ordered a turkey sandwich as it came with the combo. Overall $9 for the two (and a piece of bread and adorable little apple) is a great deal. The soup was delicious and filling on its own. The sandwich was okay, but its certainly not called the "Sandwich Spot." I will definitely be coming back for the Jambalaya sometime in the near future! This place does give off a "Soup Nazi" type feel, but the people working are extremely nice!
