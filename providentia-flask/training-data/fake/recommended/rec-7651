Lovely setting - you feel like you are In a Viennese cafe. Long wait to get in, however, and ultimately disappointing food. Â Our server did not give knowledgeable guidance to the dessert menu. We ordered a chocolate rum cake that was so mediocre we didn't finish it and a chocolate hazelnut cake that was excellent. At $9.00/slice, they have no business serving a cake that isn't fabulous. When the server asked how things were, and we said the rum cake wasn't very good, he said "sorry," smiled, and ran away without offering to get us something else.Viennese coffee was not hot, and not very good. At $5.00/tiny cup, it should be much better. So, the 3 stars are for atmosphere and the chocolate hazelnut cake. I don't think I would eat there again.
