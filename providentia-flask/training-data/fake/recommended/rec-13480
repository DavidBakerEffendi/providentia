Great Pizza. Thin tasty dough, excellent sauce, fresh mozzarella and other imported ingredients Pie was perfect. Not one spot was missing cheese or topping. The owner makes each pie himself. No I'm not kidding. It's perfection Ala Dominick!!! Wait time is long but lets be real, Dom isn't a kid and perfection takes time. If you want the best, you've found it BUT be prepared to wait
