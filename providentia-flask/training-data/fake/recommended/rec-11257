The beer selection is great, the food is pretty good, but the service is ... well ... HORRIBLE. Unbelievably horrible. I worked in the restaurant industry for over 10 years and if I can smile and act like I care about customers, anyone can. Not Bethany. We went on a Friday for happy hour and our server Bethany could have cared less about our needs. We seemed to be an annoyance to her. I went there a while ago, but one of my coworkers was just complaining about the service there which reminded me to yelp about them. Clearly I'm not the only one who feels this way.
