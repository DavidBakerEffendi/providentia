I went out on a second date to Jasmine Rice because I looove Thai food, even though I can't name most of the dishes.  It was Saturday night, so the place was packed and there was only one table available RIGHT next to kitchen-Yikes!  But they quickly made up for this inconvenience with excellent service. They were on! If they saw I was done with my appetizer silverware, they promptly replaced it with our entree cutlery.  They saw my water running low...seconds later, it was filled. It was like watching a well orchestrated waiter ballet.  I started to sway in my seat.  Then came the choreographer of this perfect dance.  I believe his name was Bob. He created the menu and he took the time to explain it and suggested something that was...mmmm! I wish I remembered the name of it, but it was duck and sweet and spicy and exactly what I wanted.  Aside from the food, I believe that Bob was the best part of the experience.  He was informative, jovial and really was the icing of an already wonderful dining experience. If I had to complain about anything it would be the size.  Intimacy is one thing, but at one point I felt like I could reach over and have some of our neighbor's appetizers and they would be none the wiser.  But if they continue with their top-notch service, expansion should be inevitable. Loved it!
