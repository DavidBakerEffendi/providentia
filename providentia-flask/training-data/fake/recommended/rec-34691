Juniper opened a couple of months ago and I thought we should check it out. From the outside the atmosphere and decor appear lacking, rather bare and uninviting. People often peak into the window just to find an empty restaurant inside and walk away. Indeed, Juniper is not the most happening place in Wburg. Part poor decor, part lack of liqour license, its quietness is a self fulfilled prophecy. However those of us who do step in and get a table are up for a pleasant surprise: what the restaurant lacks in atmosphere the chef makes up in quality of food. Having been here twice I must attest to other reviewers: the dishes are excellent, inexpensive and quite varied. Linguini are perfectly al dante, shrimp are plump and succulent, burgers are juicy and flavorful, sandwiches are well assembled with all ingredients in perfect harmony. The menu, while not large, has dishes from several cuisines: Italian, Chinese, Korean and American with the latter being particularly good choice. Service, as many have noted, is excellent: the only waiter is friendly and actually honest about the dishes. Food arrives quickly. Next time you walk by Juniper and see empty tables and bare walls inside, give it a try: not all jewels sparkle.
