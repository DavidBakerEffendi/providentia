I went to this Halal cart on a sunday afternoon with my significant other. The line was short compared to the massive crowd of people we saw the night before. I had heard many good things about this food cart prior to actually trying it myself so I was pretty stoked. I ordered the chicken and lamb over rice with both white and hot sauce. After trying my first bite I was immensely disappointed. The rice was dry, the meat was dry, the side salad was wilted and the sauces were mediocre. Maybe I'm just not a chicken over rice kind of guy, maybe that's just the charm of street food but one thing I know for certain is that I'd probably have to be pretty trashed to enjoy it.
