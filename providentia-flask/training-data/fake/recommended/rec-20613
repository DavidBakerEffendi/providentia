Out of all the Jersey diner's I've eaten at (and it's a LONG list) this place ranks pretty low on the totem pole. It's most that the food is terrible, but it's not that great either. For WAYYY better diner food and a nicer atmosphere, just go down the road about half a mile and turn right to go to State Street Grill!
