Up until Friday night, Cookshop was my go-to restaurant when friends visited from out of town. The food is always great, the ambience beautiful, and the High Line is right across the street. But last Friday, when a friend's cocktail didn't arrive, and he gently asked our server (with a smile and a wink) "you working on my martini"? He groused, "No, but the bartender is" and walked away. When a different server arrived with his martini sans the 3 olives requested (lemon peel instead) and we asked nicely for the olives, she rolled her eyes and walked away with the cocktail. In the end, our surly server smiled at us just once, when my friend was working out the tip on the bill. Too bad for our server, the cause for our going out was that my uber-generous friend just sold his company for millions. Could have been quite a tip.
