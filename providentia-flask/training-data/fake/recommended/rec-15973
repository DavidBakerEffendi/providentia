Out of all the places I've eaten at NYC so far, I'd have to say that this is one of my TOP TOP TOP TOP favorites. I really do not feel like the chicken and rice is overrated at all. I've tried other halal carts, but NONE of them have the perfection of this cart: HUGE portions, perfectly cooked rice, and extremely tender chicken without the extra fat and tendon that many other carts throw in. Random tip: when I went with a bunch of my friends, for some reason they gave my boyfriend and me the white sauce on the side in separate containers (we didn't ask for it), which ended up being a really good thing cos that was a LOT more sauce than the usual that they squirt on. The rest of my friends just got the sauce squirted on by the halal guys, and they all ended up going back to ask for more white sauce, while my boyfriend and I had ours thoroughly drenched thanks to the sauce on the side.
