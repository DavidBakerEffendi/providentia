Whenever I'm in the mood for some good seafood I take a drive down to Princeton and eat a Bluepoint. This place is on the money every time and their food is always fresh and delicious. You have to make a reservation as they don't take walk ins, but it's well worth it. The clams casino is the best I've had of all the seafood places I've been to. And the calamari is delicious, fresh and sized perfectly. It's BYO, so bring your favorite bottle of red and enjoy it with excellent seafood. There's also the option for outdoor seating if its available. This is especially great in the summer months. Everything about this place is great, great staff, great food. Definitely a must if in the Princeton area.
