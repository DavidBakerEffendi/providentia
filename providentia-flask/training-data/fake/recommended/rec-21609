I really like B2.  As others have pointed out, the queue is confusing and the baristas send out a judgemental and aloof vibe to nonregulars, which makes this place seem a bit uninviting. I can't really blame them.  After years existing in close proximity of Geno's steaks and listening to people order "expresso" and "café oh-lay" I'd probably be callous to humanity as well.  I just wish they'd feign even a moderate interest in life, is all.  Cute place, great fare, good coffee, and right across the street from the best pub in the city.
