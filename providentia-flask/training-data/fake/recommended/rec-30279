Truffle burger - yummy and juicy Manly burger - my friend said she liked hers Fried pickles - hmm i wasn't a fan Truffles fries  and Cheese tots - were just standard Secret menu  - you will need to ask about this. I figured out that if you seat at the bar, you usually don't have to wait on line. We got there on a weekday around 6pm on the month of July 2013. We had to wait for like 10mins even tho when we got in there were a lot of empty tables. Well not a lot but a few, I thought that was a bit strange on why did we have to wait. -.- I guess they seem to have a little management problem on teamwork between the hostess and waitress/waiters. Overall,this place was just a HYPE. That's about it. I'm just happy I wasn't those people who had to wait more then 30mins before it totally wouldn't been worth it.
