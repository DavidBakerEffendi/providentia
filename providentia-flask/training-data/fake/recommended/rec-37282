Joya has an amazing ambiance as you walk in it is very romantically lit up.  Additionally, they have a very cozy seating area outside as well.  On top of that their service was great as my friend and I played musical chairs as we could not find the perfect spot to sit. When it came to food, I ordered the Kang Gai sliced chicken with eggplant, bamboo shoots, peppers and carrots in a red coconut curry sauce. The dish was so savory and the vegetables tasted amazing in the red coconut curry sauce! Delicious!! I downed it with a nice cold Brooklyn lager on draft. Will definitely come back to try other dishes!
