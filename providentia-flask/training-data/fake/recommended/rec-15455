We came on a Sunday night and it was pretty busy. They take reservations so be sure to OpenTable. We ordered the Procuttio and Mozerella appetizer which was GREAT. Just the perfect amount and not a crazy amount of different things, just simple and deliciousssss. The baked penne was decent but not their best dish, the Mezzaluna pasta was really good because of the creamy mushroom sauce. You could also tell the pasta was incredibly fresh. The service was great and pretty fast. Would reccommed sitting on the back patio. Also the prices were pretty low in terms of NYC, two people who shared an app and each had pasta paid less than $40.
