This is the best bar in the Olde City neighborhood. I have been eating and drinking here for years and I have had much of the food on their menu. Personally, I favor the pulled pork but any of their barbecue items will really make your mouth happy. Sharing a pick-3 with a date over some delicious (and often rare) craft brews can make a great night out. I also find its a great place for happy our with friends becuase many bars Happy Hour specials only include cheaper beers. At Khyber the Happy Hour special applies to everything. Â The bacon popcorn is also a clutch choice to accompany happy hour beers.
