It truly boggles my mind that this place has garnered such reviews, considering that this is the first time I am compelled to write a bad review on Yelp -- that's how terrible my experience was. I first dined here about two weeks ago with a friend. Our waitress was charming, although service tapered off near the end, such that we waited an INORDINATELY long amount of time to receive our check. So be it. The food was good, so we got over it. I came back last night with three friends. The restaurant was busy and we had no reservation, but were seated relatively quickly. It all went downhill from there. The two appetizers we ordered took an extremely long time to arrive, so we devoured them once they came. Then, the real waiting began. Our orders (pizza, pappardelle, brisket, and steak) took an hour and a half to arrive AFTER appetizers had been given to us. Numerous inquiries to the sourpuss waitress were not helpful - we were eventually assured that "it's on its way", after which it still took an additional half hour for the food to actually come out. Tables who had arrived after us received their food much earlier, leading me to believe that perhaps the waitress forgot to put in the order. Nevertheless, if such were the case, the waitress should have done everything possible to make up for her oversight. Instead, when we could actually get her attention, all we got was her terrible attitude. After we had finished our meal (the food was good), we asked the waitress politely if she knew what had taken so long. Her response was that "the place filled up at the same time, and the kitchen is small, so they can't keep up, there was backlog" etc., etc.......... Please, cut the bullsh*t - it was just adding insult to injury. Truly inexcusable and so unprofessional. Notwithstanding the good food, we will NOT be back!
