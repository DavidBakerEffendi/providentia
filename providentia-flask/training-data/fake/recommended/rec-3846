So I walked in hungry and the owner/manager whoever she was took forever to get me a menu and even come back to take my order. I am not too pushy so I forgive if the food is great. I ordered the pad Thai just because if the pad thai is good then you can typically assume the rest is pretty ok. The pad thai was just okay. They used too much tamarind sauce or something because it was too sweet/sour...made my jaw clench LOL. but the consistency and texture were still okay. I was hungry: ate it all.
