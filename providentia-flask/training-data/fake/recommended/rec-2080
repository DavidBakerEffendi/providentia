Avoid! Taste: Bland. Â Bread was great. But that was all. Experience: Very put off by the "speak english" sign and various other bits of signage. The 30 minute wait in line wasn't fun either. Haven't tried Pat's yet but probably won't bother. Next time in Philly will opt for a cheese steak place with great yelp reviews for the actual taste of the food.
