I don't understand why people are raving here.  We stopped off in Burlington on our way to Canada because we wanted some lunch, and stumbled upon Red Onion.  It seemed to have healthy choices (for those on a diet) and vegan choices (for the vegans, duh), but it lacked...quality. The prices were incredibly high for what you got, at least in my opinion.  The food was just alright, the bathroom was, well, lets say I used cleaner in college bars, and the kicker, the servers were totally rude to us.  The true 2 star deal for me, tiny cup of coffee for $2, and then, for a refill, another $2.  WHAT?  Even the rapidly bankrupting Starbucks gives you a break on the refills.   I don't live in Burlington, but should I return, I will not be stopping in at Red Onion.
