My husband and I had an exceptional meal here. We got the tuna tartare (amazing!) to nibble on then moved on to the halibut and pan-roasted chicken for our entrees. Our meal was mouthwatering -good from beginning to end. They also had a great selection of wines to choose from - several options but not so many that it becomes overwhelming. In addition, we liked the layout of the space. Intimate but with great windows to allow plenty of natural light in. The service was great as well. Come for a date or to catch up with a few of your close girlfriends!
