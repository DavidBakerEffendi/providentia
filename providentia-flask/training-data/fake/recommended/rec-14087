This is my go-to sushi delivery place.  The people are super nice and fish is always good and fresh - which, sadly, you can't say for many places in the city.  The salmon, especially, is often melt in your mouth good. Don't get me wrong - this isn't special sushi. It's delivery sushi.  But for that it's pretty good.
