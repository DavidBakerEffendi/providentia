I was in Philadelphia for just 2 days with my husband and this is the last place we went before we left. That bald guy thing made us curious enough to go inside. We were pleasantly surprised! I absolutely loved the illustration on the walls and all the product packaging. We found perfect gifts for several of our friends in there. I didn't give it 5 stars because we did not stay to eat, but I was very intrigued. The guy that helped us was very nice, even when I was rushing all around asking a 100 questions about all the gift packages. As an artist, I fell in love with the packaging, its worth it to go inside just to see the design.
