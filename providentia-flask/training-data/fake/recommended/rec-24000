Bifurcated deliciousness. Yeah, go ahead look it up or check out El Camino Real to understand it first hand. ECR features a menu pleasantly divided between inventive Mexican dishes and hearty down home fresh off the chuck wagon BBQ. Truth be told, I've never eaten from a chuck wagon, but I do know my BBQ and can call this authentically delicious from at least twenty paces. Pricing seemed high on some items which I only realized when I was served a burrito less than the size of your average newborn. And while I loved the divided menu, I would have liked to see some fusion dishes that marry the two ideas together. We hit up the happy hour for half price marg pitchers were tasty. Not sure if it was because of happy hour, there was a ton of ice in the pitcher delivered to our table. The atmosphere like the food is lively and varied. ECR is a great place to grab some drinks with a small group of friends or meet up with co-workers for some happy hour fun. Couldn't give this place a 4/5 star review because in comparison with the Cantina, this place is just ok. Two things that stuck out were the ice to drink ratio and the fact they charge for chips and salsa. It's only a dollar for all you can eat, but still it seems cheap. Why charge at all? Or why charge for the first basket. Those two things combined made me wonder what else they are cheaping out on. TL;DR Great drinks; decent food. It's is worth a try especially if your palette can't decide between Mexican and BBQ.
