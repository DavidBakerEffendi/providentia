I went there for the first time last night and everything was fantastic! The owner came up and introduced himself to our table and we instantly felt welcomed. The only complaint that I have is that we were required to get the $35 prix fixe menu because there was 6 of us. I understand 6 is more then the average but requiring the prix fixe is going to hinder us from going there often. Besides that, everything was great!
