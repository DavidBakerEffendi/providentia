My girlfriends and I were so excited to try the restaurant after hearing rave reviews, so we got there on a Saturday around noon but were told that there was a two-hour wait. The hostess was not very nice or friendly but we got our food relatively quickly after we ordered. The food was good but not amazing and the blueberry pancakes were not as good as we expected. My frittata and my gf's eggs benedict were also just okay. I was then surprised to see that gratuity was already added and when we went to pay, they said it was cash only (apparently it is written on the bottom of the menu in TINY letters). We were just not very impressed and it was definitely not worth the 2-hour wait, but at least we know now.
