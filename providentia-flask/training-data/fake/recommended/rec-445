As a regular here, I can confidently say that this is one of my favorite spots in the area. I was a fan before but I must say that once they introduced the bahn mi fries, my whole world changed. If ever you needed a reason to come here, it's for the fries. They are perfectly fried and topped with a generous amount of the bahn mi toppings and delicious spicy mayo. The rest of the menu doesn't disappoint. I've tried the pork and lemongrass bahn mi sandwiches, as well as the spring rolls, glazed chicken wings and various types of the bubble tea and specialty drinks. The staff is friendly and this spot almost has the feel of a cafe because people just come and stay to chat. It's small but spacious and the green paint and chalkboard walls give it a very fun and modern touch to the neighborhood. I've been coming since it first opened and it's definitely starting to catch on with out of towners so I hope it doesn't become too popular to enjoy anymore = (
