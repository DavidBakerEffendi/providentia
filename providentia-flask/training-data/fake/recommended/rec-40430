The burgers are awesome!  They aren't very big but unless you're extremely  hungry, you'll be satisfied.  The meat is very flavorful, kinda like a burger off the grill at home.  Try the 500.  The fries were also really good.  If I wasn't hungry enough for a burger, I'd stop by this place just for a bag of their truffle fries.  I was literally picking out the crumbs from the bottom of the fry bag! Here's the bad part... The place is way too small.  Unless you go late in the afternoon when most people are at work, expect to wait in line to order and stand around with a growling stomach waiting for somewhere to sit.
