I've never eaten here, but it's a good place for a beer or glass of wine. There's no tv, which is great and the music comes from the bartenders IPod. No loud drunk college kids; well rarely. It is a block away from South street, so you do get rowdy patrons sometimes and then it gets loud and crowded.
