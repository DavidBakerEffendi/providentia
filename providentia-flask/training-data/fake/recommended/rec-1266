This is some seriously genuine Mexican food. You can really taste how fresh the food is, and I liked how you can spice things up a bit if you like. I DO LIKE IT HOT - So that made me happy. Went there for lunch, and the service was fast. The velvet booths are way over the top, but comfortable to sit in. Definitely stop in to treat yourself.
