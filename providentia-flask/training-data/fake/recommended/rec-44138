Great food. mmmm. It wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be. The menu had all the spicy items in a bold red font. Maybe that made me think it would be hotter. We hung out for a while, and the staff was attentive, but didn't push us out. They weren't that crowded, but did have a rotating group of patrons. Even with all the other places to eat in China town, this is becoming my favorite.
