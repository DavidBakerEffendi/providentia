It's fairly obvious that the two negative reviews here are by the same person with some sort of agenda. Hate to wake you up but Mexican is not Spanish and vice versa. That being said I've only been here once but will definitely be going back. Tasty food, clean and a friendly vibe. Cindrella special quesadilla Â on a fresh made tortilla was great.
