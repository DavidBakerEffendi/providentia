I love Mannino's. When we moved here 11 years ago, we were trying different spots. We went into Mannino's one night and ordered some slices. They have a big display of specialty pizzas and I was saying to my wife I wanted to try the buffalo chicken some day. Joe Maninno came over and gave me a slice to try for free. That tells you everything about the folks who run the place. Ok, now the review. The pizza is great. Plain, sausage, white with broccoli, Scicilian are standards for us and always good. The buffalo chicken is good (I get the one with a creamy sauce...not the fried chicken one...yes, they have two types). Then, there is the Godfather. Ham, vodka sauce, fried chicken, fresh mozzarella.  This thing is out of this world. Pizza is not all they do.  The chicken parm sub is insanely good and I crave it when I've been out of town for a while and away from good Italian food. The sauce is amazing, bright and a hint of sweetness...try it, trust me. Their dinners (Chicken parm and francese are our favorites) are HUGE. Seriously a great value. Obbiously there is a lot of stuff we haven't tried, but the things we have are great. Finally, the people working here are great. They take care of you and they put their heart into it. I know there are probably 6-7 other pizzerias in a 5 minute drive, but for me, Manninos is the tops.
