Not Cuban, not everything with the name cuban is. it smell like old shoes, the place was empty, @ 2pm,. I was there with my son and his friend, the waitress sees us saids you guys can sit Â where ever, no Hello or welcome, I was there 5 years ago, it was jumping, nice service, the owner came to our table to chat with us. Back to the Food. Bland Black Beans, Stale Cuban Sandwich and Bad Salad with brown Avocados. Mariquitas are Plantain chips not long strips, they are served with Mojo pronounce Moho. We got Garlic Sauce the waitress, upset that we asked for Mojo, went to get us some, after we asked for mojo, they told her in the kitchen they only serve Mojo with over Yuca. This Restaurant for the $$ isn't great. Its still pending on a letter Rating. I wonder why????
