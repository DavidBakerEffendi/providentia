I think I could enjoy this place with a sense of irony if I tried really hard.  I do like the fact that they have Heffeweisen on tap.  The weird bouncer dudes made me feel very uncomfortable.   Not too much in the vegan department.  There's ping pong.   On second thought, I'll just stick with Memphis Taproom.
