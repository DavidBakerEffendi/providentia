This past May, I was introduced to a cool guy from San Fran at a friends' wedding in NJ. He had been to Do or Dine the night before, when he stayed in our neck of the urban jungle, and had great things to say. This was also when I was becoming more familiar with this spot via the bigger picture of cable television. I cook all the time, so I really dislike going out to eat and know I could have done the same thing. I really like to eat things I have never considered cooking. Do or Dine fulfills that for me. And then some. Do or Dine still has the awning / umbrella / overhang of a former West Indian spot. Or is it new? Either way, it's an entirely different place. Inside, it's a whole 'nother level. A disco globe hangs in the middle and casts its party bits on our faces, the walls, the subway tile, etc... all while music, much of it 90's hip hop, makes you dance in your seat. The music isn't at a low level, but I could easily carry on a conversation. The tables were somewhat close together, so I did feel a bit like my neighbors were listening in. I'm a big fan of recommendations, but I think it's best to go in there with an open mind and choose something you fancy from the description. I'm pretty sure you will be very happy. i will say this. The Leap Year Special - aka the Frog Legs with Spicy Dr. Pepper Glaze were UNBELIEVABLE and you should take the risk. There are two crispy, sticky, meaty frogger legs that you will inhale. And it really does taste like chicken. There are two big booths for group seating. You could probably fit at least 6 people. Â They can push tables together in other parts. The bar has an impressive look that I want to return to.
