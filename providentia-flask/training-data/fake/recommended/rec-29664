Crepes and wine?!  YES, please!  This place is awesome!   The crepe selection is huge with every possible crepe you could think of.  The menu is split in two - one side has "savory crepes" and one side has "sweet crepes."  After all the options, if you still can't find something you like, they'll concoct a crepe for you.  I couldn't decide between the classic nutella crepe and a Crepe Suzette (orange), so they made me a combination of the two - and it was delectable!
