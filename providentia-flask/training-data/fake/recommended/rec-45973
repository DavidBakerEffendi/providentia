Good- We were on a bus tour and the whole bus went to OUTBACK- we went here as it was in the same strip mall. Our meal was good and we were please with the food and service. I was glad we did our meal here as the other people said their meals across the way was overpriced and not good!!! Our meal was expensive but you are in Burlington -
