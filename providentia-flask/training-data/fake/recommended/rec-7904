I've been here many times, and it's really hit or miss.  If you come on a Sunday afternoon, it's perfect!  If you come on a Saturday night, you'll wonder how a place so big can have such a long line.  If you can hit it at the right time, this place is amazing!  We came by on a Thursday happy hour with a big group, and were accomodated with no problem.  We drank steins of beer by the fire pits outside and ate brats and cabbage.  As a vegetarian, I love that they have both veggie burgers and veggie sausage.  Options always make me happy.  I went for the veggie brat and wasn't disappointed.  The food was delicious.  I also split potato pancakes with my friend.  $6 for 3 cakes was a bit disappointing and weak.  They could have called them hash browns and people would have been offended.  They were good, but small and expensive.  Given the atmosphere of the place, it just didn't fit.  Inside has a pretty cool vibe too.  There are big, long picnic style tables that you can squish all of your friends into- similar to outside, but without the cold.... and the smoky smell that gets into your clothes and hair from the fire pits.  I always find it worthwhile though.  Nothing that a little fabreeze and a shower can't fix. I always leave this place drunk and happy... and this is precisely what keeps me coming back for more.  See you soon Frankford Hall!
