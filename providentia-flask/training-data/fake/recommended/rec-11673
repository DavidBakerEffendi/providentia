The bomb!!! I had the thicker noodles with braised beef.  This was one of the best noodle meals I have ever had.  SO inexpensive and so delicious, I can't wait to go back when I visit Philly again tomorrow! Would def recommend this place. We also ordered the dumplings: the picked pork and chicken curry. Those were 4 stars, not the best dumplings I had but not bad either.  I would stick to ordering the noodles and specialties instead of appetizers. Plus the food is so large that you won't need apps!
