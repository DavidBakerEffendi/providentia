Most likely you've tried this place. I went here a lot with my family, but now as an adult you won't find me there. The pizza, calamari, you name it, is dripping and dripping with a disgusting amount of oil. Also, they have no butter? I never heard of a place that serves bread but no butter. Another totally overrated place. The consistency of the dough is like mush, if you ask for extra cheese it's dumped on practically. I guess everyone has different tastes though when it comes to pizza.
