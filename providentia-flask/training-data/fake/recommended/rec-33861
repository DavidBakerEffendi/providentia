I'm not a big fan of non-salmon colored fish, but when I feel a craving for something different, Dmitri's immediately comes to mind.  This is probably the best place for Mediterranean seafood in all of Philadelphia, and perhaps an even better testament of their culinary prowess is that every time I go, I find myself downing their bluefish so fast that I feel like hurling.  Yes, it's that good. Elbow room is a luxury here, but you'll deal with it.  Service is pretty friendly, and you can choose between a normal table or a seat near the cooking action.  Dmitri's does not take reservations, however, and the lines are always long, so it is best advised to go during non-peak hours (around 5 PM, or after 9 PM). My one major gripe is with the olive oil provided on the tables.  There is a dish of olive oil on every table, and this same dish is used for different groups of patrons.  Maybe I'm just being picky, but for food this good, I would expect them to be less tacky in this area, and a lot more hygienic.
