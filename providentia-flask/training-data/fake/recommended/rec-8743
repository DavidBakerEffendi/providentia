I've been lucky enough to eat at Rao's many times.  It's always GREAT!  The food is just like eating at your Italian American Grandmothers house.  The meatballs are amazing.  Frank Pellegrino welcomes you with a big smile and loves to sing to the whole restaurant.  Nick the Vest has been the bartender forever and he has some funny stories to tell.  If you can get a table at Rao's, you must go.  Good luck!
