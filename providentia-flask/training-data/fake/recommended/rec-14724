Tia Pol is so small you wonder if they chose tapas b/c they couldn't fit regular sized dishes. Went on a recent Wednesday around 7PM and had to wait an hour at the bar for a table.  Lesson learned - get here 6/6:30 if you don't want to wait... All in all, I thought it was good but felt it didn't quite measure up to the hype.  We ordered four dishes: Patatas Bravas (good but found the wedges too big and could've been spicier), Chorizo in Sherry (okay), the Serrano Ham/Artichoke/Manchego dish (very good), and the mixed cheese dish (pretty good). I enjoyed my rioja and the service was admirably pleasant given the pressures of a packed house. I'd go again but only during an off hour when it wasn't packed...
