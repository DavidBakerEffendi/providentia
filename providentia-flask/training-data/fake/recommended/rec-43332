Maybe it was because I came in with such terribly high expectations. But I just didn't feel the food was anything to write home about. I was feeling a small dinner that night and got the soup of the day (a potato leek I believe?) and a side of broccoli rabe. The soup was decent, a bit slightly underseasoned for my taste, but still ultimately very edible. I'm usually a big fan of broccoli rabe, but what I received at Paprika was a bit (that is, a lot) undercooked. I'll make sure to come back and give this place another shot, but at first impression it didn't seem as amazing as what's been previously reviewed. On the bright side, the service was great! Our table abounded with immediate water refills and warm bread for the duration of our meal.
