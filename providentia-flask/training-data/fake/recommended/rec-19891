I came back to this place after missing brunch one week.  The customer device is good. But the wait on a Sat afternoon is kinda long. So get here early. But our waitress, Jillian, was excellent!  She was attentive and available to answer questions. I had the pecan pie French toast. OMG! So good! Sweet greatness! It was like cake for breakfast. The Bellini and mimosas were good. My birthday boo had the Eggs Huntington. Very very good. Our first time having eggs in that manner.   Coffee was good. And we even got a free jelly donut cuz the kitchen was backed up! Overall, the customer service was good and food was good. Only downside is wait time. But it is worth it.
