Came here after reading so many great reviews about the pancakes (momma loves her pancakes!), and to be honest i'm not sure what the hype is all about. this place is very good i loved the banana walnut pancakes which were super filling, but nothing too special. i'd come back if i'm in the area again, maybe. also, cash only! (thankfully there was an atm right across the street woop)
