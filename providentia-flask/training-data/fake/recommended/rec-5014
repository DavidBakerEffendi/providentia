We arrived just after 4 and enjoyed a sidewalk table with an umbrella to protect us from a light shower. Great spot for people watching. We found out we couldn't order ribs until 5 so had a couple of beers with chips and a spicy cheese dip until dinner items could be ordered. The wait was worth it as the ribs were succulent, juicy, slide off the bones good. My son went for the jerk chicken Mac and cheese and said it was comparable to the best he's had. I also have to say the staff was very friendly and helpful.
