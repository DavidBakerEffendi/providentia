The food here was perfectly described by "Meh".  It was not bad, but decidedly not good.  The onion soup was maybe actually bad.  It was watery and lacking flavor but was at least offset by a decent piece of grilled cheese (but really how hard is it to make good grilled cheese?).  Across the board the food looked good, was well presented, but lacked in completeness.  The flavors in each dish were not carefully considered at all, or if they were, unsuccessfully.  This place has potential if a talented chef were brought in to revamp the menu.
