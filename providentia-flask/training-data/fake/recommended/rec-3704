Real rating: 3.5 stars We were lucky to be able to sit in the back section of the restaurant and admire the gorgeous decor. The decor truly blew my mind. Our food consisted of the following: Mac-n-cheese with bacon brought to us directly from the oven --super yummy. Â  The biscuits --to totally come back for! We decided to take other yelpers advice and shared the Country fried steak entree, the steak was awesome, while the mash potatoes were nothing special. My bf's sister who hates cooking, and barely knows how, can make better mashed potatoes than this place delivered. Oh and the hot slaw is something we wish we never tried. The last thing was the corn bread, we were so excited about this until we tasted it. It had a very strange after taste, and a far from enjoyable consistency. A few people here said it may have been too sweet, I believe they made adjustments to the recipe and it's not even a tad sweet, they should revisit their cornbread recipe. When the waitress came to remove our plates from the table, she asked if everything was OK with the cornbread (we left all of it), I told her it had a strange after taste... When the check came, she didn't bother to remove it from the bill. All I'm saying is don't ask if you aren't going to do anything about it. The place is super overpriced, however I'm giving this place another try. Those damn biscuits got me!
