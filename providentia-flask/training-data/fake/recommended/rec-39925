I dined about a week a half ago at Salute on Sunday. The staff, the menu, the nice surroundings are perfect. The people could not have been nicer. The food was spectacular and the wine selections are superb. If you have an occasion and want it to be special then I suggest you consider Salute. You won't regret it.
