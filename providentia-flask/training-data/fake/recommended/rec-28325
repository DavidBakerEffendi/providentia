Hands down, the best Mexican I've had in NYC. Of course, that's not really saying much but De Mole is definitely good. We've been going there since it first open and it was an unofficial BYOB. We moved to Astoria so I don't get back there too much but I think they have a liquor license now. Need to get back there again soon.
