I went there this AM for their signature French Toast and was VERY disappointed. It is Challah French Toast stuffed with cream cheese and banana and covered with a vanilla syrup and fresh Bananas. I expected that the French Toast would be grilled on both sides and then the Cream Cheese would be spread and ooey gooey in the middle. No such luck. They basically made a banana cream cheese challah sandwich and lightly toasted it on the flattop. The bread didn't really have any egg in it, only the outside was warmish and the center part of the bread on both sides was dry and cold and the cream cheese was also cold. Yuck. The syrup was good, but very sparse on the plate. They need to serve it with some syrup on the side. French Toast has a nice texture (or it's supposed to) and the bread shouldn't be dry at all. Their short order chef should come to my house for a lesson in French Toast making. Either that, or their recipe needs to be adjusted and THEY need to learn what good French Toast is. I'll make it myself and save the $10. Â  The coffee was good, though.
