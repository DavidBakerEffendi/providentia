We got two combo plates and made a picnic out of it up on the High Line. The combo plates are generous and reasonably priced ($8), and it's nice being able to try a selection of everything, knowing all the dishes are vegetarian. Our favorite was a very spicy vegetable dish; the curried chickpeas were fantastic as well. We couldn't finish everything but the samosas made delicious snacks the next day.
