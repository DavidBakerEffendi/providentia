I was so disappointed on my last visit/order. I ordered my usual 8 piece chicken.  When I got home I did not see the usual two breast pieces but instead more thighs.   If they ran out of breast they should have said something and if it was a mix up that is truly a bad one...  Who makes  fried chicken for a living and can't tell the difference with pieces?  It was a really upsetting surprise. I also found that the breading on the chicken was alot thicker then usual!  It was really bad that time around and I would have given it two stars if it wasn't for all the other better experiences I've had there. I won't be going back there for a little while.
