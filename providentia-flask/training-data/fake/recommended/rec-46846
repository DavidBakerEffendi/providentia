This is our go to neighborhood place for a close, convenient breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  I have never had a bad experience or a bad meal here, and I've been there more times than I remember.  My only complaint is they are extremely stingy with their ketchup.  They bring it in a tiny metal cup that is usually about a 1/3 full.  Just bring me the bottle please:). The prices are very reasonable for the neighborhood.  I recommend it.
