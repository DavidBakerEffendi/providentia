Ironically, for a place called "Noodle House," the noodle soup here is probably one of the worst things to order. I guess the noodle part only stands for pad thai or similar type of stir-fry noodles. One thing that is good is the bubble tea. The other is the stir-fry vegetarian dishes. Their coconut flavored bubble tea is pretty great.
