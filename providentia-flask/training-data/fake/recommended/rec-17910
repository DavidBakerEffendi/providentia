My husband and I went back to Fernandes (Newark) on April 13th.  We made reservations 2 days prior.  Parking lot was full, but valet service took our car immediately.   We were seated promptly and were brought our drinks order within minutes.   One thing NOT listed on the menu but is absolutely fantastic is their "steak on a tile".  It's a filet mignon cooked on a spanish style roof tile (literally a roof tile).  Your steak starts cooking on the grill in the kitchen for a few short minutes and then is brought to your table to finish cooking on the tile over a sterno.  The waiter cuts the HUGE steak into smaller pieces to cook faster.  My husband and I shared this 16oz steak...he likes it medium-rare and I like it medium-well...and we were both able to determine when we were satisfied with the length of cooking.  The tile is left on the table with burner and garlic butter to continue cooking.  It is absolutely delicious!!   In addition to the steak for 2 (you can order it just for one also), a glass of wine and a small pitcher of Spanish Sangria, our order came to $58.00.  We did not order appetizers or dessert. We were also told that they opened a new restaurant in South Amboy on Rt35 North.... just north of the drawbridge.  We stopped in the other night just to see the interior... and it is absolutely beautiful.  We made dinner reservations for Mother's Day... and I can't wait to eat that steak on a tile again. A great view of their menu (with prices) can be found at allmenus.com/nj/newark/2….  We were told that anything that Fernandes serves is available at their new location. We HIGHLY recommend Fernandes for their outstanding food and service.  I'll let you know how their new location - La Marina - is after Mother's Day....unless I see you there.  You won't miss us....we'll be the noisy group of 10 at 5pm
