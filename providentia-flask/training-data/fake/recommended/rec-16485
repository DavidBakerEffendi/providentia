Made a reservation night of, but made it for the next night by mistake! Hostess was pretty friendly, and booked me a table when I got there for within 20 minutes, in the meantime, my boyfriend and I had a drink at the bar. I had one of their signature (more strawberry-flavored) cocktails. When the server took my order, she volunteered to include a different type of alcohol instead as it was "much tastier." Of course, I wanted it to be tasty - so I did! However, when we later paid, we found she up-charged for the other alcohol, which wasn't too cool. This place is always great - huge, fun people watching and attentive service. Had the brussel sprouts - such great unique flavor with everything they mix in, cauliflower - perfectly cooked and eggplant "chips" - love these and want to know how they make them! Also had the chocolate souffle - it was delicious and rich (and fun how they serve it with such presentation), but a bit pricey at $18.
