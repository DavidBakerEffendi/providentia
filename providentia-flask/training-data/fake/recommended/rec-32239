Sketch Burger is a little on the expensive side, and since we ordered delivery through diningin the menu prices were roughly a dollar higher automatically. However, it was DELICIOUS and we will order for lunch again. All the sandwiches had a choice of special sauces, although only one person chose one. I got the Dr Pepper Pulled Pork sandwich. It was jam packed full of meat and whatever the sauce is had a nice little kick to it. Everyone in our office chose something different. Turkey Burger with horseradish cheddar and avocado. She said it was not overly seasoned and very good. Smashed Onion burger with horseradish cheddar and chipotle sauce. He said the onions were just sauteed and placed first on the bun, so they made the bun very greasy. Otherwise he really enjoyed it. Beef burger with american cheese. At first he was skeptical, because he did not want "sauce" on his burger. However, the sauce ended up being the cheese melted into a sauce-texture. He ate his burger without the bun, because the buns are very heavy and extra filling. The fries were mediocre, not great but also not bad. They came in a paper bag, which is good so they did not get too soggy on the drive. We were all stuffed after our lunch and ready for a nap.
