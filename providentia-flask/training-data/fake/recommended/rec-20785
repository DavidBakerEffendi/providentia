I caught this spot while driving w my hubby and just had to go in...was not expecting what we saw...homemade pasta...Mascarpone cheese from Italy prices just amazing. The highlight of the day was we came when they were service shrimp scampi for lunch, crab cakes, tilapia, breaded shrimp. The shrimp are sooooo big!!! U had to open your mouth wide....and that marinara sauce was on hit!!! OMG. It had a sweet hot kick to it that just went w everything we had. We were dipping it like crazy Then my hubby had the cheesecake and I had the homemade pecan pie. I tell ya! They do NOT skimp on the food. The pecans were big and roasted the cheesecake must have been mixed w mascarpone as well. Just melted in your mouth. Just Devine!!! Until I hear of something better this is our go to Italian deli. BTW we live in New York City...what-ev-verrr. We r so still driving here.
