Absolutely delicious!! And so reasonably priced! Their breakfast portions are very generous. My friend and I got their scrambled eggs on a biscuit and they had to be the best eggs we've ever had in a restaurant. The biscuit was also cooked fresh from scratch and was so flaky and moist. Dying to go back here!
