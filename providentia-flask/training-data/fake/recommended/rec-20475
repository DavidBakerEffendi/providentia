Have been craving a good roast beef recently and had it on my mind when I headed to Philly today. I said as long as we are going to be there, let's get DiNic's for lunch. Ok, here it goes...........they are located in the Reading Terminal Market which is a maze of various food concessions and produce vendors. Parking is not something easily come by in this area bordering China Town. We did luck out and find a spot close by and ventured in. We were starving at this point and headed straight for DiNic's. There was a decent sized line already for orders to go. Just as we approached, some people got up from the small section of stools they have wrapped around the counter. We happily took our seats. Although I had been craving roast beef, I wasn't sure if I should go with to pork or the beef. Finally decided to stick with my instincts and get the roast beef.  I got mine with the sharp provolone.  After a few minutes, our sandwiches were served and looked pretty good. Good size too. Were they good?? Yes......Were they great?.......NO.  The meat itself wasn't very flavorful and WAAAAAAAAY overcooked!! Let me tell you something......if roast beef isn't at the very least a little pink, then don't bother!!  Kind of like a well done filet mignon......it shouldn't be!! I love sharp provolone, but to me it overpowered what little flavor the meat had. Have to say I was kind of disappointed, not that it wasn't  good, just that it wasn't THAT good!   Now if you ever want to try an insanely delicious roast beef sandwich, make your way over to Brooklyn, NY and head to Brennan & Carr. I know the Philly people may never admit it (lol) , but they will make you forget all about Tommy D's!!!
