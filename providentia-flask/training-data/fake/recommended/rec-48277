I took a huge chance and selected this as a dining date with a friend who lives in NY when I was out in NJ on a business trip. I wanted something interesting, ethnic, vegetarian friendly and somewhere halfway where I was staying and where she lives. So, after seeing some high Yelp reviews, I made the executive decision to go here. I was NOT disappointed. The meal was absolutely delicious. The flavors were amazing. My vegetarian sampler meal was so flavorful and executed well. The waitress was nice and helpful. I wouldn't mind coming back next time I'm in town!
