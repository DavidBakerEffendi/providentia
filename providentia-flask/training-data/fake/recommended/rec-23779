Came here with a friend for lunch and i really liked it! It's a small bar area with a laid back feel. Decent taps, i'm not a beer snob though, so i can't fairly judge that. The food was really good! I had the grilled ham and cheese on a pretzel with friends and it totally hit the spot. Our bartender was Ryan, (i'm pretty sure that was his name) and he was a nice guy! Let us taste test the beer's we wanted to try and all. I'd definitely stop back for lunch!
