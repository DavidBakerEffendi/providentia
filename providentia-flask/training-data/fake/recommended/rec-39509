I already ate the roast pork sandwich with provolone and hot Italian peppers twice, and I was only in town for a few days!  Everything about this sandwich is a good idea.  The bread is perfect:  crispy on the outside, soft on the inside to help soak up some of the delicious pork au jus.  The pork is hot, thinly sliced, juicy, and has the perfect balance of seasonings.  The provolone is shredded, and is at the bottom so the heat from the meat and juices melt it into the bread.  And the hot peppers?  AMAZING.  This is proof that simple is tastiest, and if you're not a pork lover, trust me, you will be after your first bite!
