I like the Kite quite a bit. Friendly staff, and knowledgeable about their beers and cocktails. The owners are usually mingling in the crowd on most evenings, which is cool to see. They seem to care about the place and really "get" beer. So it gives the sense that this isn't just a business to them it's a passion. Which is cool to see. Food selection has always been strange here. Flatbreads, burgers, & muscles are the favorites by far for everyone. But I can't speak highly enough of their specials. Every time I'm handed that specials menu I order something from it and am always glad I did. When the Cuban sandwich is available, I encourage everyone to order it. It's fantastic!
