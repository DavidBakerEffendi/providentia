I almost do not want to write this review because then the jig is up, but in all honesty this place deserves all the stars in the world. Sooooooo good and I'm not even exaggerating. My friend introduced me to this spot a few years ago and I've been going ever since. The empanadas are made on the spot and are super fresh and hot... and oozing with cheeeeeese. My favorite has to be the Hawaiian. Pineapple, ham and cheese... Can't go wrong.Oh with the pink sauce! (What is that stuff?) LOVE the pink sauce. I crave these empi's so often I'm practically here every week. Their empanadas are not like let's say Mama's Empanadas or Mr. Pollo. These are the real deal made with love. The prices are nothing to complain about either! Winnaaaaaaah
