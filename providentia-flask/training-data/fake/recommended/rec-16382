I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE. BUT! I arrived with a friend after seeing a show for some post show nomnoms and we were denied service even though they didn't close for another 40 MINUTES!!! Needless to say, I will think twice about going back to my favorite Thai place. P.S. Yum Yum 3 happily accommodated us
