It is so unfortunate because everyone has been telling me good things about this place. I found a dead bug, most likely a cockroach in my hashbrown. Although it was dead, it's eyes and furry legs were so disgusting. Only good thing was the staffs were understanding and did not charge for the meal. It is going to be a long time before I return to this place...Eeck!!
