This place has excellent meat, generous portions, and perfect prices...what more can you ask for from a deli?  The Russian dressing could use some work, but since the coleslaw is so good, and because the meat doesn't need much help -- this can slide.  It was my first time, so they let me try samples of pastrami and corned beef -- both delicious.  The place is a dive, but does not matter for lunch!
