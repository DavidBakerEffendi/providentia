I had to try the famous Chicken and Rice cart that I had heard so much about. On one sunny, summer day, I knew the time was right. When I arrived at 53rd and 6th, I first had to figure out which of many trucks was the right truck. FYI, it's the truck on the southwest corner. Once I marked the spot, I walked up to the truck, asked for chicken and rice, accepted the suggested white sauce and spicy sauce, took a seat near Central Park, and dug in. Survey says? Delicious! White sauce is a must. Spicy sauce is VERY spicy, but a little dab is worth it. It's only $6 for a plate and the plate is huge! Great as a late-night snack, cheap mid-day meal, or meal on the go!
