So, I'm usually a fan of the Taiwanese-type hotpot (note: the difference is in the broth of the non-spicy side and the spices used for the spicy side). But since there doesn't seem to be one in NY (there are a lot of those in LA), Mister Hotpot is really the next best thing. I'm so glad to have found it because FINALLY I can satisfy my craving for spicy hotpot!! I will ONLY eat hotpot with people who appreciate intestines and pig's blood. The one thing that is probably better than the hotpot restaurants in LA would be how soft and flavorful the pig's intestines are! We had to order 2 of those intestines because it was SO GOOD! I also really enjoyed the broth (if you get the split pot one) of the non-spicy side. Even though I like the spicy side more and tend to cook more of my food on that side, I will still put some ingredients on the non-spicy side because it makes the soup so much better in the end. The broth they use has a milky white color because it's probably cooked with beef/pork bone marrow for long periods of time and it is soo flavorful. (the taiwanese ones usually use fermented vegetables soup as soup base). Can't say which I like better since both are really good :) There is something magical about their hotpot because i keep wanting to go back and order those intestines!! (okay I think I have proven enough that I'm indeed a zombie with my intestine talk haha)
