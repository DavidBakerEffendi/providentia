I have a weakness for french fries as it is and have always wanted to experience belgian fries.  This place was so good! When you first come across it, it has a huge line out the door (but goes relatively quick) and looks like a small greasy hole in the wall.  the frites are perfectly cooked, crispy and with the right amount of mealyness in the center.  they are cooked in small batches so you always get "fresh fries". I had the roasted garlic mayo which was ok but the Vietnamese pineapple mayo was definitely the way to go! creamy with just a hint of sweetness and a little bit of cilantro.  Would go again, but alone...so I dont have to share this time :)
