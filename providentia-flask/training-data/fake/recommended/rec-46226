Lupa is good but not great. We ordered carbonara and buccatini. The pasta was aldente which I loved but the pasta was also stuck together in clumps which is the worst possible thing when it comes to pasta. Id expect that from olive garden not a mario battali restaurant.  The carbonara was very tasty and so was the buccatini. My husband order pollo diavlo which was delicious and probably thr moistest chicken ive ever tasted. I ordered the saltimbocca which was good but I wasn't blown away.  The veal was very tender but the flavor was lacking. The veal was also served as a complete circle. It looked very unappetizing and like I was eating a huge mushroom. The aervice was very good and the waitress was very knowledgeable. I appreciate the fact that menu is in Italian and its authentic, but it is very annoying to have to turn the menu over to the glossary to see an english description of the food.
