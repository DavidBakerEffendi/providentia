This place is pure perfection when it comes to panini's. I have loved every sandwich I have gotten here (with the exception of the Fontina because I don't like truffle oil, but that's my own fault for ordering it and thinking they'd go light on the oil). My favorite will always be the roast chicken with mozzarella, arugula and spicy mayo. Eating at this restaurant is great as you can sit indoors or outdoors in their garden and the wait staff is pleasant. Ordering is also great as their delivery is pretty quick and the food has always arrived hot. The only "wish" I can think of is that I wish I was able to get chips or a side with my sandwich. However, their portions are always generous so they can stand alone as far as filling you up goes. All in all an awesome spot, and a must visit if you're in Astoria and craving a panini.
