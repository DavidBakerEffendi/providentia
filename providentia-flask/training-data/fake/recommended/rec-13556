Went for brunch this afternoon and while I wasn't repulsed, I certainly would never go back.  There were only two servers in the entire restaurant and every table was filled, so the service was a bit slow.  This didn't bother me because I wasn't in a rush but can imagine it could be a problem for some.  I had the Green Eggs with Quinoa Hash Brown and greens.  The eggs arrived cold but the quinoa was delectable.  I also ordered a mint lemonade which was refreshing and had me wishing summer would get here ASAP.  My friend ordered the eggs on challah bread and it was pretty good, that is, in comparison to my meal.  I wouldn't say don't visit but perhaps brunch isn't their strong suit....
