Fork is great place for lunch with your friends.  The dining room is beautiful, and even with the open kitchen (which we were sitting next to), you could easily converse with table mates.  I was pleasantly surprised to find an exciting cocktail menu.  I had the Lemongrass Lemonade that was perfect refreshment for a hot day.  It was more "lemon" than "lemongrass", but still delicious.  Another diner had a rhubarb drink that I thought was best described as "what Anthropologie would taste like if it were a cocktail".  Go and have one to see what I mean.  For my meal, I had the salmon burger, which tasted great.  I had asked for a side of the sea-salt malt vinegar potato chips, and discovered that they weren't really salt and vinegar chips, but rather, dusted with malt vinegar powder.  If you crave the acidy taste of salt and vinegar chips, you'll be disappointed.  Another diner had risotto and loved it.  For desert, I did three small bites: the brownie, the profiterole and the semifreddo.  All three were delicious.
