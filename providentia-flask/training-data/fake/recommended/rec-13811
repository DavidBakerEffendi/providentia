we came here on a sunday at 2 am and there was no line!  we got the combo plate to share which worked out perfectly since i don't like lamb and my bf didn't love the chicken.  the white sauce and spicy sauce is amazing but be careful not to pour too much on even though you think you may be macho.  this hot sauce has a lingering effect that burns your stomach. i've had friends who poured a lot on thinking it was bbq sauce and all they could say was "too spicy too spicy too spicy!"  definitely worth the $6!
