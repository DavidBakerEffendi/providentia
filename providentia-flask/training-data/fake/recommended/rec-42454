We didn't realize that they had a parking lot in the back, so we parked across from the restaurant on a side street. Inside is a very cozy atmosphere. I heard that they have live music some nights and would like to return for that. Everything was delicious. The fresh mozzarella on the caprese appetizer was out of this world. My boyfriend ordered the special lasagna which was absolutely perfect as well! Next time I come I am going to order a steak for sure! For dessert be sure to order the lemon cake and a cappuccino... a perfect ending!
