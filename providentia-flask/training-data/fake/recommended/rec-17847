Chicken and gyro mix. Extra EXTRA white sauce, Extra Extra Extra hot sauce. They give you a lot so technically it's enough to share, but who would want to anyway? This is just one little review among the thousand 5 stars.  Remember, there are 3-4 locations just across the street from each other, and they're ALL the halal guys.  Don't make the noobie mistake of going to the longest line because they're all the same place, just different corners.  But don't mistaken, there's only ONE (or 3) Halal Guys and you can only get it at this corner. Don't get the imposters. It's NOT the same, AND they don't give you as much either.
