The decor and atmosphere is best part about this place...disco balls, fun music, great vibe.  The group that I went with seemed to really enjoy the food.  We ordered spring rolls for the table (pretty good) and I ordered red curry (of course) which was also pretty good.  The price didn't break the bank which is always a plus.
