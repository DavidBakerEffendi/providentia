Came here for dinner with a friend.  She made me pick the place in this area since she was coming in from out of town and going somewhere nearby.  I figured I couldn't go wrong with picking Italian. I really liked the atmosphere of the place, almost like you could make it into anything you wanted - romantic, friendly, group setting - very relaxed and welcoming. I got a salad to start, which was good and then the whole wheat pasta (which, as a HUGE pasta fan, I'm usually not such a fan of whole wheat) with vegetables, oil and garlic.  I was very impressed.  I think I cleared my plate, which is extremely rare for me at a restaurant (at home it's another story).  Though it could have been because the portions were pretty small.  I was a little disappointed with that, but the prices aren't bad. For this area, I'd say it is a massive step up from the bar food that's all around and it's a good place fora date, friends, family, etc.
