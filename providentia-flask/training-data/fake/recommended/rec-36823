Decent but not stellar place for standard French bistro fare. The cassoulet was tasty but runny and had a lot of fat floating on it - they should have skimmed it in the pot. The seafood gratin was a 1950s dish with a glob of sauce over it - it tasted okay but lacked salt and didn't blow me away. The warm octopus salad stood out and was very tasty. The escargots were okay as a standard dish but not stellar. The Tournedos was very good. Service was very friendly. BYOB - make sure you bring your own wine bottles!
