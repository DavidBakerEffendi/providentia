It's pretty much all been said on here already, but here goes....crust is as good as any I've had. Just simple, tasty, coal fired oven perfection. Love that they have 2 different size pies to choose from. 3 of us opted to order a few of the smaller pies so we could sample more. The classic pie was very good. Not sure I'd call it the best in NY, but it was really good. My favorite was the Speck pie. Basically a regular pie with crispy speck and some shaved parmagiano.  I loved the bite and saltiness of the speck and Parm. We also had a white pie with truffle pâté, mushrooms, prosciutto and a balsamic reduction. Great combo, however I would have preferred some ricotta cheese on there. All in all, top notch nyc pizza. The rave reviews are pretty much on point.
