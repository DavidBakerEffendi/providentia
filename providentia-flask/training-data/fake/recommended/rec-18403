I love sushi at Zento.  This place is in my neighborhood and we go here almost weekly.  I felt compelled to Yelp about it because I want to see this place succeed.  Food is always fantastic and I love that you can get brown rice with your sushi.  Some faves are spicy tuna with brown rice, seaweed salad, Branzino roll, Mexican Roll, tempura tofu, broiled salmon and eel sashimi.  BYOB, prices are very reasonable.  Staff is very nice and restaurant decor is well done.  Also my go-to for take out.
