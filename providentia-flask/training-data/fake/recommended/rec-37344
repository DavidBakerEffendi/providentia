Charming little place in the middle of nowhere in Bensonhurst. You'll miss it if you walk to fast. Staff is attentive but not overwhelming, just the right amount of service for a small place. Food is excellent, fresh, and very tasty. Salads are fresh as well. Panini is large enough to be shared. I shared a Panini and a Crepe and was full. Overall a cute little place to stop by for lunch or a snack.
