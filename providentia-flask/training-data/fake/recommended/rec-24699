Very good for the vegetarian...(or pescatarian) I loved the hummus, the bread and olives in the beginning. there was a special seafood risotto one night and it was very good. There is good wine, a good vibe to the place and it has delivered twice that i've been there. Small, unpretentious, good food for the cost. Â I will def be back! =)
