I had brunch at Marc Forgione for the first time a couple of weeks ago with 3 friends. I was expecting a wonderful culinary experience, but it was negative from start to finish and I certainly will not be returning. The hosts were pretentious and the food was average at best. Their "eggs benny" was one of the worst takes on an eggs Benedict that I have ever had. Imagine a bland cylinder of potatoes with a water-logged egg on top that was not adequately poached. It had zero flavor, no texture, and poor presentation.You may think that a delicious cut of Canadian bacon or prosciutto will be the saving grace, but instead, what you get is a shriveled morsel of some nondescript crunchy "meat" that is less than half a bite. As a true connoisseur of eggs Benedict and and a lover of good brunches, I can say that this was a despicable attempt at one of the great classics.
