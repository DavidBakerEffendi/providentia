I'm sort of obsessed with El Camino Real lately. Why? It might be the fried pickles, which are amazing and one of my favorite things to eat, ever. It might be the margaritas, which are quickly moving up my "best margaritas in Philly" list. It could be the gooey cheese enchiladas, topped with a fried egg (everything's better with fried eggs on top). Maybe it's the tender beef brisket, with a mix of the spicy and sweet sauces drizzled on top. But why try to justify an obsession when I could just indulge in it instead? Yum.
