the place was great but out wait time was quite long. when we got there we put our names on a list and we waited for a bout 30 minutes before we were seated and bunch of other groups got to go ahead of us. their pizza is alright. I've had better. the pizza barley has any sauce on it. the mozzarella pizza was really good though. it is very Â thin crust pizza and burnt which i am not a big fan of. overall this place was only okay.
