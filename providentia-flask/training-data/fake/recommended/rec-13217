The pork buns are great. The special fried pork appetizer is also very good. i've tried almost all the ramen dishes and it was pretty good. the bad: Don't even think about going here if you're hungry immediately.   They don't take reservations.  Wait depending on the people is between 45min - 2 hours.  At the end of the day, there are plenty of other restaurants that serve ramen.  It is after all just noodles. the hostess is not always accurate on the timing of the wait, but that varies on timing. I would suggest a very early or very late dinner.  6:30-9pm is the WORST time to go, unless of course you have nothing to do for 2 hours, but wait for noodles.
