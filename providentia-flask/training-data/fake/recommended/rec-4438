In a nutshell, NIXS is everything I've been wanting in Hartford. A lovely, low-lit lounge area with fabulous cocktails and a completely inviting ambiance. I've only been here a few times (most recently this evening for a few drinks) and unfortunately can't comment on the food yet (must come back to try!) but I'm all about the vibe here and can't stop lusting over those damn gorgeous light fixtures. I attended NIXS soft opening a while back and was able to sample a few cocktails but recently have been stuck on the Bazzle Dazzle with gin, peach stirrings, muddles basil, simple syrup and meyer lemon juice. They've also got a selection of housemade bottled cocktails! All in all, a perfect addition to Front Street, and I can't wait to come back for a full meal!
