What a great dinner! When I travel, the first thing I do after finding a hotel is to see if there is a Spanish restaurant nearby. I went to Costa del Sol tonight in the hopes that is was good enough for me to go back tomorrow for a second meal. It was, and I am eager to try new dishes tomorrow night! The bread with jamon sounds so simple, but was so divine. I haven't had a Caldo Gallego since I was in northern Spain years ago, and it was also wonderful.  The gambas al ajillo was also very good. One thing to be aware of, if you like sweet sangria, then you're going to love the red sangria. I don't happen to care for sweetness, so tomorrow night, I'll stick with red wine. Yummy flan for dessert, but the servings for the main meal were so large (bigger than most tapas places) that I brought most of it back to the hotel. I agree with the other reviewers about the parking situation. Very tiny spaces, but that has nothing to do with the quality of the food.  I had a wonderful serving person, actually several people. All very pleasant and personable.
