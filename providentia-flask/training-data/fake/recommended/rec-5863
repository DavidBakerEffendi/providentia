Went here on a whim one night while roaming south street with my friend, and I must say I wasn't impressed at all. The people we were meeting there absolutely loved this place, I on the other hand, felt very out of place here. I felt like my wardrobe stuck out since I had forgotten my cardigan, jean skirt, and hollister polo in my other bag. The only good thing is I don't think the drinks were terribly expensive, but I was too drunk to care at this point. Sadly, at that time I had quit smoking so I couldn't even go outside to get away. probably won't go back...
