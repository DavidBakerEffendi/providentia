This place is not overrated! LET'S KEEP THE HYPE GOING! The steak salmon with the lemon potatoes is the bomb! What doesn't hurt like a bomb? The prices for food at this place (during lunch time)! I ate at this place with my mom during the afternoon and everything we ordered came out to around $25. The problem? The wait! My mom and I had to wait around 30 minutes to be seated and there is not much space to stand around in this restaurant. The restaurant is very small too! In fact, this restaurant has an outdoor section that is converted into an indoor section in the winter season. I was actually escorted to the converted area to be seated, but it was cold in there. There are light fixtures high above the tables in the converted area to keep customers warm, but the heat from the light burns the head after a while! I give this place a go though. Cheap, good food! P.S. Don't eat here for dinner because some of the dishes served at this place costs more money in the evening/night. Check the website for details.
