My cousin took me here for dinner while I was in NYC. He said it is one of the best restaurants in NYC, so good the chefs come to eat here after their shift. We started with a dozen oysters. We had 6 east coast and 6 west coast. The east coast definitely came out as the winner here. Then we had Moules in White wine and the very famous Bone Marrow & Oxtail Marmalade. I think I cleaned the plate, if I could I would have sucked the bone dry of all the marrow. For the mains I went for the Rack of Lamb Spinach, Potato Cake and Thyme. This was all cooked well. The meal was good but I can only really gush about the Bone Mow and how perfect it was. I've seen they have a restaurant in Las Vegas, so I will definitely be making a little pit stop when I go.
