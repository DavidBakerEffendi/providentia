I am a huge pizza eater and since i was in nyc i thought i might read some yelp reviews and find a really good pizza place. First of all there is about 3 seats in the entire place, it is small. Also the prices are crazy, $3 for a plain slice and a large pie was almost double what i would normally pay at home. I get that its nyc and tourists and such, but a complete rip off for decent pizza is not cool. Not much sauce and really thin, it was decent. Super small.
