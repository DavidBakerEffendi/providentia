If I were to ever open a dive bar, I'd walk into Rudy's with a digital camera and a notebook. This place is so *dive* that it seems orchestrated. This is an old, neighborhood bar that in the past 15 or so years has become overrun by artists and hipsters. There's still the "neighborhood" contingent, to keep the "dive" status intact, but as the night goes on, white belts and track bikes outnumber fire department t-shirts. Somewhat recently purchased by a Belgian ex-pat, they've seen a shift that has brought them amazing Frites (with the prerequisite 30 or so dipping sauces) and an extensive beer list that could make Delaney's jealous. Beer snobs have their choice of glassware, and beer slobs can still get pitchers of PBR or the High Life. Their live bands can be hit or miss, but I can't count the number of bands I've seen there that now garner $40 tickets elsewhere. The jukebox isn't as cool as it used to be -- bartenders would make mix CDs -- it had everything -- but it's still worth sinking a few hard earned singles into.
