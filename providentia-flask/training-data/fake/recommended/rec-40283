Awful.  We were in town to see the nephew in the Princeton Harvard game .  We all came from different cities and wanted to have a dinner together before heading home.  The hostess was as dumb as a bag of hammers and tried to seat 11 of us at.a small round table.  We asked for a larger table .We were told that it was reserved(we had reservations as well).  The food was attractively presented and not bad.  I don't think it was great it was not unusually good, it was slightly better than what you.might get at one of those places in the mall that passes out free samples of Bourbon chicken. The decor was the typical shiny black  and fake cinnabar motif that is pleasant enough to us westerners when the food and service are good when it is as poor as this place was it is cheesy and annoying....which is what I found my dining experience here to be.  I would not come back or recommend it to anyone whom I considered not be a friend.  P.S.  The people who had reserved the table we. couldn't  have NEVER showed.  so we had meh food at a.crappy table for a.lot.of money.  Nah  won't go back EVER....
