I've had their pizza a number of times and have also had a sit-down dinner with my wife.  The food is good, and the pizza is really good.  Above average for sure.  My only complaint is that the dinner menu is a bit pricier than comparable restaurants, but it's nothing that should keep you away from trying the place.
