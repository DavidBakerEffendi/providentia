Yum, Yum, Yum. I went with a small group for a birthday party. We split 6 tapas which I though I would be hungry after, but was wonderfully surprised to feel full. To start the pomegranate margarita was delish as well as potent. I am super picky about empanadas, but the mixed sampler (I think pork, seafood, and chicken) was soooo good. The plaintain filled with pork was also excellent. I almost wanted to order one just for me. We also got some desert (churros) which were a nice ending to the meal. Overall, I was very pleased and will be visiting again soon!
