Let me say I have had Mexican food all over the country and yes the West Coast and state bordering Mexico obivously have a hand up....However, trust that the food at this place has its flavors in order. Not sure what other people are getting who left bad reviews but I found the food to be quit tastey:)  and the atmosphere to be very New york but also very festive!! Me and my gilrs went  and we really did enjoy ourselfs, we went for Brunch and it was good.  However, the star of the day was the SANGRIA!!!  It was delicious but it have could be a lil stronger (my lushness is showing) but still good!!! I will return maybe next time for dinner
