This is hands down, the best place to eat in the city - well Italian food, okay, specifically, the gnocchi! This was the first place I Yelped in the city when I first visited and I have to say, I have frequented this place more than once - which says a lot when you live in a city that allows you to try something new every day. They don't take reservations and in the winter the place seats a little more than forty, small but lively atmosphere. When my friends and I first came to New York a few years ago, we were cramped in the corner of the restaurant and it was winter, so we wanted something hearty. I ordered the spinach, Gorgonzola gnocchi while my friends ordered meatballs and spaghetti. This was probably the best gnocchi I've had, potato pillows that melt in your mouth, with a creamy, cheesy sauce that envelopes them. Add a hint of crushed red pepper and you're golden. Since then, I've brought all my friends from out of town and they have loved the spot! Plus, in the summer they open up the restaurant so you can sit outside and soak in the summer sun. P.S. they only take cash! Come ready to eat!
