The food was great - they're known for their breakfasts, specifically the pancakes, but I had a chicken sandwich and it was delicious! We had to wait, but just short of 10 minutes on a Thursday during lunch time. It was crowded and the space is tight, so don't expect to have private conversations. Service was fine.
