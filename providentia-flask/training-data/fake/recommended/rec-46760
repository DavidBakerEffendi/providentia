I've been here a number of times and the food and service are outstanding. Every dish I've had from steak and chicken to their beat salad was fantastic. The preparation technique is superb and flavor combination unique and delicious. The wine selection is also very good. The service is also very prompt and friendly which is what I expect from a pricey restaurant. And they aren't pretentious. The only reason they don't get 5 stars from me is because it's VERY pricey for a non-fine dining establishment. People are "west village casual" and the atmosphere matches that so I'm not sure what's with the michelin-level of pricing.
