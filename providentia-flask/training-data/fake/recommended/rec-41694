I can't fathom why this place has such a strong following. The restaurant itself has a nice decor and although I did not have a beer, the list did seen extensive and unique. Those are the only positives I can come up with.... The sausages are over priced hot dogs- while I was eating at the counter I saw the "chef" pull out a package of national brand hot dogs that would be available at any supermarket. I was horrified that I was paying the exorbitant amount that was being charged for hot dogs I could have thrown on the grill in my back yard or picked up at any 4th of July frat party BBQ. In addition, the manner wafers that are being offered for "dessert" should be deserted. Once again, a packaged good that could be bought at the market on the corner but you are able to pay triple the price at this establishment- lucky you! Lastly, the waitstaff was very strange and intrusive adding to an already uncomfortable and off-beat (not the positive way you may expect of a local Brooklyn spot) atmosphere. Needless to say, there is much left to be desired.
