Sawatdee is a classic Philly BYOB. It's a small place, but we made reservations for a Saturday night at 7:30 for 4 people and it wasn't crowded at all. The dishes are of good size - I shared the spring rolls appetizer and pad see ew moo entree with my sister and it was enough for the both of us. Both dishes were delicious. If you want a cute spot to go with friends or on a date, this place is perfect. They didn't even charge us a corking fee for two bottles of wine! The servers could have been a bit more attentive, but I think they were understaffed and it didn't put a damper on the experience for us. I would definitely come back here!
