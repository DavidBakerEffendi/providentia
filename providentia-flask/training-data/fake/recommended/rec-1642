So, I heard about this rivalry between Geno's Steaks and Pats which are located across from each other. I decided to try both to determine for myself which is better. Let's get one thing straight... In order for a rivalry to exist your sandwiches must be somewhat good. While on the quest to find the best cheese steak I found the two worst. At Genos, The bread was hard and meat was bland. The atmosphere was not very inviting either. I didn't expect to see signs stating "I want my country back" (not sure who took it from him) and "press 1 for English 2 for Deportation". After seing these signs and being of Mexican decent, I wouldnt doubt if someone spit in my sandwich. The staff didn't seem friendly at all. Geno's seems more like a tourist attraction than anything. If you still have an itch to try them just to check for yourself, I recommend splitting a sandwich with someone and then head to Tony Lukes.
