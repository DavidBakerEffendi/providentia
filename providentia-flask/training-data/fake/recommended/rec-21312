I was absolutely blown away by this restaurant, and I am a pretty picky eater.  First off the decor makes you feel like you're in a 5 star restaurant.  The ceilings are high, the atmosphere is chic, and there's like this cool box design on the ceiling if I remember correctly.  Marvelous!  There's even a tip jar for the bathroom attendant, so it gives you an idea of how nice this place is. Food wise, this place was one of the best I've had in NYC.  There's a lot of crazy exotic Mediterranean dishes, a deviation from the usual gyro-souvlaki-hummus-falafel that you see at most Mediterranean places.  I came with a party of 6 and we got a lot of dishes. 1) The beef dumplings turned out to be these really really tiny dumplings with some sauce.  The dumplings were probably like the size of a quarter, and I had hoped that these would be larger.  But they were still good. 2) The brussel sprouts were AMAZING.  They were cooked slightly crispy and had amazing flavor.  I don't even like brussel sprouts that much but they cooked it very well here. 3) The duck schwarma was yummy, but I can't remember what it tasted like.  It tasted better than my Chicken Shish Taouk!! 4) The eggplant dish had very thinly sliced eggplant.  I'm not a huge fan of eggplant but my friend said it was quite possibly the best eggplant he has ever had. 5) Chicken Shish Taouk was slightly disappointing - the chicken was so so and I was expecting more from the sauce but I didn't really taste anything.  The other dishes overshadowed this one by a mile. 6) Lahmajeen (pita with lamb) was really really flavored well.  LOVED IT.  They came in these cone-shaped pita.  I would definitely get this if you like pita + meat. Also, the yogurt/cheese dish they leave on the table in the beginning is spectacular.  It kind of tastes like glorified cream cheese but it was so yummy. Total for 6 people came out to be around $180 with tax and tip.
