Hmmmm--I must have eaten in a different place than the other reviewers.  Hostess was not at her place when we arrived--and when we walked in, she was less than enthusiastic in her greeting.  The space is nice--4 of us were seated in a nice booth.  Our waiter was very energetic and informative--although maybe a little too enthusiastic in his recommendations.  He mixed up the orders at our table.  While I appreciate the concept, the burgers were ordinary.  And expensive.  The onion rings were good, but not great.  It took about 20-25 minutes to get our food,  and just as long to get dessert--vegan carrot cake and chocolate shake.  Our waiter made several excuses for the kitchen--for instance, it was the chef's first time making the carrot cake.  Seriously? Overall, this place has a long way to go in my opinion, and I don't think that I would return.   The staff are dressed casually--bordering on sloppy.  Our bill totaled over $75 plus tip--way too much for mediocre burgers and a couple of desserts.
