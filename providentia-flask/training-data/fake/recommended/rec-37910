Fantastic pizza! I went here for dinner a few weeks ago and loved everything about this place. It's small but has a unique look. The service was lovely. We ordered the asparagus appetizer and veal meatball pizza - both were delicious. My only complaint would be that I wished we had ordered a second pizza. I would recommend this to anyone.
