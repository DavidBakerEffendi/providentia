On my trip to NYC I decided to have dinner with family at Grimaldi's after visiting the Brooklyn bridge.   And boy was the line super long and out the door down the block.  This must say something about the pizza if people are willing to wait in a line that long. Luckily the line moved at a steady rate and we were able to sit at the bar since we were only a party of 2.  Con- their liquor license is pending.  Other than that our pizza tasted amazing despite the kitchen running out of grilled chicken.  We had pepperoni, ham, basil, ricotta, and mozzarella cheese.   All fresh and piping hot when served at our table. Grimaldi's is my all time favorite pizza place.
