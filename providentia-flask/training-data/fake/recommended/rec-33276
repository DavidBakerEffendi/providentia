I really wanted to give this place 5 stars.  We went for dinner, the food, drinks, and ambiance (mood, lighting, decor, and music- hootie and the blow fish- MORE PLEASE) were really impressive.  However, they appeared understaffed and after our food arrived our server disappeared for a some time when we were looking to get a second round of drinks (which didn't happen because it was too late by the time he came back around).  In his defense, it appeared that 3 new tables arrive at the same time.   Signature cocktails with gin was refreshing and nice for summer.   Food: Fresh spun mozzarella- so fresh tasting and creamy texture- great balance English Pea and ricotta Raviolli-  my expectations were not great on this dish but it was truly something I will be back for.  It was delicate, covered in a white wine type sauce.  perfectly savory without being salty.   All and all I will be back here.
