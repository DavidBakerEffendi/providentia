Sadly, Local 44 has changed ownership and gone downhill.  The menu has changed (but not for the better), the wait staff is downright dopey (they don't ask about refills, they forgot about one of my party entirely).  I think they're sailing on the laurels of the previous owners...and their location (because they're the only game in this neighborhood).  I'm not going back - unless they change owners again.
