For the food, I would have given it a 4-star - The food was decent, but certainly not addictive.   The main problem was the wait time, and under-service. The issue is that the restaurant was understaffed totally, and we did not feel like we were treated/serviced very well at all. For example, we raised our hands for more than 10 minutes and no one saw us... We ordered a pitcher of italian soda and it came without any companying glasses so we had to use the wine glasses that were available at the table. The second problem was we were seated right next to the kitchen and though the weather was nice outside, it was hella hot inside! Another thing is also because the restaurant is very crowded and small, it was very noisy - not a good place for a romantic dinner. So, key takeaways: i) Food - OK, B+  (my favorite was the partadelle or something that spells like that - a pasta with mushroom and cameralized onions etc) ii) Environment  B- iii) Service  B- iv)  Price was about $33 per person for a 4-people dinner (2 appetizers and 3 entree shared)   Neways, glad I tried and tasted the reality after all the hype about this place!!!
