I'm cheap. These dumplings are cheap. We're good together. No really, I am cheap BUT I am especially happy when I get great food at a ridiculously low price. I'm willing to pay a lot if the ambiance is right, the service is stellar and the food is masterful. I'll go to DB Townhouse or any Boulud and throw down some change because I know that all of my senses will be happy and I'll be satiated. But somehow, Prosperity keeps me happy with 5 for $1 fried pork and chive dumplings? Get em to go, and sit in the park nearby and enjoy these plump, delicious (and a little fatty) Â treats. It's honestly ridiculous, and you need to go find out for yourself.
