I love Sushi California, I've been here a bunch of times and it's always been great. It's definitely at the top of my list of the sushi I've had in Connecticut. It also holds the distinction of the first time my boyfriend ever tried sushi (he's totally hooked, of course). They have a wide variety of delicious rolls and the fish is always super fresh. Their rolls are always really flavorful, and lots of them come with tobiko on top which I love. Going for dinner is great, but our favorite time to go is definitely for lunch--they have a normal roll special (3 rolls, I believe) and a special roll special, so we usually order one of each and share. We've tried a lot of their rolls and their sashimi and have never had anything bad or 'fishy'. The service is fantastic, and they've definitely given us the lunch menus, even if we've gotten there after lunch is technically over. A couple of times the chef has even sent us some of whatever he was making himself for lunch completely free. The first time I went I definitely didn't have high hopes for a sushi place in a strip mall next to stop and shop, but Sushi California is great.
