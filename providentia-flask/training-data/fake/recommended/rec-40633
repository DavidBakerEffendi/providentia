Went to Jones this evening to try something different since my husband and I usually stick to the places near our home. I was hoping for something tasty and comforting on this cold evening, but unfortunately it was an altogether....unappealing experience. We split the nachos which were not terrible but not remarkable, then our entrees came. My husband had the chesseburger and said that it was akin to A&W Rootbeer stand burgers, more like a bland fast food burger than anything else. Fries were also unappealing. I had the vegetarian chili ($13). Unfortunately it was just a bowl of not quite cooked beans with some sour cream on top. I couldn't eat it due to the beans being so firm and dry. NOT at all like a chili. Everything is waaaay overpriced for the quality.Our service wasn't bad, but thats as much as I can say for the place.
