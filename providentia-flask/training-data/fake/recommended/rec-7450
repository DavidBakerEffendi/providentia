Definitely in my top 5 fave restaurants in NYC.  Where to begin? Bacon popcorn. Smoked bacon BLT banh mi Shredded crab pizza on scallion toasted pancake I didn't like the shredded foie gras, no texture. The fried chicken was ok. Good beer selection.  At the end of dinner, they give you these little creamsicle flavored shooters to clean the palate. Great service. Not sure you need a reservation, my group didn't make one and we were fine at 7pm on a Weds nite.
