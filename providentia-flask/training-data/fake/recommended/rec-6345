I've only gotten food delivered from here, so I can't comment on the service. As for the food: I've had the lamb chops, the sirloin steak with the au poivre sauce and the shrimp BLT. All were very good. The lamb chops and the steak portions were very large and filling for the price, and came with delicious French fries, some of the best I've had in a while. The shrimp BLT was small, and they forgot to add bacon to mine, otherwise it was very tasty. Also beware, all Ponty food seems to be on the heavy side and sometimes it can be too much.
