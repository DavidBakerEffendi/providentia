Food and environment are great! Probably the best side dishes among similar level restaurant, they along can fill you in! I ordered a clam soup as entree, very good! However, the service was slow. The severs seemed distracted and I have to ask to order and to pay. They also don't accept Amex, the limit for card is $20.
