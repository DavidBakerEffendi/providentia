Holy moly! One of the damn best meals I've had in my life. Lol, that's a little sad, ain't it? On my 3 day trip to NYC, I had this 3 times. That's ridiculous. Located on 53rd & 6th avenue, you won't miss this place, cause there's about 3 Halal Guy carts on this corner. $6 gets you a fat bowl/plate of rice, veggies & your choice of protein. I stuck to the Gyro/Chicken & Rice. Don't forget the white sauce! And a dash of hot red. OMG so damn delicious & fattening. Line moves fairly quick. The guys move quick! I miss it already, can't wait to go back! Best thing to eat especially after a night of drinking. This is serious must eat in NYC!
