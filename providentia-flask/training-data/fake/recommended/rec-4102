First time ordering from here and I must say the delivery time was pretty quick. Food arrived cold but, i'm not holding them on that because being that's 14 degrees out today. My husband and I tried the chicken flautas, chicken tostadas and the chicken quesadilla. Don't know why we ordered everything with chicken.. lol... Food was good but not great like some of the other reviewers say.
