Came here with friends and left full and satisfied. The prices are cheap and the food is delish. I had a large greek salad with anchovies, then a ripper (hotdog) with mustard relish, and a breakfast plate of eggs, bacon, rye toast and fries. I have to say I ate so much it was basically my lunch and dinner for the day. Total bill for 3 people to eat there, including tax and tip, ending up being $45. I can't wait to go back.
