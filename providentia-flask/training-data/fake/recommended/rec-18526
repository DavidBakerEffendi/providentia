Really liked this place.  Went on a quiet Friday afternoon Labor Day weekend. Sat right up at the "bar" and grabbed a couple Coronas out of the fridge.  The staff was super friendly and fast.  I had the chorizo taco and pork taco and both were delicious.  The sauces they have are really good as well.  The "small" order of guac and chips is actually pretty big.  Two of us couldn't finish it.  We'll definitely be back!
