I went to sketch burger this past summer and had a great experience so I was excited to return! However, I was extremely disappointed. First, the service was very poor. Wait staff was inattentive and unhelpful. We arrived at 7:30pm (the place is open until 9pm) and were told they were all out of regular fries. We asked how the sweet potato fries were and our waiter responded "well, the regular fries are better". Not helpful considering we could not order them. It took a long time to order our food and even longer to get the bill at the end. The waiter also forgot my friend's regular milkshake. Sketch burger has also cut down it's vegan options. One of the things I was excited to order upon returning was a vegan milkshake, but they no longer have them on the menu. I decided to just order the vegan burger with green goddess dressing, but was informed they were also out of the dressing! The burger I had tasted average, but considering there are so many better places to eat in Philly with better food, better service, and more options, I will NOT be returning.
