What a great neighborhood restaurant.  I most recently went to Friday Saturday Sunday on a Thursday during restaurant week.  It is my favorite RW spot because I know what will be on the menu, and I know what I want:  PATE and FILET. The execution of these dishes is flawless.  I love savoring the meal and realizing that there's no way I could replicate it at home.  The service is friendly and attentive, and it's so nice that you can BYOW.  I always recommend Fri Sat Sun to people looking for a memorable date night spot, or as a classy option for less adventurous eaters.  I wish I could afford to go more often, but it is a great spot for catching up with an old friend over a leisurely meal or for celebrating a happy or auspicious life event.
