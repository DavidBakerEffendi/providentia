Definitely amazing food! Another place i've only been to once (and my only taste of Burmese food) but it was so delicious! The lentil fritters are perfect if you like some heat, the fried pork wontons are delicious (though the coconut sauce is a bit sweet) and the thousand layer bread drenched in anything (steak, tomatoes and potatoes for dinner, in coconut syrup for dessert) is delicious! When I had almost reached the corner, I heard a huge commotion and turned around and they were waving and clapping at me! Why, you may ask? Because I left my purse behind. I love them just for that!
