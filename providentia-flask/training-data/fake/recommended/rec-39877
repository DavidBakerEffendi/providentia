Since my last review, I've been here for dinners and late night cocktails/desserts. One of the nice things about this place is that it's a good low-key spot when other restaurants are beginning to close. I would recommend the super-chilled oysters (a wide variety here!) for apps, and the special, WHATEVER it may be. I haven't been disappointed by any of their dinner dishes yet. Another thing that I still deeply appreciate about this place is that the staff is so polite but the overall vibe of the place isn't stuffy at all. It's a wholly nice counterpoint to pretentious and faux-rustic spots in Billyburg, like... oh, I don't know, Roebling Tea Room with its super dark lights and cold/inattentive/snotty servers?
