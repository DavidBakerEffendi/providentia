Huge turn around!!! I wasn't really into this place since it opened several years ago, but when I heard one of the cooks from Fish was creating his own menu I had to check it out. I started with the with the goat tacos and traded a friend for one of her pork belly tacos. I've been going back ever since trying everything on the menu. Guess it helps that I work in center city, it's my go to spot for lunch with a beer. You can't go wrong with any of the tacos, I'm almost finished trying every single one on the menu! Just tried the pork buns today and the were absolutely insane! I may have to go back tomorrow and get them again!
