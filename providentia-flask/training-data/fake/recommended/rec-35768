If you're into fresh fish cooked the right way and the way you like it, this is the spot to check out and a rarity in Philadelphia.  Considered on the pricey side for an entire meal (including apps, drinks, etc.), but for a fish fanatic it should be well worth it.  For the mezedes, try the pikilia spread if you're crazy about hummus and delicious pita.   Estia is also a great place to throw a small gathering -- they have a wonderful, intimate wine room in the lower floor that seats 10 to 12 and a great event planner to help to select the right menu that suits the needs of everyone in your party. -pinkposy
