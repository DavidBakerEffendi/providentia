I came here for brunch and ordered two waters and an eggs benedict (you know how hangovers go). I never got my two waters, but that's ok - I had plenty of water. I'm just SO confused as to why they are SO stingy with their hollandaise? There was literally only hollandaise barely on half of the eggs. I asked for a side and they just brought me barely enough to even cover the rest of the eggs. The benedict was fine but my friend and I could not stop laughing about how hilarious it was that they literally don't want you to have any hollandaise. I and my waistline should thank them probably but seriously, don't get TOO wild with that hollandaise Cafe Cluny!
