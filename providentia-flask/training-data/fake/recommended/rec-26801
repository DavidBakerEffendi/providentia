I have been  coming to this place for many years and was pleased with the food and service. Now I notice  the service and food have gone downhill.  Foods were served at room temperature  and quality is not good anymore.  Twice a friend wanted to get the new VIP card.  The manager and owner refused to issue the card.  They both said that they are too busy and to come back another day.  Another time the hostess said that the owner had to be there to issue it.  He was there that day, but said it was too busy.  They were just standing around and were not doing anything.  I notice that business is a lot slower, no long waits anymore.
