quite a pleasant surprise! I wasn't too hungry when i got here and didn't expect much, but the food was seriously delicious! we got the patatas bravas, sooo good,squid with rice (my favorite of the night!!), soft shell crab (my runner up!), lamp skewers (average), octopus (my least favorite, even though it was still good) and the fried peppers and a few specials that i can't quite remember right now.. but all were quite tasty! wait time for 3 on early friday night was around 30 mins, but you can enjoy the wines and sangrias while you wait! service was very sweet too....
