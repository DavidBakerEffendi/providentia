4.5- Great dumplings that aren't too oily and are juicy and flavorful. Four for a $1 and large wonton soup for $2?! Unheard of prices - you can get 50 shrimp dumplings for $12!!! There's no seating and pretty sure it's cash only but this is a MUST if you're in china town! I will def be coming here again on my next trip to New York
