I ate a small appetizer, fried calamari at the Nassau Inn Yankee Doodle tap room the Friday after thanksgiving. 24 hours later, I was sick with severe food poisoning-like symptoms. 24 hours after that, this article comes out. planetprinceton.com/2014… Called manager of hotel to get my one nights stay refunded to me because it's clear to me when 40 people get sick, who all have one place in common - there's something very wrong there. Manager denied my claims. The problem is, I run my own business and was unable to work with my clients for two days because of the illness caused by frequenting the Nassau Inn on that Friday.  So, I believe a refund is more than fair and am appalled at the management of the Inn and its restaurant. I hope the health department shuts them down - I can't believe there have been no reported consequences yet as a result of this incredible story. I will never stay here again. I'd rather stay further out of town and avoid this nonsense. Or maybe I'll go to The Peacock Inn - who has it figured out.
