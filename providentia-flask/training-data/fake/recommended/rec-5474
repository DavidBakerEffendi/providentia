I only come here for the savory crepes: the staple Southwesten steak (my favorite) or chicken ranch. They are very delicious with decent portions, but they put on too much sauce for my taste. Cheap and tasty, this is one of temple's best food trucks. It can get busy, but they are open late as well. I have tried one sweet crepe but it didn't turn out too well for me. It wasn't one of the normal sweet crepes so that could be why. It had peanut butter, nuts, nutella and I think honey? I get tired of eating the same flavor for too long, but this made me want to puke halfway through, perhaps from the textures, because individually I love each ingredient.
