I figured I would start my first Yelp review off with a Bang. What seems to be the "chupacabra" of all reservations, I had the pleasure of dining at Rao's last night. I normally put a large emphasis on the food side when dining out but its impossible to ignore the decor and service side of your meal when dining here. I will not sit here and describe each dish using words like "moist", "nom nom", "cheesy", "to die for". I just write reviews the way I would want to read them from someone who knows what good food is. Service and Decor: 5 Stars You really do feel like you are in someones home when you enter. It really is very difficult to explain the vibe inside unless you have been there. I will say I understand why people enjoy going on a regular basis. For those of you who are star struck...the sightings can be overwhelming (I took the seat of a man who's name rhymes with Footy Hallan). The owners make you feel welcomed and Nicky "The Vest" couldn't be nicer. Around 11:30 the Jukebox was turned on and we were fortunate enough to see Mr. Pelligrino (and an unnamed 5 time Grammy Award winner) do a medley of songs for the patrons while a Hall of Fame Super Bowl winning Cowboy got up and joined them for the "Macarena". Memories that were worth the trip alone. Food: 3.5 The food is Good! It's not going to be the best Italian food you have ever had but certainly far from the worst. We really didn't have a bad dish and all of the classic staples were present. Someone pulls up a chair, sits down at the front of your table and says "Ok, this is what we have tonight". The must gets when at Rao's: *Seafood Salad *Mozzarella en carroza *Orecchiette with broccoli rabe and Sausage *Veal Parmesan *Black Raspberry Ice Cream ***Must Get: Â  Meatballs The price was VERY reasonable (with wine and after dinner drinks included) I can only hope I am fortunate enough to spend another memorable evening there in the future.
