I had a great meal with two friends visiting from out of town. We felt welcome from the moment we stepped inside. There's a friendly vibe that's hard to describe, but you just feel at home at a place like this. The service was extremely attentive between the host, bartender and wait staff. They were able to accommodate some changes due to allergies without a problem, which was great. Food came out in good rhythm, though we never felt rushed. Two of us got tuna, which was perfectly cooked. The salmon special also looked wonderful. Sides of brussel sprouts and mushrooms were simply prepared but full of flavor. We capped off a great meal with the chocolate cake and salted caramel pudding - both delicious and great for sharing. Unpretentious, charming atmosphere, friendly staff and great food - JL is quickly becoming a institution in the West Village.
