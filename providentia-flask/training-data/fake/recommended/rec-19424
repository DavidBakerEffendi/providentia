Pretty decent.  I called to make a reservation and they said none were available.  I got on open table and made one for the exact time I had just asked about.  It was barren when I got there at 11am for brunch so I was a little confused. I was not crazy about their drinks(bad bloody mary tasted like V8 and straight vodka & a overwhelmingly strong chocolate martini).  Food was good.  I would recommend the crab cakes.  Nothing to really rave about...
