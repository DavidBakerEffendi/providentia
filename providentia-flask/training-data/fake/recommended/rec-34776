Excellent bar!  Great drinks + low key environment + wonderful bartenders + late night food service + great crowd = the perfect mix.   Michael and Wes make the best bespoke cocktails.  Oh...and both are total babes ;-) PS: Take a minute to talk to the door guy.  I'm sorry I don't know his name, but talking to him is like 'Chicken Soup for the Drunk Person's Soul'.
