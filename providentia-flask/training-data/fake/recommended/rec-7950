I loved dining at Ulivo.  It was the quintessential BYOB experience you crave when going out to eat in Philadelphia.  The service was spot on and knowledgeable.  My girlfriend and I split the arugula salad to start which they plated to share.  I had the tonnarelli with crabmeat which was a perfect portion and had a nice spice.  My girlfriend got the penne with mushrooms which was delicious.  We also shared the corn polenta which the waiter somewhat undersold to us but turned out to be fresh and light. We ended up sharing the zucchini bread with lemon zest which was a huge slice and we didn't even finish it.  It was very moist and fresh. We closed down the restaurant while the older diners slowly trickled out.  I would definitely return to Ulivo and try a different pasta dish (and bring even more wine).  I love that they take credit cards too.  Great neighborhood spot!
