The guys who work here are so nice! They let you sample the different chutneys, and they don't even seem annoyed when you ask to try more flavours! Since they get so many orders, the fries are always in and out of the fryer. This means piping hot fries, the way they should be. I always always get the mango chutney. A small size is enough to share with two to three people. Â During the weekend, expect a long line at this hole in the wall.
