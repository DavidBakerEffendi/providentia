not going to find a better ramen house in town. they also have many starters on the menu, as well. the menu isn't too much, just about right for a ramen house that offers ramen and a tad bit more. it's all pretty good stuff. it's not 5 stars for a few reasons, but I hate to be overcritical. this place is very good, enough said.
