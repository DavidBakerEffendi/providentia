Been there a handful of times....food is good but service (particularly at the bar) is SLOW and rude as can be. Past two times we have been there we sat at the bar for drinks and food. We went for dinner....place was empty...pretty much only people there.....Bartender took our order....got our drinks....and dissapeared. We got our app 20 min later.....never was asked if we needed another drink. After that our food was MIA...after about 25 min (45min after we placed our original order).....we asked the bartender if she knew when our food was coming out bc it had been a while since we ordered..... before i even finished asking she said "its been 22min". Let me just say this... i have been in the restaurant industry for YEARS....bartender... I get how the restaurant biz can be.... so let it be known that i understand and am very sympathetic to normal restaurant happenings that go on that cause problems.... BUT... this was flat out rude.... 20 min later (close to an hour after ordering) we got our food.... and dont you know my husbands burger had a hair in it! Needless to say...sadly....the bad service overshadows the good food.... Not worth the aggravation
