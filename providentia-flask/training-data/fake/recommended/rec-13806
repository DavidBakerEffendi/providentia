I have yet to find a small local place in ny that is better than Clinton St.  The pancakes are delightful.  They warm up the syrup for you.  The sandwiches are good too.  The fried green tomatoes are good.  The only downside is the wait.  Sometimes you might have to wait 2 hours.  Usually there is at least a 1/2 hour wait anyway.
