I'm no arepa connoisseur, but damn these were good. Ordered delivery for 6-7 of my friends and everyone enjoyed them. I loved the arepa de chocolo -cheese. Â I did have a taste of the arepa with steak and found the steak a bit chewy. An arepa from here is the perfect hangover food. It's only two blocks away from me - very dangerous. I'll definitely order again and visit the store.
