I feel conflicted about this place. On one hand, the coffee is AWESOME and although I've never tried the food, the menu looks great. The place is cozy and has lots of character. However, the staff and manager are beyond unfriendly and rude. There are really moody and timid 12-yr olds manning the cash register as the manager watches them in silence. Also, the prices constantly changed based on how the 12-yr olds and managers please. I work nearby and go to Piccolo nearly every day, order the same exact coffee drink, and yet the prices constantly change. There aren't many good coffee options around this neighborhood so despite the horrible service, Piccolo is the place to go.
