I do not know why you would want to eat Mexican anywhere else in Philly! I fell in love with this place almost 10 years ago. The decor is amazing! The dark wood bar and the Day of the Dead murals stand out. The service has been excellent - whether you are sitting at the bar or a table. I must admit I usually order the Enchiladas Con Mole Poblano. It's no longer on the dinner menu, but if you request it, they will serve it. The food is outstanding!!!
