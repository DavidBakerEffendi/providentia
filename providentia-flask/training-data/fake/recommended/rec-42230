While I appreciate the fact this restaurant has a vegetarian section on their menu (with only 2 items), I truly regretted ordering from it. You would think with ONLY two vegetarian items they would be good. Not! Okay, now I know this is not a vegetarian place but still. The food is not cheap & one would hope you at least get what you pay for. Not here, this veggie burger was THE worst I EVER had. Ever! It's made with lentil beans, has grain bread & is topped with a generous supply of leafy-sprouts. It sounded okay until I saw it. To begin, the patty looked liked like a deep fried hockey-puck of damp bread crumbs and that's EXACTLY what it tasted like. It had zero consistency & completely fell apart, like sand, when touched. It was the MOST disgusting thing I ever had. I would have sent it back but my boyfriend would not let me. He was embarrassed and tried to eat it himself. However, he could not eat it because (he agreed) it was HORRIBLE. We also ordered the hummus platter, nothing spectacular at all, and my boyfriend had a fish dish (just okay). Definitely not worth the money. Brooklyn has MUCH better spots that both vegetarians & carnivores can enjoy. So, Blue Ribbon Brassierie, if you read this, get it together! Do not put something on your menu just for the sake of having it there if it's disgusting. This is New York City! A better veggie patty could have come from my ars!!
