Came here right when they opened, and they already had 3 parties seated, on a weekday! However there are lots of tables and seating inside and outside (which would be amazing for the spring/summer) so I didn't feel cramped, rushed, cloister phobic or any of the things you'd feel at a very popular brunch place (there's no eggs benedict on the weekdays btw!!!) The pumpkin pancakes were decent, but something I would definitely share because no one should be consuming that many carbs for breakfast alone, and you can't taste the pumpkin after a while. The cinnamon yogurt sauce that comes with it is a wonderful combo with the syrup, but I was a bit disappointed because the syrup came out by the time I was almost done with my dish. The breakfast special comes with toast, 2 eggs, home fries, small glass of OJ, and a coffee/cappuccino/latte of your choice. I think that's a great choice especially for the money. If you want to go a lil more fancy, get the eggs Benedict. I would definitely come back, but hoping that it would be as empty/not jam packed as it seemingly may be on the weekends for brunch.
