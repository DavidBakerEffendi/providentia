The funny thing about Manu's sushi is that their salads, steak and deserts WOWS you better than the sushi! But if you need a sushi fix however... Then this is the best option in the area. -compared to the other 3 places- Otherwise go for the deserts, decor/atmosphere (very nice) and for drinks. (stay away from the sangria though). Way too sweet and tasted like cough syrup. ***Loved @Jason's review*** "Sushi is an art, but it ain't rocket science" lol well said.
