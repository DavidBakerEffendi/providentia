In the past I tried not to post any review on yelp because all reviews on yelp, good and bad are highly exaggerated. This is my first review and will be my last. I went to Katsuhama last week during lunch hour. It was a busy restaurant. I ordered a fillet curry and a small beer. The beer came faster than I had anticipated. And the curry arrived in about 15 minutes timeframe. The curry was average and it filled me up. The servers are fine. I gave it a five stars rating. No exaggeration and embellishment. If you find a restaurant that is below your expectation, just don't go to that restaurant next time. Be a bigger person and just let it go. You have much more important things in your lives than trying to hide behind the internet writing negative review. People who write negative review are those who have nothing in their lives to look forward to and have a bad agenda toward a particular establishment or an individual. Or they are just in general a bitter individual with grievous intention.
