Subs, grinders, deli sandwiches, etc with a unique flair. All the food has a "name" like, the Holy Oinker, the Batman, the Doctor, etc. Food was actually quite good and tastes very fresh. Â The kind of place you might see as part of the Vermont Fresh Food network (not sure if they are or not). The bacon on my sandwich was awesome! Don't let the small front and shack-like appearance discourage you; give it a try.
