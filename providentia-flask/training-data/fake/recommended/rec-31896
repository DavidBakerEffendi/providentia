I'm sure this place is great and maybe when I get a chance to eat here, I will revise my rating.  But right now, I'm so very, very disappointed.  I'm sure no one from the restaurant will read this since they've gotten so many great reviews and NY Mag still considers them one of the hottest tables in town.  Still, my reservation experience makes me never want to try it.   A little background, I was three weeks from finishing my month long master cleanse.  I knew that I wanted a great meal as my first one after the cleanse.  I was giving myself 10 days after the cleanse to acclimate myself to regular food then my wife and I would dine here.  So I called and made a reservation for 5:45PM on a Friday, April 4th.  The woman confirmed on the phone and we were good.  A couple of weeks pass by and as I look at my calendar, I see two entries for Locanda.  One for April 6th and another for March 30th.   So I call them to confirm that our reservation is for April 6th.  But they couldn't find it.  Neither date was in the their books.  Not by my name nor my number.  Then the woman says, oh, I see the problem.  You are reserved for the Dutch, another one of the chef's restaurants.  She goes, "Let me deletes this one and book you for April 6th."  All we have is 10:30PM.  I was like, what?  But you made a mistake, you can do anything?  "Nope.  We accept walk-ins.  Anything else?  No?  Good bye.  " That's it.  No apologizes.  No sympathies.  Just suck it up loser customer who wants to spend money in this restaurant.  We don't need your business.   So you can guess how I feel.  What got me so mad is that she just doesn't care.  In a service industry at such an upstanding restaurant, the person who is supposed to give the first impressions tells you to eff off.
