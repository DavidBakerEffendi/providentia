I love sushi and this place is my go to place.  They are reasonably priced for all you can eat and its so fresh.  I love it there and recommend it to all my friends.  Its BYOB which is great to bring a bottle of wine and have a nice date.  They have a great selection of sushi for the all you can eat.  I would suggest going everyday!!!!!
