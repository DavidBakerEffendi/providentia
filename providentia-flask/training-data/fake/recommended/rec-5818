Vic's Sushi is the best sushi I've ever had. And I mean it - I'm a sushi connoisseur and have had toooooons of sushi in LA/NY/japan. You seriously can't go wrong with ordering any of the specialty rolls. They are insanely creative with presentation - they'll combine the rolls you and your friends order and decorate them like a masterpiece [as you can probably see from the posted photos]. Each roll has its own unique combination of ingredients to make your mouth beg for more. My favorite roll is the iRoll. The tuna dumplings are also out of this world. Its also BYOB so you can even pair your taste buds with some merlot. My cali friends are always surprised when they ask me what's the best sushi I've ever had, and I answer them "Vic's Sushi...... in philly".
