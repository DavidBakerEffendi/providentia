disappointing. i've been here several times, and while overall the food was fabulous (except for the pad thai, which was a bit dry), Â everyone - from waitstaff to the hostess - was over-the-top rushed, arrogant, and rude. the hostess acted as if she was doing us a huge favor when we asked to sit at a different table...our waitstaff kept walking away from our table at the tailend of his sentence, giving us no opportunity to respond...our server clumsily kept pushing everything on our table (including our drinks) out of the way with the dish he was trying to serve us... ridiculously unprofessional, it was almost funny... i love a fabulous meal, and there are so many options in philly; won't be back anytime soon.
