Wow -- just don't get it.  We saw a show on Travel Channel raving about Jersey's Mikes with a whole episode about how it started, etc.  So when my son had a gift card, we thought we would try it.  This is our opnion only, and obviously a whole lot of people feel differently:  they are borderline terrible and incredibly overpriced.  I went in to place the order and saw prices for three sizes: mini, regular, and giant.  By the prices, I assumed "regular" was comparable to a Subway footlong, because JM's regular price was about $7.  So I thought, okay, about $2 more than Subway.  But as I watched her start to make our sandwiches I realized quickly that "regular" was a tiny 6" sub!!  Their ingredients are no better than subway, and they had far less "toppings" to pick from.  Their "giant," at about $12 was a foot long -- more than twice the price of Subway.  What makes their sandwiches so awful is the bread -- it is just awful and flavorless.  And the bread really makes the sandwich, as anyone can layer meat and cheese and lettuce and tomato.  We are just stumped by their popularity.  i am NOT saying Subway is a great sandwich -- but it is certainly better than JMs and half the price.
