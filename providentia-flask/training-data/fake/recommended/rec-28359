Not to be trite, but salt and fat is self-explanatory in concept, design, and execution- all done splendidly. As my sister says, salt is one of my favorite "foods." Yes, it's a mineral. No, it's not technically a food, but this chef MUST be on the same page because the perfect amount of salt [and fat] are incorporated into each menu item. I NEVER thought that the best fried chicken I've ever tasted in my life [my life, I tell you, without exaggeration!!!], would come from my own neighborhood. I didn't even want to order it, but I was persuaded that it might be interesting. I have yet to visit states in the South known for their fried chicken, so until then, S&F, you stay on the radar of Queens' finest. Adding to the interesting appeal is the combination of Korean elements to its menu flare. I like creative mixes to American dining ordeals. EVERYTHING I've had here was fantastic, and I only didn't try the gnocchi. If you're a fan of oxtail, it's superb: it literally slides right off of its bone. Cheers to your grace and presence, Salt & Fat. You are very welcomed by me in this neighborhood.
