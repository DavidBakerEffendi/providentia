The burgers and fries are good. Charging $0.25 per topping is pretty lame though, but I guess that's their prerogative. Unfortunately, the largest problem is the unfriendly service and decreasing level of cleanliness with the restaurant. Things used to be better when it first opened but it seems things are more lax now. I've only gone in during the day for lunch so I can't comment on how the restaurant fares after last call. Regardless, it's sad to see a quality burger place rest on its laurels and go downhill.
