The pictures you see on yelp can't really show you the size of these sandwiches. If you are used to sandwiches (thisbig) imagine one that is (_t_h_i_s_b_i_g_) instead. ...And it's tasty too!  I tried the Roast pork sandwich with provolone and spinach.  However, never have really been the biggest fan of pork.  I would recommend ignoring all the glowing reviews for pulled pork and try whatever meat you're a fan of.  All of them looked amazing. You'll be stuffed if you finish this by yourself so having a sidekick eater is a good idea as well.
