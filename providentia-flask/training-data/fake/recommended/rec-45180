This place is a hidden OASIS.  It's holed up behind a gas station and crossroads -- a true "diamond in the rough" as my mother likes to refer to it.  The Normal Rockwell-inspired interior is true to the surrounding community and I love how cozy the whole place is.  There are indoor tables, but you can also get food to go.  It closes early on weekdays (3:00pm), but it's perfect for breakfast or lunch in the Claremont area.  I stopped here with my mom for lunch and we split the mozzarella, pesto, spinach and tomato sandwich on wheat berry bread with a fresh tomato basil soup on the side.  So fresh and delicious!  Just the smell of the soup was enough for us to walk away feeling sated.  This is the BEST lunch place in the area and I only wish that they were open later!
