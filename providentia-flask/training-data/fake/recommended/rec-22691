Let me just preface by saying we are military wives and the farthest thing from foodies or beer afficianados (spelling?). We do not get out much and when we do our children are always in tow. We arrived early and there were no tables, but more of a worry was that the changing station had not been set up in the bathroom yet and we had babies. Â A table opened up, however, my girls wanted to head out due to the changing issue. At that time we were approached by man named eric who assured us he would handle the situation if any "changing" concerns arose. We found this hilarious so we stayed not thinking much of it. Sure enough my daughter went like clockwork and to our surprise eric was right there. He assured us he had 3 daughters and this wasnt a big deal. He even pointed to his 3 lovely girls sitting at a table. He quickly handled the "mess" and had my little one giggling the whole time. Talk about customer service!!! But this is where it gets even more comical. Our server told us eric was his boss, a fact he then denied, but sat down for a drink with us. At that time he admitted the 3 girls were in fact his friends kids and he had no children, he simply didnt want a table of 6 women to leave. The group of us erupted in laughter. It turns out this eric was quite the host. He knew one of our friends husbands from another local bar and when pressed for his availability he said. And i quote. "I have given up on women, i dont even want siri in my iphone". HA. Anyway eric and his staff made us feel like queens and we have already been back. (Full disclosure our diaper changing hero was nowhere to be found) Recommendations would be the cider and the brooklyn bratwurst. And of course, if you can get eric at your table thats an added bonus. Thanks lockyard cant wait to see you all again.
