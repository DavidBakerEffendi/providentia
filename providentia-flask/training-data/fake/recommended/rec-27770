Grits! Salmon Autumn salad. What a wine list! Â This is a great spot to dine in Hartford before a show at the Civic Center. They accommodated our party of 10 that walked in off the street. The staff was courteous and attentive. The food was delicious, farm to table and well presented. Everyone was satisfied and happy with their food choices. My Autumn Salad (add Salmon) was delicious. I would come back again.
