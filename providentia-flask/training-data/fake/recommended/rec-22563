Overrated does not even begin to describe the mediocre quality of the food. We sat down at a dirty table, were given dirty, unwashed silverware and served day old slop masquerading as lunch. The coffee was good but you'd think a refill would be free, particularly when you prepay a hefty tip onto a self-serve meal.
