I work right by here, and I am OBSESSED with this place. I'm a bit of a falafel snob-- the only kind that has ever fit my queenly taste is from L'as du Falafel in the Marais area of Paris. BUT NISH NUSH RULES. I've never had anything bad from there and if I could eat it for every single meal I would. The perfect amount of crunchy, flavorful, smooth, and filling. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it...
