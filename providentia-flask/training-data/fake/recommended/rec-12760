My friend and I went for lunch at 11:00 a.m. on a weekday-- no wait as it'd just opened for the day. We ordered the truffle beet salad, tempura onion rings, and the Original and Umami burgers, medium rare. The beet salad (arugula based) had a heavy shake of salt over the top; the presentation was pretty, but you should mix it before eating, if that's not intuitive. (The leaves were already dressed, so it's not as refreshing a caloric balance to the burgers.) Huge onion rings, but I had enough of the slightly greasy tempura batter after a couple-- there's a trio of dipping sauces, garlic aioli, a spicy chipotle, and a ranch-y one, with the garlic aioli being my preferred. So, to the burgers, which is why the lines when I've passed at night are hours long-- the texture reminded me of Louis' in New Haven: diced, loosely shaped tartare patties, you can taste the quality of the meat but it falls apart as a burger. My inner cheapo/glutton was alarmed at the $12+ tag for a burger without the "sides" (regular, truffle, and sweet potato fries as well as the onion rings, an additional $5 on average)-- it's so expensive!, there's too little of it!-- but a friend and I split everything listed above, still waddling out, so it's more filling than it looks. (Had room for a DKA each, though.) Friendly, high energy staff. I wouldn't queue for these burgers, but you should try it if you're in the area.
