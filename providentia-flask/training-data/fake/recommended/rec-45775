We are regulars here as we are in the area.  We love the sushi and our kids enjoy the bento as they love the Teriyaki Chicken.  I cannot speak to everything on the menu but I must say sushi itself is amazing, especially the special rolls.  Also if you have never tried a sushi pizza get it from here.  Very tasty appetizer that has as much sushi as a large roll.  Enjoy!
