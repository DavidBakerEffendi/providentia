My wife and I stopped by for an early dinner a few weeks ago. One of the better restaurants in Bed-Stuy for sure! Our server was informative and friendly, without being overwhelmingly chatty. The space is large yet  very cozy. Designed with love. The food was spot on. My pork chop was delicious.... Cooked perfectly. My wife's chicken was juicy and just so, so good. We both had a couple of drinks and dessert. Wonderful. We also met the owner who was very nice.  Overall a great experience all the way. Check this place out!
