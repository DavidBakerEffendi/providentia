First, this is a great place to eat lunch or dinner. Good, filling food and they always have really interesting menu options.  In general this place is a lot of fun. There are just not enough reviews about their breakfast here!  Their breakfast is absolutely outstanding!!  We are big breakfast people in general but this is our absolute favorite.  Everything we've ever had here on their breakfast menu (weekends only) is amazing.  Great place to take family and friends for a weekend breakfast.  Mimosas, tri-color potatoes, and homemade corn beefed hash are the highlights for me.   Oh and don't forget this place is BYOB!
