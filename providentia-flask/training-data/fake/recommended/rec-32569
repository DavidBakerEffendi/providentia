Came in for a Sunday brunch. First of all, the actual seating is super uncomfortable- it was like reliving my choir days all over again in posture chairs. If you even try to lean back your spine is punished by angry, wooden scaffolding. It didn't help that we were smothered in a corner by a dusty bookshelf. Secondly, our server was cold and disinterested. He never once asked us how we were doing, never attempted to make eye contact when speaking, and either "forgot" to refill our water or just didn't care to do so. I was especially thirsty while eating a very dry, "Tunisian Sandwich." The sandwich itself is absolutely disgusting - tuna and harissa salad, boiled egg, pickled carrots, potatoes, olives, preserved lemons on panni bread - What was I thinking? Does that even sound good together? It's my fault for choosing it, but the real problem, which was out of my control, was the panini bread - this bread was so dry and SHARP, I couldn't eat it because it was hurting my lips, mouth and throat. My friend had the poached eggs; he seemed to enjoy them, so one star for that.
