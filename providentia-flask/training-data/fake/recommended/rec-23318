Great food, nice people.  Everything on the menu tastes great.  Hard to find a table sometimes. Update August 1, 2012 Since the menu has changed this place has stumbled.  Good place for a beer and wings but it is no longer a staple on our list.  We go to Hawthornes now. Update January 23, 2013 No longer go here.  Noise level too high and new menu disappoints.  Hawthornes it is for a quick beer and hamburger now,
