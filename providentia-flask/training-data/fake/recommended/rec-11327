If you are a beer connoisseur - this is a good place to hang out.  When I visited, it was on word of mouth in the beer community, before the Guy Fieri visit...LOL I like Good Beer Period!!  I like trying new and interesting ones that I may not normally encounter when out with friends at the regular chain places.  I had a Potato beer during my visit - wasn't a fan, but it was great to give it a try.   The beer selection is good and I appreciated that the staff would answer any questions that I had and they were experts and that made it a great time.   I don't want to down play the food - it's good.  While there, many vegans commented on the great selection offered.  I am not a vegan and my food was equally good. This is definitely a place a keep in my "go-to" places for out of towners who enjoy good beer.
