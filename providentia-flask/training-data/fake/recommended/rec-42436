I rarely leave reviews, but I have to for this spot. They should be way busier than they are! The veggies are super fresh, the tofu and meats are tasty and interesting without being over seasoned or too salty.  Same goes for the pours (dressings you add to your pita).  The variety is ridiculous.  I also love that the staff is friendly without being fake.  I tend to go for the pesto tofu with all the veggies minus scallions and the charred tomato vinaigrette, although there are tons of fancy and non-fancy combos that I plan on trying.  I spend around $10 every time and have no complaints!  I'd rather spend $10 on a delicious/healthy/filling pita than $6 or $7 on a deli sandwich made from crap.   As a fitness instructor I love finding places to grab lunch that offer healthy yet filling meals.  Teaching multiple classes per day, I work up an appetite, but hate eating junk.    It's a great place for a post workout meal or for whenever.  Is it the place to go if you're on a super tight budget?  No, but it also isn't going to break the bank.  It is worth it!
