Soooo delicious. I was in town for work and asked (while doing a little lunch time shopping) the checkout girl at Free People where to go and get something good - not like Cosi or Subway. So -- she reco'd Le Bus and I was SO IMPRESSED!! Despite the amazing-looking array of sandwiches, including beloved hummus, I went for the "best tuna salad in Philly". Such a delish sandwich - amazing hearty whole grain bread, awesome tuna salad, lettuce, tomato, and hard-boiled egg. Paired with some awesome gazpacho - yum. And, they even panini-pressed my sandwich. Next time I'm in Philly, I'm going back for more. Cheers!
