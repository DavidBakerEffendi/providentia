The mofongo is hands down the best I have ever had.  Typical Puerto Rican muffing, moist, with pork meat and crackling skin inside! Yum! The sancocho is also hard core and with an authentic boricua flavor.  Dona Adela is always around giving instructions to his employees, which gives you a sense of her strong commitment to serving Puerto Rican food just the way it is.  Many "Puerto Rican" restaurants in the city have either a cuban or a dominican flavor to it, which is ok, I guess. But if you are looking for that "abuelita" flavor, this is the place to go.
