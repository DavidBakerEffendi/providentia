I'm only 31 years old. Why does this matter? Well, it matters because in my lifetime I can't remember Geno's (or even Pat's) being that good. I think many years ago, they were both kings but they have fallen due to their statuses as tourist symbols. Tourist traps is what they are. The steaks there are cold and are only fitting for the drunken and lost who have no closer alternative.
