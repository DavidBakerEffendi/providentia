Whoa! This place is awesome.  Everyone was genuinely friendly and outgoing.  Everything we ordered was fantastic.  Two thumbs up on the bone marrow, the mac and cheese, jalapeno and bacon cornbread (smothered in butter of course), and the meatloaf sandwich.  There was even enough food for lunch the next day.  I'll be back!
