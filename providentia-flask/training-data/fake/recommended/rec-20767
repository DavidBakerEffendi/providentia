I go either to this Cocoron location or the Delancey street location approximately every other week. So, yeah, call me an addict. I shouldn't even write a review because that means fewer seats (and there aren't that many seats to begin with). If you want the best chance at getting in, come alone and sit at the bar. Couples are fine, trios are pushing it. And if you're arriving with more than that... I hope you're hanging out outside when they open. I nearly always get the sansai soba (hot in the winter, cold in the summer) and my bf usually goes for the stamina soba. The little side dishes are all delightful (my favorite is the kimpira... burdock root and carrot) and IF I have any space left in my tummy box, I always want the coconut-frozen fruit dessert. So light and creamy. I'm not a big dessert person (all those heavy molten chocolate things can be thrown off the Brooklyn Bridge as far as I'm concerned), but the coconut thing at Cocoron goes on my top-10 desserts list. My mouth is watering even now. I might need to walk down there and line up for the dinner service...
