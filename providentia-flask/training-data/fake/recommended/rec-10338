Four us went here for dinner one night.  The ambiance and table setting is nice.  The salads were basic and OK.  The break was a small, store loaf about 2" in diameter served with butter.  Service could have been better but not horrible. I had the pork medallions which came out as two fairly large cutlets.  Overcooked but with a nice char a sauce.  The mashies were a bit tasteless.  My wife's food was OK. This restaurant seems to cater to seniors, which we are not.  Just saying....
