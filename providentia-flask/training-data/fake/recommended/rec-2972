After some a holiday outing with my kiddo and my folks my dad asked to have lunch at "the old dickens inn". He wanted to see what had replaced it. I did an inward groan when I saw it was now a Cavanaughs. While they retained the decor of the "inn" the rest was pretty bad. Our server was mediocre at best.  The food was terrible. For example: We ordered the chip and dip, one of the dips was supposed to be queso. It was really just cheese wiz. It was awful. I got the shrimp tacos which were equally terrible. They were boring and the tortillas had the texture of having been microwaved. My mom's fish (fish and chips) looked terribly greasy the chips were cold.   I guess this is a good place for a few beers and watch a game. To actually go for a meal, not so much.
