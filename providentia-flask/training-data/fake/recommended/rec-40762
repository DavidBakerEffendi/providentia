I love the atmosphere in the upstairs dining room of Fuji Mountain. It's an intimate-feeling space with raised wooden booths and fantastic lighting: above every table is a single hanging bulb. Makes everyone's skin look radiant and makes me feel like I'm having a glamorous and romantic night out. Also, the food is great, they brought us free edamame, and our waiter wasn't a jerk about our annoying request to split the bill three ways.
