It's fine, but not my first choice.  Or my second choice.  Or my third. I have been to this New Haven hot spot twice now, and while I have been brainwashed by my boyfriend to believe that Pepe's is the way to go (he was brainwashed years ago by his family), I'm looking for something new, after two somewhat average experiences at this million-year-old establishment.   I'll start with what I like about Pepe's... I like that the pizzas are gigantic and are served on a giant pan, which doubles as a place to put trash and napkins, instead of on the table.  I like that the servers give you one million napkins, because you will need them.  I like the atmosphere, and their seating method, which is clear and simple and fair. Now for the review: When you order a diet coke or a water, they come in tiny juice glasses.  Really?  I'm a water person, and I need more than six ounces in my glass, especially if the servers aren't going to be around often enough to see that it might need to be refilled on a regular basis.  Chomping on ice cubes for hydration is unacceptable.  Even for a pizza place. The White Clam Pizza - I like salt, but this was WAAAAAAAYYYYY too salty.  I wouldn't get it again. The Basic Cheese - Eh.  Not enough cheese for me.  Tomato sauce is too runny.   Pepperoni & Mushroom - Better than the other options, by far.  Nice thick slices of pepperoni. The Oil factor: When I have to use more than one napkin to soak up excess oil off of my slice, there is a problem.  Soooo oily.  Not how real Italian pies should be. The Burn factor:  Pepe's, I know your oven is super impressive and hot, but when I have to remove half of my crust due to charring, it's no fun!  I want to also remind everyone that the black charring is carbon.  Which is toxic. I have to imagine that anyone who gives Pepe's five stars has been brainwashed just as my boyfriend has, because it's just not that good.  I'm trying Sally's next time.
