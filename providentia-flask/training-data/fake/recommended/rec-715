Nice place, good service, but such a let down after looking forward to dining at this restaurant for 2 years. If you want to drop $50 on a snack: this is your place!! Portions were too small for the price & overall culinary quality was one notch above ANY good diner. Shrimp & grits were the best I've ever had, but full dinner portion was more of an appetizer size serving. Ribs were a good sized offering, but NO taste. Go figure: they skimp on the great stuff & load you up with Â the worst ribs I've ever tasted.
