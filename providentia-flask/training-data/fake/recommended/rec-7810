This place is not only beautiful... but a dessert heaven as well.  This is just too much goodness in one location!  If I lived in NY I would be here all the time... okay, at least once a week.  I had espresso with whipped cream on top.  The table next to us had a plate of whipped cream delivered to them!  (Don't ask me why... it's still pretty awesome though.) Oh, Cafe Sabarsky... I'm going to dream of you tonight.
