As someone who really dislikes carrying around cash, their cash only policy is a HUGE minus. Luckily I was able to scrounge up a few dollars and have very, very nice friends! Otherwise, I think this place is definitely worth coming into Brooklyn for! I had heard great things about the calamari, but unfortunately they were out. Instead, my table of three split the fried mushrooms (yummy, but apparently nowhere near as yummy as the calamari) and the shrimp summer rolls, which were pretty standard. For my main, I had the shrimp Pad Thai. Now, I am a very unadventurous person and eat Pad Thai pretty much every time I eat Thai, so I had plenty to compare to. It was easily one of the better ones I've had! Even though I was insanely full about a third of the way through my plate (YAY for huge portions!), it was hard to stop picking at it. ...Especially since our waitress never came back to give us our check. We actually had to flag down another one after 20 minutes of looking for ours. She came back just in time to pick up our money though! Overall, solid 4 stars and I look forward to eating my leftovers for my next few meals. The cash only thing seriously sucks, though.
