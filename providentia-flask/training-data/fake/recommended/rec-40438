My wife and I went Friday night for dinner and some hookah and we were very disappointed! After we were seated  ( waited 25 minutes for seating), a server brought us some water and took our order.  So far so good, we ordered grape leaves, an eggplant dip and a hookah with a grapefruit bowl. The server that brought out the food never brought us out plates, silverware or napkins, we had to flag down another server for them. He seemed sooooo unmotivated bringing it to us.  Literally dragging his feet!! Now to the food.  Grape leaves we're super bland!!! The dip was good but the pita bread (that I had to ask for) seemed old and like the kind you buy at a super market.  After that we didn't order anything else. They never filled our water. So after finishing the apps we realize we didn't get the hookah we ordered yet.  It had been 50 mins since we ordered.  I asked another server to check on it and he said there was a wait.  I would have liked to know that when I ordered it.  So I asked him to cancel it and bring me the check.  It was never cancelled and after 15 mins more, we got the hookah.  The bowl was an orange not a grapefruit that we ordered.  My wife and I just made the best of it.  We will definitely not be returning here.   Unorganized staff. Bland and old food. Slow and bad service! AND GRATUITY WAS INCLUDED! Ugh. Nightmare. My wife gives them 1 Star!
