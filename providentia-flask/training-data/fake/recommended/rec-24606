Even though the line might seem like a sure sign of a quality establishment, this place falls short of its competitors. While the cuisine is interesting enough, and the concept is all right, the service isn't quite great. And after a long line the least I would expect is warm food, but that seems to be a bit too much to ask. Overall I wouldn't bother during heavy lunch hours as you might be disappointed by the temperature of your food. I recommend this place at its low traffic time. Maybe its better then?
