My wife and I had our wedding reception here.  All the food was AMAZING, all the guests agreed.  The food and service at this spot is great. We went back again tonight to reminisce, and the food and service was par for the course for them (great!).  This restaurant is  very loud with chatter, seating is very close to other tables.  Be prepared to be cozy.   Tonight's meal --The only downside of the meal was my scallops.   I had 3 very large scallops, other plates I saw had 4, though slightly smaller.  This would be totally fine except they were a little overcooked, the pan searing was a little dark.  One was very much more than the others.  My wife had a pumpkin pasta.  Delicious. In all, very very satisfied with this place, one of the best restaurants we've been to in the city.
