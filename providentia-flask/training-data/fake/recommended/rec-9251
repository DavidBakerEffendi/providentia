Okay i want to not say anything at all about , this wonderful halal cart,.. But i know that's not nice sooo... Every night after binge drinking during the school semesters,  we drive all the way to to the city ( from stony brook), and go to 53rd and 6th , and get like 10 platters, for the whole floor,!.  Gosh this is good grub , when your hungry as hell  after drinking ,. goodness!! gracious... get the lamb and chicken mix, get lots of white sauce and lots of hot sauce,.. . no salad, that's a waste.. .. and pour all the sauces on there,.  and that hot sauce is hot as shit ,.. and it will burn you , but man it is sooo good!,  just burn your damn mouth , and eat   yummmmmmuyy!, buy two bc , the next morning you will be wishing you had more , sober! ps.:  Who the heck named this place  by a street ,.. its freakin called .. " CHICKEN AND RICE!"
