Love coming to the place. Me and my GF would go a lot to 7A across the street a lot until we ended up having a bad late night dinner there and said next time let's try Yuca bar and let me tell you it was the best thing to happen, the food is very tasty and the cost isn't bad at all. It can get a little to full but they space the table well enough apart so you don't feel your on top of other people. Drinks are also good. Only problem we had one time was when we was ask if we would like drinks I ordered my drink as my GF said she will order in a few min because  she was not sure what she wanted. Then the waitress came with two of my drinks and when we said ' oh ' no I only order one. The waitress made it seem like the 2nd drink was what my GF wanted. As she took it back I notice we was talking blah blah to the other waitress about how my GF did order the drink. I did feel like saying something, but I just turn my head and felt. If you do not understand people because of the fact u don't no english to will you need to understand you may misunderstand a lot of orders. But I'm guessing the fact that my GF isn't spanish the waitress felt if she would speak spanish me or my GF wouldn't over hear well I don't think she notice I am spanish and did over hear her talking about  how the order wasn't wrong and we did order it, One thing I dislike is when people make a mistake and can't just let it go. But this is me reading into every little min I am there. Most likely I notice this because it wasn't as full that day with people. So if ur looking for good food and a good time. Yuca bar is a good place to go to.
