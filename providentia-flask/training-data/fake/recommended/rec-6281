The food here is excellent and the service is attentive and accommodating. Not surprising at all that it get packed here every weeknight. The meatballs, the shrimp orzo, and pretty much every dish, dessert and cocktail I've tried here has been memorable. Â Will definitely be back..a great place to take foodies!
