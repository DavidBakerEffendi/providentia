I must echo many sentiments in tribute to an absolutely phenomenal meal I've been dreaming about ever since -- the most absolutely decadent Â gastronomical festive experience (crawdads, lobster, oysters, crabs, ribs, fondue, pu pu platter, champagne and chocolate concoctions oh my) I've had in NYC -- and I grew up in da big apple. Ever since my best friend's bachelorette pre-party dinner there last year, where we got the bomb ass big booth and were treated like royalty, I've been fantasizing about taking a trip out from Cali just to eat there. Mmmmmmmmm. Drool. UPDATE 10/07: Indeed, I took a 24 hour stopover trip to NYC exclusively to eat at Blue Ribbon. And I was NOT disappointed...though since I was on a bit more of a budget, there was a level of restraint that still leaves me salivating over our stupendous bacehlorette feast...
