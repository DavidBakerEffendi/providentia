Dos Toros, how I love you. I moved from San Francisco 2 years ago and until this place opened, I wept daily of the lack of Mission-style burritos in the city. I tried everything. When I read that Dos Toros was trying to make Bay Area burritos happen, I went the day they opened. Now, don't get me wrong, I will never have a better burrito than my faves (Gordos, L'Avenida, etc) in SF, but Dos Toros is enough to feed my cravings. I want to go to there right now. I haven't tried the quesadillas or tacos Â but the chicken, veg, and carnitas burritos are delish and their portion sizes have increased since they first opened.
