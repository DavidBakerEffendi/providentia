The pan roasted goat cheese salad that I had here last week on Gay Pride parade day for brunch was soooooo average. I could of head over to some gourmet supermarket like Agata and Valentina or Zabars, get a slab of cheese and then head over to a supermarket say Dagostinos and made a salad that was the size of my head. SOOOOOO average. The price of it- 15 dollars was sooo un justified. The Cafe may be popular since it is located right in the heart of East Village and it's outdoor seating but the cafe needs to step it up a notch if they want to have some better salad offerings. We are in the 21st century so new yorkers tend to eat healthy and the salad offerings here just plain suck. Â  Perhaps maybe have a salad like roasted peppers with asiago cheese salad over bibb lettuce salad??? Also the earl gray tea was soooo mediocre. Queen Elizabeth would cry if she had this cup of tea. It tasted soooo bland.
