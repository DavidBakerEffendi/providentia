Decent food, good selection of draughts, terrible event management, bearable acoustics, friendly people, and overall a decent place to settle in for a mediocre night. If you're thinking of playing here, I've had only terrible experiences. The last time I played here, we had to leave for a friend's surprise birthday party at midnight the night of our show. We asked the door man if there was any pay for the event, and he said that we would have to wait for the end of the show in order to sign a contract to be paid. Not trying to do that, we asked how much it would be, and the door man 'estimated' about 5-10 dollars for the entire band. Now, in my experience, the person working at the door has only one job: to know how much money is coming in. Later in the evening, we received a text from one of the other bands letting us know that we had actually earned $60. This would have been a nice addition to our recording fund and worth waiting another hour. We played for their venue, we brought them beer-loving customers, and we spent money at the bar for drinks; yet, they did not even have the courtesy to give us to money that we earned. I don't play for an extremely popular band, but we are very closely connected with the following that we have. They've lost both an act and a friendly customer base due to this underhandedness.
