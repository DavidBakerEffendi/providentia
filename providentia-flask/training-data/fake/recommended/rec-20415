Sunday brunch is yummy! I had the eggs benedict, but they call it something else. Hamilton maybe. I don't like ham so I substituted bacon instead. It was great. Biscuits could have been more moist but the hollandaise helped with that problem. The manfriend had the short rib hash. Also good, but I think there's something about short rib that isn't appealing to me. He loved it, though. The one thing I did not get to try-their bloody marys. They claimed they couldn't sell alcohol till noon, and a virgin just didn't sound as good. I don't remember this alcohol law, though. Not sure what the deal was.
