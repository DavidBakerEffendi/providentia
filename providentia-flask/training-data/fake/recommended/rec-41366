I am somewhere between a 3 and 4 for Jolie Cantina but figured I'd round up because I think this place will be fabulous once they find their rhythm. My fiancee and I went here on Friday night since we'd heard they'd just opened and we used to go to Jolie on Atlantic. We found a great window seat at the bar and were given menus right away along with their house-made chips (though they were a bit stale) but had to wait about 10 minutes to order drinks even though the restaurant was only about 1/3rd full. Their wine menu was great and is very affordable however there was only one bartender and he seemed a bit lost but I assume its because of the new location/new bar. For dinner we shared steak tartare "a la mexicano" style, which was great! The flavors were subtle and not overtly "mexican" and served with fresh fried taquitos. Â We also shared the pork belly "chicharrones" which were more like baby pork rhinds (no skin and were crunchy like chips) but I thought they were a great snack for the bar. We shared two orders of tacos, beef tongue tacos and lobster tacos. They were both fantastic and felt fairly authentic (each on 2 small corn tortillas, with a large serving of meat and basic lettuce/onion garnish.) The meal was served with 3 sides of sauces (salsa verde, a chipotle red sauce and a mild, sweet orange sauce), all were quite nice though I would have liked a bit more heat in at least one of them as they were all quite mild for a mexican style restaurant. We didn't order dessert but had a quick look at their dessert menu which was similar to the original French Jolie menu and didn't seem to have any mexican-fusion dessert options which was suprising since the rest of the menu had very strong mexican influences. We will definitely be coming back here again soon. I believe that the minor glitches were due to the newness of the restaurant. I think Jolie Cantina will be a great addition/offering to the neighborhood and I look forward to my next visit.
