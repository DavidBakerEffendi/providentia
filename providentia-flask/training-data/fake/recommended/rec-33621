Excellent dinner--worth the trip from Manhattan to Brooklyn Heights, for sure.  Highlights were the flavorful chunky gazpacho, individual vegetarian pizza, peach cake, and dark chocolate gelato.  Next time want to try the mac & cheese, which looked great.  Pleasant atmosphere, lots of charm in a quiet neighborhood.
