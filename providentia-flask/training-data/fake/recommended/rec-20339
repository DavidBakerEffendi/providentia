Came here over the weekend. Cool lil' diner hole-in-the-wall vibe. Waited 15 minutes and sat at the awkward-to-sit-at-w/-2-winter-coats counter and after a bit of negotiation settled in. The vibe was down to earth which I love. The waitstaff was also down to earth and friendly. No complaints there. The coffee was okay - not spectacular (what's the fuss about Stumptown again?). The food is where I was extremely disappointed with my yelp people who have rarely let me down. I had the Tater Tot Heaven. The "tater tot" tasted more like a salty hush puppies sans the 'tater' - does anyone know what tater tots are btw? I wish someone warned me. I could barely stomach 1/2 the bowl because of how extremely salty it was. The hush puppies were salty, the jalapeno jack was salty, the eggs were salty...thankfully the guac was a cool bit of unsalty goodness that gave my mouth some relief. But once that was gone I found myself forcing it down my throat and washing it down with as much water as my mouth could handle. I went through 2 glasses of water and the thought of shoving more of that salty madness made me sick to my stomach. Maybe I caught the cook staff on a heavy-handed salty day but sweet jesus that was one of the worst breakfasts I've ever had. And breakfast/brunch is a meal I am well, well, well acquainted with. The Boy had chicken and waffles. Waffles were fine. Chicken was okay. We both agreed that white 'gravy' was unnecessary. I'm not saying this place is horrible. All I'm saying is - lay off the seasoning in the eggs if you're gonna serve it with salty balls & salty cheese, that's all. Come here for typical American fat-filled salty diner fare with fun vibes.
