I went by myself on a Sunday night at 4:30 because I knew that was the only way I would not have to wait an hour to have ramen. Within 5 minutes I was shown to a table for 6, where 5 people from 2 parties were already comfortably seated. Well, this is awkward. I ordered a Samurai cocktail which was amazing - strong but still a little sweet. Feeling less awkward now. When the ramen got to the table it was so good that it was completely worth the entire arrangement. No friends, no meaningless chatter, no interruptions....just ramen. Perfect.
