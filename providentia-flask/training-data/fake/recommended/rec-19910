I would've given 4 stars b/c honestly the food was good and the decor is nice too. We didn't wait long on a Sunday evening and overall it was cool. The only thing that put a damp on this place and probably affected my decision to return is the fact that egg shells were found in my honey pineapple fried rice. That's an absolute NO NO!. We told the server and she brought out a fresh new plate(maybe) LOL, but that's just not cool.
