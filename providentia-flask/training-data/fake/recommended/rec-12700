Honestly, I'm not sure what the hype about this place is all about. I think the food quality at La Pulperia is mediocre at best. The salmon brulee was highly recommended on yelp, and although it was good, I didn't feel like it was anything special. The fish ribs were somewhat bland and had disgusting, slimy fish skin on them. I had high hopes for the sangria-braised short ribs, but the sauce that comes on it is too bitter for my taste. Forget about asking the waitstaff for recommendations on what to order...it doesn't help when you ask and they end up rambling on about every item on the menu. 3 stars, and I think I'm being generous.
