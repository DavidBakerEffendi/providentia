Sanford's was a great place to have brunch. Â Although the wait was long it was well worth it. Their prix fix menu offered a variety of foods . I loved that they offered a variety of alcoholic beverages as well as tea, coffee, or juice along with your meal. The portion sizes are filling. Our waitress wasn't great however the bus boy made up for where she lacked. Needless to say he received her tip :). Defanitely will be returning
