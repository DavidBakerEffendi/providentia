This was my first time eating at Andrew's Project, and will certainly NOT be my last.  I am new to gluten-free eating, and decided to check out this place since I was out of town and it got positive ratings here on Yelp.  Well, I must say -- what a fantastic GEM!  The owner was so kind, and courteous, and his children helped bus tables, and were as sweet as he is.  All of his food is 100% gluten free and homemade, and were clearly cooked with love.  I had the Swedish meatball pasta and it was so yummy and plentiful, that I am fortunate enough to have leftovers for tomorrow.  My mom had the pea soup (served with a side of gluten free bread), and it must have been the largest bowl of soup I have ever seen!  Again, it was delicious and surpassed any pea soup she had ever had before.  I am about an hour from Andrew's Project, and will definitely be making the trip back to try other treats on the menu.  It is so worth the drive.  Oh, and one last word of advice --- The owner recommended the Mushroom Coffee, which we immediately declined, just because it didn't sound desirable.  After the owner told us all about the health benefits, we decided to share a cup between the two of us for the ride home.   WOW!  WHAT A TREAT!  It tastes and smells like coffee, is sweetened slightly with almond milk, and gives such a natural boost of energy that we will DEFINITELY be getting that again!  GET THE MUSHROOM COFFEE!  You won't be disappointed!  :-)  We are already planning our next trip back!
