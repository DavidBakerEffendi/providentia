Pat's is really a tourist spot more than anything else.  It's not that there's anything especially wrong with being a tourist spot, but Pat's is not someplace to go for a special meal.  Most people want to compare it to Geno's, which is another tourist spot.  Comparatively, Pat's has better bread, the meat and cheese are the same, and Pat's fries are not as good.  They offer the basics: cheesesteak, pizzasteak, fries, etc.   If you are visiting Philadelphia and you're in the Italian market, I say go for the experience.  You're not going to get a sandwich made with any heart or soul, but you can say you did it.  If you're not in the Italian Market area, it's not worth the drive. Please keep in mind, Pat's and Geno's (and most of the italian Market) are all Cash Only.
