I'm happy to welcome this place to my hometown! I'm not really much a burger person but I really enjoyed the junior cheese burger I got. They are made fresh, not frozen. It was juicy, the bun seemed fresh, and the fries came out hot (but unremarkable). You can basically customize your burger toppings because they are made to order and their menu offers more than burgers too. Their beef chili was also pretty good. I'm much more of a chili expert and id give this one a B- Price-wise, I was satisfied. Two burgers and fries with two sodas and the chili came to about $20. The staff (Justin in particular) was super friendly and attentive to customers at the tables. They kept the tables clean and wore gloves while handling the raw meat. For lunch or a quick casual Friday night bite, I would definitely come back.
