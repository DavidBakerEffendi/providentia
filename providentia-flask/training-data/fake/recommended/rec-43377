Lombardi's is a classic and supposed to be the oldest still operating pizzeria in America so it is a MUST stop for any visit in New York.  It's nothing fancy.  No bells and whistles.  No happy birthday singing, meal deals, or 1001 different crazy toppings.  It's great pizza done right.  Simple and tasty and it leaves you wanting more.  This last visit it just so happened that it was our anniversary and this was where my wife wanted to go.  We had a LARGE margarita pizza and it was delicious.  Light and crispy!  We managed to finish the whole thing off (last time we got a small) but we justified our pigginess with a) it was our anniversary, and b) we had just walked around Liberty and Ellis Islands for about 7 hours.  The best thing about it, besides the fresh flavor and pizza goodness, is that it wasn't greasy.  We didn't feel slimy or gross like you sometimes can when you get pizza.  I'm not sure what their trick is but it's obvious that they've perfected it. In the interest of full disclosure, I am a thin crust kind of guy.  I've had deep dish and I appreciate the existence of deep dish and can understand why people like deep dish.  However, if I'm going to have a choice between a great slice of thin crush NY style pizza and deep dish...I'll choose thin crust every single time.  They have only three kinds of pizza here but I highly recommend the margarita - its what we've had the past couple of times we've visited.
