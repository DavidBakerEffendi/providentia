yes, it's cute. but in a very precious way. yes, the decor is warm and comfy. but only to make up for the cold and disaffected waitstaff. what restaurant promotes a "drink coffee while you wait!" policy and then RUNS OUT OF COFFEE?!?! this is a friggin brunch place people, purchase some extra coffee for your inventory! the food is decent but nothing to write home about. but my friend's fries (which came with some but not all the egg dishes) were tastily crisp and dashed with a mixture of herbs. the best part of my meal was the company-- we laughed our way out the restaurant, dismissing the sourpuss look on our waitress' face by blaming it on the lack of caffeine.
