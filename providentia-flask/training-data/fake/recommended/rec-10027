I work across the street from here on Thursdays and decided to try it out for dinner one day.  I ordered the Harissa flavored Falafel sandwich with wheat pita (I skipped the Tahini).  It was really good!  The portion size is fairly generous.  The place is pretty small, so it's not necessarily a good "eating out" experience if you're going out with friends, but it's a good place to stop by if you're on the go. I would give this place 3.5 stars.  The food was pretty decent, I'm just not really a falafel person.
