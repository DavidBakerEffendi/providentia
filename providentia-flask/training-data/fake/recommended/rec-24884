Chef Mackenzie Hilton has done it up again. This is one of the best restaurants in Philadelphia. We were just by again on Friday and I had the petite sirloin with scallops on top. All I can say is mouth watering!!! Literally! If you like Italian Mercato is the place to go in Philadelphia. The restaurant is a BYOB that has a rocking great menu and an even better dessert. This is one of my partner and I, favorite BYOB's in Philadelphia. I always have the petite filet and he usually gets the Ciopinnio (?) The dishes are always great and bringing your own wine makes it that much better! We are huge fans of the molten lava chocolate cake for dessert. The staff has always been very friendly and accommodating. If you are in Philadelphia or just visiting make sure you try Mercato.
