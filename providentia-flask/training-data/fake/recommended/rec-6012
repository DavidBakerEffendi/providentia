Our original plan was to try to eat at Cafe Mogador again (had tried going once before, turned off by the hour wait, we went to a nearby Persian join). Same problem and again we thought of trying something close by. Fortunately, East Village is full of great places and it is not difficult finding another place through yelp. Pylos had amazing reviews and we like Greek food, so we thought, why not. The hostess gave us two choices, we could wait for half an hour or we could do the community seating. We were famished and hence, chose tha latter. We started with the Soutzoukakia Smyrneika (meat sausage in a tomato sauce), which was delicious. For the mains, we had the boned chicken, which was pretty good as well. The portion sizes were large enough to feed the two of us (they give bread on the house to start). Brilliant food and lovely wine. The only downside was the seating, with the guy in the couple next to us constantly making fun of his partner, chastisizing her for not knowing that Amazon is a loss making company, lol. So our tip is to definitely make a reservation before you go because you don't want to be stuck on the community table, sitting next to strangers. But definitely go for the food and service, which is awesome.
