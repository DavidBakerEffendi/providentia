1st time here I would have given 4 stars. Nice enough decor, very good food slightly over priced. The linguini with sea scallops and chick peas was absolutely perfect. Pork shank and short ribs over mashed potato for our entrees were also very good. Loved the experience as a whole. Been back twice since, both times HORRIBLE. The pasta with scallops was mealy and starchy, tasted very strongly of fish. I ordered it a third visit and had the same awful result. I don't know if it depends on who's cooking but this pasta dish went from great to inedible. Had the pork ribs over fried polenta. Ribs were meh, very salty. The polenta tasted like it was fried in dirty oil. Was excited about this place after my first visit. Too bad they aren't consistent enough. The neighborhood needed a good small plate italian wine bar. This is definitely NOT it. Wont be going back.
