I really enjoyed this place a ton. I visited my best friend this weekend and she brought me here. It reminded me a lot of Honey's Sit n Eat in Philly! I loved the homey vibe. First off, our waitress was super nice and attentive. They had soy for my coffee which for some reason is hard for me to find. I didn't get anything crazy just eggs your way, but so good and the perfect amount of food. Oh and I got a side of bacon, holy hell there were at least 6 slices of bacon on the plate. Very pleased with this place i would definitely go back on my next visit!
