jesucristo, the pizza here is freakin' outstanding, and i've sure eaten a lot of pizzas in my time.  don't remember what i got, but the crust was amazing and the the sauce was herby, whatever that means.  It's overkill, but the beer selection here is sprawling and interesting, with international, local, and organic (?!) favorites.
