Love Rossy's. It's only a block away from home so its become our go-to spot when I just don't want to cook. Having had my kitchen remodeled for an entire year this was the place to eat. Their shrimp ceviche is great! I love the toasted French bread served up front with an excellent spicy sauce. My favorite of their meats if the pork chop with vinegar peppers.... Do delicious. Have been here a lot! NEVER a bad meal!
