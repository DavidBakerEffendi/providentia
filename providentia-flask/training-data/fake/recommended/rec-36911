Okay, WONDERFUL HEART ATTACK FOOD!! Try finding something this yummy and fattening in LA. Won't. Happen. I had dinner here and like the other reviewers I had the macaroni and cheese which was DELICIOUS! I consider myself a macaroni & cheese connoisseur so you can take my word on this. Call me crazy but I sort of like the fact that this place has lost a little of it's polish as such a hot spot. I never have to wait for a table now and the staff's attitude has improved drastically.
