One of my most beloved restaurants in Philadelphia. All our visits to Aimee Olexy's gem have been memorable. We first went just days after they opened, to celebrate a friend's birthday. There were no "opening" issues--food service was flawless, prompt, and friendly and the food itself was mesmerizing. It was a fall menu and my friend had the chicken entree that was the most delicious chicken dish I've ever encountered. I honestly had no idea somebody could make such a simple protein taste that wonderful. All our visits include a cheese tray because that's Olexy's calling card. When you're in the home of a cheese bar as beautifully laden with exotic, rare, and fantastic cheeses like Talula's Garden, you'd be foolish to skip this course. Brunch with the family here was also an experience--everyone was besides themselves with glee at their various choices, the coffee is superb, and the breakfast pastries were divine. Finally, I've had some of the best cocktails here as well! The lemonade with huckleberry delight from last summer was so good, I clearly committed it to memory. Of course, their "artist" cocktail is a standard and always a fine choice. The attention to detail here, in both food, presentation, service, and surroundings are praiseworthy and a visit here is always worth the wait. Perhaps most impressive, is the fact that such astoundingly excellent food and service comes without an ounce of pretense. There is nothing stuffy or obnoxious about the staff, food, or environment here and I feel like I'm back with friends every time we visit.
