We showed up for a typical Friday night dinner at Royal Masala a few weeks ago. Though an impressively decorated facility, we were surprised to find the restaurant completely bare. We were the only ones in the dining room upon being seated. A few more parties trickled in as the night wore on, but the whole experience certainly did not elicit that "this is the place to be" feeling... The food: It was good, but I've had better. Particularly disappointing was the lamb Vindaloo dish I ordered. Now any Indian food connoisseur knows that a dish called "Vindaloo" should be the spiciest dish on the menu, if not one of the spiciest. What I received was a decently prepared dish, but it was not Vindaloo. Let's just say I was not halfway to crying after two bites of my dish, as would be normally expected :). My girlfriend's Chicken Tikka Masala was solid, and the breads were good, but I reiterate, nothing to write home about. So Royal Masala gets three stars... They need to up the ante a bit to compete in the Hartford Metro Indian Food scene.
