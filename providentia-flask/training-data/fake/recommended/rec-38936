Whenever I'm in the area and have some extra time to get lunch I go to Marco's. Great food, great value, great service. They have a deal where you get 2 huge slices of pizza and a drink for about $4. They let you put whatever topping you want on the slices, not just what they have already prepared and they load you up with the toppings. The whole staff is always very polite and they actually appear to usually be in good moods, that makes a big difference in a service industry.
