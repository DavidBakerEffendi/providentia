Hand's down the best water ice in the entire world.  They have iced tea water ice.  It's so amazing too.  I like mixing it with lemon.  The pink lemonade water ice is incredible too.  The thing about Italiano's that is so good is that the consistency is incredible.  There will not be one chunk of ice in your water ice.  Anyone who likes Rita's will never want to get water ice there again after having Italiano's.  They also invented the Gelati and are the reason everyone else in the city calls it a Gelato.  They don't have the rights to call it a Gelati.
