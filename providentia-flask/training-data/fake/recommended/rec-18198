I LOVE the Hinge and often go out of my way to visit.  The iced coffee in the summer is reason enough (and get something from the bakery.  You will never regret it). I've only eaten dinner here once but I loved it.  The bowl of roasted brussel sprouts was hard to finish because the serving was huge!  My dining partner and I both got a bowl and couldn't even stop to take a breath.  We devoured them.  Perfectly pan-seared, not too oily, and just spicy and garlic-y enough without hitting you over the head. The "Japanese Meatballs" or whatever it was called (the menu changes monthly) sounded risky but I went with it because they're vegetarian.  I was right to take the risk.  Imagine Japanese soul food... and you've got these.  They were everything you love about Japanese food, crammed into a ball, and lightly fried.  Served with cold soba noodles, I was in heaven.  My waitress provided some extra peanut sauce to dip the "meatballs" in and it was perfect.  My friend ordered some sort of fish dish and loved it, tho I don't recall the particulars. Brunch, on the other hand, is something I frequently grab at the Hinge and LOVE.  The breakfast burrito will keep you full all day.  I don't have a single complaint or negative thing to say about the brunch here. In short, go to the Hinge.  It's a BYOB with a diverse menu, friendly servers (one of them just won the annual  "Best Waitress in Port Richmond" prize according to the owner), and one hell of a brunch.
