When I first went to Penelope, I was floored. The place is super cute and the staff is pretty friendly. Loved their breakfast sandwiches. But over the months, the place became a lot more popular and now the wait is around 40 min to an hour for just two people. When we finally do sit down, everything is so rushed and the food just doesn't have that oomph to it anymore. Started exploring more items on the menu, but the waffles are too dry and the vegan meat substitutes are a horror. Now I don't think it's worth the wait. There's no more 'soul' to the food anymore. :( Also, this place seems to attract lots of young parents who refuse to control their screaming babies. Not a fan.
