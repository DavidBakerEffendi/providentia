This place is quite a gem!  It's quaint, snug, has a good crowd and a polite staff. The drinks were unique (made with their own bitters) and tasty, and food was good.  It's a mix crowd 20-40's, intimately lit, slim walkway with seating at the bar and areas to rest drinks.   Price: $$-$$$ Service: friendly Groups: The space is not too big, it's good for a group of 5-6 max, there aren't tables to seat everyone but standing room is available.   Would I come back? yes! And I would recommend checking it out!
