Yum! This place is soooooo good. As I rarely give any establishment 5 stars this means a lot. I've been here several times for lunch and have enjoyed it very much. Inside the restaurant feels like you've escaped NYC and ended up in some beautiful summer cottage. The mood is very relaxing. I'm not a fan of eating crepes as meals...only as dessert. However, this place changed my mind and I can go for a crepe anytime of the day now :) I ordered the La Paysanne crepe both times I've been there and it's unbelievable. Others in my party have ordered the spinach crepe, the sausage crepe, and several of the dessert crepes and I've heard nothing but amazing reviews. Crepes are between $9-$10 but they will fill you up. It takes a lot for me to not ask for seconds...I always leave here super full after one crepe. Everyday there's a lunch special - $9 for any crepe + drink (I always get coffee as my drink and the coffee here is suburb. I just wish they were open in the mornings so I can get my coffee from here). A note - they don't open up until 12:30PM on weekdays. On weekends they open up at 11AM for brunch.
