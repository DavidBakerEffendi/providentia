A great modern version of a biergarten. Not having to be strictly beholden to being so overtly German like most German themed biergartens, you can just enjoy Â the pleasant surroundings and giant mugs of beer. Yeh they have mostly german beers and german influneced food, but you don't feel like you're in Little Gelsenkirchen. The fire pit is a fantastic touch, as are the ping pong tables. The food was good and the price point was ok. Not great, but neither was terribly troubling. I was planning on hopping around to different bars in the area, but I had such a good time here I just ended up hanging out for twice as long as I originally planned. There's just something I love about drinking beer at those picnic tables with those types of benches on that super fine gravel.
