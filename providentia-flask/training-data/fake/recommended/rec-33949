Holy-MOTHAFUCKIN-SHIT. The FOOD. The FOOD. The FOOD. Adventurous, tantalizing, delicious as fuck, this is one of the best meals I've had. In life. All 24 years of it. Â  Rather than go for the mains, dinner consisted of small plates, paired with a side of excellent, attentive service. Oh, and the owner is a winner of "Food Network Star." Just sayin'.
