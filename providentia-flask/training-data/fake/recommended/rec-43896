I'm a New Yorker and you're asking me to review a flatbread pizza style place.  Ok, here it goes.  It's nothing compared to NYC but it is really good.  Daniel and I shared a typical large flatbread with tomato and cheese and whatever not; it needed parmesan and basil because the flavors fell a little flat.  Even though I'm not supposed to eat meat, Daniel's friend gave me a piece of his sausage flatbread and that was amazing,  I will say.  The deserts there are great and so are the beers.  Service is also good.  I will definitely be coming back to Burlington and here again, not to worry.
