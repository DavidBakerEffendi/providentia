I have been to Pacifico for a birthday dinner, restaurant week, and salsa night. I'll address all three experiences in my review. The birthday dinner was excellent - great service, great food, and a great atmosphere. I had the skirt steak with lobster, and even though I'm not a lobster fan, Pacifico convinced me. Their tableside guacamole is also pretty decent, but make sure you split with someone (mainly for the cost). This place is quite expensive and depending on your budget, you may or may not find it worth it. That's where restaurant week comes in - it's a great steal for restaurant week. They don't make a special menu like some other restaurants do: the same items on their restaurant week are on their regular menu. They make the place a little crowded to fit more people, but the food was just as good when I came before restaurant week and they didn't make the portions smaller (a common problem in New Haven for RW). Their salsa night is also great, but beware, it's really crowded. It gets hot so quickly and if you are an avid salsa dancer (unlike me) you won't be able to show off your awesome dance moves. For those trying to break into the scene, though, it may be nice to skirt between the floor & the bar. My one complaint would be the drinks. There are not many places where you'll find an excellent mango mojito or margarita. While Pacifico has great drinks overall, some of their more fruity drinks like those mentioned are way too sweet. One will be enough for the rest of then night.
