I found this on yelp, when I was visiting NYC. Sometimes that works....sometimes it doesn't. Fortunately for my friends and I, it TOTALLY did. This was our favorite meal we had on our trip. Just peering into the restaurant made me immediately want to be inside. It's homey decor and intimate lighting made for great atmosphere. There were four of us, and then entire restaurant was full. It's a small space, however artful the table arrangements had been set up. And yet, the four of us were completely cozy hanging out in the "perch." How fitting. And adorable. The staff was absolutely amazing, serving us wine and free appetizers that were a delicious precursor to how good the food would later be. Â By the time we were seated, I didn't even realize we'd been waiting for almost 30 minutes because the staff made it feel like an experience rather than a drag. My boyfriend and I decided to split a meal, which they conveniently put onto two plates for us without charging. Seriously amazing buttermilk chicken and lobster soup appetizer. It was the best overall experience with amazing food. If you are in the West Village, definitely visit this wonderful little treasure.
