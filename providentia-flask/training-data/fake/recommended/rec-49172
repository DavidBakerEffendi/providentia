It was the perfectly cold ( 7 degree ) day to be seated in Pedro's section for delicious blue moon beers and chicken sandwiches and burgers. The big wooden booths were warm and inviting and the chicken sandwiches were moist. Pedro was sooo nice! When my friends and I got up to use the restroom, leaving only Natalee sitting alone, Pedro felt bad and brought her a shot of tequila! The menu is simple, the beers are cheap, and it's a hit. Oh, and on the way to corner bistro, we ran into Peter Dinklage walking his dog (Miles Finch from Elf).
