I'm not quite sure what everyone gets out of this place. It clearly relies on the fact that it is on a block overrun by pizza places and bar food - and people who don't want to walk to Avenue A to Zargoza's for real tacos. First off, there are some cool things about this place. The vibe is good and it manages to have some seating in a tiny place. Now, onto the bad. I paid $17 for an al pastor quesadilla, a 12 oz.. can of soda, and chips/salsa. For that price in that neighborhood, you can get some really incredible food. It's absurdly expensive. The chips and salsa were both good. The can of soda was, well, a 12 oz. can of soda for $2.70. The al pastor was beyond bad. I could barely even discern the actual meat and was left with a plate of grease when I was finished - on top of the napkins I needed to pat my quesadilla down with. I haven't even patted down a pizza hut pizza with this many napkins. Strangely enough, the taste was very good. If they would just use about 10% of the oil they used, it would probably be an excellent place. That being said, I am going to wait for someone to tell me it's no longer greasy until I try going back.
