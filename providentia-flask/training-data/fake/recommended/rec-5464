This is really a tiny hole in the wall. I went on an early Thursday evening about 5:30 but I am not sure how easy it would be to get a table otherwise. The wait staff was cheerful and friendly, complete with Australian accents.  They were also very attentive; especially when my friend spilled her glass of water on her lap! They give you tiny plastic  glasses of wine for $6 (I think it looks small because of the glass, but the glass is actually pretty full. This isn't really a wine bar, so I didn't expect much and this was perfectly fine. I imagine beer would have gone better with the burger anyway!) My friend and I shared the pumpkin salad and the Whaley's burger. Both were tasty, but next time I would go right for the burger (which comes with a nice side salad of its own). The burger was large (and messy-they put the ketchup on for you!) and tasty. The meat actually had flavor and seasoning in it, and the beet, pineapple and fried egg was a nice touch that added some fun texture. I also really liked the bread that it was one, more of a Panini than your typical bun.  I would definitely go back and want to try those smoothie combinations...it is a cool, casual, open-air, laid back spot.
