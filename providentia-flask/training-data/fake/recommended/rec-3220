I live close to this place so I've been around since Egans and (subsequently) Halcyon opened. I also heard the reviews from friends about the insane wait times so I've never gone on a weekend. When they first opened they didn't take reservations, but I've heard that's changed (for the better). As my regular "middle of the week place" in town I've always enjoyed the service, food and ability to get a table immediately upon arrival. Because I am a regular it would be hard to comment on every meal I've had so far, however last week I ordered the soft shell crabs and they were the best I've ever had! Â I've been testing these seasonal delicacies anywhere they serve them for a solid 25 years. (they usually only stick around for about 3 weeks on any menu in May/June) The Halcyon version were lightly battered, pan seared and covered with a moist mountain of salad mixed with avocado, grilled corn, tomato and a perfect light dressing. Oysters: I also try these everywhere I go and tend to lean toward Kumumoto's. This time they were a bit small (which makes the VERY tiny!) and the flavour was bland. We tried 2 others and weren't really impressed. Usually I like their oysters buy this time I was glad we only ordered 8 before dinner - not worth it. Servers always remember us and are attentive. But again, I've never gone on the weekend and keep my visits to Mon, Tues and Wed.
