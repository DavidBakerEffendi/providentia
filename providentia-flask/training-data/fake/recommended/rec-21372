Silk City is best described as a 1950s diner meets a 1970s disco overcome by hipsters.  The Pork Belly Empanadas are delicious, a must order.  I had the Ham Hock Mac & Cheese, it was heavy on the Mac & Cheese, light on the Ham Hock (I think there was some in there).   The reason for the 3 stars is the service.  It is your privilege to be able to be served at Silk City (at least if you are sitting in the Lounge).  Do not expect anything more than your dishes to be changed and your check.  In fact, the most attention that was paid to us was when it was time for the check.  Drinks were empty (thank goodness for water), and I don't think I saw our waitress until it was time for the check.
