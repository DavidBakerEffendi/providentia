As others have mentioned, the burger is fantastical. The duck fat fries are great; the whiskey list is extensive. The drinks are really phenomenal in my opinion. I liked the Fish House Punch. The place is a little small, and the tables are very (very) close together--like, have a conversation with your neighboring table, reach over and steal a french fry close. As long as you're sitting next to nice people this shouldn't be a problem though. I would definitely go back, even just to try the many different pickles on the menu!
