This is our go-to brunch spot! The brunch specials are always interesting and delicious, and the regular menu is delicious as well. I'm a huge fan of their pancakes. The original pancakes are yummy, as are the special pancakes they often offer - lemon ricotta pancakes, carrot cake pancakes, cookie dough pancakes, etc. The service is usually good. We always try to get there by 10, when they open, especially if we have more than 4 people.
