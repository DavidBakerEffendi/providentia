Probably a 2.5.  Honestly... Not amazing. There are a million other choices that do more for a foodie around. Tables are on top of one another and it has a little bit of a chain feeling to it.  If you go here... Equestrian the tables on the upstairs balcony (still inside) or the back room. I liked the concept of their pasta trio and the special pastas of the day and everything with the never ending fresh pasta, however I didn't think the dishes I had were anything special... Making me really want a different option. Other meals at our table were: The lamb shank... It was pretty big and enjoyed. The lobster fra diavolo was delicious with squid ink spaghetti and a pound and a half lobster plus clams and squid, etc... Huge and delicious. Wine selection was good Caesar salad was good.
