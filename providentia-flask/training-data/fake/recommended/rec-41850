Really tasty ramen in a little shop in the East Village. I've eaten in crowded ramen shops that really focus on getting you in and out of there quickly and I totally get that experience, love to marathon shovel some noodles into my mouth in the privacy of my own home, but that pace isn't for me when I go out. Minca is a nice middle ground--they had room for two right away (8pm on a weeknight) but it was still pleasantly bustling. A little less lovely than a lot of ramen shops, decor-wise, but the food is worth it. I was able to get vegetarian ramen (wavy noodle with egg) that was super flavorful and full of vegetables, including corn which is my all time favorite for ramen (a nice crunch). Hot sake comes in a cute little bottle, perfect size if you're heading to another venue afterwards. Our server was very sweet and attentive, plenty of water refills and let us sit for a while before dropping the check. Not sure I would travel great distances for it, but definitely on my list for Lower Manhattan. Cash only.
