I live in the area, and Slate is a somewhat recent find for me.. probably first went there in May. However, since finding it... I can not leave and go there about three times a week. My first and only time inside the restaurant (I usually bring my dog and sit outside) I loved the intimate vibe.  They have a good drink and wine list and it adds to the mood since it is very dark inside.  Kind of got a boudoir feel.  The waiters are all very friendly and attentive, which is kind of amazing considering about two of them work the tables at one time. The owner (Domenic I think?) is usually there and wants to make sure that you have a good time. We often order take out and he will give my boyfriend a beer on the house while he waits and or will throw in a free dessert.  He treats his regulars like gold... even the dog gets some meat. What really draws me is the excellent veggie options. I love the vegetarian gyro and there green curry tempeh.  Its amazing!  For the meat eaters out there, my boyfriend has ordered most of the menu and has never complained. I think Slate exemplifies great food and a great staff that values your business.
