We stopped in Burlington for a night on our honeymoon roadtrip and had a fantastic dinner at EB Strong's. It was by far the best meal we had in our weeklong trip. The cocktail was perfect (French 75) and the food was incredible. We started with the calamari, and my wife had the scallops while I had the steak with mashed potatoes. There was nothing left on our plates by the end of the meal. We finished off with the cheesecake in the mason jar. It was a unique presentation and tasted amazing. Will definitely be back here again next time we swing through Burlington.
