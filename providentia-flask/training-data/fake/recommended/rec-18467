I've been waiting for Mu Ramen to open for half a year and finally got to eat it during their soft opening this week.  Note that it is a soft opening so they're still working out all the kinks, but it was solid from start to finish.   We came with some foodie friends who didn't mind sharing and ordering everything on the menu, yay!!   Starting with the appetizers, the U&I is a staple favorite for any Uni or sushi lovers out there.  I love any place that uses fresh wasabi.  The mussels were delicious with their spicy sour dipping sauce.  The chicken wing stuffed dumplings are like thanksgiving wrapped inside a chicken wing and deep fried - so good.  And last but not least, the highlight of my meal (and this is not to say that the ramen isn't amazing, but this is just so unique) the Okonomiyaki.  It's not your standard japanese pancake, this is a soft and crispy, with some kind of custardy center, smoked trout and salmon roe on top with a maple syrup sauce.   For ramen, we had the Mu Ramen, which has New York & Korean influences, based on oxtail broth and corned beef topping.  This was such an interesting fresh take on your standard ramen.   We also ordered the Tonkotsu 2.0 because I can't go to a ramen place without getting the Tonkotsu, and this doesn't disappoint.  The owner / chef Joshua does a great job creating a rich broth that isn't too fatty or salty. And the nitamago topping I ordered was perfectly gooey in the center.   Can't wait to come back next week with another set of friends.  Just FYI for groups - the max party size is 4 so plan accordingly.
