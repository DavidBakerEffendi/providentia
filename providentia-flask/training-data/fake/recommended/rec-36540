Consistently great food and ambience. Excellent for sharing a little of upscale TriBeca dining with visitors. Try the beef tartare, it's the best I've found in NYC. We usually just turn up, put our name down at the desk, and wait out for our table at Smith and Mills bar across the road (also 5 stars).
