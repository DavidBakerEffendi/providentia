They have two valet lots you can park in which is a plus because parking can be difficult in the area. I would recommend making a reservation but walk ins are okay too, you just may have to wait a bit. The description rates Fernandes as $$ but I think its closer to $$$. If you are in the mood for meat you want to go with the Rodizio. They also have a great selection of seafoods. Make sure you have a pitcher or two of sangria. It's delicious here.
