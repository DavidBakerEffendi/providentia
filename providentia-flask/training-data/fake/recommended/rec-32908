Good coffee. Poor store layout. Huge space but not enough seating or tables-- most of the shop is just empty nothingness. Also I ordered the quinoa salad and it's really bland and boring. The food menu isn't very accessible-- the list of items doesn't have descriptions beyond "quinoa salad", so I had to ask what was in it.
