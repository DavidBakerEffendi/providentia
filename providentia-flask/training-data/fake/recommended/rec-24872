I love this place.  It's amazing how a mish-mash of a million different flavors and textures comes together and tastes so fabulous.  Seriously, it's like  a symphony. I must admit the first time I had chaat I was not impressed.  On a whim and with a deep craving (who gets cravings for something they don't like?!?) I declared that I absolutely had to go back.  And boy was i glad that I did. As most others have said Hasan is perhaps one of the nicest business owners in The City of Brotherly Love.   The strawberry lassi is my new favorite, the samosas are incredible (especially when dressed up with the sauces) and the crazy chicken chaat is like a modern art project both to look at and to taste. If you've never had it before let them know, you'll get a brief lesson in all things chaat.
