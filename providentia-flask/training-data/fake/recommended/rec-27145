The Empanadas here are delicious and just right ! I love restaurants that cook their meals in the same taste and caring way, even after years, the flavor does not change. Empanadas are made with corn flour, whole grain or white flour texture. My all time favorite is the platanos maduro con queso/sweet plantains with cheese and the Hawaiian. The cod fish one is also delicious.
