A total fan. Drove by so many times and never realized it was there but introduction to bacon popcorn definitely starts me to drool and wonder what other surprises are ahead. Everything was good from foi gras, oxtail, bbq wrap, buns. Homemade ice tea Although fresh lobster and ingredients and quite a display- was not very impressed with taste. But still love this place and can't wait to go back.
