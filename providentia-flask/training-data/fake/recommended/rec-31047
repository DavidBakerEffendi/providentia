All I can say is I absolutely love this truck! My first taste experience was yesterday when I just happen to be on campus on my way to the bookstore. I wind up getting the Chicken Caesar crepe which was soooooooooooooo good! They also offer so many other choices of crepes to choose from. I can tell you that the crepes are really huge and for $5 bucks you can't really get any better than that. It's an inexpensive meal for a great price. I want to try the delicious dessert crepe one day, which looks quite tasty. I want to also mention that they now accept credit & debit cards, which is pretty cool. So this means more check-in's for me! I would definitely recommend coming here if you happen to be on or near the Temple campus. The truck is really easy to find, but in case you are not sure where it is just pull aside a random Temple student and ask them "Hey where is the truck with the $5 big crepes?"
