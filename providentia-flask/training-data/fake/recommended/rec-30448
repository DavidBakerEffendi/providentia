I would have liked to give this restaurant more than two stars as much of the experience was pleasant, however two things occurred that were pretty serious IMO. First off, I will say that the service was terrific.  Had a reservation on a Saturday night at 7:00 and we were seated within seconds of arriving even though the place was packed.  Our server was also terrific. The one thing though that i found completely shocking was that after i was told about the evening's "special" and proceeded to order it, the server came back and told me that they were completely out of the special.  At 7:00????  I mean, I could understand that happening if my reservations were at 10:00, but to be that early in the evening and be out of the special seems like some seriously poor planning. I ended up ordering the pork shop and wasn't very pleased with it.  It was an extremely fatty piece of meat and I ended up not even eating half of it. Having said all that, the rest of the food was extremely good.  All the appetizers and sides that we ordered were extremely tasty and again, the service was excellent. But the fact that the main part of the meal was horrible and that they ran out  of the special so early on, forced me to give only two stars.
