Lovely place in the village with beautiful decor and excellent food! Generally my biggest gripe about Italian is when it gets too heavy, with tons of cheese and heavy carbs, and this place proved to me that it doesn't always need to be that way. The mussels are fantastic, same with the crostini and the arrabiata. We also had the tiramisu and the daily special of tilapia, which were all incredible! If you love Italian flavors but hate being food-coma'ed for 4 hours, this is a great place to go for an intimate and not pretentious night out. The ambience is really romantic and the authentically Italian waiter told us to "Enjoy this beautiful night!!" at least twice with such enthusiasm that I couldn't help but laugh! All the servers were so helpful with their recommendations. There was a bit of a wait on a Thursday night, so be sure to call in and show up on time as to not lose your place, but it's worth every minute! It's pretty far west on a tiny corner with no craziness, which is perfect is you just wanna escape NYC for a couple hours :)
