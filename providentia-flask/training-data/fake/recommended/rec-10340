I used to go to this place a lot about 10 years ago and it was very good then but  I just visited it recently and did not have a good experience.  We tried ordering our food on the phone to pick up but the person we dealt with could not speak English very well and had trouble understanding what we wanted.  So we drove over to order our food in person and point to the menu what we wanted.  We ordered an eggplant sandwich on their gourmet sandwich section, which was supposed to be grilled eggplant, grilled zucchini, avocado, and goat cheese on multi grain bread.  They still could not understand what we wanted but finally we thought they got it.  Apparently not because when we got home it was an eggplant parm sub.  We also paid for our food when we ordered it and after waiting a long time for it to come out the same person that we paid before argued with us that we didn't pay for it.  We had to pull out our receipt to prove it to them.  The place was not busy at all so I don't understand why it was such a long wait.  The owners should make sure that they have someone there who can speak English well and that knows their own menu.
