I came here on a Thursday night a couple of weeks ago for my boyfriend's birthday.  It was our first visit to The Good Fork and it certainly lived up to the hype! Absolutely loved the interior design of the restaurant.  Comforting and rustic in an intentional, polished way.   It was a quiet night, only a few other diners at the restaurant and the service was impeccable.   We ordered the Pekin Duck Breast and the Steak & Eggs Korean Style.  OUT OF CONTROL delicious.  I love duck and always order it when it's on the menu. This may have been the best duck I have ever had.  And oh my god, the steak & eggs korean style was incredible.  The kimchi rice served with it was perfect.  I would eat this entree every day.  Seriously, I would. We ordered sorbet for dessert and the restaurant sent out the dulce de leche and pasilla pepper ice cream on the house since it was my boyfriend's birthday.  We were so appreciative of the restaurant's kindness.  The sorbet and ice cream were both delicious.
