Ok.  this is SO not a diner.  It may be a fine dining establishment.  The food may be great.  I wouldn't know, I went there at 11PM sunday night looking for a greasy cheese covered chicken salad sandwich with fries and got a snobby waitress with a farm to table menu.    As I said, this may be a great place to eat.  But it is not a freakin diner!
