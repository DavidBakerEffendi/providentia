I didn't have a chance to sample any food but I did sample plenty of delicious beer and I would never complain about that!  I must say my virgin experience at JB's was pretty awesome.  I bought tickets for someone as a gift and thought I would tag along to hear a band I've never heard.  The performance was great and the actual venue is perfect.  I scored a spot on the steps which gave me a perfect view of the band and the stage without any heads getting in the way.  Even though it was packed, the crowd was pretty mellow and seemed to be enjoying themselves.  I only took a quick walk through the first floor and noticed how large it was.  You can still come here and chill out on the first floor bar even if your not heading to a show.  My father was telling me how my grandpop used to drink there regularly before it became what it is today and the more I can get back, the more I can see myself doing the same.
