Got here after a night of bar hopping and surprisingly, the line was only 15 people deep and was quicker than a $2 hooker trying to get a buck. I got the chicken/rice platter and it was time for the sauces. I was warned about the red sauce so I put a little bit into my platter and then had a quick taste. "It's not so bad," I thought to myself. So I proceeded to drench the platter in red sauce. You see, I can handle spicy foods. Or so I thought... I felt like I was in a cartoon. My mouth was set ablaze and I swear there was smoke coming out of it!!! I was running around looking for water to quell the intensity of the scolding lava sauce. Luckily somebody had water. It really didn't help. I scooped out most of the red sauce and ended up putting some white sauce into the mix to ease it up. It kind of helped. Conclusion: Their chicken and rice was amazing. Even though It was scorching my tongue I still pushed through and finished it. It's seriously crack in chicken/rice form.
