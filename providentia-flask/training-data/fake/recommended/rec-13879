so after my great brunch experience, i recommended cafe orlin for dinner with a few of my cousins. bad decision. not only was the food very mediocre and bland (we had the tilapia, ravioli, chicken, and linguine with tomatoes and garlic) but the service was slow and rude. we had a hard time having our waters refilled and an even harder time getting the attention of our waiter. at one point, i stood up and waved to him across the room. he acknowledged that he saw me and then waited another 10 mins before approaching our table. sigh. my bubble has been burst.
