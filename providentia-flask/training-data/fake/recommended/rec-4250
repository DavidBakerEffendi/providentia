This is the best thin-crust pizza I have ever had.  I never imagined pizza could be this good.  It goes down so easily that my friends and I have a rule: always order pies in pairs.  Just to cap things off, the wings are as good as it gets.  The salads are worth ordering as well.  Pastas, on the other hand, will do the job but usually seem a bit limp.  Make the trip for the pizza.
