This place is fantastic for a snack with friends or a quick, cheap date. It can get super crowded at night in the summer, so be prepared to take the fries to go. The servings are huge so two people can easily split a "regular" size and be satisfied. For sauces, I recommend the parmigiana peppercorn and sun dried tomato mayo.
