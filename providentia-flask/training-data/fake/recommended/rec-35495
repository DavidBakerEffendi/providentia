Everything here was out-of-this-world delicious. Very small and out of the way and I think the kitchen must be the size of a closet , but you wouldn't tell by the deft service and delivery and presentation of the food. For a table of vegetarians, we had lots of options, tried several salads and pasta dishes, and shared bites. Not a single thing on the menu we wouldn't recommend. Finished the meal of with small glasses of pompelmocello Â (limoncello but made with grapefruit) - highly recommended, if you like grapefruit, of course.
