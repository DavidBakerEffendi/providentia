I've been here before, but tonight it was truly exceptional and worthy of 5 stars.  I always love the pork belly steam buns, but tonight they seemed a bit subdued.  After that the meal was excellent.  The dishes weren't always perfect, but they were all tasty and different.  Brussel sprouts, pig face, pork shoulder, and beef tendon oh my.  Everything was good, but the brussel sprouts with spicy puffed rice was my favorite.   My wife thought some of the dishes were salty, and I was drinking, so while I disagree, she may be right.  Regardless, I can't wait to get back...I'm a momofuku disciple and I hate peaches.
