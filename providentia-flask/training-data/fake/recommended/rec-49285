The food is mental awesome, and if you don't go here to eat, you're a moron.   I met Steve, the owner, at the counter as soon as I walked in.  I told him it was my first time to his place and asked him what he recommended for my friend and I to eat for our first visit.  We told him we eat everything and asked him to make us whatever he thought we should have.  He made us two plates with various items - blackened salmon, fried chicken, rice and beans, Mac n cheese, collared greens, fried ocra, sweet potato, ribs, cornbread.  It was off the hook.  These guys are very down to earth, friendly people.  For people who drink, it is byob - no big deal, because there's a package store next door.  This place rules, and Steve and his buddies are awesome.
