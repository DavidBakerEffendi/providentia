I've been to Asiana House, Sakuraban and Koto.  These places are pretty expensive but their chicken and beef teriyaki very good.  So when I saw HJ House, I had to try it out.   Their beef and chicken teriyaki is only $11.99, compare with $14,99 or $17.99.  And it came like a stir fry, which was nice.  It was also delicious.  I've gone there three or four times now.  Why not?  You can't really beat that price.
