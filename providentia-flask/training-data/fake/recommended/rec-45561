I may not be a native Philadelphian, but since we have friends in town, I'm about as familiar with the brunch scene here as a Brooklynite can be. Â I've tried pretty much all of the major spots, and I think this might be the best. The scrapple in the focaccia breakfast sandwich was fantastic, as was the biscuit (though it was inexplicably square). The house-made ketchup was so great that we were seriously considering finding a way to sneak the whole bottle home with us. My only issue was that it took us 45 minutes to get seated, but I think we're all familiar with Lou Reed's immortal words about Philly brunch: "The first thing that you learn is that you've always got to wait." Other than that, the service was great, and I'm already starting to plan a trip back to try the rest of the menu.
