This restaurant has got to be one of the best restaurants I've ever been too. The food was great and the staff was AMAZING! I lost count of how many of them came to our table. There was our waiter, the guy CONSTANTLY refilling our water, the guy clearing our plates, the guy delivering our food, etc. All of them were extremely courteous and made us feel like a million bucks. We gladly left them a well deserved tip and if we had the money we would have given them more. My friend and I had the following: Appetizers: - sweet corn & cheese (Soooo good! Tasted like a pizza minus the crust.) - black iron shrimp Entrees: - lamb kebab (Delicious! However I did wish the portion was a bit bigger.) - kafta Sides: - phoenician fries Dessert: - ilili candy bar (ONLY get this if you LOVE chocolate! It's great but I must warn you the chocolate is intense. It was almost as if a fudge brownie and a Hershey's bar came together and made a baby who they then baptized in a shower of chocolate sauce.) - labne cheesecake napoleon (This was....HEAVENLY! When they brought it out I almost forgot my friend had ordered cheesecake because it looked like a smore tower minus the chocolate. The "cheesecake" was more of a soft spread that was squeezed onto filo dough and then layered. Beside it was a sea of strawberry sauce filled with diced strawberries. The taste was divine. At first you tasted the crispiness of the pastry and then cheesecake hit you but then a moment later you taste yogurt followed by a lingering rose water sensation. THIS IS A MUST HAVE!) I cant wait to go back again! =]
