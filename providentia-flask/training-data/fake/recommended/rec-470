So so good! This place is amazing and such good quality food! I'm obsessed. My friend and I tried the Fingers, the Fiesta, the General Sticky Tso, the Buffalo Balsamic maple, and the Fire Flame Curry. The ingredients are great and everything simply tastes amazing. The Fire Flame is incredibly spicy so be warned! The sauces are also pretty spot on, but very thick. If you like a lot of cream in your sauces, these are for you. Honestly, the fingers don't need the sauce! The sauces go much better with the truffle fries. If you like A LOT of truffle like I do, then these are awesome, if intense. The place itself is tiny so I took my meal home. Don't expect to sit down! The only thing I will say is that I was told to get all the fingers fried and not grilled so I can't comment on that. I'll try the grilled versions the next I am back, which will be soon!
