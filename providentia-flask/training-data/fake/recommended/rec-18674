This place is great. And if you go with a group so you can share and try different things... even better. We loved everything we ate here. It was reasonably priced. And it was crowded (aka popular!). Some items we got and liked a lot... Watercress salad, gai kua, Thai noodles, crispy pork belly, duck salad, some kind of sesame or cashew chicken... shoot, I forget!! I should have written it down. Anyway, I think we ordered 6-8 dishes for 5 people and it was perfect/a bit too much.
