Who can resist a glass of wine and eating al fresco on an early spring evening? Well, not this gal. I saw Uva was one of the few places that had an available outdoor table so I asked to be seated immediately. The outdoor ambiance was nice, the wine was fine (not knock your socks off, just fine - I had the uva merlot) and the polenta was so rich I could hardly finish it. The servers were constantly hovering, not pushy just overly-present, which kind of took away from the relaxing meal I was looking for... Overall, I'd probably go back but skip the meal and just order a bottle of wine to go with the yummy bread and olive oil.
