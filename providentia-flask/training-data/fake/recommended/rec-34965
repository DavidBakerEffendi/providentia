I call this bar "craft bar" - which angers people that are meeting me there because there quite literally is a "Craft bar" somewhere in manhattan.  I digress. Beer?  Good.  Beer here?  Realllllly good.  They have a bunch of different beers at this joint.  They have their regular menu and a constant change about the other beers.  And they're all phenom.  They even have tips for you cats that don't know how to order anything other then a "bud light".  The last time I went here, my coworkers ordered a ton of delicious smelling food ranging from wings to hummus...but we were headed out for fried chicken and I really didn't want to spoil my appetite.  But let me tell you...it. smelt. gooooooood.
