Since there are literally over 1,000 reviews, I'll get down to it.  Love this place because it is always just a party.  Really.  Noon on a Saturday?  Party.  10:30 pm on a Tuesday?  Party.  But no matter how fun the atmosphere, I wouldn't love it if the food weren't good, and it is.  (Duck confit just sayin')   Expensive, so don't complain since their prices are posted on their website.  Don't attempt without a rez.
