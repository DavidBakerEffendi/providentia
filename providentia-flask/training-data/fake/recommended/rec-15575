YES. I love these food carts because you get much bigger portions than a lot of other halal carts, but mostly the HOT SAUCE. You heard me. I am a spice freak and normally don't get hot sauce on my halal food because I feel that if you are not sniffling over your food after getting hot sauce put on it, it just ain't right. I am a bit saddened to see that the prices are now $6 and not $5 (it's not really much of a steal anymore), but nonetheless their hot sauce is bomb. I recommend the lamb or beef over the rice with extra white sauce and hot sauce. I think one small squirt is good for people who don't like their spiciness as intense as mine. I like to drown mine in hot sauce, I always pay for it with about 30 minutes of panting and sniffling before I cave and get something sweet like ice cream, but I think it's so worth it. This is not a place to frequent (especially during normal hours when people are out as the lines do get long) if you've got a hankering for cheap delicious halal cart food, but it is something you should try at least once. Unless you don't like hot sauce or don't plan on putting it in your food. Then the prices just aren't worth it. Just go to any old halal food cart/truck/stand and ask for extra white sauce.
