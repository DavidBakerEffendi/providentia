Went there for dinner during the week. Food was awesome. The GRILLED SIRLOIN was amazing, as well as, a few of the sides. The self serve bottomless draft was perfect, such a great idea. Service was nice and the evening I was there they played hiphop all night. Was just a great experience for dinner.
