Fun tapas bar.  Truly great sherry cocktails (and I typically despise wine cocktails). Appropriately comfortable yet hip village decor.  & the most delicious creative sundae I've had in a while.  Food is limited in scope but if you love bruschetta, charcuterie, cheese and pickled veggies then you have plenty to choose from.
