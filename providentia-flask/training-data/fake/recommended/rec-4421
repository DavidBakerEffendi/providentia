I came out to Johnny Brenda's last night to see a show (Memory Tapes) and I had a really good time.  The upstairs is a great place for live music complete with a little balcony with some seats.  The bar has a ton of options including some delicious craft beer on tap, as well as some local beers (Yards!).   I'll definitely be back in the future to check out some shows and have a couple of beers!
