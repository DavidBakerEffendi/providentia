Jimmies = a Farmington Avenue tradition going back to the 70s. Nick & Marella run a nice restaurant with good food, competent staff, providing an enjoyable lunch or dinner. Parking can be a bit tricky during peak times but always worth the stop, Jimmies is a West Hartford landmark popular with many generations.
