After I wrote this review the owner very pleasantly contacted me to let me know that, although the waiter hadn't informed me, there are ways of combining "sides" to make a full meal rather than ordering modified full meals in order to save money. I thought it was a great sign that the owners actually care about what their clients think, and while I would have appreciated the waiter letting me know about the options the first time, I appreciated the attempt to reach out. I'll be back.
