Had a fantastic meal the other night with friends.  Excellent cocktails, great entrees and impeccable service. I also loved the fact that the music was not obnoxiously loud. Particular high notes include the bread basket (OMG the whipped ricotta!), the octopus appetizer and the cauliflower. However, there were a few lows. The broiled oysters were not really cooked which means my pregnant self could not enjoy them-- wouldn't have ordered them had I known.  Also, my vegetarian friend was going to order the cod but thankfully, someone else in our group asked how it was prepared-- poached in duck fat.  So, just be a little careful with the menu if you have any dietary restrictions-- things may not be what they seem.  Finally, the desserts were a little disappointing-- some interesting flavors but lacking that wow factor. All in all, I would go back to Dover in a heartbeat.  It's a great addition to Brooklyn!
