We used to go to Edison just to get Vietnamese pho. But then they moved out. So my wife find out that there's 1 Vietnamese restaurant in linden. We tried it and didn't like it at all. So we googled & found this place. Even closer from us. The food much better than the one in linden, the waiter was very nice. This is our new favorite pho restaurant now. P.S Cash only!!!!
