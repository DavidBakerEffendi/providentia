I used to go to Moaz all of the time. I didn't want to like Mama's. I didn't want my friends to be right about how good it was. Bottom line, I suck for waiting so long. The falafel is better (well seasoned, and not too crunchy), the wheat pita is not cardboard-esque, the pickled cabbage is awesome, and the humus is great. The combination of solid falafel with a good pita and the right sides makes this place seriously seriously awesome. I am so critical when it comes to food, so when I fall I Â fall hard. The atmosphere is dingy and kind of gross. I wouldn't eat something if it dropped on the table, but I pretty much put on my rose colored glasses when I'm there. This spot looks like it belongs in Slumdog Millionaire, but again I love the simple food and that's all that I care about. It's cheap too. They are closed a lot though. Very early on Friday and closed all weekend I think. ***I bought a ring for Mama's and I'm hoping she'll say yes. We will be very happy together.
