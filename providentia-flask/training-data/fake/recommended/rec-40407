wow, this may just be my new favorite place to eat.  after reading all the good reviews i decided to give this place a try and anyone who gave this place a good review has got it right....cozy, comfortable, friendly and quick all come to mind as i think about what it's like to eat here.  and while the atmosphere is good, its the food that counts right?  well you won't be disappointed - the portions here are huge and the food is delicious!  do yourself a favor and get the appetizer sampler, it's a great way to try a few of their apps, all of which are great.  the gyro here is outstanding, usually a good mix of crusty bits with more moist bits mixed in, its excellent.  i've had the gyro platter (huge) and gyro over greek salad (again, huge) and both were delicious.  someone i was with got the lamb shank over orzo which was amazing.  this has become a must-go spot for me and once you try it, it will be the same for you.  outstanding
