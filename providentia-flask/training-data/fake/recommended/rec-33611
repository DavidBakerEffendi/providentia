Amazing! Our waiter was wonderful, attentive but not overbearing with a sense of humor and an attention to detail. The food was outstanding! I highly recommend the quinoa hushpuppies, i couldn't stop eating them! I also loved the octopus appetizer, it was cooked perfectly. Honestly everything was delicious. I kept eating way after I was full just to be sure to clean my plate. This is a great place for a special meal, I personally couldn't afford to eat here often. But next birthday or anniversary you'll be sure I'm booking a reservation!
