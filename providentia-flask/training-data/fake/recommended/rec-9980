FOOD: The food is great and surprisingly very cheap. You can get a whole rotisserie chicken for less than $15. AMBIANCE: The restaurant is separated into two different areas. Upstairs is quieter, with tables for fewer people, and more quaint. Downstairs can get loud, caters to larger groups and is huge. I was shocked on how large the downstairs area is and how high the ceiling was. WOW: Whenever someone is having a birthday, they play a birthday song very loudly and waiters bring cake while singing happy birthday. One night there were 7 birthdays during the 2 hours I was there. Can get kind of loud in
