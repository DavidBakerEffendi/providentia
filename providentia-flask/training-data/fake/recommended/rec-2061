I heard that roast pork sandwiches are supposed to be the new cheesesteaks in Philly.  At least that's what the Food Network has led me to believe.  So we decided to try Dinics which was featured on some Food Feud War vs Bobby Flay reality show (I think it was on Man vs Food to be honest which is on the travel channel, but that's beside the point). The roast pork sandwiches...the pork was juicy, but it was a little on the salty side.  The spinach was good, didn't feel too wilted or too wet.  Cooked very well.  But the sharp provolone...I think that was a little too much for me and it overpowered the sandwich.  The bread was probably the best part with it being crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. You could definitely tell with the long line, that this was the most popular place in Reading Terminal Market.  I would definitely like to come back here to try their brisket and their other sandwiches... But the verdict is, I don't think I'm that big of a fan roast pork sandwiches.
