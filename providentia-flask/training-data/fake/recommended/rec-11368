My wife and I love to frequent Johnny Brenda's. The outdoor seating in the spring and summer months is a must. The food never disappoints. In fact, their cuban sandwich is the best I've had in Philly. The beers are all local draughts. The interior is inviting and the service is friendly. I haven't seen a show yet, but I'd recommend the Sunday gospel brunch. Of course I'll be back.
