At about 6PM, me, the wifey, and two friends decided on Alta for dinner and I called to see if they had any reservations and they told me not til 10PM :-(  We went anyway to see if we could snag some seats at the bar, got there at 8, and the hostess informed us that since they were in the process of seating the 8:00 reservations that they may have a table within the next 15 minutes.  So we went to get a drink at the bar and didn't even have a chance to finish perusing the cocktail menu before we were seated!  Score!  The only caveat - we had to be out by 9:30 for the next reservation. Alta is a big, loud place.  So loud that it was difficult holding all-inclusive conversations between the 4 people at our table! I liked the idea of Mediterranean tapas with hints of Italian, Greek, and Moroccan thrown into the traditional Spanish.  The tapas were executed well and we enjoyed them.  Had the bacon wrapped dates and olives, additional olive plate, spanish cheese plate, avocado relleno, tuna tartar, beef carpaccio, gnocchi, pork empanadas, and grilled mozz skewer.  All were good, none absolutely stellar.  Two of my friends had the red sangria and DID NOT like it (I only had a sip but agreed), so whatever makes their sangria "non-classic" they should avoid!  My wife and I split a bottle of Txakoli.  All that plus an espresso and snifter of sambucca at the end totaled $180 w/o tip.  Pretty reasonable. Wound up leaving around 9:45PM and weren't rushed at all.
