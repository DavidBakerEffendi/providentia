I have been here twice for dinner and never once walked away with elation when I  came here. The reason I came back for the second time was because this place is very cute and they have out-door tables plus I like to people watching while dinning. I love to eat and I know what is delicious what is not. The food in this place is more like New Jersey diner taste to me. I might feel full from the food but not really happy of the taste of the food. Their bread and butter is delicious but I can't just order that can I?  By the way they only take cash and be ready to see a 18% gratuity add to you bill.
