Went here after a day at the Museum of Moving Image. What a treat! I had an assortment of things, but some standouts were: white bean crostini, chorizo crostini, tuna spread crostini, the fried eggplant panini, & a special chicken panini of the day. The baby string bean salad was also really yummy. I felt the brownie we had for dessert was lacking. It felt too heavy, but I'm pretty picky when it comes to brownies. I can't wait to go back to sit outside and enjoy some of their other treats they have to offer!
