Penelope is so great. When I lived in the neighborhood, this place was really my go-to spot. It's quaint and cozy, and has belly warming comfort food. The space itself is not so big, but there's always a crowd, so make a reservation when you go. And be sure to try the mac n' cheese. You can't go wrong.
