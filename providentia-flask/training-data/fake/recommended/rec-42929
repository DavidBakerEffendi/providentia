Stepped in on a cold Sunday evening hoping for a nice glass of wine and got so much more than that!   I loved sitting at the bar in the dim lighting and chatting with Matt, the friendly and patient manager.  Matt recommended our wines and they were right on target, especially the Pinot Noir- though a bit pricey at  $17.  Ordered three different cheeses and the plate came with cherries and pine nuts and some toasted bread all of which were delish.   We ended the night with some sorbet and gelato which also came highly recommended by Matt and he did not fail us. The coconut sorbet was refreshing and the rum raisin gelato was super creamy and just the right amount of sweetness.  The check comes out in a little notebook and you can leave a message- which we did, of course! Can't wait to go back- we hear they serve a great lunch.
