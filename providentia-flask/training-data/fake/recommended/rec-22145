I think that the service here is a bit disjointed; I think we had 3 different people help us (1 person took our orders, 1 person cleared our table, 1 person brought out the food, which was staggered oddly i.e. bread came out last), but the food here is fantastic, so I wouldn't worry about it too much. We popped in for a Monday night dinner and ordered way too much food; we figured we'd order a few of the smaller plates, but got 4 items, thinking that they'd be small portions. Wrong! We had the pig tails (freaking delicious; like eating a tiny, meaty rib) and tater tots, the beet salad with beef tongue, fried brussels sprouts, and cornbread with jalapeno. Each was served in a giant bowl, all of which we happily cleaned. They have a great draft beer selection, and the smokey old fashioned was A+. This place serves up some tasty, reasonably priced comfort food - I'll be back for dinner again and hope to try the brunch soon, too.
