Beautiful pizzas are made here in an old building by the Brooklyn Bridge.  The location has the ambiance of a basement but who gives a care about that!   Pizzas are absolutely delicious.  My favorite is a white pie with fresh tomato, garlic and chicken.   I have eaten at every single Grimaldi's in the Las Vegas area and I'm glad they faithfully deliver the same great pizza.   Also, it's less expensive than Lombardi's in SoHo. Staff is cheery and friendly and very appreciative of your business.
