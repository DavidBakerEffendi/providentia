Based on my experience, 3 stars is probably a little generous. Admittedly, I was recommended to try EO for cocktails, but I was hungry so ate as well. I found the venue nice, and the service ok, but the food average and over-priced  (bone marrow puffs = oily, and the chicken and beet root something = bland and tasteless). Plus, my apéritif, Vespa, was not to my liking. Could be good for a drink with friends, but I won't be returning for food.
