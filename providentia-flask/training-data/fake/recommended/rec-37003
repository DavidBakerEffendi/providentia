See Gabby D's comments, as I have the exact same ones having been there with her that fine evening, except I had the namesake pork "momofuku ssam" wrap.  fucking delicious.  And while some things on the menu are quite pricey (drinks, bread and butter), the ssam wraps were very affordable. I found the "we do not offer vegetarian friendly dishes" warning on the menu quite amusing. Good times all around.
