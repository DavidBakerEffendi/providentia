I like La Va for its vintage, laid back atmosphere and tasty treats. Coffee prices are a little on the high end, but I am supposing this is more to cater to the newly gentrified surrounding areas than the regular South Street indie crowd. My husband can't get enough of the Dark Side of the Moon chocolate cake, but I personally am more into the coffee and atmosphere than the chocolaty treats. LaVa sits at a location still close enough to the small businesses of the area but far away enough that it's not filled with tourists with loud children. I typically see lots of people doing work on their laptops, although I hear they boot you out after a certain amount of modem time, which in a way is both fair and messed up at the same time. In general, though, they have a decent selection of food and pasties to tide you over and they're only the second coffee shop I've been in that serves Turkish coffee. So needless to say I'm sold.
