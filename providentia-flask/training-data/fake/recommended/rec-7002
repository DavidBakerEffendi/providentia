This place is so great! Went for brunch, had the chicken fried steak and eggs. So delicious. The biscuits are really good too. Can't wait to go back for the chicken fried steak dinner :) The best thing about all of it is there was no obnoxious two hour wait to sit down. We walked right in. The staff was very friendly. Go to this place!!! You will be so happy.
