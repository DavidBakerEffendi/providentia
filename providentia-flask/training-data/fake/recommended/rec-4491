The Red Hook Lobster Pound has one of the best lobster rolls I've ever had to eat. They're a tad expensive so after one I wanted another, which could be a problem for your wallet. The shrimp roll was good but the lobster one is definitely the way to go. The interior is neat with the large lobster tanks and decor. A definite stop if you're down in Red Hook.
