Nice place, attached to the hotel Monaco right in OId City, so it definitely has that sort of feel..as in you know its attached to a pricey hotel even if you come in through the restaurant. We came here for a birthday party, for a Saturday night in Old City I figured the place would be packed, but our party of 8 was seated up on the higher level by ourselves! It was nice they had the space for us but a little strange to be secluded like that, in my opinion. Anyhow, the food was very good, we shared a few appetizers (the fries...oh lord the fries were awesome), which were tasty but like most things here, a little overpriced. Main dishes were also delish, I couldn't even finish my salad covered in massive shrimp. We had dessert there since it was a birthday, it was so decadent we shared 4 among ourselves and had trouble finishing them. The service was good and the quality of the food was wonderful, but I am giving it 3 stars because of the price and the ambiance. Maybe the downstairs was different but it felt a little too trendy upstairs by ourselves for me.
