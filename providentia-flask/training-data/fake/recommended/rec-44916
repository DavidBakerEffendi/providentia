Nice place for brunch. Music was a bit loud. Drinks were nice and strong though. My friend's salad nicosie looked declicious. Wish I had ordered it myself as the eggs I had were not particularly special, but then again you can make yourself some eggs and/or salad any day, so really your paying for the nice view of the river.
