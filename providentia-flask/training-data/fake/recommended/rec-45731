This small place hidden amongst small shops in Astoria Blvd proved to be a real gem. It is not easy to spot it, but once you learned about it - you'll be sure to come back. The owners is a friendly young couple who are passionate about the food, and it shows in clean, but rich flavors they put out. The menu is small but its has plenty to satisfy a craving stomach. Their beef brisket is to die for. Just yum. To me the best way to savor it - is to order it in a Wafco. It's just something else. Light, bursting with flavors from pickled carrots and daicon, fresh cilantro. And their green sauce - a must. This is by far my favorite item in the menu. I gave a try to their pork belly, tamales, salads, and peanut butter tart - and everything was fresh, light and flavorful. I want to try all of their sides people have been raving about. This is a plan in action. I think it's a great addition to our Astoria scene. Please give it a chance. They need our support to be able to stay on. I hope they will stick around.
