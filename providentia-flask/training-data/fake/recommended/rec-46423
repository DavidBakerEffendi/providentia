Came to Desnuda as part of a my boyfriend and I's 'food tour of Williamsburg'.  I really enjoyed this place.  Who can say no to truffle popcorn and swaying fans?  Ordered the lobster ceviche and a kale salad - both were pretty awesome.  The salad had a great combination of flavors with seaweed, nuts, citrus and kale.  Ceviche was a bit spicy, but not overwhelmingly so.  Service was good including relighting our candle soon after I blew it out due to dropping a piece of popcorn it in!
