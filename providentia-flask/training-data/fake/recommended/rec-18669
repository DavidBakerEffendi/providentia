Delicious food, and they have a secret menu! Say what?!?!?! Yes its true, I had to ask about a five spicy duck burger that I saw on yelp, because I love me some duck. They told me it was on their secret menu but they didn't tell me anything else, hmmm? Anyway, I went around 9:30pm and they told me an 1.5-2 hr wait but it ended up being 30minutes. The food was paced but nevertheless came out faster than some fast food places I have been. Â Salad came within 2 minutes of ordering, then the drinks came, then right when they cleared the salad the fries came out ,and within a few minutes of the fries coming out the burgers were delivered. Besides the delicious duck burger, I highly recommend the tuna burger and truffle fries.
