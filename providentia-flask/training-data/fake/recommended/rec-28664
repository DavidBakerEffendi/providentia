I just want to thank Hu Kitchen for providing a safe place for Celiacs to eat.  You can't imagine the surge of culinary freedom we feel when ordering off of a menu, no questions asked.   Moreover, I love knowing that what I'm eating is not only gluten-free, but healthful, wholesome, nutritious and deeeelicious.   High five, Hu Kitchen!
