I promised myself that before I left New York, I needed to try some authentic thin crust pizza. After I witnessed Adam from Man v. Food try both Chicago deep dish pizza (which is next on my eating bucket list) AND New York thin crust pizza, I knew I had to have some for myself. My friend who just recently moved to Manhattan knew that Lombardi's was (supposedly) the first pizzeria established in America, so we decided to give it a go. I called to see if a reservation was necessary, but the man who answered the phone told me, in the thickest New Yorker accent you can imagine, "Nah you don't needa reservation. We got lotsa room heeah at Lombardi's." Soon enough, we found ourselves in front of Lombardi's and its iconic Monica Lisa mural on its front wall. We walked in, waited for maybe 2 seconds and were whisked away through a labyrinth of hungry people, pizza, dough, flour and stairs. We were finally seated and decided to go with the classic margherita pizza with sausage. Fifteen minutes later, the pie came out and, boy, was it pretty. It was huge, first of all, but if you have four or five people in your group (especially if you have guys), you may want to order two pizzas. But I digress. We each took a slice and WOAH this was the stuff right here! It was good pizza alright. Now I don't know if it was the tacky red plaid table cloth, the cherub paintings on the ceiling or Lombardi's reputation, but at that very moment, I felt that I could not be having a more authentic pizza experience. But why four stars? Unfortunately, the pizza did not blow me away. Sure, it was SOLID (and I mean solid in every way imaginable) thin crust pizza, but I wasn't completely wowed. Nevertheless, I'm glad I came here. Really glad. Thank you, Shoko O.!!
