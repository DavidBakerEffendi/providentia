We were really hungry and not familiar with the area at all, so I just looked up nearest eateries. This one came up with 4 stars, so we just went for it. What a mistake -I usually read lower grade reviews before committing. This is the worst Vietnamese restaurant I've been to. For is bland - chicken overlooked, meat tasteless. Service was OK though, and decor is nice. So go there if you don' care about the taste. Not me.
