I was compelled to stop by after reading the uh-mazing reviews - I was not disappointed!!! We both tried the Super Cub Classics and chicken and lamb taco's to boot. I've always loved vietnamese sandwiches but you can really taste the quality of the ingredients and care in which they are prepared here. Everything was fabulous and with two drinks the price for a very filling meal came in at under $20. I hope that these guys - who are exceptionally friendly and attentive - go far and prosper!
