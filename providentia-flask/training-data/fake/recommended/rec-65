Probably the best Italian I have EVER had. And not only is the food delicious, but the ambience is classy, understated, warm, and welcoming. Our server, Amanda, was very sweet and helpful in recommending items on the menu as well as explaining their "family table" concept. My boyfriend and I chose to sit by the open kitchen, which was fun to see the kitchen staff of chefs at work preparing all the tasty dishes. The chef even sent over a dish of amazing steamed mussels for us "first-timers". We were almost completely full off the baked pecorino, heirloom tomato bruschetta, and the loaves of delicious rosemary-olive oil bread. However, when our main dishes arrived, we couldn't resist the housemade pasta and seared chicken. We ate almost half and Amanda boxed up the rest of it for us to take home. The carafe of house wine was also a perfect accompaniment to a delectable meal. All in all, decently priced, high-quality, complex ingredients, and a fabulous place to sit, sip, munch, and enjoy the ambience. Can't wait to come back! Oh and did I mention it's only a block or so away from our apartment??
