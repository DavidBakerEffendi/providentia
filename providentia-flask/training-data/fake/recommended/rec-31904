There are a lot of quality burger bars in the East Village, but Royale definitely stands out.  The burgers are huge, quality meat, and fresh ingredients.  They got some good beers on tap, and some good tunes in the juke box.  This place doesn't get packed either, so there's always a seat.  It's a little pricey, like $12 bucks for a burger and fries, but you get what you pay for.  Get the Royale with cheese, medium rare, extra tomatoes, and hold the Pulp Fiction references.....
