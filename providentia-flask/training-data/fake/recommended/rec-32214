Have never had a bad meal here. The shrimp and crab quesadilla is amazing for lunch, and the marscapone French toast is to die for. The service is great, all the girls are so nice and accommodating. The owner is in there helping when it is crazy busy and he's so down to earth. My favorite spot to eat!
