Ate here for the first time last night and was impressed. Small but cool, intimate space. My wife had the burger special which was a pork and bacon mix. I had the regular burger. Both burgers and the fries were excellent. I don't agree with the complaints about the prices being too high. On average, it's a little more for a few, but certainly not all items on the menu. For organic, locally sourced food that in my opinion was well prepared and tasted great, it's very fair. Service was good too. Definitely recommended. We walked in at 7:00 on a Friday and were seated right away, but would recommend reservations, especially for more than 2. BYOB? Of course!
