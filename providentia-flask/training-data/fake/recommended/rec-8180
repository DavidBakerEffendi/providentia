Finally, good Chinese food in University City!  We tried the lunch specials, and they were excellent -- fresh and delicious dishes and only a few dollars more than hitting a food cart.  There are lots of vegetarian dishes on the menu, and most of them are tofu and veggies instead of fake meat (what is up with all the fake-meat Chinese places in Philly?).  The five-spice tofu with chives was particularly good.   The one downside was that dishes marked spicy weren't even a tiny bit hot.  We actually ended up requesting hot sauce, and I saw other tables doing the same.
