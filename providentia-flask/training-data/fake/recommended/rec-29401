Weird place. Sometimes the food is really good, sometimes it is not so great. Apparently it consistently is changing ownership. They give you a lot of meat, but sometimes the meat is a bit dry. Chubby's across the street may be a 'safer' choice. It's one of those places that when it's at its best, it can compete with anyone in cheese steak land. Unfortunately, you never know when that is.
