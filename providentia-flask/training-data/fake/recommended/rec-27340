I won't ever turn down a bar that offers a free shot upon Yelp check-in. . . unless it's the end of the work day and the sausage-fest is about to begin. Like most Irish-style pubs with sports playing on the TV and loud men yelling across the bar, Three Monkeys definitely caters to the crowd that could use a cold brew after a long day. My friends and I enjoyed the various hot drinks and the "make your own dog" platter, complete with every topping imaginable. (Heaven.) I can't say that I would make a special trip here, but there is always a seat available (if not downstairs, check upstairs) and a full bar with a friendly staff.
