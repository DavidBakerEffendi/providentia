What a super cool place in a super cool neighborhood. I went on a Saturday morning...Quite possibly the best brunch I've ever had. The caramelized banana french toast was exquisite...It opens at 11:00AM - we got there and secured a table at 11:15 and there was a line-up out the door by 11:20. Its a "must go" place for brunch. Quintessentially NY!
