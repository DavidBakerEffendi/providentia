I was disappointed. The place is cute, the waitress was fine, and the menu looked delicious. My pork barbecue sandwich was dry until I asked for more sauce, but the meet was gamey tasting and not a standout at all. My husband had a delicious burger. The kids had mac and cheese - totally tasteless, like a cream sauce with no cheese - chicken fingers (fine but ordinary) and a hot dog declared to be "delicious." We waited fifteen minutes for our bill after the waitress said she would bring it right back. Prices are reasonable.
