Some days, this place is phenomenal, some days it's just okay.  I've come here many times for the dinner prix fixe and realized that when the head chef is in the house (Mornings and Weekends), everything is cooked to perfection and the service is great.  When the head chef is out, the food is still good but just lacks the wow factor in taste, and the service just seems confused (wrong serving plates are used, slow service in bringing things out, etc).   That being said, on the good days, you can take anyone into the restaurant in the most terrible mood and everyone will come out of the restaurant completely satisfied and happy because the food is just that good.  I have taken many friends here and the consensus is that when the head chef is in the house, the food is heaven.  We especially love the dinner prix frixe menu - 3 amazing courses for $20!  I've had just about everything on the dinner prix fixe menu and every dish has been great. This is a must try.  Just come on the weekends for dinner or lunch anytime (when the head chef is in).  For now, I can only give this place a 4.  When it gains consistency in it's food and service, i'd give it a 5 without a second thought.
