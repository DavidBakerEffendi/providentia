Took an outdoor table late afternoon recently at Extra Virgin - to enjoy a glass of wine w/ my twin brother who was visiting NYC.  Great spot, great wine - until several small children (who seemed to belong to the owner) sat at the adjacent table loudly singing.  Their adults actually encouraged it, making no attempt to bring back the serene environment that we all were enjoying.  So instread we asked for our bill & left, and found another place down the street for another glass of wine.  (We decided to stay for dinner.)  We spotted another couple walking down the sidewalk - who was also sitting at Extra Virgin.  Turns out they were visiting from Australia & also left earlier than planned to get away from the situation.   I did mention to the staff at our dissappointment, so hope they took note.
