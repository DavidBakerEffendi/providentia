I loved Rye. The cocktails were awesome and their entrees were enticing and made it hard to decide what to get because everything looked good. I'm a huge fan of places that try to make great food but stay creative as well and that's what I take home from Rye. After living in the West Village before coming back to Williamsburg, I can say that this place is on Par if not even better than a lot of the same style restaurants in the West Village but without the Village markup. The service was also really good, they took a little while getting our food out, but they we're very forthcoming about it.
