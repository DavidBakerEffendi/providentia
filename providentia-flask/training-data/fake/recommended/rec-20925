First off - the 3 stars are an average rating between 2 stars for the beer and 4 for the food. Vermont Pub & Brewery (VPB) is Vermont's original pioneering brewpub. Greg Noonan, a somewhat legendary VT brewer, started VPB after pushing for legislation that would allow for an establishment to brew and serve on the same premises. So naturally you would expect great beer here. Unfortunately that is not really the case. I've tried all of their beers numerous times because I really wanted to like them, but my best description would be "close but no cigar". Every beer is sort of a nice try, but it's almost as if they're all kinda watered down. Greg Noonan would be disappointed. If it's a good brewpub you're looking for, you're better off across the street at Zero Gravity at American Flatbread. The food on the other hand is some pretty solid and reasonably priced bar food. Burgers and onion rings are particularly great. Fries are excellent too. It's nothing spectacular, but it's a pub, so you don't expect spectacular. It's very good for what it is. Service is reasonably quick and always friendly. They've got a fairly large outdoor patio, which is particularly convenient if you want to bring your dog. There's also an outdoor beer garden around the back in addition to the tables out front if you're just coming for a drink and not to eat.
