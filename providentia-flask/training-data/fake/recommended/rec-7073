Food was delis and very clean and fresh! Appreciate that it isn't heavily oiled food and you can eat healthy while the food doesn't lack ANY flavour. The staff was patient as my friends made modifications to the food and needed extra time to pick items. Overall awesome experience and I'm looking forward to add this one to my go to restaurant list!
