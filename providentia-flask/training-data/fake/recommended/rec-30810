I wanted to like this place so much. In the end I liked pretty much nothing about it. The ambiance was confusing. It was not intimate, too brightly lit, and playing a music and a movie that seemed confused with their food. The food. I liked nothing about the food. Autumn Wraps--a nice concept, but nothing stuck out in their flavor. We had to add a lot of hot sauce. The Chicken Wings--they felt almost rubbery to me. They needed to be crispier, or saucier. The sauce was thin and the skin left a lot to be desired. The Cabbage/Mustard Greens. These felt overly oiled. I could tell they had been cooked haphazardly in a wok and tasted just of vinegar. The tofu on top was so fried that it became almost empty inside. The Pork Belly. The meat on this dish was so overcooked I was shocked my companion could stand it. I had one piece, with fat an inch thick and that was enough for me. I was also stunned that there was not actually pho on the menu. The sake was fine. Best part of the meal. It also felt so expensive for where it is--this dodgy corner in Bushwick. I will not be going back.
