So I am a Lombardi's Lover.  They will always be #1 to me, but Paulie Gee's is certainly #2.  Lombardi's has a larger pie and better dough, but Paulie Gee's has a slight edge on the sauce (and I am, admittedly, a serious red sauce snob). Four of us were sat immediately at 5:30 on a Saturday.  We JUST beat the rush.  If you have to wait, no worries! Transmitter Park at the end of the road has a fantastic view.  If you don't have to wait, just burn off those pizza calories walking the pier after dinner. The beer selection is great and the reclaimed wood tables, pizza names, surrounding light, and the owner, Paulie, all add to the charm.   We had the following pizzas: Delboy - for those who are unfamiliar with Italian cured meats or Paulie's ingredients, this pizza is a must for fans of "meat-lover" or "pepperoni" style pizza.   In Ricotta Da Vita - this was my favorite of the night.  The hot red sauce and gooey Romano stick to the fennel sausage and perfectly compliment the peppery bite of the arugula and the super fresh and creamy ricotta.   Hellified Porkpie White - The name itself is a mouthful.  The pizza was very interesting.  Be sure to try some item with Mike's Hot Honey on it.  I am NOT a sweet and savory fan, but this hits the nail on the head because it is not cloyingly sweet or abrasively hot.  Just Right.   Regina - A minimalist staple.  This was the last pizza delivered to our table and it was like the palate-cleanser of pizzas.   The tab was $96.00 for 4 pizzas, 4 beers and tip.
