Finally had a chance to enjoy Applewood. We've been wanting to go especially since we live around the corner. But we also had a real special occasion to go... more on that later... in a few months. ;) The summer cocktail was perfect on a warm summer day as we enjoyed our place on the front patio. The dinner menu was appealing both for myself and for my vegetarian wife. I had a light haddock that was deliciously delicate. Overall an excellent experience. And NOT as expensive as we had thought. It's not cheap but prices wouldn't prevent us from enjoying Applewood more often.
