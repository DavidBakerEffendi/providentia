"So you wanna go back to my place and smoke some pot?"   This is where that classic line graced my ears.  Seriously the best pick-up line I've ever heard.   My response (laughing hysterically, mind you): "That's awesome.  But no." His friend comes over:  "Is my friend bothering you?"   Pot guy:  "What?  She's hot.." Me: "Um, no, actually.  I'm quite entertained.  Kudos for rare honesty." My friends:  Dumbstruck.  Followed by uproarious laughter. Pot guy to my guy friends:  "Is that ok with you?" My guy friends: "um, well, it's up to her, but.." Me:  "I'll pass, but thanks again for the story I will post on Yelp." Yep, this place was entertaining, not to mention cheap drinks, and very laid back atmosphere. Just a great place to hang and drink (lots) with a group.  And thanks to the bouncers - cool guys with a good sense of humor.  You rock.
