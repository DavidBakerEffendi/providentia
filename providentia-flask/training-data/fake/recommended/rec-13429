After trying to get a table for brunch a couple times--both times there was a huge line by 9:30 am on the weekend--I got in for brunch on Friday, only waiting for 45, considered pretty good for this place. I got the eggs Benedict w salmon and my partner got the eggs benedict on crab cakes. What I enjoyed the most were the biscuits but overall I felt the food was overrated an not worth the huge lines and price. in the future I would get the sauce on the side, as they put a lot on.
