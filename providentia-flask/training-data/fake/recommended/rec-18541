I'm sure I'm not saying anything that hasn't already been said but I love this place. I'm a huge potato lover and when it comes to fries- I can eat them all day. All sauces aside, the potatoes are cut and cooked to perfection. The sauces are just an extra bonus. The pomegranate sauce is unique and sweet making the combo magical. The prices are fair and the staff is very welcoming and patient, especially when seeing how packed this place can get. I wish the store was a little bigger so it can accompany more people but its not a big deal. The idea of going to Pommes Frites makes my eyes light up and mouth start salivating. I can't wait to go back!
