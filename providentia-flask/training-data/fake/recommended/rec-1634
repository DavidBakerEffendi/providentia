OVERRATED ! I have been passed this place millions of times and always said "hmm, what's the line about "? Well , this Friday I found out and let's just say I should have saved my time and Weight Watchers points LOL. The restaurant is PACKED and I mean PACKED , there is barely enough room for you to eat comfortably . We got our pizza and it was the wrong size & the wrong toppings . Ok, we sent it back and with no apology the waiter throws our pie on the table. At this point I was ready to walk out !!! So after a few bites of this so so pizza I realized we wasted our time . My boyfriend and I agreed to NEVER go back there . Trust me it's nothing to brag about AT ALL !
