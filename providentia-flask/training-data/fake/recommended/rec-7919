Got off my flight and needed a quick bite before embarking on my endeavors around the city. Was recommended to this place by the shuttle driver who drove me from the airport to the hotel. Ordered the tofu bell pepper quiche, which included a light salad on the side. Food: 5 star quality. Freshly made with fresh and seasonal ingredients. Very delicious. Environment: Very comfortable, and the entire decor made it as if I was eating at home. Price: Expensive for how much I got. The quiche was a fist and half in size. The salad was equal in size. The bill: $14 pre-tax. I left hungry.
