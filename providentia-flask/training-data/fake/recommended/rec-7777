Went in for a quick early meal on a Tuesday.  The food was great, and I'm looking forward to going back for more.   I wish our server had been better though.  Obnoxious, pushy, and always up in our business.  She hurried us through the meal, removing plates before both people were done, and always pushing extras (another glass of wine? maybe beer? how about dessert? something after dinner to drink?) to up the bill.  It was sad that such a well-loved and successful restaurant hires such amateurish and bully servers.
