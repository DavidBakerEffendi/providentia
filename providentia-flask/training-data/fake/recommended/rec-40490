Went to Elaine's for dinner on my wife's birthday and there was only 2 tables with people in the entire restaurant.  We found out why when our food started to come out.  Stuffed mushrooms were barely ok and cold, so was the fried mozz and the blue cheese dressing that you have to pay extra for was like water and tasted like water too. My wife andmom got the scallops, which they say are bay, but by the size and taste of them they were sea and for the price we feel like we were ripped off and my daughter got the chicken parm which was old and seemed to be frozen by the dark microwave edges on the sauce.  I got the special which was steak but when you ask for medium and it comes out well done i guess it just goes with the way the rest of our dinner was. This was not our first visit to Elaine's, but it will be our last.
