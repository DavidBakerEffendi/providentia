What is going on with these soft-boiled eggs? I cook a lot, love food, but wow, the concept of how great an egg can be, was changed for me here. Very pleasant little place, if a bit pretentious. Great coffee, as mentioned, but not quite as good as places like Abraco or 9th Street. That becomes irrelevant, however, when the food is factored in.
