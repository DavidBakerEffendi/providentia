We were looking for a Mediterranean restaurant not too far from the Kimmel Center for a Sunday matinee, and we were not disappointed. As an appetizer we started with the hummus, served with a warm pita. We moved on to our entrees. I had the Chicken Shish Taouk sandwich (Lebanese style) and it was very good. The pita was grilled and crisply served surrounding fresh ingredients. Very tasty. Warning: if you don't like garlic, you may want to request no garlic or less garlic. My wife had the Kafta Kabob, also Lebanese style. No complaints there, either. My only complaint is that the seat of the seating material in the booth in which we sat was worn out and cracked and in need of replacement. All in all, a very good experience. The food was great, the location for us was perfect, and we will return the next time we're in the Arts section of Philly around mealtime.
