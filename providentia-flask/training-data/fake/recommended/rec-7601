Was good food dont get me wrong.. Wango Tango sauce was brought for 3.99 to take home which helped the ribs taste better which were burnt top.. No Beef ribs at this location,Nice sever good customer service, good thing we Made Reservations didn't have to wait 20-30 mins like everyone else. Even tho we where half hour late .. Steps away from the R train, smaller portions than expected for BBQ spot, had beef brisket N ribs.. brisket miniature plus too much Â fat on it for me.. was okay.. Would try again just at the Harlem location
