The atmosphere and location make this my absolute favourite place to grab a fresh pressed juice. The cozy decor and independent feel was so comfortable, I just sat there on the sidewalk facing couch and let time pass away, reminded the city isn't all hustle and bustle. My drink: Apple, Beet & Ginger. YUMM! They have food, coffee, and wifi as well.
