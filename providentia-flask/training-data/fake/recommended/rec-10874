This place was great. Food was every bit as good as this type of place on the other side of the water.... but much more relaxed. I started with the Foie gras, which you don't see often on menus anymore. ...feeling a little guilt in retrospect, one has to hope it's done in a humane way. Perhaps naive. Anyway, it was really really delicious! In fact, hadn't tasted anything this good since dining at Chefs table / Brooklyn Fare! Then had the Lamb. It too, was quite good.
