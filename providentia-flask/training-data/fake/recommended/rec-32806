Stopped in here on our way home from Killington.  SO glad we did.  Tried a little bit of everything and everything was cooked to perfection.  From the grilled octopus in a vinegar sauce, to the huge stone rice bowls, to the best bulgogi I've had forever - couldn't have asked for better.  Quick service, fresh ingredients and easy on the wallet.  Thank you for the wonderful meal!
