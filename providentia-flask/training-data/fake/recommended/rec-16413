I think my expectation for this place was too high. Their cheeseburger was by all means great. I was certainly satisfied with the beef patty, which was super thick and juicy. But what makes their burger inferior to Shake Shake's, in my opinion, is that different parts of the burger don't come together quite nicely. Or rather, it is that there is nothing special about the rest of the burger, such as the buns, cheese or veggies. I think of it as an improved version of Five Guys. But it can't compete with Shake Shack.
