My initial thoughts on visiting an establishment that served only vegan food (while not being vegan myself) were apprehensive at best. I was quite open to trying new things, but uncertain if vegan dishes could capture the quality and taste profile of dishes that did use animal products. My gosh, did I get a reality check! Chick peas instead of chicken. Black beans in lieu of beef. Almond or coconut milk over their bovine equivalent. Quinoa and kale as far as the eye can see. All substitutes as equally viable, and often much more delicious, than their non-vegan counterparts! Positivitea is a veritable wonderland of ingenuity and innovation. With complex, mouthwatering creations spanning burgers, wraps, waffles, smoothies, ice cream, and of course, tea, Positivitea truly does have something for even the pickiest of people. The added fact that their service is impeccable stands as a testament to how reputable this establishment is. If you have any doubts about vegan cuisine like I once did, I can guarantee they'll be quelled once you sink your teeth into Positivitea's savory and sweet offerings. So, go, and make it a three-course affair! (:
