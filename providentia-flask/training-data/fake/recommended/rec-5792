Vientiane is cute and casual little neighborhood BYOB self-described as Laotian. I'm a big fan of the pad thai, which is rich in flavor and served with still-crunchy broccoli and carrots, and you can't really go wrong with an appetizer of fresh spring rolls or edamame. Most of the food is just OK, but there are a handful of really excellent dishes. If you're planning to go, make sure to bring cash, because they don't take credit cards and have no ATM inside. They also do take reservations, so keep that in mind, as they do fill up on Friday and Saturday nights.
