The bartender must part his hair with a ruler. He wore a white apron, a high collared shirt and vest... I kept expecting him to slip into sepia and shout "Extra! Extra! Read all about it!". He had an extraordinary sense of economy and showmanship and served my friend's Rye over a perfect 3x3 cube of ice. Beautiful.  waaay to swanky.  but good for one drink if only to watch the newsie behind the bar crush a mint leaf like he was delivering Shakespeare.
