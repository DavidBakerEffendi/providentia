I had the gyro meat here twice. One time it was AMAZING and the next time it was tasty, but a little over cooked. The cheese on the Cypriot salad was very strange! I didn't love it, although they have the best Feta! I also had the grilled chicken over Greek salad which I really enjoyed. Their Greek salad has cucumbers and tomatoes instead of lettuce - FYI. Overall not a bad Greek place at all! It does get crowded at night so come a little earlier than 7:00pm.
