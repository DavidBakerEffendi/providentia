What a great find.  We were cold and hungry,  wandering down Church street on a blustery 15 degree day and just wanted a place to eat and get out of the cold.  It wasn't busy when we went in so we had time to talk to the guy at the counter and found out that they make all of their bread in house, and that the hot sandwiches are heated in the oven.  We ended up getting a couple of the Red Onion sandwiches on different kinds of bread and a couple of different kinds of soup and we were blown away by how fantastic everything was.  We also got a cookie to share and that was also really good.  Some people have complained about the service but the guy who was working the day we went was super friendly.  They don't sell their bread there but the guy told us that they sell it in the Coop around the corner so we stopped in there to get some to take home with us.  We went to the Red Onion just hoping to not be hungry anymore when we left and ended up having the best lunch we've had in a long time.  I can't wait to go back.
