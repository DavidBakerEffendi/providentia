Yes, I am the tourist who wanted to try the supposed famous Geno's steaks. Being a native New Yorker I have seen my fair share of scary neighborhoods but this area takes the cake.  The line was going pretty quick so I felt good about that. Got to the front and the question barked to me was "What you want?".  I went totally blank for a second! When I recovered I  said "3 Cheese steaks".  Got  my poorly packaged cheese steaks and began to eat it. To be honest I have had better in NYC. I wouldn't go out of my way to have Geno's but if you are in the area and have no time to eat anything else , I guess this would be a good spot.
