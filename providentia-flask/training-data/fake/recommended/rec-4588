My first experience of Cuban food. It's a pleasant place and the server was attentive and eager to please. The food was delicious, though I cannot speak to it's authenticity, being a newbie to Cuban food and I will definitely return. I had the papa rellena (light and fluffy mashed potato croquette stuffed with seasoned ground beef breaded and lightly fried and served with homemade mango and habanero salsa) which was light and tasty. The salsa was fruity and mild. For an entree I had soul cubano (serrano ham, manchego cheese, tender roast pork and salami dressed in cilantro and roasted garlic aioli on pressed cuban bread served with mixed greens). The sandwich was delicious, a wonderful combination of flavors and textures. The cilantro and aioli took the sandwich to a whole new level! The salad was dressed with a sweet balsamic - honey accents - which was a lovely contrast to the (slightly too) salty sandwich. I plan to return and sample other items from their menu.
