My mother arranged a 3 hour, 7 course family style tasting meal for 10 of us in a private side room.  The servers would bring out the large platters of each course and we got to serve ourselves and taste everything. It was the perfect way to have a group meal. The meal included: Salad,  Kale. Pasta with lamb (?), gnocci with walnuts and gorgonzola, roasted chicken, sauteed fluke, and flank steak. Desert. 4 bottles of wine + champagne. Everything was fabulous!!  perfect.
