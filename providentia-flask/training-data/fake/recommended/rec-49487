Love the atmosphere. I like quiet, small restaurants so this was nice but I didn't find it cramped *ah hem* I'm talking to you LES joints! So I HATED the service. I usually am very easy going about this part of dining although other family members were not happy. But my waitress looked like she just woke up. Her hair looked dirty and was just sitting on top of her head in a big tangled mess. Her attire was... I don't know it just seemed inappropriate to wear to work. She just looked unkempt and I was squirming when she was bringing our plates and touching the rim... Basically, she looked dirty and unhygienic and I didn't want her touching my plates. We ordered everything on the menu except for the desserts and the foie gras. But the standouts were all the salads, oxtail, pork buns, pasta. The beet salad especially. The oxtail melted in my mouth. The pork buns; I don't usually find bread + kimchi anything, appealing so this was a pleasant surprise. The fried chicken was juicy and moist and crispy but the condiments were so so. Things you get at any Korean fried chicken place. Pappardelle pasta with the runny eggs!!! So good!! Mix it well. Pasta was perfectly cooked. Wine list sucks. I wish places like this implement byob with fee. I won't mind!
