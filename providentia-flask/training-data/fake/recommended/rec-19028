I agree with some of the less favorable reviews posted here. The wine selection decent, food ok, but service is simply horrible! We were seated in the couch section on a not busy night, and I was told TWICE by the waiter to "take your foot away from the coffee table" in a rude and barking tone (my legs were crossed so my foot was quite close to the coffee table). We were then told, again very rudely, that "you need to move because youre taking space for other customers". I dont care how cheap the wine is at happy hour, we will not be returning - ever. No place, particularly this mediocre joint, is worth being treated lime s@#$.
