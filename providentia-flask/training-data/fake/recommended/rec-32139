I write this to you sick from bed.  Myself and two guests had the sushi and all had a stomach ache about 3 hours after.  After ruining sleep, I ended up hugging the toilet worse than I did in college, it was truly impressive.  I will not be back as this is obviously sushi that is not fresh. Unbelievable.
