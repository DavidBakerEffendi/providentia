It's no difference than Empire Building or Statute of Liberty, very international; It's a tourist's destination; it's like you will definitely try Peking Roasted Duck at QuanJuDe when you travel to BeiJing. It maybe a dream for people never live in New York before. However, it should be not that much special for locals. I am a non-New Yorker. Landed here last September. First time to give a shot without any plan or reservation. After my yoga class I passed by and suddenly was attracted by the busy scene. I like the feeling I had at that moment. You saw people talking and laughing loudly. A very energized Saturday Morning. I was recommended to try the Scrambled Egg in Puff Pastry. The pastry is crispy and tastes a lot butter. The scrambled eggs are scrambled eggs, not outstanding. Asparagus and Mushrooms are fresh enough. I will called it a One Morning Stand.
