As for the night club on a Sat night $10 cover gets you in, decent live band, older crowd, low on eye candy, don't expect to find a seat anywhere or the bar so call for reservations ahead of time.  What was really a strange concept to me was the long lapse between songs and everyone clearing the dance floor, I wondered maybe there was some kind of performance that was going to happen, but then just heard a new song come on and everyone started to form lines to get on the dance floor...me and my room mate could not get over this unusual observation and kind of just laughed every time it happened.  Maybe it's some tradition from the old country but really did not make much sense to us.  Anyway, maybe Friday nights are better there, would like to know so I don't take my chances
