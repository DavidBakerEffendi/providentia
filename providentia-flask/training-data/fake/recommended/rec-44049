Rangoon is great.  It's inexpensive, the menu is extensive, the staff is friendly, and the food is unusual without being weird.  You can take anybody here who is willing to eat anything remotely Asian and they will eat something and love it.  There are good vegan options.  Lunch specials are big and cost something like seven bucks.  The "thousand layer bread" is awesome.  Every single time I eat at Rangoon, I think, "I don't eat here often enough."
