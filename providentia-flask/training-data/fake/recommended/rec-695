Myself and 3 friends decided to do a cheesesteak taste tour of Philly to determine which place had the best cheesesteak. We picked the top 5 yelp locations, went to each one on concession, ordered exactly the same item at each place (cheesesteak with Provolone cheese and grilled onions), split it in 4 and gave our verdict. Findings as follows (in order of preference): #1 - Sonny's: soft bread, delicious cheese and flavorful meat. Our absolute fave. Next time we'd consider asking for more cheese to make it even more perfect. #2 - Pat's: a close 2nd. In comparison to Sonny's, the bread was slightly chewier, the cheese was more prominent tasting (an advantage over Sonny's), the onions tasteful but the meat was slightly greasier. #3 - Ishkabibble: the meat was on the dryer side and lacking in cheese quantity. Bread was decent and chewy. Flavor was decent. #4 - Geno's: food was a little bland and on the greasier side. Despite this, the cheesesteak was still tastey, but not our top choice. #5 - Jim's: the greasiest of all the cheesesteaks with the blandest meat. I would skip. Hopefully our little taste testing endeavor will help anyone visiting Philly for a brief time, looking to try the best cheesesteaks this city has to offer.
