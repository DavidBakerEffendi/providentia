So this is the sushi I missed my flight for. I'd bought sushi from Beyond Sushi before (always carry-out; the place is tiny and seating options are limited) and I couldn't leave NYC without getting it one more time. I figured I'd be able to make it down to 14th street, back to the apartment, and then to the airport in time. I was wrong about that, but at least my sushi was good! I've had the Spicy Mang, the Mighty Mushroom, and the Pickle Me. All were good, but the Mighty Mushroom just might be the most delicious. I've also had the miso soup, which was just okay and not something I'd order again. Normally, I turn my nose up at vegetarian sushi, but that because I've never had any as creative or delicious as what they're slicing up at Beyond Sushi!
