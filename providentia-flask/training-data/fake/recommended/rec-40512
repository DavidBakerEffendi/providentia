Went there because it was the only diner like food near our hotel and the food was great along with the service. Â Ordered the thanksgiving dinner and loved it. I rarely eat turkey since I don't like it as much as chicken but the turkey there was amazing. Service was courteous and didn't take forever to serve us. Would definitely come. Back here again if I am in Philadelphia
