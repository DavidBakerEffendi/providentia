My favorite place to get fries. It's very centrally located, which is a plus and a minus but honestly, I'm willing to wait for Ishkabibble's fries. I love the inside even more than the carnival-esque outside. It's a little off, with autographed photos of tons of 'celebrities' that kind of ring a bell? Maybe? One hit wonder in the 90's? But I like it. It's pretty reminiscent of what people are already calling the old-new south street (it's changed a lot in the past three years, even more than it already had) which is comforting to those of us who grew up here. The service is wonderful, the people on the grill and at the register are friendly, but efficient. There's very little chit chat unless it's dull, but you never feel unwanted (cough::LORENZO'S::cough) and you feel like your money is going to the people, not a company.
