Wow do I love this place! Everything Tom puts together is really delicious. The tacos are great! They use authentic corn tortillas and everything is super fresh. I love the chicken tacos and the pork tacos but my favorite thing here is a Chicken and Sweet Potato burrito. They have sweet potatos so they can make vegetarian tacos and burritos but the combination of chicken and sweet potato is great. They also have specials from time to time featuring smoked brisket and fish tacos. They announce them on their facebook page. The service is always good, everyone there is friendly and it is a great neighborhood place They also do breakfast tacos and burritos which are just as delicious. The eggs, bacon, potato, are a dream come true for a breakfast meal. When I use to live near by, this was by far my go to spot in the area. Soooooo good!!!!
