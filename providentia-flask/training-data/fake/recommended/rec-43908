I want to Love, Love, Love Alice's because the atmosphere is perfect and it's a block from my house; but, I just Love it.  I took off a star because I think there is something off about the menu.  I can't even fully pinpoint it..  I get they don't want to be another place with a hamburger on the menu; but, sometimes you want a good hamburger close to your house while your friend has something a bit fancier than a burger on a bun.  Plus...I don't know, sometimes I go there and there is nothing on the menu I want which seems weird. But.  Having said that, I really do love Alice's.  You can stop in, sit at the bar have a nice drink and a small plate and be happy.  I like it as a dinner place and have been there several times. This past weekend I tried the brunch and have just found my new, favorite brunch place.  I had the french toast which was fantastic and the perfect amount of food and amazingly priced for NYC.  I'm not the type to give instructions on cooking to the waiter; but, when I order bacon, I always ask for extra crispy.  I rarely get extra crispy.  RARELY.  I usually get some fleshy slices with a crunch here or there.  But, when I asked for  crispy bacon at Alice's, I got the most beautifully perfect, crispy bacon and I don't know where they source that bacon but I could have cried because it was one of those amazingly emotional culinary experiences.  The coffee was good.  It wasn't too crowded.  The waiter was attentive and responsive and friendly.  It was one of the most perfect brunch experiences I've had since moving to NY. I'm going back as soon as possible.
