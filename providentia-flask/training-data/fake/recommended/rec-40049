On a Friday night, my boyfriend, my roommate, and I were craving Greek, so we were excited to find Snack was so close to us. We got worried when we noticed that the whole restaurant was 4 or 5 tables, but luckily they were able to seat us right away. We ordered tzatziki to start, I got the avgolemono as my meal (wasn't too hungry), and both my roommate and boyfriend got the lamb stifado. The boyfriend had been eyeing the boneless lamb rib, but the server told him if he was hungry, it probably wouldn't be enough food. We also had baklava for dessert. The tzatziki was definitely five stars. Creamy, flavorful, and served with soft pita triangles fresh out of the oven. Even better, our waitress refilled our pita basket several times when we asked! The avgolemono was also really good and had lots of lemon to it, although I would have liked a bit more orzo and more than two bits of chicken in the whole bowl... Both my roommate and boyfriend loved the lamb stifado. The lamb was tender, perfectly seasoned, and the portion was generous. It also came with a delicious rice pilaf. The service was also very friendly, and you could tell our waitress knew the menu well. The only reason Snack doesn't get five stars is their baklava. While it was a pretty big portion, it was really dry. All in all, I'd definitely go back, but I don't think we'd get the baklava again.
