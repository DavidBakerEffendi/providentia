This review is for happy hour only. While the prices are not the best in the city, this happy hour is well worth visiting. A ginger rum cocktail was strong and satisfying. I moved onto some rose cava which was poured by a very generous bartender.   We ordered some snacks from the happy hour menu which were small but flavorful.  The meatballs were tender and there were three of them.  The slider was tasty but too tiny to even fit on the slider bun.  I also ordered 1 of the surf and turf skewers.  It took 45 minutes and was so sad and tiny that I felt silly having waited for it.  I don't know what I expected for a dollar so my dissapointment was probably self inflicted. It isn't the best but it's far from the worst.  I'd go back for happy hour again.
