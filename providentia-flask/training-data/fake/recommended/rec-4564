We drove by the Long Wharf park and saw all of the taco trucks, so after we ran our errands, we headed back that way to grab some lunch. With so many choices, it was overwhelming, but we Yelped it, and decided to choose a few tacos from Nextalli. The husband I loved both the al pastor and carnitas tacos - a bit of a wait because there were a few people also waiting for their orders - but worth it! Both were flavorful - and actually had different flavors and spices - which seems nearly impossible at taco places or restaurants. Also - they have some of the best prices out of all the taco trucks at Long Wharf. We will definitely check them out again and try some of their other food choices.
