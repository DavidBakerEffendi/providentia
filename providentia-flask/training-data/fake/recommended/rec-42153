Had the great pleasure of meeting David (chef) last night as my friend and I were sitting outside. Super friendly, loved talking about his Thanksgiving Balls and how people love to eat his balls. I only wish there wasn't as much focus on canned beer and more focus on a larger draft list. I will definitely be back! They still don't accept credit cards, so cash only for now
