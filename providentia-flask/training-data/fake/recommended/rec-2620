Alright - well - it appears the that true Philly loals are a little fired up about this whole Geno/Pats thing.  And I agree with them.  My friend and I did the two-steak comparison.  I will say that Pat's won the Battle, but both sides lost the war... Pat's was fast.  The line was about the same, as it was at Geno's, but the fact that Pat's crew dumps about 1,000 pounds of steak onto a water/grease filled surface at a time had the line moving fast. The steak was good.  I'm not much for wiz, so I went american and mushroom without.  Decent.  I guess at the end of the day I felt like I could get a comparable steak anywhere. Now, having been there, I think I would 100% agree with Alex M. "there are 2 reasons to go to Pat's...1. you have friends in from out of town who've never had a cheesesteak, and 2. its 2:12 AM and you're drunk"
