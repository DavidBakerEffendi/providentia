we had a lovely dining experience with four of us sitting outside in mid-September, all having very different dishes, and all very pleased. Â The staff were very accommodating despite what felt like an influx of 1000's! and to make it even more memorable, my wife left behind a pair of high heels, which Lauren recovered and kept and put safely away so when we remembered where they might have been left more than 2 weeks later, she had them for us!!!
