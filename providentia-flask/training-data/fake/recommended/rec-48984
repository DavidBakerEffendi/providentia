Short and simple: This place is big and clean; customer service is as you order it. I had a burrito bowl, technically a salad bowl, and it was exactly as I wanted. It was also quite delicious and filling. The price is also reasonable. I recommend this place to individuals and groups. I also want to add that they cater.
