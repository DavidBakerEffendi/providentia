This place isn't all it's cracked up to be! I was in town to get passports done for my family and I and since we had a few hours to kill we decided to go to Genos. First off, let me start by saying the people who work here are complete racist a-holes. You can't ask them a question without them jumping down your throat or giving you a dirty look. After dealing with their attitudes,!we got the sandwiches and they were cold and flavorless. I really wish we would have tried Pats across the street. Never again!
