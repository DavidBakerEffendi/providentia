I didn't have any of their food but their drinks were DELICIOSO!  I had the pineapple mojito drink and it was sooooo good.  I was super hungover from the night before and vowed not to ever drink again! However, this drink was sooo smooth, had coconut flakes on top and came was a piece of sugar cane that i just gobbled up! Great for people watching. very cute place.
