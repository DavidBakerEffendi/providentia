If you love chocolate and ice cream, you can't go wrong here for dessert! Â Decently priced desserts for their size. The cookieshake was like drinking melted white chocolate with oreo pieces. It was heaven in a cup. But I defenitely couldn't finish without sharing due to it's size and richness. The white chocolate cheese cake crepe doesn't taste as loaded as some of the chocolate drinks and desserts on the menu. It's lighter taste and good size made it more enjoyable for me.
