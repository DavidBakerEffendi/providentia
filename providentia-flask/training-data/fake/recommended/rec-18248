Went to Istanbul tonight to celebrate my birthday. We went in, sat down, and it was too cold. 65 degrees outside and they had the air conditioning on. Complained to the waiter - he suggested a small table in the middle of the room which was only a few feet away from where we were seated. We left instead. Could they not turn the thermostat down? Do they enjoy big AC bills? The food here is great and service is usually very good but just couldn't enjoy a meal while shivering!
