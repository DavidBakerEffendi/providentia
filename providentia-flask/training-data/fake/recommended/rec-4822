I love me some day drinking at Frankford Hall. I've been here a bunch of times during the hours it is light outside (not the best neighborhood so watch yourself outside the venue) and always had a good ole drunken time. They serve bottled beer but you don't come here for that, its all about the 1/2 and full liters. There's no discount for going for the big stein but you look a lot more powerful drinking from it while also getting a forearm workout. Prices for the big boys range from $10-$14 and there are about 10 varieties on tap. 1 liter equals 33.8 oz so this is not too overpriced. It's all about sitting outside at the benches and as it gets cooler the heat lamps kick in nicely to soak up those last rays of the day. They also have board games including Jenga to add some entertainment for your group. The only food I've tried is the giant pretzel but they recently added burgers which looked pretty tasty also. Long live the beer garden!
