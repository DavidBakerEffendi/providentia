Best Hand-pulled Noodle place I've tried so far!   If you are looking for Cheap, delicious, great service Hand-Pulled Noodles place, This is THE ONE.  I've been living in NYC for 4 years now, and never really care for hand-pulled noodles until I was introduced to this place by one of my girl friends.  And now, I try to get ppl to come here, whenever I am in the mood for noodle soup, or in the area =) I won't go into the details about how good their noodles are, you probably can read about them from other reviews on this page.  Whenever I'm here, I always have to get their side dishes.  The seaweed, cucumbers, chinese kimchi...you can't really visit this place without trying the sides out.  They are super cheap, too.   I ordered house special hand-pulled noodles normally, there's literally so many different choices and I don't think you can go wrong Good customer service! P.S.  It is hole in the wall type of place..so don't expect AC in the summer ...
