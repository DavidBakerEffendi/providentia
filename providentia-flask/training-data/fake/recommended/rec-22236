Pizza was...OK. Certainly no where near something I would recommend. I'll be honest- Fresh mozzarella is not my thing, but that does not have a hand in my review. Very hard to find a parking place #1, and #2, the people i came in contact with were RUDE. Granted, the door man who is a staple at the place, does have to deal with a few Bozo's coming in, but that's the food biz, you should never EVER become an asshole yourself in response to a middle eastern family walking in that happens to turn you off. Sorry we ALL can't be Italian. #3- (While I was waiting in line) I told him I came from New Haven (2 hours away) just to try some Brooklyn Pizza, he says to me- "I've had Pepe's Pizza (On Wooster Street in New Haven) and said the clam pie (that they are famous for) wasn't good at all. He wrote off the place pretty hard. Pepe's has been around since the early 1920's and this guy was out of line on all counts. My honest review? No big deal really, won't go back. Ate in my car and enjoyed it, but that's it. One other thing.... Anyone gives me a pizza wrapped in butcher paper again?...can keep it. Btw?... Best pizza on earth is Pepe's in New Haven (a few more locations now). I've had some of Brooklyn's so-called best pizza, and none...NONE, can hold a candle to Pepe's. Hands down.
