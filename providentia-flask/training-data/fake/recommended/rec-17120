Konaaaaaaa - hey boo! You know you my girl! Love your happy hour specials (5-7 and 9-11 i think?) Food always on point, service always on point, drinks on point! I've been here numerous times and never have had a bad experience, so keep it up! I was just here on Sat night and discovered the sweet and spicy shrimp missing from the menu though...WHAT IS UP!?! Get that back on there ASAP! I miss it!
