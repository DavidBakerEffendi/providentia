With open windows that catch the summer breeze and a "trendy-but-not-too-trendy" vibe, this cute corner restaurant in Soho is a good staple. Grilled corn may be a dime a dozen in NYC during the summertime, but Cafe Hanaba's inclusion of chili pepper and their easy hand on the mayo makes this grilled corn the most zesty, light and delicious grilled corn I've yet had -- SERIOUSLY, GET THE CORN. My dish, the Pollo Mirado, was a savory combo of their spicy spinach, Spanish rice, and garlic-grilled chicken. This, mixed together with their special green salsa, made for a perfect summer meal. It wasn't "pretty" (and nor is the interior decor of the restaurant, per say), but the flavors more than compensated for this. Another bonus? We didn't have to wait very long for a table at all, despite the little bubble of people outside, which is a huge positive. Admittedly, the bite of my friend's fish taco (...get your head out of the gutter) that I tried was sub-par, but everything else on the table was shockingly (or not-so-shockingly, as other Yelpers would have you believe) good.
