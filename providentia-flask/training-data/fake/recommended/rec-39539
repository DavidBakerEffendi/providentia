There we were, three profesional women, completely sober, minding our own business at the bar. When suddenly a black gentleman starts trying to touch s repeatedly. Â When a man nearby called the black guy out for behaving so rudely, we were told by the Yuca barman that "WE WERE WOMEN AND THIS WAS NEW YORK. IF WE DIDN'T WANT TO GET TOUCHED, WE SHOULD STAY HOME."
