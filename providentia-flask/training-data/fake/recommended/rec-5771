This place knows the art of making a pizza.  The quality and simplicity of the ingredients are experienced in bite full. The bread was crispy and gooy inside and the mozarella was pretty effing good.  The bitterness of the arugala played with the prosciutto.  I had the hosue chianti. The bartender was the consumate professional.   Needless to say, I would recommend this place wholeheartedly.  Bravo.  There are so many great pizzeria in Philly though so I will need to eat my way around and come back with an update to be able to give it my rare 5 stars. While I was there, this place was going like gangbusters on the take out.
