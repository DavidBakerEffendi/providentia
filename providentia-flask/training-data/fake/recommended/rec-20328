Short and sweet on this one. I've eaten @ almost every place on this street over the corse of a lifetime. Some are better than others, others are the cookie cutter variety, still others serve dishes that set them apart or offer a nicer atmospher. Either way I feel it's more or less a nice exsperience. This was a pleasant reprieve from the rainy hot Saterday nite stroll. We ducked in for a cocktail & small plates. Rocky was our server. He was warm, gracious & professional. The type of better end service Â one anticipates in LT. Nice glass of Pellegrino w lemon, Proseco- on the drier side. Ceasar salad w grilled calamari (pan fried not grilled but nicely done), stuffed artichoke which was cooked properly but I didn't care for the anchovies, capers. A little too much bread crumb & not enuff broth for dipping. But overall, it was fine. Pleasant interior but on the very low lighting side. Great service. Clean. Average prices.
