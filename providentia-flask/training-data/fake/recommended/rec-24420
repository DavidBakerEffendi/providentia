Omg SO good. Came here for lunch one Saturday. It was pretty crowded but still some empty tables as this place is HUGE. Ordered the trio of dips which were a great start to the meal. The pita was piping hot from the oven and the different dips were all amazing. Ordered a special salad that had cucumbers, tomatoes, feta, scallions, and grilled chicken. It was delicious and all of the ingredients were so fresh! Then we had the grilled octopus and yiayia's meatballs. Both were AMAZING and I don't think I could come back here without ordering those two dishes because they were out of this world. The meatballs were crispy on the outside and were soft on the inside. The Grilled octopus was perfectly cooked and was served with a chickpea salad. All in all, a great meal and I will certainly be back!
