pig nuggets with spicy mayo (?), bacon and brussel sprouts appetizer, and kale slaw as a side, all great. CONS: slightly smaller than expected servings for the main dishes, a little pricey for the food, but it is well prepared nonetheless. PROS: great atmosphere, friendly staff, great drinks and congenial, neighborhood feel. perfect for date night / friends alike.
