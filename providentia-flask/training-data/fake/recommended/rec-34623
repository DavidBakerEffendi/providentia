Bistango is a solid italian/pasta shop, with quality ingredients and interesting combinations. It can get really busy, and the space can get a little overwhelming if you go during the weekend. I can vouch for the pappardelle with short rib ragu - if that appeals to you, go for it. Supposedly the chicken is good as well, although I haven't tried it personally. For those of you that have allergies, this place might be your savior - the waitress firsts asks what everyone's allergies are, and I think many of the options are (or can be) gluten free.
