Pretty good for not so authentic Mexican, which too me is pretty ok when your looking for some not so terrible junk food for dinner.  The guac is yum and served really cold, but all in all really good.  The staff is so nice.  The salad dressing is addicting, not sure what is in it, but it is really good.  You can eat outside and people watch which is super nice. The food is pretty good and its reasonably priced.  Aces in my book.
