Top of the line everyday bar. Drinks are pretty cheap. The music is fantastic, but the bar is rarely loud. Bizzarre movies are often quietly playing on the two unobtrusive TVs. The menu has items that are both creative and comfort-oriented (I highly recommend the deconstructud meatball sandwich). Although it's a small place, we packed a group of about 20 in there on a Saturday, and everyone was happy. I have been here a dozen or more times, and never had any mishaps.
