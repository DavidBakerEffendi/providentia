We enjoyed a really nice dinner here.  The Ribeye was a center cut cooked to perfection.  On a sizzling hot plate.  Didn't come with sides, so I ordered lyonaise potatoes, which were really tasty.  Before that we had the calamari, which were nothing spectacular.  All in all, dinner can be pricey but the steak is worth it.  Recommend!
