A perfect place to celebrate. The food is heavenly (more below), the service is friendly. Most importantly, this restaurant knows how to walk the fine line between quality and pretentiousness. It's well appointed and their dinner menu is fairly chic, yet you never feel like you're under-dressed/too poor/too informal, unlike in so many other places around NYC (in Park Slope in particular). So, the dinner: only had seafood, but it was some of the best I've ever tried. Among the appetizers, the cheese plate includes their homemade cheese -- a treat! Oh, and one other thing not to be missed: THE TOMATO CAKE! With basil ice cream. Â It's kind of like Tuvan throat singing -- sounds weird at first, but you can't get it out of your mind afterwards.
