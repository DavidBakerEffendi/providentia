Shitty Service!! 1) The parking sucks, its too small. 2) The food is whatever, it needs more flavor. I hate that they serve different tapas for lunch and dinner. They should have the same. I am writing this review because of the service I received.  My waiter spilled red wine all over my clothes!  This is not an exaggeration, it covered my blouse, pants, sweater, and shoes.  Everybody knows that red wine stains are pretty hard to take out. I didn't made a big deal when she spilled the wine, I just stood up and went to the bathroom to try to clean it. I was with my boss, so I was trying to act nice and calm, after all it was an accident.  I thought though that at least they would give us a free drink or a discount, or perhaps even an apology, but when the waiter brought our check there was no discount, no free drinks, and no apology, it was like nothing happened. I was really mad, I called the manager, she came and was really stupid. She blamed everything on me, she said it was my fault because I moved (not true!!). I also complained that the waiter never apologized for what she did, the manager defended her by saying that she did but we didn't hear her (bullshit!). So after a few minutes of arguing with the manager I got nothing!  Basically for her it was my fault, and she made it clear that she wouldn't discount anything on the check.  I was really disappointed in the way the manager acted.  I was already mad, so I just paid and left, and of course I would never go back again.
