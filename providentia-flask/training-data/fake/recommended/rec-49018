A decent meal for it being the Upper Valley... Perfect portion. Great menu items and lots to choose from an amazing variety of foods. Atmosphere is relaxed, clean and casual. The scene is kind of hipster but also saw some young families walk in as well. Get the lavash bread it comes with a delicious array of dips like hummus, spicy relish, 3 strained greekyogurt dip and if you like dolma they have that too! Not bad, Upper Valley. We need more restaurants with this level of quality!
