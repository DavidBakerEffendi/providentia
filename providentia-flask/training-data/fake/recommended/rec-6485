Went here for brunch on Saturday. It was pretty packed but the wait wasn't terrible. The ambiance was very hipsterish and quaint at the same time. We were seated in the back room and I felt like I was in someone's country home. I yelped this place before I came and since the reviews for the Hot Artichoke Dip and Crisp Bread were so good I had to try it. Was not disappointed.. it's the best I've had. It's not too cheesey or creamy and a bit on the chunky side. For the main I had the Smoked Trout hard-boiled egg, horseradish cream buttered sourdough toast. The smoked trout was okay.. a bit overly salty. I'd like to come back to try some of their other dishes.
