Nice outdoor patio - bit loud, not meant to be quiet sit and dine place. Friendly and attentive staff. Interesting menu - not your typical options. Most of the dishes have a spicy kick to it - even the drinks. Overall, a good choice if you want to be outside with some boisterous friends and are in the mood to try some funky tequila drinks - good part of the city as well!
