Awesome German place in Staten Island! Love the authentic atmosphere and the collection of steins. Great beer selection. A little crowded at times, and there may be a wait, but worth it! The food is amazing. They have this incredible mushroom - bacon appetizer and the game sampler sausage platter is fantastic. The herring is good and even the salads. The schnitzel and the pork shank were great. I would just say to have them substitute the default side dish french fries for spatzle.
