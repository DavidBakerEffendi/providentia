Overall awesome food. Huge very tasty drinks. Had the Blueberry Mojito which was legit, fresh fruit with great balance. Had the calamari...it was meh...but I tasted the curry puffs which were great. I ordered the Spicy Thai Basil noodles (Pad Kee Mao), very good and very spicy. Everyone else enjoyed there food too. Will go again.
