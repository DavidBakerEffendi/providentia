This is one of my favorite foods. This halal cart is the best amongst all halal carts in NYC and I've tried a bunch. There are two carts. One that comes out after 7pm across from the Hilton (the original location) and another cart that opens earlier on the other side of 53rd st. at 10am. Both carts taste the same to me. For some reason the line is longer for the cart across from the Hilton. I don't know why, but my only guess is that its because its the original location. There is more turnover there, so the food may be a smidge fresher. The most popular options here are the combo (chicken and lamb over rice) and the chicken over rice. Both are $6 and include a small side salad. I've tried the combo, which is good, but i prefer the chicken over rice. The flavor of the rice is awesome. The portions are large and are enough to feed two. Drench it with white sauce and drizzle it with hot sauce. Yum, so tasty!
