I strolled into Mercato with a few friends on a cool Tuesday spring evening.  The set up is simple - plain wooden chairs with a hardwood floor.  Muted colors.  What set the place apart was the food - simply the best Italian meal I've had in Philly (I have not been to Vetri yet).  For a starter, I had the antipasti - which was a pretty good blend of hams, cheeses and grilled vegetables - solid but not anything out of the ordinary.  The mains were extraordinary - I ordered the orecchiette with rapini and sausage.  The pasta was perfect - firm but not undercooked, the sausage flavorful and the rapini the perfect complement.  I also ordered brussel sprouts with bacon bit -- perfectly done.  Can't say enough about the food here.
