This place kicks ass.  If you give this place a crap review, you must have had an off day or the lord almighty just hates you. The bronte burger here is insane.  Rarely have I come across a burger that boasts such a wonderful combination of tender meat, mouth watering sauce, tasty bread and all around super awesomeness.  I'm getting hungry just typing this now.  There is absolutely no doubt I will come back here just to order that again.   Note this place is small - and it is communal seating.  But you won't care/notice once you order one of those bronte burgers because you'll be so immersed in the yummy goodness you won't care what's up anymore.   You won't even notice the really friendly staff there and the generally nice vibe that this (tiny) place offers to its customers.
