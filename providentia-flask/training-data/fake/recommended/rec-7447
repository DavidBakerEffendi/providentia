Monday night; the place was empty save for the guy on his laptop at the bar. BYOB; went across to get some wine and ordered the potpie. Took about 25-30 minutes but with fair warning. We weren't in any rush so my friend and I caught up and drank wine. No joke though, the owner/cook/waiter went out to get fresh veggies to put in our pot pies. The menu clearly says all orders are made-to-order so we were amused. The pot pie was banging. I had to have had at least 1/2 of chicken in my pot pie plus the filler was bomb, the crust was golden and flaky and was definitely a good serving size. I wanted to try the burger but wasn't that hungry so I will definitely be returning.
