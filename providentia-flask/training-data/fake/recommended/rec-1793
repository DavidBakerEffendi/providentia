After a failed attempt at finding good Indian food near DC, we headed up north to the tried and true spice kingdom that is Iselin, NJ. Despite the fact that all the curries and stuff they have available are precooked, they are all top of the line. They didn't have chicken tikka masala, but instead they had chicken 65. LOL. EXCELLENT. I didn't even care what the name was. If its brown, has meat, and lots of oil, I'm game. The lady at the front didn't really want to heat up the dish for us, even though there was a microwave behind her. We even asked her twice, and she insisted that it would better to take it home and warm it up. Maybe it was due to my profuse refusal to speak in Urdu, but she didn't understand that we were travelling and wanted to eat in the car. Anyways, the super fragrant, messy, oily, spicy, amazingness is probably sitting somewhere in a blood vessel clogging up my cardiovascular system. It was everything you love about Indian food and nothing you don't. By the way, there's nothing to dislike about Indian food anyways, except when it might be executed badly. I really like how they make their chicken kabobs fresh. Next door, at Shalimar, they don't, and they're are pretty open about it. I'd describe Shalimar's kabobs as mediocre, and having a rough texture due to the fact that they are microwaved before serving. I don't mind microwaved meat if I'm eating my own leftovers, but if I pay for food outside, it should be fresh, shouldn't it? While I can't comment on Ali Baba's kabobs due to not trying them, I'm sure they'll be good as they are made fresh right in front of you. Of course, this comes with the downside of waiting a bit. Lots of specials available, and really good food. The kabobs are made fresh, which has to be nice, and the other dishes they have are pretty tasty as well. This place is simply awesome.
