Love this place. Very convenient for my life (only a few blocks from where I live). The only time I've been here when it wasn't busy was for lunch on a weekend I think and it was a nice change of pace from like 7:30 pm on a Wednesday. Food is always good and if you're nice to the workers, they will be nice to you. Great decor inside!
