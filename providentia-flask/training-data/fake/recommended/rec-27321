I Â love that at cafe habana you can choose between a more formal sit down meal or grabbing a quick bite next door. The two in one thing was a fun quirk. Though I'm not really a meat person, I decided to the give the cuban sandwich a go at a friend's urging and I'm glad I tried it, though no one should make any plans to ever eat a sandwich like that gracefully. Corn also yummy and also very messy--I prefer the corn done the same way off the cob at the place just down the street. But guys the flan---so so good. They were out of carmel so I tried coconut and it was delectable and in a cute little glass jar. I don't plan on racing back any time soon to look like an idiot trying to do battle with a sandwich (but that's mostly just me and my not liking meat in the first place)but if I do happen by, there's another coconut flan in their mini fridge with my name on it.
