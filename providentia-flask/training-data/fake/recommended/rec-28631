YUM.  I typically hate overpriced over-thought out food at trendy restaurants but the tasting menu at The Eddy may have changed my mind.  Each dish was more interesting and delicious than the last.  I literally could not pick a favorite.  Great cocktails, great service (even with our party of 8), great atmosphere. Definitely worth my stingy dollars.
