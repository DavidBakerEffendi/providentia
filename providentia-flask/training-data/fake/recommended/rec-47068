I wish Day by Day could replicate itself and open a branch somewhere on the West Coast... or in Boston or NYC or DC or any other major US city I visit more frequently.  The brunch here is AMAZING!! First off, it was Labor Day weekend when my friends and I (in a group of 8) came here for brunch. We did not have a reservation and yet managed to be lucky enough to get a table within 20 minutes.  Our waiter was quite knowledgable and very accomodating for such a large group. The only downside was they do only have packaged tea bags and do not offer loose leaf tea.   Otherwise, it's been 4 months and I still dream and long for their potatoe pancakes benedict and their stuffed challah french toast.   Don't bother with any other brunch place in Rittenhouse Square/City Center... EAT HERE NOW!
