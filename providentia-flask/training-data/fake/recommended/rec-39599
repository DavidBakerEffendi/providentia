Came here with a hipster friend looking for a decent lunch spot in SoHo. I wanted something as far away from the bland, overpriced deli/cafes on Broadway, and Ruby's was our final choice. It's a hole-in-the-wall with only a few seats and, though we were early, the place filled up fairly quickly. I got the Bronte burger with a slice of pineapple, and the Australian burger experience was very different from what I expected, though not unpleasantly so. It comes served in grilled panini bread and contained a medium-rare burger, lettuce, tomato, chili sauce, mayo, cheese and pineapple (added at my request, no additional cost). The light, sweeter taste was perfect for summer, when you want a burger but nothing that will leave you feeling too heavy. Instead of French fries, it came with a side of mesclun greens in a delicious vinaigrette dressing. I actually appreciated this touch; another way to make the meal more refreshing and less heavy. Usually I don't do salads, but the dressing made it enjoyable. I got an iced coffee to drink. It was on the strong side, so I added some skim milk. The taste reminded me of Mud Coffee, but less bitter. My friend got an iced tea, which I believe they brew with mint. Both were great! As an added bonus, we sat next to a group of Australian tourists who happened to be eating there, and were offered (friendly) hugs on our way out. Though we ultimately refused, it seemed a perfect finish to a delicious lunch.
