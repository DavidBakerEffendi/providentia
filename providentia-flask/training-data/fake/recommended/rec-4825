Tavern is pretty all-around-average bar food in a just-above-average setting. I've now been to Tavern a few times for dinner and brunch. It's in a great location and it's pretty affordable for the area, but the food is just meh. And the bloody marys are below-meh, and that's how I judge the quality of my brunch. I do think dinners there are a bit better than brunch. Nothing bad about the Tavern, and I'm sure I'll be back, but this is a true-three-star-A-OK place.
