good breakfast/brunch options. Especially LOVE the fries, and all the awesome dipping sauces that come with them. coffee isn't great, but apparently the drinks are tasty (it was too early in the morning for me to attempt alcohol). We came here to play boardgames with friends in the back room, which is a nice area for groups. Service is good, and the eggs benedict was tasty. My favorite was the egg burrito/wrap.
