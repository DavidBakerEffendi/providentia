So I have to say that I've never experienced service like this in my entire life. I will say that it wasn't a typical afternoon at Fat Buddha. My boyfriend and I were vacationing in NYC in December and Mizzou happened to be in the SEC championship. Naturally, we had to find a bar to watch the game. We were told that Percy's was a Mizzou bar in NYC so we made our way there. Turns out that Percy's was at capacity and the crowd was spilling into the neighboring bars. In comes Fat Buddha. We got a seat right at the bar and despite the HUGE crowd, the service was impeccable. We didn't have to wait long for a drink and our wings (which were delicious, by the way) came out in no time. I couldn't believe how well they handled such a large rowdy crowd of MU fans. The best part was when I asked the bartender (who I'm assuming was a manager of some sort) if they had coffee. We had been drinking for hours and I needed a little pick me up. He stated that they didn't have any, but that he would go across the street and get some. WHAT?! I've never heard of such service. Not only that, but when he brought me the coffee, he offered to add some Bailey's (yes please!) and gave me a generous pour. This happened not once, but TWICE. IMPECCABLE service, great beer selection, and nice food. We couldn't have asked for a better way to spend our afternoon watching the game. Thanks, Fat Buddha.
