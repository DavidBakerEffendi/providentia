My uncle used to work here way back in the 80s when he was an illegal immigrant. They kicked him out when they found out he couldn't read nor write. I find this somewhat ironic, considering this is probably the place where he first learned how to compose a decent sentence in English. I grew up partly on Cantonese cuisine and, to me, Dai Wong (Big Wong King) serves familiarity. My uncle brought me here because he promised me the best duck rice you could find in the city. Â You'd be hard-pressed to find better duck rice anywhere else. Other than the duck rice, I go for almost everything here. Except the Tsingtao beer. Because that tastes like ass-flavored soda. But yes, this place is definitely worth your dollar. Or dowh-laa.
