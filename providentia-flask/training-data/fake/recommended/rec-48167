The food was delicious, but the service was absolutely atrocious. Our waitress took nearly half an hour to get to us. When she finally did, she said, "hey, I didn't see you there." and gave us one menu for the four of us. We ordered our food, although half way through our order she started to walk away. We also ordered the focaccia bread since she said it was very quick. My sister, who got a kids meal, had her food brought out to her at least a half an hour before my mother and I got ours. She had completely finished her meal when we finally got up to complain. We we rudely told that she got a kids meal, and kids meals were quicker to make, and that the focaccia we ordered, which we were told was quick to make, was in fact what was keeping our order. Finally, we gave up and asked to pay for what we had received, and leave. They convinced us that they would box up our orders for us if we waited just a bit longer. Apparently,"just a bit longer" means another twenty minutes. They boxed them up for us, and I arrived home to find that they had only given me half of my pizza. I should have checked when I saw them whispering over my box. What a joke. The sad part is, what food we did get was actually really, really good, but even so, I will never, ever come again.
