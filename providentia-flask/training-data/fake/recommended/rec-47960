I was there last Friday night and at first was very disappointed at the fact that there was no alcohol. I know, I know it's a restaurant, but on a Friday I like to wind down with some vino to accompany my food, well in this case I wanted to wind down with some sangria since Peruvians are known for sangria. ANyhow, no Sangria, moving along. I was there with a party of six and the waitress was really nice and gave great recommendations. The appetizers were very tasty - we got the papa Huancaina, mixed ceviche and a chicken tamale - it was all very tasty and we were all pleased. I ordered the Corvina Frita as my main dish, which came along with some white rice and onion salad. The dish was a little plain for me - I don't know I felt like it needed something else. It def was not the worst Peruvian food I've ever had, but it certainly wasn't the best. Overall, I would return if I'm in the area.
