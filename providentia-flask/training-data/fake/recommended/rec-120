A New Haven institution, right around the corner from where I live, and the only reason I don't go there more often is because I really shouldn't be eating bacon on a regular basis, though the bacon at the pantry is everything bacon should be--hot, crisp, salty, and flavorful.  Good coffee, great pancakes, and real maple syrup, too.  Awesome.
