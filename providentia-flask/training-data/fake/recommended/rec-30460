You can't go wrong with the sangria from Tia Pol, I love love love it.  If you come early you won't wait long for a table but expect to wait otherwise, it's a very small space.  The atmosphere is cozy and during the summer the windows are open and you won't want to leave.  The ham croquettes are amazing!
