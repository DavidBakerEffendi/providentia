There are drunken munchies and then there are drunken munchies. I'm not just saying that to sound cryptic, or mystical, or like a Scientology paper. Don't judge me. What I'm trying to get across to you is that when you're blitzed, you have options. And they have to be given serious thought. Por ejemplo, if you decide to slay your hunger by eating a "Bomb" sandwich from Sal, Kris and Charlie's, the only thing I'm going to do for you is likely to be getting you a Get Well Soon card and a gift certificate for plumbing services. Sometimes you need something of quality. Something choice. Something to make you (probably) remember the night forever. And that's where the Pho sandwich comes in. Oh, sure, pho is a soup. Of course it can't be converted to something that lives on bread! But it can. And it's marvelous. And while it may be the only thing that I remember from that night, it was good enough that I haven't even begun to question why I woke up missing $134 and had bruises on my legs.
