I went for the first time today and was very pleasantly surprised, The location is deceivingly larger than it looks from the outside as well as having a very peaceful atmosphere. I ordered the spicy tuna rolls as I always do when first trying a new sushi spot and I was in love, the fish was fresh the rice perfectly sticky and the sauce on top sealed the deal. No doubt I will be going back!
