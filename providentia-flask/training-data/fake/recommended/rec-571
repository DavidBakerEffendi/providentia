Went to Nai after seeing good  Yelp reviews and craving tapas and sangria.  Went on a Tuesday night with three friends.  We ordered two or three small tapas each to share for the table and two pitchers of sangria, red and champagne.  Both sangrias weren't that great.  The champagne sangria was the worse of the two.  Both were too sweet, but at $20 a pitcher, I can deal. THE FOOD WAS SPECTACULAR and came in two rounds, which was nice. Croquettes, potatoes, tortilla española, calamari... Unreal. Gave it 4 stars for the overly sweet and watery (but $20!) sangria and because it was almost empty on a Tuesday, making the experience a little awkward. But I'd go back for the food. OMG.
