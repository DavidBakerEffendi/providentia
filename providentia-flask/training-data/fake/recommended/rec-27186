I am enamored with 3 things:  the roasted beets, the brussel sprouts and the bathrooms.  I visited ilili recently for a Saturday afternoon brunch with a group of seven girlfriends.  The pre-fix brunch deal is nice enough, and the waiters were patient and attentive.  The place was strangely empty, elegant and a little sentimental.  The vegetable/vegetarian sides definitely stand out; eggs are OK, my friend seemed to be happy with her choice of lamb.
