I love their frittatas and buttermilk biscuits.  The Vanilla Mocha muffin was disappointing.  It was very dry and dense.  The wait staff was efficient and accommodating.  Pursits will probably disagree, but I think that they should update their menu to be more conscious of empty carbs.  A buttermilk biscuit AND (potatoes or grits) is a bit much.  I know it's possible to make a good tasting whole wheat buttermilk biscuit or perhaps substitute something else for the potatoes or grits.
