As a visitor to NJ, I'm finding that several of the local restaurants are BYOB, so I googled for a wine store and up popped Uncorked Wine Shop & Lounge in a nearby strip mall. As I was walking to Uncorked, I noticed Nicola's practically next door. I got my wine from the nice lady at Uncorked and I asked her about Nicola's and she said it was very good and they didn't even hit you with a $10 uncorking fee like some other restaurants do. I decided to gamble on Nicola's. The parking lot was fairly full for a Wednesday night (always a good sign). Nicola's exceeded my expectations. The atmosphere was nice with subdued lighting, nice decor, white linen table cloths and wait-staff in all black ready to swipe your bread crumbs with their gold squeegees.. I was seated promptly and promptly served. I chose one of their special dishes (a sausage ravioli and broccoli dish) and it was delicious with lots of subtle flavors. I followed it up with an espresso and tiramisu. Molto bene! The bill was $34-ish (not counting my separate wine purchase).
