A sugar cane stick in my drink! Yum.  This place has delicious drinks at average prices.  I had a Mojito and Yucajito, both of which were garnished with sugar cane sticks which brought me back to my childhood.  The seating at the window bar is a perfect for hanging with a few friends and observing the bustling people outside.
