I'm keeping this review simple. Good Food. Good vibe. Long Lines that move fast. I got a quesdilla and frozen margarita with a side of corn on the cob. It was delicious but the LINE WAS OUT THE DOOR. Be prepared to watch the number thingy so you'll know when to pick up your food. Cell service kinda sucks in the back but I'm not sure if that was occuring to everyone. There are 2 lines..one for food and one for just drinks and corn. obviously, the drinks and corn line was super short because everyone was there for food. overall, i'll go again. i heard someone say something about them showing movies on the weekend on the wall which sounds like fun. Also, this place is only open in the summer...from my understading. It's CASH ONLY. Let me repeat...CASH ONLY. Womp. Womp.
