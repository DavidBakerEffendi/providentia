We came in around 11pm, the business was still good. Our orders came pretty quickly but the waiter didn't bring us any water, after we requested for water he still forgot and we had to ask him again. The miso soup was pure liquid without tofu or seaweed, my bf said he has tasted this type of miso soup in other Japanese restaurants but for me this was quite disappointing. The homemade garlic dressing for the shredded cabbage salad was pretty good. The pork fillet in my katsu curry was dismally small for $13 and the curry sauce was nothing special, I could have made much better tasting curry myself with a commercial curry sauce mix! After we finished the food, we asked for the dessert menu and again the waiter forgot about it and my bf had to remind him with a look. I will not be coming back to this restaurant.
