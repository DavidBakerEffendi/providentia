What can I say? This is the beauty of New York City street eats at it's best. I am an Indian and obviously I love biriyani. Well this biriyani-esqe plate really hits the spot late at night. Buttery biriyani rice, marinated grilled seasoned chicken (you can mix it with lamb for an even better feast), a signature yogurt sauce, a SUPER SPICY HOT SAUCE YOU SHOULD USE CAUTIOUSLY....all that fresh goodness packed into a reheatable aluminum tray that you can eat out of standing there like a drunk idiot and save the leftovers for the next day? Wow. Amazing. And that food in NYC, for $6. Wow, at least there's a few things with good value in NYC - and this is one of them. At the end of a night of clubbing - given the weather is ok - you will find a super long line of people and among them strong numbers of Desis (South Asians) too. If the weather is crappy, there will probably still be a long line just cause the food is that good. I probably praise this spot more so because I am from out of town and only have it on rare occasion. If I was a tri-state native that partied in NYC every month - I would probably only get it a couple times a year.
