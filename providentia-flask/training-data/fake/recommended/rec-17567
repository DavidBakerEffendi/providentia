Ok that was my fiancee that gave that review, and I have two minor corrections. I had the porterhouse steak, and it was phenomenal! Also, I don't think the drinks are that expensive, a martini is $7.  And the friendly bartenders do a very good job of making them!  The service was really good, wouldn't have changed anything about that.  We really think this is a perfect addition to Cedar Grove.  You certainly don't have to worry about finding parking as they have their own lot in the back!
