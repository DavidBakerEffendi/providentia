Went in for a late lunch, around 3p.  'Parking is all metered street parking, wasn't difficult to get a spot but I imagine that's harder once the college students are back.  No wait but over half of the tables were occupied, which seems like a good sign for that time of day.  Lots of tables out front which I'm sure would be fun once the weather warms up.  This may be a chance occurrence, maybe the food truck didn't come in time or something, but ordering was complicated.  Tried to order one sandwich- out of spinach, picked a different one-out of roasted peppers.  Friend tried to order a turkey burger- out of all burgers.  It was almost humorous if I wasn't hungry!  Finally settled on a chicken and mushroom sandwich.  The sandwich itself was actually delicious- pita was soft and not too dry, chicken was tender and flavorful, tzatziki sauce was the right touch.   Big portions for a sandwich too.   Just another thing to consider...it was cold in there!  About 40 degrees outside, so with the big glass windows along the front, I guess a little chilliness is to be expected.  But the tables are all next to the window so there's no way to get away from it.  So dress warm if you check it out in the wintertime.
