Went here to check out the place that I've heard many people talk about in the past. I'm not a big Sopranos fan, but I had seen the last ever episode. I thought it would be cool to see where it was filmed and grab a bite to eat. Holsten's is a great old diner/confectionery and the ice cream is delicious. If you get a chance to stop in, make sure you have one of their sundaes or floats. The peanut butter/chocolate one was delicious when I tried it and everyone else at our table equally enjoyed their desserts as well. I believe my friend had one that was some sort of oatmeal cookie flavored and loved it. I also had a burger and onion rings which was good as well, but their real specialty is the ice cream. The place is really fun and brought you back to the traditional family-run ice cream parlor days. Overall a great meal and good fun.
