Threw a 27-person brunch party here and it was the PERFECT place for a private event! They have a beautiful back room that's perfect for an intimate get-together. First, Gonzalo is extremely professional and nice to work with. He is very accommodating and always quick to return emails. Second, the food is delicious. Never mind everything else, the food is SO worth it! Everyone loved their meals. We had brunch with the option of having french toast, pupusas, or slow roasted pork and everything was SO good. No one had leftovers. The sides were delish too. Very great restaurant, will definitely come here again and again!
