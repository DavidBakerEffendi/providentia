Went a few weeks ago to get a chicken cutlet which was decent. But the reason I'm giving 1 star is because while I was standing there waiting for my order the pizza maker proceeded to spit into the garbage can, then pick his nose wipe it on his apron and go back to making pizza without washing his hands. Absolutely disgusting.
