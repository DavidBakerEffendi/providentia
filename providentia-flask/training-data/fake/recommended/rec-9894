Went for New Years Day brunch and it was a heaven sent burger on a BRIoche bun cooked to perfection + everyone gets their own brunch fries (we all usually share 1 fry order / table) = great success. All for $14 mind you! Did not drink but seems like a good vibe for a day drinking event.  I think I'd even come back here for a happy hour. The owner was very friendly but did not know why the place was called Alfie--not really important but anyway.  Music was good too...80s hits for brunch woot One recommendation to the servers would be to be more attentive for our water glasses; we were thirsty trying to recover from NYE. That's the only reason for the 4star.  Oh and that they don't take reservations.
