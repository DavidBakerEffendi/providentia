As a former Murray Hill resident, I do wish Whitman and Bloom were around earlier, and it's certainly a welcome addition to the neighborhood as I am occasionally there for work. In the two times I've been there in the past month, W&B has most things down-- cozy, welcoming ambiance, polite and attentive waitstaff, reasonably priced food and drinks, and a lively but not rowdy crowd. The one drawback on both visits is, unfortunately, the food itself. In my visits, I've tried the salmon and the hanger steak. Both were...fine. Sort of like they ordered them from the diner down the street and re-plated them--like the temperature was off (warm but never hot), and the consistency always look like the food was all just sitting around waiting to be plated and sent out. So the food is not _bad_ or inedible, but it's also not "good," and makes me hesitant to go back. The main reason I'm writing this review is hoping the proprietors see it and step up their act in the kitchen. Otherwise, even with an ideal restaurant in all other ways, I think people will stop coming.
