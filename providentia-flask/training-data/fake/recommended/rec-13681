Kiwiana is a surprise found.  We were trying to find a lunch place before we went to Brooklyn Museum.  Egg benefit is very special here.  It's doesn't have the smoked salmon.  It's made by braised pork belly, poached eggs, brioche and hollandaise.  Kiwi mimosa is special and delicious as well.  The price is very reasonable.  I am looking forward to visit them again soon.
