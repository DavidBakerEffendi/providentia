This is my new favorite place to eat in Manhattan! At least on a warm September night when you can enjoy the garden space in the back. It's classy and comfortable and makes you feel like you can still enjoy the good life even in overcrowded and overpriced New York. There's no loud music ruining conversation. Prices are normal--like $11 for a plate of pasta or $14 for chicken. (There were four of us, and we left happy and satisfied for just a little over $100--when was that last time that that happened in NYC?) The food is good--not exquisite, maybe, but good and hearty. It enhances conversation, rather than getting in the way of conversation. The atmosphere of the rear garden is just plain magical. Festive lights give the space a cheerful feel. It's small and enclosed, but there's enough room between tables that you don't feel trapped. It might be less fun inside--I'll have to try! Go to this place after a walk down the High Line.
