First, I just want to let everyone know that there is no table-service here. I did not realize this from the reviews and website when I went and it definitely would have been helpful to know, so I just wanted to put that out there. You order at the counter and the staff literally will not approach you at all. There are no menus, you get your own silverware, and clean up after yourself - all of which is fine, but I just think you should know that when making plans. This is really a take-out place. That said, the food is good. The mac and cheese is delicious, the chicken burger is great and amazingly juicy for poultry, and the chicken sandwich and fries are great too.
