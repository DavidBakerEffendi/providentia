They've changed their name to patio. This is hands down the worse service in the state...it is so bad it is funny and you should go there to experience it first hand. They'll mix your order, forget your order, tell you an hour after you ordered that they can't make what you asked them for. Expensive and not that tasty food. Terrible mixed drinks. Drink Portuguese beer...they've got Super Bock. I should also add that they charge $5 for a jar of tap water- I could not be making this up, yes it is too silly but they do this.
