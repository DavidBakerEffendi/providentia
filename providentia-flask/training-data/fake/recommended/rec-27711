The Hayama cart I go to is on Cedar at York, but I'll put the review here anyway.  This is my favorite cart of all the carts at YNHH/Yale Medical Center.  My favorite of what he serves is the soup with chicken katsu and udon.  I also really like the spicy pork, sukiyaki, misoyaki fish, and shimp tempura over rice.  When soggy tempura is still delicious you know something special is going on.  Supposedly he's opening a take out place in West Haven soon, which I'm also very excited about.
