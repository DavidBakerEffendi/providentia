Terrible service from the rude waitstaff! Food was subpar which went hand in hand with the ambiance, service and cramped size of the restaurant. The current reviews of the restaurant seem to most accurately reflect the true colors of the restaurant. This is a solid one star establishment. Don't pick this place based on the overall reviews. 4 stars is what this place absolutely is not !!! Make sure to read the current, recent reviews. This place is on a downhill avalanche to the bottom, if it hasn't already reached the bottom. The large man here definitely has a large man complex , mixed with know it all attitude. What are you doing in the service industry much less managing a restaurant. You wouldn't last a day in San Francisco bro.
