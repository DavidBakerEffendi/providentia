Love bar and I really enjoy the food and the back room which opens at 10. However, the last time I was at Bar was far from OK. We had made a reservation at 7pm for a party of 14 people (fyi We all love Bar as a place to celebrate birthdays or just to eat, we come here whenever we have the chance which made this experience particularly bad). To start off, when entering the establishment, we over heard the bouncer talking about all the people they wanted to beat up tonight...oh??? Then, when the waitress came to the table we were told we had to leave the table at 8:30. This would have been fine if a) we were told this might happen ahead of time and b) we weren't a party of FOURTEEN. To make matters worse, when we asked about why is was ok to kick us out we were told by three separate people, 2 hostesses and a waitress, "its not our problem". Our dinner was then filled with a waitress yelling ANYMORE DRINKS LAST CHANCE about three times and not having enough time for our party to finish eating...we wanted another pizza! Many of us drove an hour or more to celebrate the birthdays of two friends that night and one person drove from Massachusetts. After being kicked off the table, we had to stand around the restaurant awkwardly in the way waiting for the back club to open. If we knew we would of had to give up the table, we would of gladly made plans in between dinner and their club opening up but it was too late at that point. I was really just disappointed in the lack of customer service and appreciation of regular patrons...I really hope this was a one time.
