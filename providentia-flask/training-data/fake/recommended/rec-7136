A friend brought me to this place, and what an amazing experience that was! Everything we've tried was fresh, original, full of flavor and nicely presented. The staff was nice, we did not have to wait for anything for too long. The ambiance is nice and pleasant, and the A/C was not blasting like in typical American restaurants, but was kept at a nice temperature. Would love to go back and try more things there!
