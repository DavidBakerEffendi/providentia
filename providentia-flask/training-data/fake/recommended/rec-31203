I love living in New York, however living here has made me expect exemplary service. This...was anything but that. Got here for a 7:15 reservation and we're not seated until 7:35. That was understandable and plenty of room at the bar to sit and wait. Once we were seated, our server came quickly to get our order. Appetizers took quite a long time, we had to ask for them twice. Once they arrived, we finished them quickly (the salt and pepper shrimp was actually a little cold---which means it WAS sitting out waiting to be taken up). At 8:55 we were YET TO SEE AN ENTREE, and actually another server came to our table to ask us "if we wanted anything else," I almost lost my mind. We cancelled our entrees, and left. (Everything was comped, thank goodness). But we are never, ever coming back. The moral of the story, is that I understand that a restaurant can become busy...but it was the utter lack of acknowledgement that we had been waiting, that everyone just walked past while we stared at an empty table. Not okay.
