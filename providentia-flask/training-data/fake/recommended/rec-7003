Made dinner reservations for a group of 6 on a Saturday night. This place was amazing. Our waitress was great and so were the rest of the staff we met. Everyone was friendly and accommodating. For anyone who likes asparagus and pickles try the pickled asparagus. SO. GOOD. The drink special last night was some sort of punch. It was delicious. Would have had those all night if they didn't run out after we finished our first glass. That was the only downside all night. Hopefully they add it to the menu. Our food came out quick and everything was good. The Mac and cheese, spaghetti and meatballs, and veggie burger were on point. Also don't leave without getting a pickleback. PINEAPPLE MINT HABANERO. Will definitely be coming back
