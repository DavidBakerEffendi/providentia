We recently had our wedding rehearsal dinner here for about 30 people.  We selected one of the party packages and everything was great.  It started with family style appetizers, which were served in abundance and tasted delicious.  I was too full to even eat more than a few bites of my salmon dinner (which was good) because I wanted to try all the apps and there was such a great variety.  Plus there was dessert...we got so much food for our money.  The service was great.  They were prompt to refill any drinks that were needed.  Overall, I was very happy with our choice to have this event at Don Pepe Steakhouse and we would certainly use them again.
