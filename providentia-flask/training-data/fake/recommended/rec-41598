I love coming to Osteria. The grilled octopus is amazing. It's also something I never thought I'd eat, but Osteria makes it downright delicious. I ordered the black bass as my main entree, and was not disappointed. Light, flaky, and full of flavor. The octopus pizza is also great. Some entrees are bigger than others, but I have never walked out of the restaurant hungry. The prices are a bit high, so I don't come often. But when I do, it"s always a good meal.
