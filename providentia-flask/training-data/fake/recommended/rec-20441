Having had and enjoyed their takeout, I decided to brave Joya on a Saturday night.  I put my name down for a two-top at around 8:30 pm and was told that there was a 45 minute wait.  Well, an hour and a half later, I was finally seated.  The bar with its tasty and affordable beers on tap made the wait significantly less trying, but seeing multiple tables stand vacant, set and ready to go, for up to 20 minutes did the opposite. That said, the food here is delicious and so, so cheap-- a great value, and Joya definitely has a monopoly on the best tasting Thai on Court St.  The chicken satay, green papaya salad and summer rolls are sure to please, and you can never, ever go wrong with their pad thai.  Our food came out very quickly (if all at once, entrees and apps at the same time), but honestly with prices being so affordable and portions as delicious as they are generous, I can let those things slide a bit.  The decor is very nice and trendy as well, although the atmosphere is a bit boisterous and you probably wouldn't want to come here on a date because it can get very noisy and crowded.  Drop by instead with a group of friends for a fun and yummy night out before checking out the bars on Smith-- you won't be displeased.
