The food here is like an upgraded version of Chipotle, and it's so good. It's hard to go wrong with whatever you order. I really like their chicken or fish tacos but whenever I'm feeling a little more hungry, I'll go for their chicken and sweet potato burrito. For $8.75, I can usually make it last for about 2-3 meals. My favorite part of the burrito, besides the meat and sweet potato, is the rice. It is so incredibly flavorful! Seating is limited, but there are about 4-5 tables outside during warmer weather. They have a cute array of soda in glass bottles.
