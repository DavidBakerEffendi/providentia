Went here last night with my wife to watch the Gator game and had the best experience. The menu was affordable, the staff was awesome, and the food was amazing. The two8two burger was out of this world. The poblano peppers provided the perfect little kick and the below poster was right, the sauce was very reminiscent of In-N-Out's. Just awesome. My wife had the turkey burger which I tasted and found to be one of the more flavorful tb's that I've ever had. The sweet potato fries were also tasty and extremely crispy. The bartender, Erin, was super cool and so was the owner Billy. If you love burgers, great beer, and a laid back atmosphere this is the place to go. Cobble Hill/Boerum Hill/Carroll Gardens finally has that great burger place that it's been missing and if you live anywhere in the Tristate area you should definitely go! I can't wait to try this again.
