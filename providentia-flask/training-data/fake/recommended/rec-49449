I walk past Tinks almost every day, and have the great displeasure of having to read the sophomoric "fun" quips that are featured on their outdoor sandwich board--that is to say, I have the great displeasure of "experiencing" their sandwich board every day, and that is what this is a review of. There is more often that not something either unappetizing (once it said something about being sick) or just plain idiotic--as if the status update/tweet mentality of an annoying teenager or some 20-something whose frontal lobes still haven't quite connected is going to make me want to eat there...? I'll never eat there because of the sandwich board outside. . While across the street at the lobster place, they have simple, interesting, and fun sandwich board drawings of movie posters that incorporate sea-food themed puns. Take a note, Tink. (FYI: another part of the problem is that it's a dry-erase board, rather than a chalk board (chalk is inherently more classy)).
