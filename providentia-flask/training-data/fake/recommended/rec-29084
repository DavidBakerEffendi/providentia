A must see if you're visiting Philly, and a vibrant place for anyone else. My favorites are the Market Bakery, whose cookies, breads and sandwiches beat Metropolitan Bakery by a mile; Beck's Cajun Cafe, whose po-boy sandwiches you'll be craving until the next time you visit. The Amish stands are best for ripe tomatoes. The market has live music during the lunch hours and vendors are pretty friendly, if a little expensive at times. Go in with a plan; otherwise it can be a little overwhelming.
