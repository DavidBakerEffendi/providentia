Govinda's "chicken" cheese steak was the only cheese steak I had on my first trip to Philly, but I was not disappointed. It doesn't taste quite the same as a normal chicken cheese steak, but if you have any reservations about eating chicken or beef, I don't think you'll mind the difference in taste. I love the idea of the restaurant, and I wish we had something like it back in NC. I would certainly eat here regularly if I lived in Philly, but it does lose some points for the interior of the restaurant. I don't mind hole-in-the-wall restaurants, but the inside did feel dirty and hot while I was there. I think the chicken cheese steak would have been even better on a hoagie, but they were out of hoagies when I went. I'd probably give 4 stars if it were in another city, but Philadelphia has so many great restaurants that the competition is too strong. Either way, this place offers solid vegetarian options and I would definitely recommend if (especially if you can take out).
