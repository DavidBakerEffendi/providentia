Came here for brunch one Saturday and we were the only ones there at 10:30am, which is totally fine - we just happened to get up early :) 5 stars for the decor. So cute and cozy. I could have stayed there all day. We sat right by the front window and people watched. 3 stars for the food. Had the french toast. Nothing special. I would come back for an evening wine and snack (they don't have a full bar).
