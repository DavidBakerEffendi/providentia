After another long 80 hour work week, one of my favorite co-residents wanted to get out of her scrubs and into hot pink heels and hit a nice restaurant for dinner. I suggested Mercato since my first experience there was enjoyable, and four of us spent our Saturday night on the sidewalk in front of this little, awesome restaurant. The evening did start off on the wrong foot with a salty hostess and the service remained poor throughout the evening. Luckily the delicious wine we brought distracted all of us from that grim fact and we were able to enjoy the delectable feast Mercato provided. We started with a few salads: the market salad was overdressed but in a delicious vinaigrette so I let it slide. The crab and grapefruit salad was a favorite by all. I ordered the fish special, corvina on a bed of truffled mashed potatoes with a grapefruit buerre blanc. It was absolutely amazing but way overpriced at $34.00. That sort of price tag is a little rough to stomach at a CASH ONLY restaurant. My co-residents enjoyed their veal cutlets and beef shortribs (much better than the hospital food we suffer with on a daily basis), and my lady friend loved her chicken dinner. It all ended sweetly with a few affogatos (overpriced too at 8 bucks), a strawberry shortcake (not the best thing of the night), and the delicious ricotta cheesecake. I'll go back but I hope the service is better on a slower night.
