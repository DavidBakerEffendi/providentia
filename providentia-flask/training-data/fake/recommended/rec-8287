A neighborhood gem. Food is tasty, drinks are good, really attentive and kind service. Drinks are a little expensive ($12 a cocktail?!) but otherwise reasonable. Fun and hip atmosphere, but not pretentious. Even on a busy Friday night, was seated within 20 minutes and the hostess could not have been nicer. Menu changes often depending on what looks good in the market. Have been there twice -- will keep coming back!
