Dish does consistently good food.  In the last couple of years I have been for dinner, dessert, a large party, and most recently lunch.  I have to say - if you are in town for dinner and you're in the mood for dessert, head over to the Dish dessert bar.  Everything on the dessert menu is worth the calories.  The dinner menu is fairly priced for the quality and presentation of the dishes.  Within the last week I've been for dinner where I had the scallops and lunch for fish tacos.  The scallops were perfectly cooked and the sweet potato puree is reason enough to order this dish.  The lunch menu is overwhelmingly large.  The fish tacos are just okay.  For one - you have to assemble them yourself which, if you're there for a business lunch is awkward and messy.  The mahi mahi is delicious but the sides served with the dish is just not that great.  I'll try one of the other selections next time.  Service is very good and I've never left the restaurant without the folks in the front saying 'thank you' for coming.  nice touch.
