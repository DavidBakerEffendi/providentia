supposedly this is the best halal cart in the city, so a friend and i tried it the other week. when we got there at around 1 pm, there was a long line of businessmen waiting to get their grub on. got the lamb and chicken combo over rice. SO GOOD. huge portions and it was only $5! i'm not a big lamb person but i figured i should try it. the lamb was kind of ground up looking, next time i go i think i'm just gonna get chicken. i couldn't handle the spicy sauce, my mouth was burning even with the super delicious yogurt sauce to counteract the burn. i can't wait to eat this again; i was craving it at all hours but didn't have time to go back!
