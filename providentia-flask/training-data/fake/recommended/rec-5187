While visiting friends in Philly, they insisted we go here for Saturday brunch and raved about it the whole previous day. I'm happy to say that they did not exaggerate! We went around noon on Sat, so it was pretty busy and there wasn't much room for our group of six. However, a lovely couple saw our dilemma and offered to move so we could sit at the more accommodating center tables. That basically sums up the demographic here; everyone is so neighborly! We had a great conversation with the family sitting next to us while we waited for our food. Speaking of the food, it was awesome! I got the #10, which came with beef bacon, two eggs, and three french toast. I couldn't even finish it all! I was curious about the beef bacon, which ended up tasting pretty similar to pork bacon (aka delicious). It was cooked nice and crispy. While I don't normally put butter on my french toast, it came with butter already on it and was so nice and melty that I may have to change my ways. Perfectly golden and fluffy. It was a great deal for about $8. Our server Faye was sweet and attentive, and I speak for everyone when I say this visit MADE our Saturday morning. Everyone enjoyed their meal to the max. Looking forward to stopping by by next time I'm in town!
