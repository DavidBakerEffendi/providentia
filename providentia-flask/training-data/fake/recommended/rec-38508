I'm not a big fan of hot dogs, so when my wife suggested it, I was a little bummed out, but I need to make her happy...LOL. Surprisingly, it was delicious and filling. I wanted to order the Cincinnati skyline, but since my wife was ordering it, she told me to order something else. So, I order the surf and turf dog...again to make her happy. Oh, the things I do for her. Philly Surf N Turf - Fried fish with a hot dog. Huge and extremly filling. Fish was large and flaky, but lacked a lil bit of flavor. Cincinnati Skyline - I wish I stuck with my gut and ordered this. Packed with tons of flavor. I'm not huge on scallions, but this hotdog did it well. The melted cheese with the gooey chili was great! Fries - really good and tasted fresh. I tried it with siracha ketchup. Nothing special regarding the sauce. I make this at home. Overall: I would definately be back even though I'm not a hot dog kind of guy. Price isn't bad for how filled you get from one dog.
