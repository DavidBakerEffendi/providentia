When the bread came out - warm, flaky, and spilling out from the flowerpot it was baked in - our notoriously picky (and vocal) friend took piece and said, "this is really special."  The whole meal felt that way.  We started with the butternut squash (awesome), calamari (good, but don't waste a visit here on calamari), and pappardelle (unbelievable).  My hake could have been a little warmer, but was perfectly cooked with these puffy little gnocchi and a whole artichoke heart.  The husband got steak with beets: earthy root vegetables with meat, who knew?  He loved it. It was a great meal and I'll definitely return.  Honestly, we went to Babbo a few days later, and I thought Anella was better.   FYI, they now take credit cards.
