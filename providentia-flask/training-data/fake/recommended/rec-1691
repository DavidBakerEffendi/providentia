Tried both after a Sox-Phillies game, and Pat's is better. Server's have an attitude, the sandwich was already wrapped, so when was it made?  The texture of the meat was sort of like it was from a roast beef roll.  Then I put on the hot sauce, which was my own fault.  It is freaking hot! FOr what you pay and what you get, go to Pat's.
