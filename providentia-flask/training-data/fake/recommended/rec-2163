Service here is abysmal.  One of the worst places I have been to in Philly (subtract 1.5 stars).   Yeah its a casual dining place and I am not expecting professional waiters/waitresses.  Still, it shouldn't take 15 minutes to get water and for somebody to come around to get your order.  That's pathetic.   Food was terribly slow too.  Again, it took more than 30 minutes once the order was in.  It wasn't our table either.  The other tables around us took nearly as long/if not longer.   It shouldn't take more than 30 minutes at a Mexican/Tex-Mex restaurant  to take the order, cook the food, and plate the food for a table of 6.  If I had done that in my days as a line guy, the sous chef or head chef would have been in my face for the rest of the night.  My bet is that they need a better system with a more experienced expediter to bark at people as needed.     Good luck trying to get the waitress to come back once your food is served too.  You should either bring a foghorn or a flare gun.  I would go with the former. As for the food, it is was an eclectic mix of Tex-Mex and Mexican.    Some decent choices and most people were pretty satisfied but the restaurant should really pick one cuisine (Tex-Mex or Mexican) and really focus on it solely.  Maybe that is just a personal preference after living in CA and traveling to TX so much. Verdict - I would go back here again for the food but not until the service improves or go on an off-night.  The service is just horrendous on a busy night (Thurs-Sat).
