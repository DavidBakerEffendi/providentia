Considering that this was the first time I have every had an authentic cheesesteak, I insisted that some of my classmates from FT. Indiantown Gap take me to Philadelphia and try one. I was also surprised to find out that they used Cheese Whiz instead of Provolone, Cheddar, etc., like I've been used too. I did hear all about the battle with Pat's and I was shocked that they were pretty much right next to each other. Anyways, my roommate was a Geno's fan. So I took my business there. It wasn't too bad. The Cheese Whiz got all over the place, but tasted ok. I wasn't impressed though. I just wish that I would've walked across the street and tried Pat's so that I can make a decision as to which one I thought was better.
