Great experience, came one week into opening without any issues. Had the crab legs which were excellent. They were cracked along the sides to make it an easier experience. Interior looks fantastic, it's an old row house right along the water. They were definitely flooded by Sandy but the place looks great now another solid addition to FiDi.
