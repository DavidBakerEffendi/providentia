Tommy DiNic's is known for its roast pork sandwich. Why, I'm not sure, but the critical acclaim here is absolutely dumbfounding. So much so, I'm going to have to sum up my experience in a haiku: Their roast pork sandwich Soggy ass bread, dry ass pork Why so popular? I have no idea how the juxtaposition between the dry and the soggy came into existence, but there they are. Most annoyingly, the servers definitely subscribe to the ol' general Philadelphia charm, or lack thereof. That means rude rude rude whaddyawant get out of line. Maybe dinic's and pat's and geno's servers all took a group customer service class together for a group rate. In the end, I'm loathe to give up any more hard-earned money to Dinic's but I'm willing to go and try another sandwich in the near future. I think I'll try the beef sandwich next time, even if I'll hate to pay extra for toppings. I heard from people who've gone to Dinic's before that the paying per topping is a new thing. Let's just chalk it up to the recession, even though the significant lines at Dinic's has me believing that they may be more recession-proof than they'd have us think.
