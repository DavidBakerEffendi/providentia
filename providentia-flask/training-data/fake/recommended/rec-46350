This restaurant is hands-down, the best meal I have ever had!  We've been to Babbo, Mesa Grill, and many of the popular eateries in NYC and this place blew them away!  We had the tasting menu and every single course was great. I can't believe this place has been around for a couple of years and it took me so long to find it.  We're already planning our return.
