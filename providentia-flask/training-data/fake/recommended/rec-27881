YUM!!!!! Absolutely recommend it. Not perfect, but pretty damn good and very well priced. Huge variety!! About 20 market sides to choose from (we had the kale, broccoli, and sweet potato fries--all very good, but again, not perfect). Such a great place to go for a casual lunch. A bit salty, though. But still highly recommend it!
