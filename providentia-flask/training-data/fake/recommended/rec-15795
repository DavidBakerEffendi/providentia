My first time at Uva on the Upper East Side with a group of close friends. Ordinarily I only take dates to restaurants with dimly lit, electronic candle light but this place had a certain buzz about it. We eagerly waited about 25 minutes for our table with our mouths watering as we watched patrons  eat. We were seated in the back of the restaurant which had a nice ambiance overall. Contrary to other reviews I've read, Uva was not  overwhelmingly loud. If you are going out to dinner in New York City and  expect peace and quiet then do it in the confines of your own closet apartment. Otherwise,  enjoy the incredible food and people that NYC has to offer. I ordered bacon-wrapped scallops. The scallops were perfectly cooked but a little under-seasoned. I would rate my plate overall 3 stars, but my friend's tagliatelle pasta was extraordinary topped with a bolognese sauce. Dessert is what pushed me to 4 stars. We had the special 7 layer crepe cake. Absolutely fantastic. Made the meal hands down. My friends ordered an almond cake which was so-so. The verdict: you can't go wrong with Uva. If you need a date spot, this is your place. And what woman doesn't like a good pasta dish? Not any woman i'm taking to dinner!
