Food: I ordered their pulled pork sandwich with provolone and spinach. I must say that this was a better sandwich than the usual cheese whiz steak sandwich that you're supposed to get when you're in Philly. Good stuff. Location: It's located inside the Reading Terminal Market. It's super crowded and the line is long, but the line moves pretty fast. They have one person taking orders, a bunch of people making the sandwiches, and another person ringing you up. It's a well oiled machine! Overall: Skip that cheese whiz steak sandwich and eat one of these sandwiches instead!
