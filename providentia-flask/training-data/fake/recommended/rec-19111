i miss you jadis!! why can't i find a cute little wine-cheese-small plates eatery like this on the west side? i love the chill, laid-back, hidden-gem atmosphere. it's actually mellow and quiet enough (but not TOO quiet) for a nice little get together with your girlfriends - to gab over all their delicious little plates and wines. all the dishes, the paninis, salads and appetizers are great. the best is the well-edited cheese plate. i'll be back to pay you a visit soon!!
