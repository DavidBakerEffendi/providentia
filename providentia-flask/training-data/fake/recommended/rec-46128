One of my worst dining experiences ever. I came with a group of six, two of whom had been previously. The atmosphere was lacking; imagine diner-style tables in what looks like a semi-residential setting, with the A/C blasting to an uncomfortable level. The waitress was OK at first, but she soon wore out her welcome.  She hovered and shoehorned her way into our conversations. As another review mentioned, the rolls were large but nothing special.  The waitress put pressure on our group to order alcoholic beverages (we ordered soda) but did not seem familiar with their selection.  We started with the chourico and fried calamari appetizers.  These were the highlight for me.  The calamari in particular had a nice breading.  However, the waitress refused to clear the plate of calamari until someone took the last remaining piece.   The food came out one at a time over a 5 minute period.  For my entree I had the lamb chop special.  It was two hunks of lamb with a multitude of fat and not much meat.  I struggled to cut into it and when I finally did, I noticed it was rare, rather than medium as I ordered.  The waitress offered to take it back.  When she returned it was completely overcooked, well-done, and dry.  It was inedible.  The sides were unremarkable: the mixed vegetables were clearly frozen, the rice and potatoes were bland.  I hardly touched my plate but the waitress did not comment or offer to discount the bill.  My husband was ambivalent about his meal (the chef's meat skewers).  No one took their leftovers home. Since my dinner was a disappointment I was looking forward to the cheesecake for dessert, hoping it could redeem the meal.   The waitress returned a few minutes later to say they "could not find" the cheesecake so there wasn't any. The bill came out to be about $60 for my husband's and my portion.  Given the quality of the food, I feel this was very overpriced.  This was not homestyle in a good way.  We would absolutely not return.
