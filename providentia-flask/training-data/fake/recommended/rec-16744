Ask any East Villager where you can have a moderately priced good meal in the East Village and you'll mostly likely be directed to Cafe Orlin. Restaurant-wise, Cafe Orlin does everything right. It offers tasty food at a reasonable price; it has vegetarian options; its ambience is charming; it has outside seating; and it's located in an historically interesting spot on St. Mark's. Service at Cafe Orlin -- something many Yelpers have complained about in the past -- has improved greatly over the last year. I believe that the management paid attention to service complaints (probably viewed here on Yelp).  Bus service at the restaurant now is excellent. Water is refilled often, and dirty dishes are removed promptly.  In the last year, I've experienced nothing but good wait service.   Cafe Orlin's breakfast special, which includes two organic eggs, home fries, toast, orange juice, and coffee, is incredible deal at $6. The breakfast special is my standard order. (It's available until 4 p.m.) My friend loves the spinach and feta omelet.   One thing that I find slightly annoying about Cafe Orlin is it doesn't offer sides of items. For example, if you'd like to have a single pancake with your breakfast order, you can't have it. You have to get a full order of pancakes. A girl likes to have eggs AND pancakes TOGETHER, dangit!  I guess Cafe Orlin doesn't want me to get fat. I do not recommend sitting outside during busy times, especially brunch. They pack 'em in like sardines! You'll spend the entire meal getting up to let people in the tables around you in and out. Be warned: Cafe Orlin is an extremely popular brunch destination on the weekends. Be prepared to wait for a table. Credit cards accepted.
