Mixed, with plenty of white sauce and a penny sized drop of hot sauce is yummy in my tummy. Long lines are expected, but move pretty fast. The food is meant to be eaten right away, which is a bit difficult for me as I am a towering 5'4" female with a small frame. Doesn't taste too good after an hour. But I will always come back for repeat visits. Tip: Â Sometimes they have another cart across the street - especially when the 6th avenue street festival is going on - so be on the lookout and skip the long lines!
