Not good. We ordered 3 different rolls and they were all disappointing. The quality of sashimi was there, but they just missed the mark in taste. Â We order 2 riceless rolls-they came with rice. I ordered one roll specifically for the asparagus, it came without it. The spicy tuna was inedible. The green salad was nice though. I wouldn't order from here again. Sadly dissappointing.
