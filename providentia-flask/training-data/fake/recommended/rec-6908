I come here by myself a lot.  The food and the service are both great.  Really quick and easy food made behind the counter while you wait.   ALSO - the music is great.  Whoever spins the tunes (clicks the buttons, whatever) does a great job.  I recommend the vegetarian chili, a burger, or the tuna sandwich.
