If I could give this place three and a half stars, I would, but I don't want to lower it from four to just three. The thing about it is, go for dinner as opposed to lunch. For some reason their lunch menu is an unexciting, abbreviated version of their dinner menu, which saddens me. But they way they do seafood here is truly impressive. Creative blend of unique flavors, a lot of love going into the preparation, truly a satisfying experience. Things not to miss are the fried olives, the falafel covered meatballs, and the seabass. The desserts are all incredible but my favorite is the hazelnut chocolate mousse. They serve it in a mason jar! The ambiance is sweet but for some reason on a rainy day it gets sort of depressing. Maybe because it's lacking warm elements.
