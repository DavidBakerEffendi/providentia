Had the falafel sandwich here, and it was really good. Maybe I'm spoiled by Mamoun's and now TurKiss on the next block, but there were only two things that that I walked out wishing from Ba'al. First of all, it's not a eat-on-the-go-while-walking setup like the other guys, so my walk was incredibly messy. I was definitely that weird girl walking around soho with food all over her face yesterday, haha. Second, the sandwich was about 2 1/2 times the price of surrounding falafel shops. I mean it was good, like really good--they use this great homemade salad instead of just lettuce, and it makes a huge difference in taste. But was it worth paying that much more and having to sit down to eat? Possibly, if I'm not on the go, but I for me a falafel sandwich is something I get when I'm hungry and between destinations--it's just not a sit down and eat at a restaurant type of deal. And, if I wanted to go to a sit down restaurant I would've gone to an entirely different type of place, with servers and everything. So in summary: food is great, price is too high for the setting, and definitely sit down to eat for this one.
