Caveat: I've only had delivery, but we're not that far away and I've had it multiple times (at least 5, which is more than I think it deserved), and given that they deliver the pizza in a heated push-cart, I'm inclined to think transport is not a huge factor in the quality of the pizza I've had.  That being said, Adrienne's Pizza is kind of like a mansion built on quicksand.  It looks great, but the foundation isn't there.  They use great ingredients on their pizzas, but the crust and sauce are lackluster.  The crust is tough and chewy instead of crispy with a little bit of fluffiness (yes, even the thinnest of of thin-crust pizza should be like this--it's pizza, not matza) and the sauce is unimpressive and has been salty every time I've had it.  Like, really salty.  Like, "I had to drink a liter of water to flush my system after I ate, and I am a huge salt-lover " salty.  Also, the delivery is always longer than they tell you, by 20% or more, which is less-than-impressive. There are definitely better places to go in the FiDi for pizza.  The thing is, I want to like this place and if they could fix the sauce and crust, I probably would.  I told a friend I'd give it one more chance and eat in the restaurant (which I'm hopeful will resolve the crust issues), so maybe all hope isn't lost, but I'm not optimistic.
