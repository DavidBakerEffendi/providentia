I had such high hopes for this space.. I loved Richters and was excited that somone was using this space. I was initially impressed. The bar itself is beautiful. The wood work is very nice and the rest of the decor was impressive. We sat at the bar and the first thing we noticed was the awful music. It was so loud that I couldn't even hear the person next to me. The drinks were very overpriced and the staff was so rude!! They completely ignored us as soon as a crowd of Yale students walked in and it took 30 minutes to flag down someone as we sat with empty drinks at the bar. Â Nothing about this place will make me return, such a disappointment!!
