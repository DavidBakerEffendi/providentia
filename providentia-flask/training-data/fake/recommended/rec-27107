We celebrated a great Birthday Party in Gatsby's. The d√©cor was awesome - modern and representing belle epoch of American history. Especially manikins compositions and cozy fireplace. This place has outstanding jazz band from 8 PM with wide variety of jazz styles. Attentive and reliable service. Great attitude and personal approach to every guest. Food was really good. Excellent jazz restaurant with huge selection of awesome desserts and cocktail menu. All entrees and appetizers are delicious and creative. With a personal help of the owner of restaurant we have got a spectacular party which impressed everybody.
