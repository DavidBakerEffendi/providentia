Nice little cafe on halsey street. Great place to have lunch. Food:  The wraps & flat bread pizzas r great. Try the flatbread pizza with olive paste and chick peas.  The food servings are perfect for one person, not oversized as most places are.  The pricing is also affordable. Drinks: You could go for hot tea, coffee, juices or smoothies. The coffee is really good. Espressos are good here too, which is a rare finding in most part of this town. Decor: I like the decor here. Its cozy with some interesting antique elements. All in all a refreshing experience.
