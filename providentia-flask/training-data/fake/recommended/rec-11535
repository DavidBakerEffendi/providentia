Had an early dinner here after a short business meeting. Northern Spy seems all about fresh: fresh herbs, fresh ingredients and fresh air with elegantly simple, hip decor. The service was perfect and the food came out faster than fast food. This place is obviously a top quality business in every sense. I had the Spy Cup cocktail, the pork sticky rolls, the kale salad and the steak tartare with peach charlotte for dessert. Every dish was a well executed pairing of only a couple of well aligned flavors (which is exactly what I look for in good dining). The food and the decor and the service are all perfectly aligned in this way - only what you want and nothing excessive to detract from the well designed experiences. Prices are very reasonable for what you're getting at the East Village understated eatery. You can't go wrong at Northern Spy Food Co. One of my new favorites in NYC. I'll definitely be back.
