Went into Deninos yesterday to order a couple slices of pizza to try out. I was told you can't order slices and they only have large pies so automatically my $5 lunch I was anticipating became $14. Next I was told to wait by the kitchen doors to place my order and pick it up. I found this very odd and inconvenient as the doors were continuously opening and closing and there was nowhere to sit and wait. The young girl that brought me my pie out of the kitchen was sweet and she gave me paper plates and napkins with my pizza. My pizza crust was mildly burnt and the cheese and sauce were just okay. All in all, I found it to be an average pizza place that needs to make a proper take out area and start accepting credit cards. Bottom line: go to Joe and Pat's instead.
