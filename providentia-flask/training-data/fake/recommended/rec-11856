Ever since the boyfriend's acquired a car for the weekends, we try to venture off of the island of Manhattan in search of good food. This time our search landed us at Petite Crevette. First of all... it is not technically on Union st, but around the corner. So don't worry when you come across a cafe that seem to have recently gone out of business. When you do find your way over to the actual entrance, you can give your name and phone number and prepare for a long wait (on a weekend night). We headed over to Calexico for a snack. And if you didn't bring a drink (it is BYOB), there's a wine store just around the corner as well. For entrees, we shared the mussels and grilled fish special (yellow tail). The mussels were miles apart from what I've tried in the city. All of the mussels were plump, fresh, and deliciously cooked in provencal style. The fish, however, wasn't as fresh and slightly overcooked. I guess we're spoiled w/ the readily available live fish of Chinatown. The service was great and the decor is very homely. We'll be back to try the cioppino and soft shell crab. :)
