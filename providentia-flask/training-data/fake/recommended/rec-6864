I took my brother here for his birthday two years in a row and both times it was an amazing experience.  The vibe and décor are unpretentious and inviting.  The wait staff is attentive and friendly as well, and the bartenders are some of my favorite around.  They know the food and the menu, and make a captivating assortment of delicious drinks. Oh and did I mention that the food is incredible?  I love that the menu changes often so I can always look forward to a new exciting dish when I come, accompanied by some of my favorite staples.  Everything was extremely well seasoned throughout our entire meal, and we ate a nice variety of vegetables, protein, and desserts.  The cabbage dish blew me away.  Who knew a plate of cabbage, mushrooms, and cauliflower could taste so good?  You can really taste the love that goes into their house made pasta, and it's always accompanied by original, interesting ingredients. The bread is delicious as well and the desserts really push the envelope, in a good way.  They make you think twice about combining sweet and savory flavors, and somehow they always make it work.  You are left wondering how something that sounds so out of the box, tastes so amazing! By the end of both my meals, I left feeling happy, full, and excited to return again in the near future.
