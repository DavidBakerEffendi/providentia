Recently someone asked me to name my favorite NYC restaurant, and while I think that's pretty much impossible in the maze of subcategories that's the Apple, Petite Crevette (along with Tartine and Lucali) springs to mind.  The food - fresh seafood, simply prepared and reasonably priced - is good. But to tell you the truth, that's not even why I love it.  The setting in a cozy converted flower shop, the BYOB policy, the warm and charming service, are what render it so completely memorable. It's casual enough for a spontaneous weeknight dinner, but more than special enough for a date or a birthday. Conversations are always more interesting, and I always leave happier, than at almost any place I can think of. Really special.
