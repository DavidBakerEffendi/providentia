To be sure, this is not your typical Mexican. Â That said, some highlights: it's got a farm-to-table focus, so great local ingredients. A small but stellar beer selection - always some Hill Farmstead on tap. Unusual taco options - and a bunch of terrific veggie/vegan choices. Great corn tortillas (flour? really? blech.) Terrific guac and interesting and tasty homemade got sauces. Downsides? It's a little spendy - and it's small, so it can take a bit to get a booth. If you remember the Oasis Diner, going here will strike up a touch of nostalgia. No Line brothers tossing out breakfast after breakfast, but a bit of the old charm remains under the new polish of this local spot.
