Meh. This is probably the longest I've waited for a table in NYC, and for just mediocre food. As we walked by Nevada Smith on my way to meet friends at The Smith Sunday afternoon for brunch, I turn to my boyfriend and say "We are not going here, right..." In hindsight, maybe Nevada Smith would have been the better option. Initially I was relieved to see The Smith and its beautiful brunch ambiance and the bustle of the restaurant. Little did I know that bustle would come back to bite me in the arse. The staff at The Smith have no idea how to give an honest wait time estimate. We were a group of 8, admittedly a large group to accommodate. However, I did not appreciate the complete falseness in what we were told our wait time would be. After given an estimate of 45-60 minutes, our wait time actually ended up being double that, just shy of 2 hours. In the cold. With the staff having zero sympathy / interest in seating us. Finally, the manager had a bright idea of putting together two empty tables of four. Novel idea. So we finally sit. When it comes time to waiter failed to mention that a complimentary drink / juice is included in the price, so half the group had to then order a beverage when he came back to our table. The food came out in what felt like under 5 minutes, crazy. The french toast is good, but I've had better.. There are some unique dishes on the menu (potato pancakes benedict); however my omelet was quite bland. The home fries were tasty, but no reason to come to The Smith for brunch and experience the long waits and not helpful staff.
