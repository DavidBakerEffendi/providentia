I've been to Walter Foods 3 times in 2 years.  The first time was excellent.  I highly recommend the bar steak.  It's delish.  The second time was good, however my boyfriend found a very long hair in his salad.  Pretty gross.  It was really mixed in there.  Needless to say, the manager was VERY embarrassed and took it off the bill.  They handled it very well.   The third time was not good.  Everything was over salted.  The Salad dressings, the kale that I ordered.  It was almost uneatable.  Over salting genuinely pisses me off because that's a rookie mistake, especially in a relatively expensive restaurant. I'll go back, I'm sure.  But I'm bummed with how up and down it's been.
