Been here a few times for after-work drinks and birthdays (it's close to the office). Today, though, I saw a roach on the table next to ours, told one of our servers, and she did nothing. Luckily, we were almost done so we asked for the check, but then it crawled over to us and almost went in my colleague's bag. The other server with the leopard spots tat on her neck at least apologized and said they exterminate every tuesday, but i probably wont be back here anytime soon.
