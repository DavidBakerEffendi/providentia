YUM. Love this place. I've been for dinner several times and brunch once. I live nearby and always see a ton of people outside for bunch so I knew it would be good. Chicken and waffles - so good! The dinner portions are huge so I usually share with my BF. The 1st time we came the waitress was nice enough to tell us how incredibly large the portions are so we didn't order too much. The atmosphere is nice, I've eaten both in the back room and the front bar and found them equally appealing. I really want to go for the family style chicken dinner - looks so tasty!
