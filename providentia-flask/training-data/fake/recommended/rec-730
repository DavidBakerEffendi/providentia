Grab a Stillwater Cellar Door beer and take a seat on their outdoor patio and enjoy the beautiful evening! They offer beers from the continental US and around the world. Enjoy the modern and cool restaurant views while catching beautiful people walking up and down the street. You can even enjoy a nice city like view while on the patio. The most appealing feature of this restaurant are the doors that serve as walls and when opened make for a combo indoor and outdoor restaurant. Definitely a cool spot to hang out and when I'm back in town again I plan to visit and eat!
