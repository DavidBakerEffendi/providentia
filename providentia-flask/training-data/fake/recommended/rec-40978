We started with the Pickled Plate. We thought it would be a plate with different kinds of pickles but it tuned out to be a plate with different kinds of pickled vegetables like cauliflower and string beans. It was good even though it wasn't what we were expecting. For burgers we had the Umami Burger (parmesan crisp, shiitake mushroom, roasted tomato, caramelized onions, house ketchup) and the Truffle Burger (house-made truffle cheese, truffle glaze) the Umami Burger was great but the Truffle Burger was AMAZING! We also had the Sweet Potato Fries which were lightly coated with a mixture of salt and sugar and served with a few different dips- so good!! We also had Fried Pickles- also great. The service was a little off. We asked for tap water which they never brought. When I finished my beer it was a while before I got anyone's attention for a second. They also didn't bring the dips for the fries at the same time as they brought the fries. The food was great so it more than made up for any of that!
