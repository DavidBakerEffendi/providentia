This is my all time favorite Thai/Laotian restaurant in Philadelphia. I am not much of a salad person, but I absolutely adore all of their different salad dishes here. Papaya Salad, is probably my favorite food...ever. There is the Nam salad (vegetarian) and the Yum salad, which I get with beef that is also very very flavorful and delicious. My favorite entree there is the Pad Kee Mao, similar to the Pad Thai, but it is flat rice noodles with more flavor (in my opinion). More perks: friendly staff, BYOB, perfect place for a date. :)
