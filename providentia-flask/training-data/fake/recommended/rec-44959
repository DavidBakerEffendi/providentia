I am really torn about my feelings for Jeepney. On one hand, the food was reliable and tasty.  Went for brunch and had the Longsilog.  But I actually like the way Krystal's prepares it better.  The garlic fried rice at Jeepney was good but mushy.  And I like how the longanissa at Krystal's is crispier.  Hubs had the Bicol Benedict, which I thought was a creative way to display the marriage of different cultural influences on Filipino cuisine. The service we had was excellent.  Our server was very nice. My problem with this place is that it's pretty gimmicky for a Filipino restaurant.  I mean...a Filipino "gastropub"?!  Also, the decor is...as my mom would describe, "bastos," with the naked breasts on the wall.  This place seems like it's trying too hard to create a non-traditional experience.  The dishes are  definitely an inventive interpretation of the cuisine that may attract those not familiar.  But honestly, I just wanted good, keepin-it-real homestyle cooked Filipino food.   Just like Mom's.  But I totally respect what the owners are trying to do here.  Traditional Filipino restaurants can't seem to survive very long otherwise, so maybe this will work out.
