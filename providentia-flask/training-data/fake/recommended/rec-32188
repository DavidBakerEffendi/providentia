This is a great bar in the heart of downtown Rahway. Visited there on Saturday April 5th. They have a great selection of craft beers on tap along with other top shelf wine and liquor if you're not into beer. For dinner every member of our party of 8 had a burger for dinner. No complaints there. The bar also has a really nice atmosphere. Definitely a cool spot to stop in for a drink and a bite to eat.
