Yay! What a great find! Thanks to my fellow yelpers, my husband and I decided to give this place a try and really enjoyed the food. Don't let the crowd outside the door scare you away because it's worse the short wait. Â I tried the eggs Benedict dish portion which was large and delicious. We will keep going back for sure!
