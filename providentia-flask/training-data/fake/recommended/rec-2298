Yup this place is as good as what everyone says. Even better for me since I just moved next door, literally. There were many 6 foot gigantic subs all lined up and ready to go when I first stopped by. The sandwiches all seem to come with some kind of eggplant, i went with the fried variety and it was delicious. I ordered Nicky's Special. A combination of cured meats, provolone, fried eggplant and crunchy spicy pickled vegetables. Yum! I noticed big egg omelets with potatoes. It looked super yummy. Thought I'd save that for a later day. There are many more sandwiches to try here. Oh yeah, sizes are 1/3 and 1/2. Half of what? The 1/3 was a full one to me. My only gripe is the hours, M-Sat 6am to 4pm. I don't get it. Easy parking which is good cause there is no subway close by. I got my sandwich to go, drove by the water and ate it staring at Lady Liberty. It's good to be in NY.
