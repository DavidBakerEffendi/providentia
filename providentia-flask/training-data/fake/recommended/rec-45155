This is going to sound stupid but they have an amazing arugula salad. My boyfriend and I stopped here while visiting some friends in Brooklyn. It has a great atmosphere, and the pizza was pretty good. At our table we ordered: 1. Fig Pizza 2. Quattro Formaggio Pizza 3. Margherita Pizza All were great. The Fig pizza has fresh figs and lots of prosciutto. It actually was a little too much meat for me. The Formaggio pizza was seriously covered in cheese, and the Margherita pizza might have been my favorite The beer selection was great. When in Brooklyn, it's worth a stop.
