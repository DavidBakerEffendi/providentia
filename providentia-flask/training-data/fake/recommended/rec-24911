I mean...it's a hole in the wall. You can't expect too much in the way of service or atmosphere. Â The cheesesteak was ok...a little dry. I had to find some mayo. It could have used more cheese. I liked their drink and chip selection. It should be noted to non-locals that this is a take-out place. Don't plan to stay and eat. There is a grand total of four chairs.
