Robataya is clean Japanese food. It makes you feel good after you eat it, full but not too full, satisfied but still with some room for maybe a light dessert. You feel FRESH. The dinner menu might be kind of pricey but the lunch menu is a steal! You get salad, unlimited pickles, boiled eggs and rice, but you probably won't need it because the main course in itself is enough. --Luke's Review Robotaya is really good. It's a bit on the expensive side, but lunch is affordable I suppose.
