The wings here are pretty great. They have bone-in and boneless wings, both taste good, the boneless ones are more like chicken fingers. These are dry wings, they use a pretzel crust and it really does taste different from any other wing I've tasted.  I don't think it's better or worse, it's just different.  I usually go for wet chicken wings, but I love the taste and crunch of the pretzel crust. The pieces can be a little dry at times, but never so bad that it was an issue for me.  They also offer a unique selection of dipping sauces, I've had the Modern BBQ and the Tamarind Sweet Chili, the BBQ was pretty good but I found the Tamarind overly sweet. I've also had one of their buttermilk biscuits, I don't know what they put on it, but it was crunchy and delicious. They've also got Mac & Cheese, desserts, sandwiches, and some other made to order options that I'll definitely be back to try later on.
