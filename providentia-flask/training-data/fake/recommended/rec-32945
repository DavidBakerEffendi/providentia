I love this place. My favorite unlimited sushi place to go to.  They have a lot of appetizers going from seaweed salad to shumai and tempora.  you won't want to miss this part of the meal.  They don't have rice or noodles though so just to give you a heads up about it.  The sushi is fresh, since you fill out the papers they give you, telling them how much you want.  Order how much you are willing to eat.  It does take quite some time for your food because especially on weekends, it is really crowded and they might only have like 5 people behind the bar making sushi.  But the wait is worth it.  To end the night, they do have ice cream, but no fried ice cream which i think all sushi buffets should have.  overall, this place i highly recommended and that if you are a sushi person, come here, you won't regret it.
