Casual and authentic seafood (sea, not lake) with a great view of Lake Champlain.  Many of the tables are against the window with an unobstructed view of the lake - get there for the sunset.  Service was a little slow and included a mistake but with beers and the view, it did not bother us at all.  Not 4-star but for beer and clams or even lobster, better than a 2-star.
