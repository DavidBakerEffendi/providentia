very nice place, the decor and the ambiance is great. The food is very good, although they lack many vegetarian/vegan options i was still able to get a mushroom sandwich that was definitely on point. i wont forget to mention the ALL DAY happy hour they have mon -wed, and the drinks are stiff! the staff was friendly and very attentive. Thank me later once you have visited.
