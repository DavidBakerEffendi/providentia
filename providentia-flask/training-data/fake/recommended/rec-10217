It may be that my experience was average because I went for a very late lunch (3p). I was excited to try Pio Pio and so happy to have the place in the neighborhood. The decor inside is lovely, and the service was attentive (although it was basically empty). I ordered the lunch special - a quarter chicken, salad and a side order of tostones. $10 basically. It's a great price for a decent amount of food. My main quarrel was with the chicken. I thought the chicken was supposed to be the main event. Unfortunately, it was cold-ish and had obviously been cooked a long time ago and was sitting around. The skin looked nicely browned but given its temperature, it was disappointingly mushy. Oddly, the white meat was slightly overdone as well. And I normally expect Peruvian chicken to be highly flavorful. This really was only average. Given the hour, I suppose one could say I asked for it. But let me say, Golden Chicken around the corner, albeit a dive, hands you hot, perfectly cooked, exceptionally tasty chicken with a nicely cooked skin regardless of what time you come in. The rest of the meal was very nice. Excellent tostones. A lovely salad with avocado. Great condiments from the spicy cilantro sauce to the garlicky mojo. I would try again for the ceviche and tamales but I'm convinced this place will never replace Golden Chicken's chicken.
