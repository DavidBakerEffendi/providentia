I came here on a weeknight with an old friend to catch up, and it was the perfect setting. Small, quiet, and attentive service. We got sangria, which was fine but nothing special - mostly fruit, less alcohol. I ordered the fettuccini pesto, which was a nice light dish but also could have been more flavorful. It was a good portion size - I had some leftovers. My friend ordered the shrimp risotto with asparagus and loved it (also a good size dish). The service was excellent - both the server and the manager were very attentive and we never had to ask for water refills or wait for anything. However, I was slightly disappointed with the food and sangria. Neither one was very flavorful or memorable, and I had high hopes after reading good reviews and hearing recommendations. But, my friend loved her meal so I'll be back to try another dish. The prices were definitely reasonable for the area, and the service made the experience better.
