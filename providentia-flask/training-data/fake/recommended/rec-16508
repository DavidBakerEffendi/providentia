I have been to Graffiti a few times and have NEVER been disappointed. The place is small so you should get reservations. Food is absolutely AMAZING ! Try the lamb burger. Â They have a decent selection of wine and they do serve by the glass so you know what you are getting Jhangir Mehta (Iron Chef) has done a fantastic job with the menu. Also try Metaphor in downtown to get more of this menu
