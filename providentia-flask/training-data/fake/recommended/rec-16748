This may be the most reviewed place I've ever reviewed but still worthy of a few words.  Went there this past Saturday (post fireworks 4th of July, burgers, beers!)   Wow, is there anywhere else in Manhattan and the swanky W. Village at that , where you can get a beer for less than $4!!  shows how ridiculous prices are when you are that excited by that priced beer.  The burger is authentic, old school and good - not especially transcendent or life-altering but solid enough.  Add that to, the recessionary priced beer and you have a good old school night out.
