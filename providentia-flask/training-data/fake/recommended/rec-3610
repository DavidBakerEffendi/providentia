I do not recommend this place... My cousin, aunt and I were patiently waiting to be seated for almost 7 minutes... There were 4 seats in the front however they were waiting to put us in the back in the booth.... So two white girls came in and sat in the booth they were cleaning for us anthe same guy that told us to wait handed these girls that just walked from the street. Needless to say they did not get our money. I will not recommend this place to anyone.
