A fantastic restaurant!  At the old location of Cafe D'Amici, Matthew's Italian offers an elegant, cozy atmosphere and classic Italian dishes.  A half wall with brick and frosted glass seperates the bar area from the restaurant itself.  Matt (the owner) greeted us at the door and is as personable as it gets. We arrived soon after 6 on a Saturday night and had to wait approximately 15 minutes for a table.  Which was perfect because we enjoyed a drink at the bar before being seated.  The bar offers about 8 seats at the granite counter with a small table to the side. We started with the Seafood Salad which included mussels, shrimp, calamari, scungili, etc served cold in a lemon vinaigrette sauce with onion and it was out of this world.  My wife had the Linguini with Red Clam Sauce which is a favorite of hers while I had the Spaghetti Mala Femmina which is lobster over spaghetti in a white clam sauce.  Both dishes were spectacular.  We shared a bottle of white wine (Ruffino Lumina Pinot Grigio) from a nice-sized wine list.  For desert we split the Chocolate Bread Pudding which was delicious.   Throughout the meal we were talking about how good the food is and how there just seemed to be an excited vibe in the restaurant.  The cars were continuously pulling up the block and more people were flowing into the restaurant.  By the time we left, the bar was packed and people were even standing in the hallway waiting for tables. After going to Cafe D'Amici for years, it is exciting to see how well Matthew's is doing so quickly.  We can't wait to go back again and try more items from their extensive menu.
