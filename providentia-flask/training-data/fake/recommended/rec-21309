In Time Square? Looking for a place to eat? Hagi Sake Bar is really the only place to go. Everything else is an over-rated rip off or subpar. It is probably most well known for its yakitori or chicken skewers. Typical NYC, the wait can be up to 1.5 hours long. On the up side, you can write your name and number on the waitlist meander around TS (if you really wanted to) and they'll call you when your table is ready... an hour later.
