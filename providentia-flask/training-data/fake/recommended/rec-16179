Just went here again the other day....everyone raves about the cod roe pasta, but it was way too heavy for me. I tasted more Japanese mayo than creamy cod roe goodness. But maybe my dining experience was colored by the Blazers losing to the Rockets that day. Oh, but their nasu (Japanese eggplant with ginger and daikon radish) tastes exactly like what you would get at a teishokuya, in a good way.
