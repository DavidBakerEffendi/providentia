I frequented dive taco joints all over Cali and TJ, with amazing service, so no excuses for this one.  I am not a fan of  getting cold food or getting my order wrong. I can break it down by observing their operation - too many cooks in the kitchen and no one being tuned into what is going on.   I am not sure who owns it anymore or if the new owners have a presence, but the service has gone downhill over the last year. I will say if you do not care about service and are really hungry for good tacos, this is the place for you.  Every taco is good, every side is good.
