I celebrated my birthday here last weekend. It was a fantastic experience all around. The staff are engaging and sassy. The food was comforting. I especially enjoyed the yuca fries and the kale and avocado salad. We were there on a Saturday and they had a great jazz band. I would have preferred to see a Latin or Brazilian jazz band on a Saturday. it would have given me the incentive to stay there the whole night. The space transports you to Latin America. The bar needs to work on their classic cuban drinks. The mojito was a bit watered down and needs work but the Celia Cruz was excellent. Also I would add caipirinhas to the menu. I really enjoyed the space and I look forward to going back again!
