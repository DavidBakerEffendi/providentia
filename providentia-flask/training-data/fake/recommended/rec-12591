Totto Ramen is much better than Ippudo in taste. However, this is the fifth time I went there and I found it to be a tourist site, no New York local place for food any more. Their service was fair, but they asked for more than 20% tips though they had 15% in hand! I've never seen a place like that asking for tips! I mean this is the right of customers, isn't it?
