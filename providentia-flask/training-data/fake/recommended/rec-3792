AMAZING sandwiches but they are racist. I walked in here to pick up an order and was ignored...my white friend walks in and suddenly gets service for my order. As good a friend he is, he goes in on them and they suddenly see me. They apologized and gave us the food for free but the scars are still there. Mannnnn, the looks I got when i walked in that store. Smh.
