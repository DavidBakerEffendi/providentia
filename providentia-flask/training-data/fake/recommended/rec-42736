The bartenders here are true mixologists. I came with a fairly large party and each of our drinks were stellar. The Ginger Smash and Quiet Storm were my faves. The place was packed for a Wednesday night, but the bartenders kept the energy flowing--it never felt too claustrophobic. I was hoping for a slightly more secluded speakeasy feel, and it was more hole-in-the-wall Greenwich Village lounge energy. That said, the overall vibe was good and the drinks top-notch. I'll totally be back with a smaller party.
