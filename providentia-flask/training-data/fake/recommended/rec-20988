Pommes Frites is more of an East Village institution than a fry shack. On a Saturday night you can expect a 45 minute wait at 2 am, but it's well worth it. Expect lively conversations with the other drunk people in line with you, too. Or, just keep to your self. No one will judge. besides you're here for one thing, and one thing only: The best, greasiest, fries in Manhattan and literally too many sauces to choose from. There is no effort to appear healthy here. The sizes might at well be measured in inches to your waist, but that's okay. "I've got a gym membership," you say as you scarf down two extra belt loops on your waist worth of fries with black truffle mayo dipping sauce. This place is guaranteed to be the best bad decision of your night.
