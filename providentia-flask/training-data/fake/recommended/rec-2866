I've been here a handful of times and I've never been disappointed. The food is great, I especially love the veggie wings (which is something I never thought I'd say, being a traditional buffalo wings lover). The catfish po boy, fried pickles and brisket pinwheel are some other items on the menu that I really enjoyed. The beer selection is incredible as well. They always have some good micro brews on tap. The wait staff is very knowledgeable and helpful when it comes to describing what's on tap and helping pick out a beer. Overall, a great place to eat and/or grab a drink. I'll keep going back.
