Oh my god, where have kati rolls been all my life? I want a chain of these in every city (and Bronx too) so that I can have my fix wherever I am. The chicken tikka was spicy and a tad dry, but still delicious. The shami kabab roll was the bomb. The paratha bread is a little thin compared to your typical naan, but it works well as a sandwich wrap. The prices are quite reasonable, I just wish you could mix and match two different rolls for a daily special rather than getting two of the same ones. All in all, if this place was right down the block from me I'd be one fat m- f-
