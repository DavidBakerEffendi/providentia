Perilla was a gem that we found by chance on Yelp. The decor and service were tops and only bested by the food. We had the duck meatballs and the tuna crudo for appetizers. They were at opposite ends of the spectrum but incredible in their own ways. If you can't have both, you owe it to yourself to choose one. We followed with the ribeye steak for two which was nice and fatty (the way i like). Dessert was a trio of vanilla flavored, chocolate frosted donuts - the best you've ever had. Those donuts even made me forget about Dessert Truck! Now why not 5 stars? This place deserved 5 stars on any other night but there were a few unfortunate miscues: The patrons on our night were a mix of stuffy, touristy and douchey. Maybe that's who dines well on Tuesday nights? Our excuse was it's was her birthday. We witnessed an exterminator exit the kitchen with his equipment, walk through the dining room and exit the front door. I'm glad Perilla is either preventing or correcting a vermin problem but it's something I should never witness during the middle of dinner at any price. Couldn't they have had him in earlier or exit through a back door? All in all, this place was incredible and spot on perfect for my better half's birthday and we hope to return to add that fifth star.
