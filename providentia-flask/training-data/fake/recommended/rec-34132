Amazing food, awesome service, great wine deals, warm atmosphere, good location. It really, truly does not get any better than Becco. The first time I went was with family. We had a post-show reservation at a restaurant down the street, but when we arrived there, the host cooly refused to seat us, saying that we had arrived 10 minutes late and the kitchen was closed. Fortunately, we came across Becco a short walk away. As soon as we saw the $25 wine menu, I knew that fate had smiled upon us. I've since been back with a large group of friends, and the food and service was just as good as it had been my first time. Definitely order the all-you-can-eat pasta trio your first visit. And treat yourself to a bottle of wine. Like I (and everyone else has) said, it only costs $25. Really.
