I went to Uva with a group of 5.  First, let me get the bad things out of the way: We were sat at a too-large table, and with the noise level it was difficult to hear.  Second, our meal felt very rushed (we were in and out in about an hour. Didn't think it was that kind of place). However, everything else was excellent.  We got bruschetta for an appetizer, and although the order was quite small it was very tasty.  I got the salmon which was great and my friend's scallops looked great.  I must say though that the plane linguinne was ....strange.  Couldn't quite put my finger on it. The ambiance was great, not pretentious, but cozy and fun.  The price was about right, a bit on the pricier side, but hey this is the UES.
