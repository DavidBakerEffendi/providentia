Not only is Sabrina's (& Spencer's too) Cafe the best for breakfast, but their lunch is literally to die for. With the waitresses who look like Suicide Girls with tats and a smile. And their atmosphere fun and friendly.... then the piece de resistance... their Parm Fries are de-lish-ous!!! I take my lunch break there weekly, and my 1 hr lunch is plenty of time for my walk there, place my order, eat , pay!! then sleep :) ~ but there service is great and I recommend them to anyone young or old. ITs a Hip Spot that anyone can love.
