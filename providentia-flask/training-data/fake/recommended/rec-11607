I cannot say enough good things about Northern Spy. In a city where there are literally hundreds of great restaurants, you'd be hard pressed to find me going back to a place again and again. But Northern Spy is one place that I visit frequently and am never disappointed. In addition to their typical dinner menu, Northern Spy's tasting menu is incredible! They use fresh, seasonal ingredients in every dish. I have enjoyed their tasting menu 4 times. In each 5 course meal nearly every course was different each time! Thus, every time I go to Northern Spy I feel like I'm going to a new restaurant. Further, the service is fantastic. Every time I call to make a reservation I am greeted by name and thanked for returning to the restaurant. They always, "welcome me back," aware that I have been there before. The cozy, warm atmosphere and the incredible people who run this restaurant make it that much better to eat here. Despite having lived in New York for nearly 8 years and having eaten at dozens of fabulous restaurants, this is the first review I have ever written applauding a restaurant. That's gotta say something about Â Northern Spy.
