Delicious tapas.  Some were pretty standard, the fava bean puree was decent and Spanish cheeses were nothing special.  However, the Chorizo and chocolate, fried chickpeas and potatoes with spicy aioli were awesome.   Service was just fine for us, although the place is small and a little cramped.  It's also a little on the loud side, so don't expect an intimate night out. If you eat in the front room you'll be on stools, unless you're against the wall, so if you're one of those people who like to have a back rest on your seat, I recommend making a reservation for the back room.
