We visited weekend late lunch time, only one table was occupied by customers besides us. We took a window-side table (left side from the entrance), and there were dead fries on the window with a fly swatter. Table was somehow sticky (so I wiped with paper napkin with the served water). My partner ordered Bun with Vegetarian Spring Roll. I expected thin rice noodle (a.k.a rice stick) with clear orange sauce to pour, from my other Vietnamese experiences, but this place served thick udon-like noodle, with peanut sauce (peanut sauce just like usually accompanies with summer roll for dipping). Â  I've been to Vietnamese restaurants a lot, so it is bit unexpected.
