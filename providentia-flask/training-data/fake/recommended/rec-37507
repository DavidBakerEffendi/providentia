I love this place. Having tried a lot of sushi places in Philadelphia and other cities, and having been to Japan I have to say that this is some of the freshest sushi you can get in the city. They often have great specials and service is quick. Rolls are well decorated and not overwhelmingly elaborate and large like some places (Raw) and when ordering Sashimi or sushi they ask if theirs anything in particular you dislike, which I think is great. They are a little pricey but I think its well worth it. I think this and Blue Fin (Plymouth Meeting, Pa) are some of the best sushi I've had in the region.
