I feel this place is over hyped.  Sure its cute, adorable and super romantic.  The food though... I was not amazed.  Ordered various items, I can't remember them all.  For a fatty like me, if I can't remember, not good.  The only item I remember being delicious were the croquettes.  Second round here?  I'll pass.
