Great rice and sauces, and you get a ton of food for your money.   The chicken itself is way too dry, and the gyro meat is chopped into oblivion.  It is like salty sand.   And never wait on the huge line - they have a cart on 7th ave with literally no wait, same dry chicken, monster portions and delicious sauces.  I can see how this is a late/drunk night favorite as that is when quantity and sauce play key roles in any notable dining experience.
