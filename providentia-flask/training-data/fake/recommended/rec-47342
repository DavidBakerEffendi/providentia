Took a friend here on a birthday occasion. We've had a jolly good time with very good food. Environment: 5 stars -- Its ambient is very dark, small restaurant, do not know if it's good for big group but for small group, it is definitely one of the best feasting environments you can get! Services: 5 stars -- Our waiter was basically right next to us, as if he is our own personal butler! There's a difference between annoying waiter and one that don't give a duck about you waiter, this one is just perfect. We got what we needed, we got MORE than what we asked, and it is just enough for both of us!  (P.S. the whole restaurant sang a birthday song for you, just so you know... hahaha) Food: 4 stars -- Food was good, but it could be better!  What we ordered: App: Ceviche Mixto and Chicharron De Calamar - Both were VERY good, I'm a bit bias, I definitely like the calamari better :)  4 stars! Main course: Arroz Con Pollo - 3 stars - outer layer was a bit burnt, we cut it off and was enjoying the rest instead, it could have been better. Costilla - 4.5 stars - Almost perfect, it was glazed with pomegranate flavor, it is VERY tasty and just flavorful enough to be good. Although I do not understand the fries beneath the short ribs, not much of a fan as it is hard to eat :) Dessert/Drink: Poquito Picante - oh SPICY! I did not like it at all Another drink had coconut in it, I forgot the name, but it was VERY tasty! Pastel De Chocolate - MMM YUM!!! Free of charge thanks to birthday celebration! Price: 4 stars : I EXPECTED to pay quite some pennies for this meal, and it is what I expected to be. No surprises, you get what you paid for :) Overall, it was a very good experience. The Restaurant itself has good ambient, perfect for nice date, good food. But as all those aside, with good company, this place will be a blast :)
