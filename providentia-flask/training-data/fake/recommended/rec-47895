Hard to rank this place as I'd have to agree with a few other posters here that the food is inconsistent.  I had the pernil and we all seem to agree, they do a good job with that. The arroz con gandules that came with it was okay, but nothing spectacular. The empanadas were bland, and we ordered a variety of them--the chicken, beef AND pizza one.  My biggest disappointment though would have to be the alcapurrias. Aside from being small, they were very greasy and didn't have a lot of meat. My friend ordered the chicken steak, and it was hard to cut even with a real steak knife, and he said it was dry and lacked flavoring. He is not a fan of salt, which I am, so for him to say it lacked flavor is pretty insulting. Again, in reading some of the other reviews, I'll probably purchase from here again (stick to the pernil) but that's because there really is a lack of other establishments in this area for 'authentic' Puerto Rican food.
