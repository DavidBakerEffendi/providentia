I love this place. Every time I'm in NYC, I make sure to come here for brunch. It's cute, off the beaten path, and the decor is just amazing. You feel like you're in a rustic house somewhere with deer heads, old school wood tables, and more. It looks pretty small from the alley, but once you're inside, it's like you've entered this old school rustic home! Â Think of it as shabby chic. The brunch is delicious. We got the pumpkin pancakes, and egg sandwich. We started with a bottle of champagne, and we of course had to have a bloody mary. We sat at a table upstairs, and I think my only (small) issue is that all of the tables and seating are quite close together. At any rate, we had a fantastic time, and our server was just a doll. She was patient, let us take our time, and gave us great recommendations!
