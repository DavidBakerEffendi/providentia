What amazing service!!! My wife and I recently dropped in for a late bite to eat and were welcomed my the staff and sat by the front window. A very delicious and romantic meal shared with fruti de mare and the squid ink seafood pasta (first time I had seafood left after pasta was eaten which in my mind is Perfect!) and the staff slid an extra hightop table next to ours so we could share the dishes. A very reasonably priced meal with cocktails and amazingly delicious Italian food!! We will definitely return again!!
