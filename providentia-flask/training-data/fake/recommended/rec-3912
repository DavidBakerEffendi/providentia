Started with a Kefi Sangria, which was good. They have a really good prix fixe, which is always welcome. It's $16.95 for an appetizer, entree and dessert. I got the white bean soup, Â the chicken; which was great, crispy on the outside, moist in the middle, and finished with the rice pudding, which was really fantastic. Since I live in Astoria, it seems kind of silly to travel so far for good Greek, but if I'm already in the area, it's certainly a viable option.
