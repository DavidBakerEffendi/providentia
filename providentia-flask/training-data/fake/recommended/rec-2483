When we 1st got there the line was out in the middle of the intersection blocking traffic, so I thought maybe this place really is great. The line moved quicker than I thought and and I finally got my food. I must say that the food was ok, nothing to brag about or crave.  I've had plenty of cheesesteaks that would blow these away.  I think that Subway and Penn Station have better cheesesteaks.  As for the price it's about $13 for a philly, fry, and soda(ur paying for the attraction, not good food).  Overall Geno's is just a typical tourist attraction and nothing more.
