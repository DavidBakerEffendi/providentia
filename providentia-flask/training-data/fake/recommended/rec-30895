I really adore this place. It's beautifully decorated and the owners did a fantastic job fixing up the space. Personally, going to Outpost gives me a lot of anxiety and I can't seem to get comfortable. Lunitas is the perfect alternative. The owners are really sweet and friendly, and overall, the entire place is a lot more welcoming. I haven't dabbled too much in the food department, but I hear they now serve empanadas so I'm sold.
