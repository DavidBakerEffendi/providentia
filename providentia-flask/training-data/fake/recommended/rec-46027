Just wow. The food is well proportioned and set perfectly to my expectations (which were high). There is one place just like this in edge water but I prefer this one better. The experience was very enjoyable. Service is friendly and helpful! Food is delicious and plenty for left overs. Coming back to this place with relatives soon!
