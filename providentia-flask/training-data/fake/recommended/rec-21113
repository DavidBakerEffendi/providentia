A complete dining experience, from the romantic setting, to the relaxed yet precise service, to the eclectic mix of tourists and locals enjoying food prepared with passion and care from fresh, regionally sourced ingredients, Weathersfield is worthy as a destination in itself and we will be back.  Both quality of the food and service were excellent; dishes were appropriately adjusted for us to meet dietary requirements, and when we raved about the pickled red onion relish, more magically appeared!  A very talented classical guitarist provided relaxing music that filtered through to the dining room from the more bustling tavern; our server told us he was trading his concert in exchange for a free meal- awesome, classic Vermont.  Put simply, you can expect a perfect evening and will leave feeling right with the world...
