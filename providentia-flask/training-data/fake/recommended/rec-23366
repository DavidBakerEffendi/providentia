This is my one of my favorite spots to get brunch. The food is absolutely delicious! I've had both savory and sweat crepe and was blown away by both. I also love the coffee here. I recommend going on a nice day when you can sit outside. The only downside to Beau Monde is the sometimes slow service. I've been here once when the wait to simply order almost had me and my boyfriend walking out. However, the rest of the times I have been here the service has been much better.
