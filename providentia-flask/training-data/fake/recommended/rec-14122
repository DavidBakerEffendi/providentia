Amazing!! I started my love affair with a mojito...after a LONG day I needed to unwind. Minty and rum-a-licious! Delish. We had the guacamole appetizer. Though it was more of a seven layer dip (beans, ground beef and cheese) it was very tasty indeed! I had the short ribs, great again. Excellent service and even the manager kept checking in on us. i'm curious to try the brunch. I will be back!
