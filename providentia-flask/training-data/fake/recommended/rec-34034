I'm new to the neighborhood as of this summer and this placed opened the first week I moved in. Incredible, creative food for shockingly little money. The dudes that serve you are the owners and they keep the music/atmosphere/fresh hats coming. But the food--seriously--is better and cheaper than plenty of gastro-bs places in Manhattan and Williamsburg. Get the deviled eggs in every variety and be sure to try a signature "drank" or 3. There really are no bad choices.
