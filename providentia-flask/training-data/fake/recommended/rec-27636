First off- I am shocked that I searched on Yelp and found this!  Yelp rocks! Back to the review: My friends have been talking about this place for MONTHS- this "halal cart" that they hit on Fri/Sat nights. "Better than Mamoun's?" I'd always ask. I finally tried it last weekend with extremely high expectations.   It met my expectations and exceeded them. The line is long but moves quickly. The platter- with yellow rice, chicken, lamb (I got the combo) and the salad is all yummy- espcially with the white sauce and a sprinkle of the hot sauce. Very tasty after drinking.   Why not 5 stars?  well- I thought about whether I would go out of my way to visit and...well- Is it worth the trip uptown if you're drinking downtown?  Probably not. But- definitely go if you are in the area or passing through.
