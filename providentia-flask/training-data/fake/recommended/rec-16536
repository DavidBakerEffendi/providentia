Great restaurant, the service is excellent. My favorite dish was the brussel sprouts.  Each dish had a unique taste that differed from the others, they also have a great wine selection and a variety of interesting desserts.  The decor is very minimal and the restaurant is split up to cater to groups and a section for more intimate tables.  The price is reasonable for a quality restaurant like this.
