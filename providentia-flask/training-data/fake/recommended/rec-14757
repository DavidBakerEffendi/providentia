Owner knows his pizza! He makes his own pizza crusts, and I'll have to say, it's one of the best and won't traumatize your palate! I get the Buffalo chicken and BBQ chicken (comes with blue cheese dipper); sometimes I get the Hawaiian. Staffs are friendly and professional. Restaurant is very clean and pleasant to dine in.
