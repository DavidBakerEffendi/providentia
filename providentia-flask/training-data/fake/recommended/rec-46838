I stopped by Vegan Tree with my family who was in town for the weekend because they kept emphasizing how much they were in love with the place and that they stop by every time they come to Philly. I figured I would keep it simple and just go for the Cheesesteak. It was good but I'm  big on texture the soy steak slices were much chewier than any other I've had. I also got a smoothie. I found it odd that I could only substitute the soy milk for almond milk with a certain selection of smoothies. It had me concerned that they could've possibly been pre made or some type of mixture. Speed of service was slow they forgot my Grandmothers salad until we were almost finished our meal. I was told that it's usually not as crowded. Overall, a pretty cool experience fairly nice staff. I probably won't  stop by again, unless I just happen to be on South St. and craving for it.
