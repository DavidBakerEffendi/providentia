Really loving Brooklyn Brunch places lately!  Finally got the chance to try Miriam after hearing rave reviews.  Love the big wide windows up front. Our meal - we got the madam croquet with over easy egg on top of Canadian bacon and swiss cheese.. mmm it was delicious! The home fries were not over fried and was sautéed. Made it a very good combo for my meal. My brunch buddy had the steak & eggs, & he  really enjoyed it. Perfectly cooked medium w a sunny side egg. Coffee comes with our brunch meal. That's a good deal! Service was attentive and quick. Can't wait to return & try that amazing looking Israel breakfast!!
