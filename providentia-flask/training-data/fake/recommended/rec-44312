I hesitate to review a place after only stopping in for an app but it was a hell of an app. Name tuna with avo, shaved almond, mustard sauce and mango gets my highest recommendation. This among the top places I have found in the dumbo/ bk heights area since getting a job here and I will certainly be back for a full meal. The beer selection is standard Japanese flavorless stuff, Hitachino would be a nice addition but no restaurant is perfect.
