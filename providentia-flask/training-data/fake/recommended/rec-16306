Halal Guys, how I love thee, let me count the ways: I could eat your lamb for the rest of my days. And I just don't care how long the line; The chicken you serve is so goddamn fine. I waited twenty minutes in the bitter cold, But your 'white sauce' will never get old. Your red sauce, too, is so perfectly hot; Go without it, I simply cannot. Dearest Halal Guys, I want no confusion, So I'll end here, with this conclusion: Your food today was a perfect ten, I truly can't wait to return again.
