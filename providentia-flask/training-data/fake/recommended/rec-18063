The food is great. Pork and provolone is where it's at, and the sweet peppers and condiments are a nice touch. I'm deducting one star because your first experience will be annoying. As others have mentioned, Â you'll have no idea what you're supposed to do when you first walk in the door. There's a chaos of people shouting and sort-of forming a line. I'm also taking a star away because cash-only is lame.
