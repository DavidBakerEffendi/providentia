I am one of "those" who waited AN HOUR in line after walking across the 'brooklyn bridge for a few of their 'famous' Pies. Great Pizza, definitely enjoyed the Canolis : ) But sadly, NOT the best pizza in the NYC. Competition is STIFF! If you've never been to Grimaldi's before, grab some friends, prepare for the wait and Indulge, at Least Once-
