This is for breakfast only.  We've been there twice and I would go back again if it was early enough to avoid the crowds and if I was feeling too lazy to cook.  The french toast was the best I've had in NYC, though I'm a traditional type of gal so I order it without the Banana "stuff."  The Eggs Benedict was solid -- eggs cooked properly with the yolk being the correct texture, the sauce had good flavor, and still it was just kind of "unexciting.  Really, a good place for a dependable breakfast but besides the stellar french toast and the wonderful neighborhood there's not too much to get excited about.  If there's no line then I would recommend, but nothing worth waiting for.
