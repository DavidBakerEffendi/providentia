Again, I gave this place another chance and boy should someone slap me across the face!!  WTF!!  WHY IS THIS PLACE SO EXPENSIVE,  ITS SHIT COLDCUTS!!!  Why in the world should eggs on a 8" hero cost 7.00, its not even a legit  size hero, and they have the balls to ask you if you want a large thats only 2" more for an extra 2.00!!  I know this place has been around since moses split the sea but come on people it dont make it the best. They dont even use brand name coldcuts, shiiiit for coldcut heros that cost more than the eggs you better use at least Hansel and Gretal and believe me thats the lowest cold cut out there, you could only imagine the shit thats in your sandwich, and to top it off that crappy eggs hero was tasteless.   I wouldnt even put this place in the top 100 list,  and I'm an Italian born and raised in Brooklyn, I know what good food is and its not here
