Simple and sweet. The menu is not complicated and exactly what I was looking for on a rainy day. I thought it was odd to see no Asians there so I had some precaution about the ramen but I was pleasantly surprised! Noodles, creamy miso broth, and eggs were excellent. I think better than most ramen places in Manhattan. Thanks Chuko for a great experience.
