This place is a whole in the wall, but the staff are quick and very efficient at moving the line along. A chipper young cashier quickly swapped me a vegetable sesame pancake for a whopping $1.25. I thought I would try the pancake first and then place a second order for vegetable dumplings. That plan was quickly shot down when I laid eyes on my hot, toasty, crunchy yet soft pancake. MASSIVE. The pizza-like treat was a tad greasy, but the bread was so fresh and the vegetables stuffed inside, though not as prevalent as I'd prefer, were so crisp and flavorful. I will have to make a second trip out to actually try the damn fabled dumplings. I didn't get that far today, but I've never had a cheaper lunch! To be continued...
