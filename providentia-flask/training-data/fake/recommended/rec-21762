Ate here about a week ago - did the tasting as usual - really great as always especially the rosemary infused lamb. Â Still a great bang for the buck tasting $60pp, had a great half bottle of sparkling cider for @15, plus a nice full Burgundy for @ $28. We keep coming back because of consistency and value!
