Coal fired oven delivers a perfect pizza.  Some will say one of the best in town.  Just order a simple margarita pie, a salad and a pitcher of beer and you will be thrilled. We split ours into half a white pizza and half just cheese - don't do it.  All four of us wish we had two slices of the regular cheese, but enjoyed trying the white pizza. Lucky for me the girls only eat one slice and started with the white slice first.  Crust is perfect!
