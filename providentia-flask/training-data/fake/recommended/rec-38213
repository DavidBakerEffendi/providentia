We went on a Saturday night as a walk in for 2 and we were given a table outside along the patio rail. Any other night it would have been great but this night was exceptionally cool and breezy and my wife was cold. We asked for another table that we saw closer inside but were turned down so we decided to leave after the table side guacamole since our drinks were delivered and we already ordered the guacamole. The drinks were very good but the guacamole was very bland. We discovered that most of the herbs and seasoning were on the bottom of the bowl. The guacamole was not mixed thoroughly which can only be attributed to laziness. We wished we could have stayed to have dinner but we were to cold to enjoy ourselves and left for another restaurant.
