First time I've ever been here and I can see what the hype is all about.  Can't believe I didn't know about this gem until now.  Super good food, attentive servers that don't rush you (we were there for three hours!), fun ambience.. And all at ridiculously dirt cheap prices in New York standards.   They have an awesome hh special - 6$ wine that looks like a heavy hand poured it, but hey, definitely not complaining.  There is a good selection of food to satisfy everyone's palette.  The assorted cheese plate is a must-have in addition to the cod mashed potatoes, and flatbread.  The space isn't conducive for large groups and moreso better for intimate gatherings / dates / etc.  There is not only table seating, but also bar seating as well if you wanted to keep it casual.
