The food and service was very good at this place.  The bathroom made me laugh, i didn't know if the sink was in fact a sink or a urinal (it looks like an old urinal).  I had the market salad with chicken, sounds simple enough but trust me i've ordered salads with chicken many times in many other places and I end up chewing on old, dry chunks/strips of chicken.  Chavela's chicken was moist and delicious.  My friend had a wonderful looking chicken mole tostada which she absolutely raved about.  My only complaint is that I ordered a margarita and i didn't like it, i think they make it with beer.  I can't wait to go back to this place it was awesome!
