My friend Geno, There was a sign in front of your cashier that says, "you are in America, speak English when you order". You are damn right about it but read this. Your philly cheese steak sucks. So is the service. Cash only??? No receipt. The meat was of worst quality ever. You charge 6 dollar for fries and soda? I was told if I ever visit Philadelphia, you philly was a must. I am sorry for my bad review but one thing is for sure. It is in English.
