Seriously, 1,000,000x better than Ramen Boy. The Terakawa ramen broth is flavorful, rich, and creamy. The marinated eggs are cooked perfectly with a nice semi-solid yolk. The tan tan ramen is also great, with lots of minced pork and a slight kick with spicy flavor. I love the takoyaki, they're more authentic than the ones at Yakitori Boy, and in my opinion, much better tasting. The pork buns have a huge piece of nicely cooked pork belly, spicy mayo, tomato, and lettuce wrapped in a fluffy bao bun. Not on Ippudo's level, but they're yummy in their own right. Service is always very attentive, and I love how they yell out random sayings in Japanese. Food is getting better by the day here. By the way, I love Nel!
