All you have to do is walk down their block, and you're immediately captivated by the aroma that comes from this place. In my opinion, this is the best burger in Brooklyn. They're seasoned perfectly. They're a little too big, but most people wouldn't actually complain about that, so I won't. I love that they give you a choice of sides to order with your burger, from chili, fries, salad, etc. Their wings are also really good. They've got great flavor, spiciness, and they're meaty, not wimpy. The beer selection is great too. They have an interesting array of hot sauces. They used to have more though. Wish they would bring back the huge variety. My husband used to love to sample them all. The restaurant is cozy, with good music, and a good vibe. The owner is generally there, and he's a pretty nice guy. You can tell they work hard. I only wish I lived nearby, so I could order from them once in a while. Their prices are also a big selling point. They're inexpensive!
