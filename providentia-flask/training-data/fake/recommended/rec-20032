Exceptional food and service within a room with exceptional natural light and interest. Clearly patronized by young families and with a great kids' menu.  Vegetarian menu is exceptional as well; essentially a modification of the dishes on the regular menu.  Owner/managers constant presence and interaction with patrons takes the service to high level as they respond to potential aggravations during peak dining period without even being asked.  Pumpkin & sweet potato soup, wilted kale and escarole salad, Caputo's fresh linguini and cheddar waffles are definitely recommended.  The desserts are the proverbial heavenly.  Great wine list with some exceptional selections.  Wish they'd serve some substantive bread but the popovers and even more the cornbread will do.
