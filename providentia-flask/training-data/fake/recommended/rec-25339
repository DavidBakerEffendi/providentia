This place is everything you want from the kind of coffee shop where you can sit and study/ have a cute date/ relax for an afternoon. Beautiful baristas. Awesome artwork. Lovely lattes. Comfy couches. Finger-lickin' good food. This is the best place to spend a few minutes or an entire day. Go here go here go here go here!
