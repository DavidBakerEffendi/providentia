Comfortable, new space that has  a back yard for warmer days managed by a very friendly and welcoming italian crew.  Went there last night had a bottle of Pinot  Nero, arugula salad and 2 pizzas: Regginella and Diavola. The salad was plenty for 2. It was simple and fresh. We ate it all except artichoke pieces which  where non-chewable.   Both pizzas tasted like good quality regular  European Italian style pizza. We enjoyed both of them. The wine tasted soft and velvety and went well with our food. Stuffed at the end we still had some good expresso and frozen orange sorbet which was a nice, refreshing ending to our meal. Although it was busy, slightly stuffy and noisy at the end we had great time, felt comfortable sitting, good food and received good hospitality from the restaurant staff on a busy Saturday night. We will come back here anytime. PS I could never compare Sottocasa to Paly G's. Sottocasa's pizza looks and taste like a real italian pizza to me. Pauly G's pizza (again to me I respect all of the the opinions) is not pizza but some kind of middle eastern lavash or indian naan bread although they bake it in their fancy, special  brick oven.
