I have a love/hate relationship with this cart. Why? Because the food here is soooo inconsistent. I've had the chicken and rice several times and it's shit more than not. When it's good, it's REALLY f***kin GOOD but this happens very rarely. I love that the price always stays the same at $6 but lately, they've been skimping out on the load. It's hardly ever full. Not enough of everything and too much of the wilted greens. I would rather have them charge an extra $1 or $2 and fill 'er up. Despite all I said, I WILL continue to eat from this cart and I WILL continue to bring my out of state friends for late night food. When visiting NY, it's a must to try this cart.
