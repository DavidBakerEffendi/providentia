This place is like a miracle. I read a few reviews on here complaining about the portions but honestly I got a huge piece of their Grandmaster Veg and I am still full from it (over 4 hours ago). So idk if they changed their portion size or portions are different for take-out and dine in but I ate there. Their food is insanely delicious, full of flavors and I would totally recommend this place to anyone. I'm dying to go back.
