Penelope is overrated because it was the probably the only one brunch restaurant in Murray Hill before?? I had to try this place since everyone says i should try and always seems there are people waiting outside. so I went and had brunch there but nothing was special at all... 45 minutes wait for just regular brunch? no thanks!
