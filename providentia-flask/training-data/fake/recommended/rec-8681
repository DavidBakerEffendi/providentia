We went for dinner here one night. We had the mussels in tomato sauce appetizer and it was great! The waitress came over right away and asked us what we wanted to drink and brought them out, even though my party was all coming in ones and twos at a time. My daughter had the crispy chicken with pasta and she loved it. The rest of us shared a couple of pizzas and they were pretty good. My kids also enjoyed the dessert. I have to take a star away for the manager, even though he stopped by to ask us how the food was, and he was giving almost every other table a free appetizer or dessert for the next time. We were not offered anything like that. Not sure what is the rationale behind that - either be discreet about offering free appetizers to other tables or offer it to everybody. Other than that, had a good experience.
