I didn't give this place only one star because it certainly could be worse, but I definitely won't ever go back. I've eaten here twice for brunch and been extremely underwhelmed with the food each time. I will admit, I have pretty high expectations when I go out for brunch because I feel like it is hard to screw up breakfast food. Also, since it is my favorite meal of the day, it isn't hard for me to be in love with whatever savory or sugary masterpiece that is placed in front of me. The wait can be long; it is very busy and loud, all factors that would lead one to believe that a fantastic meal would be had by all. Sadly, you will be disappointed. Just go somewhere else. Seriously.
