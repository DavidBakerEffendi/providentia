love love love the brunch.   the atmosphere was very laid back and casual.  we were seated right away in the back.  the room had plenty of natural light and was warm. the staff was great.  very attentive and accomodating.  even though we went for brunch we asked for kimchee to take home and the waiter was more than happy to pack some up for us. we started with the blood orange mimosa and clam digger cocktails.  both were good. then onto the dumplings.  omg, they were delish.  they melted in your mouth, thats how fresh they were. we had the korean steak and eggs. the steak was so tender we cut it with a butter knife.  it came with an egg and potatoes and fresh greens.  i did not leave a drop on my plate.  yes its that good.  believe the hype!! we also ordered the hamburger.  perfect toast on the bun.  sliced pickles, red onion and tomato on the side.  also some greens.  but the chips are the reason o order the burger.  no your regular fries or chips.  they were like peels.  perfect peels. needless to say we are def going back and soon.
