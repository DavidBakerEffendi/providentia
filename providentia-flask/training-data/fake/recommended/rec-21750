My boyfriend and I had brunch here and it was super yummy. The brunch was a fixed price along with coffee refills. I enjoyed an omelette. The portion size is good! I would recommend coming a bit early because there tends to be a wait. The service was also good. I will say that the place is a little tight and you feel a bit like you are dining with the strangers next to you.
