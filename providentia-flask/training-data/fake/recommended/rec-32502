Good Thai food at great prices.  The service is attentive and courteous.  I know that there are a lot of other delicious Thai food out there, but I usually get the Shrimp Pad Thai whenever I come here.  I like how the restaurant is in the basement of the hotel (separate entrance right next to the hotel).  Also, it's great to see a diverse group of people from different country of origin whenever I come here.  We frequent Thai Taste whenever we're in New Haven.
