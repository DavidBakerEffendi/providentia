I feel bad giving this place three stars but I think giving any more or less would be inaccurate. First food: Very good but there was a piece of plastic in my dumpling! Would probably eat there again because I'm shameless. Â  We had dim sum: soup dumplings, chicken wings, dan dan noodles, and cucumber with garlic, and chocolate dumplings . Everything was very good, probably wouldn't get the chicken wings again though. More importantly, while eating my crab soup dumpling I felt of something in my mouth and took it out - it was a piece of hard plastic! When I showed it to a waiter, he's like "oh yah, that's the plastic that our crab is wrapped in." This made me think this happens often? Anyway, they gave us free chocolate/banana dumplings for dessert which were awesome and delicious! Also, we were seated near the front which would have been fine except it was very crowded and cold and the door was pretty much open with people waiting to be seated. It's also a fire hazard! Anyway, I wish someone would have told all excess people to wait outside if there wasn't room or not leave the door open.
