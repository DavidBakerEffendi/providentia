I like El Camino Real, really I do. I have my staples with the people I normally go with, and they work out quite well. It's when we try to deviate from our usual that things tend to go awry. Here's what we usually get: Veggie wings Fried pickle chips Bottomless chips All of these things are delicious, and a good value. The chips have some kind of seasoning on them that is awesome, and they just changed up their salsa verde so it's chunkier and I like the new stuff quite a bit. Try putting a veggie wing on top of a fried pickle chip, dipping in ranch, and eating it. It will change your life. Where we went wrong this time was ordering the onion rings. There were three of us, and four onion rings. Admittedly they were big onion rings, but still, four onion rings for $4? It was surprising, because their portions are typically good for the price. Our server didn't seem to understand what the problem was, and the manager she sent over also seemed mystified initially. To his credit, he offered to add more onion rings, but at that point we just wanted to be done with it so we sent them back and they were taken off our bill. No big deal, but my advice would be to stick with what works here. Aside from the above-mentioned choices, I've also had their tacos and found them quite good.
