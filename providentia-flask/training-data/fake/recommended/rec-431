We started with an appetizer of avocados and tortillas. Who would have thought that something as simple as that could be so delicious! I ordered the slow cooked heritage pork, which was tender and the perfect portion size. The sides weren't memorable. They had some interesting fusion dishes on the menu that I will have to try next time.
