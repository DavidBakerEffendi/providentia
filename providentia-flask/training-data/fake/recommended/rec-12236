Someone please explain to the management what a Caesar salad is !! I ordered a Caesar salad with grilled chicken (romaine,croutons, grilled chicken and Caesar dressing, right?).....but their Caesar salad here has tomatos, greek olives, cucumbers, and red onions !!! Basically, that is their Greek salad ! if I wanted a Greek salad, I would have ordered it !....amazing to me that no one cares what comes out of the kitchen !
