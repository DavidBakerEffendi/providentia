I've only been here once so far, but not on a night w/ live music, so I haven't even been upstairs yet. Good beer, cool atmosphere, service was fine. I wasn't super enthusiastic about the vegan options on the menu, but I was really digging the appetizers. LOVED their fries. LOVED their edamame. The hummus was good too. (I feel like I should be more enthusiastic about the hummus. But umm, hummus is hummus, I guess.) (So yeah. I know this review is not my best work. I WILL be going to Johnny Brenda's again: expect an update.)
