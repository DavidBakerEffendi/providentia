I came here with Ben W., my boy and a lovely lady friend of mine for some empanadas after we had some tasty food at Patacon Pisao. The counter lady is intimidating at first but warms up to you later. The hand-made ice pops are SO good, especially the passion fruit! However, for $2 a pop, a little bit on the pricey side. I had a bite of Ben W.'s guava and cheese empanada - interesting combination. Would've given 5 stars but the prices have increased and the empanadas aren't that big. Also, one of my boy's empanadas was 3/4 empty - skimpy on the filling :( indeed, he was very disappointed. I know the banana and nutella empanadas are calling my name for next time.
