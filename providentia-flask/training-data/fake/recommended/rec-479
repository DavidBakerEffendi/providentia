i'm just totally perplexed as to why this place is always crowded. worst tapas i've ever had. would expect this caliber of tapas at a mall in rural america, not in the middle of new york city. and that's being tough on mid-america malls. the bread they gave us was stale. the octopus tasted slimy and salty. the patatas bravas were basically Ore Ida hash brown potatoes doused in ketchup and wing sauce. the goat cheese was the only thing that was OK to eat and that's because you really can't eff up fried cheese. the service was great and they gave us a discount on sangria, as well as taking the octopus off our bill after we told them we didn't like it.
