One of my favorite spots to bring people from out of town. I love the food and drinks. Carmen chocolate martini is to die for. They have an amazing veggie burger. I love all their desserts but the smores pizza is my fave! In saying that.....Their service is terrible. Â We have waited for a check for 45 minutes before going to tell someone. My husband dislikes the food because he feels it's to pricey for the quality. I agree.....pricey meal for the crowded and loud atmosphere. That being said....I still enjoy it on special occasions!
