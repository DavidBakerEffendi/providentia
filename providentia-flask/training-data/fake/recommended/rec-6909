Vegetarians- don't be afraid to eat here. I am a strict vegetarian, and I love it. I always split the crostini (generally vegetarian), one or two salads (also generally vegetarian), and/or the soup (not frequently vegetarian). Its kind of expensive for just essentially fancy toast and salad, but the ingredients are so good and so tasty, its worth it. Plus they have a delicious wine list. And the dessert is always effen good. Yogurt ice cream with olive oil and almonds? Yummm.
