I love Do or Dine. I live around the corner, and although the food is phenomenal (that steak tartar, so damn good, wth. Also the duck, eat the duck.), my favorite part is their comfortable backyard. It's a great place to grab drinks with friends, and maybe later nosh on something delicious in the summer.
