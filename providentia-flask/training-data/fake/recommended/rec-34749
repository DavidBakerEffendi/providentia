One of the best noodle houses I have been to in Manhattan.  The noodles are delicious and plentiful, with the option to add more noodles and ingredients as you go.  The one down side of dining at Ippudo is the insane wait that is almost always there when I go.  All in all, the food is well worth the wait.
