LOVE this place. My partner and I went here on our first date and we have been going back since (4 years late and it's ALWAYS amazing). The service is warm, friendly (sometimes too attentive, we have about 6 different people ask us if we were doing ok in less than an hour, it was kind of cute!). The food is decadent. I tried their Tiramisu for the first time last year: THE best!! I have tried Tiramisu from a number of places (upstate NY and Rome, Italy being my favorite: yes ROME. This one tops them both, seriously!). Great place, yummy food, excellent service. Enjoy!
