Within the maze of shops in Reading Terminal Market is this great little place! I got the Jambalaya bowl which was pretty tasty with chicken, sausage and shrimp. However it wasn't quite warm enough from the heater. My boyfriend got their shrimp platter, which comes with corn bread, a good amount of fried shrimp and also Cajun fries (which are home fry style). Of course I had to sample everything and I loved it! The shrimp was well battered, fresh and crispy. The corn bread was light and fluffy. Cajun fries were amazing. Can't wait to go back and try other things!
