Never noticed this place before but am so glad i know about it now. Went for Sunday brunch and it was pretty empty (rare for the super crowded restaurants in the area during this time) so we were seated right away. This made me a bit nervous but I had nothing to fear--this is my new favorite place!! the food is amazing and the service very good. I will definitely be coming back--just hope it doesn't get too popular!
