I ate in more than a hundred restaurants in NYC. But this was really awesome. Perfect strip steak. And the Hangar steak coming with delicious buttery asparagus. We took a salad as a side order which was the best salad I ever had. The NY cheese cake was a galaxy ahead of what a famous factory would serve you. The brownie was also good, but I was most impressed by the REAL Vanilla ice cream accompanying it. Also top service. High chair ready when we arrived. They fixed a small table problem before we even noticed it. Prompt water service and table clean up between services. All of that for a very reasonable price, I don't remember being this satisfied going to a restaurant. my wife had gave up a long time ago expecting such a good service on this continent. Oh, and they can handle a 3 years old fine. noise level is literally perfect. my son could sing without disturbing anyone. and no one speaking above the crowd. Talking about the crowd, the restaurant was packed, on a snowbound, cold Tuesday night. Make sure you have a reservation.
