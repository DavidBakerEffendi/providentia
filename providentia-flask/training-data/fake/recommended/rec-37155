This place is amazing. Food: Buttermilk Pancakes - a huge portion big enough to spilt and a nice chunk of butter goes on the side Crispy Grits - the star of this dish is the collard greens this is the best green I've had outside of homemade of course Biscuits Benedict - this was just ok. The pancakes and grits out shined the benedict Cocktails are great the food is excellent. I'm coming back to Brooklyn just for this place
