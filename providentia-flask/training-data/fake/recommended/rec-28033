The bartender refused to make my friend a long island!!!  Personally think he just didnt known how.   Oh and he even dared to say that Long Islands dont have a soul?!  Huh?  Only drinks with a soul...so should I order a Motown on the rocks?   Lame... Oh and the beerb garden wasnt open when its 75 degrees.  Hello?!
