I seriously love Princeton Soup & Sandwich. I write this right now on my sickbed, after wisdom teeth removal, slurping up the Creamy Tomato Soup with Chicken and Orzo. It is so perfectly creamy, sweet and savory. As much as I love other establishments, the soup at Panera is too insubstantial, and at Olives too salty, but here, it is full of delicious ingredients. Even when I am sick, I muster up the energy to walk over to Princeton Soup & Sandwich for some soothing soup, or demand that a friend go for me, and this is my place of choice when others are in need of love and soup. Besides soup, I am a huge fan of their Cobb salad, because they actually put a lot of bacon and avocado in it, and their blue cheese balsamic dressing. I save that stuff with the intention of adding it to other salads, but I never do because I prefer my salads from here. Their turkey reuben is also amazing, as are their Belgian frites. Basically, I love this place!!
