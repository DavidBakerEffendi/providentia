Tried out this new place for dinner a few days ago. Interesting atmosphere and delicious food. In hindsight I should have tried the burger without bleu cheese first to get the full flavor, but it was still good nonetheless. The drinks looked interesting, but I didn't get to try any this time around. My only complaint is that the stools at the high table area, while interesting, are extremely uncomfortable; my legs kept falling asleep as I sat there. I'd recommend sitting at a table or the bar instead. In any case I'll be back this week to see how round two goes.
