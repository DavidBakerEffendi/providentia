Handy's Lunch in Burlington Vermont is a real treat.  I make it my business whenever traveling through New England (I am from near Philly) to go out of my way to stop there for the Texas Chili Dogs and THE SUPERB SERVICE. I think about the Texas Chili Dogs often and my mouth waters when I do.  The taste is so fulfilling:  savory hot dog, spiced beef, toasty bread, and tangy deli mustard comes together to make the perfect sandwich.   Earl and his Handy staff are the kindest, most fun, and down-to-earth folks you'll find behind a service counter.  It's a great all-American story, too -- the restaurant has been in the family since 1945 and to say that Earl runs it with pride is an understatement.  The Food Network should do a story on Handy's.  You get the sense very quickly that many locals frequent the place because they make you feel right at home.  Locals and newcomeers are all made to feel welcome.  The U-shaped counter enables Earl to give everyone plenty of attention.  It's a great place, folks and I look forward to my next visit.
