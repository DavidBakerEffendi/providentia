Oh. sure I may have been naive thinking any cheesesteak from Philly was going to kick ass. sure I was naive for thinking that it'd be good just because it was one of the forerunners of philly cheesesteaks sure I regretted not listening to other people say that this place sucks but you know what? I was wrong, and I admit it. Â There you go.
