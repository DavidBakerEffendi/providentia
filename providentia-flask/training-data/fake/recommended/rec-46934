I highly recommend the happy hour--five-dollar artisan cocktails!! I had the Desert Rose, which was hibiscus-flavored--very delicate and springlike. Also, the lemonana, which is basically the best lemonade you ever had, made even better by Jim Beam. Enjoyed the half-price hummus as well--it makes for a very filling bar snack. Finally, I tried the halvah mousse--a really interesting take on this traditional dessert. Can't wait to come back here for dinner.
