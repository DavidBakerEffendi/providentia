Went on a Monday lunch. Atmosphere was quiet and pleasant. Not too crowded and there was plenty of parking available in their private lot. Service was very attentive and worked efficiently. Portions on the average here are huge! (although pricey, avg $28). Menu was extensive and more than what you find on their online site. They served bread and salad before we ordered which were good, bread was hot, salad was big. White and red sangria - both were average to my liking. They had a good mix of alcohol and fruit. I just didn't like the ice on top. I liked white more than red. Chorizo appetizer - flavorful, but too salty for my liking. Ossa bucco ($32) - two big servings of short rib surrounded by potato. The meat was soft and flavorful with the vert sauce. Probably good for 2 people. Flan - below average. It had the texture down but flavorwise, I had wayy better. It was sweet but not flavorful or alcoholic. Overall, I'd come back on a blue moon to try their other menu items. Not a bad place once in a while or if you want to spend money.
