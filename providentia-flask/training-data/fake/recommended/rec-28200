Made my first trip to Pepe's last Thursday while traveling on business in Connecticut.  I'm always a little wary when someone says "this is the best ____ ever!!!"  All trepidation aside, I was up for the experience.   My colleague drove me down Wooster St. and gave me the 411 - great history in a very well-preserved neighborhood - always great to see this.  Pepe's is the crowning jewel of the neighborhood and the line starts forming early, prior to the doors opening.  That's when we joined the procession.   Doors opened promptly and we were seated.  We had already decided upon the white clam specialty pizza.  Unfortunately there was a massive carryout order that was placed and it took over an hour from the time we were seated until our pizza arrived.  I contemplated gnawing off my arm I was so hungry...   Finally we were presented with a thin, yet crispy and chewy piece of heaven laden with olive oil, fresh clams, garlic and seasoning.  It was delicious and we destroyed it.  Everything is made to order so things move a little slowly, but its worth the wait - just make sure you eat beforeheand.  Really enjoyed brick oven effect - I looked like a chimney-sweep at the conclusion of our meal, covered in "soot." As much as I enjoyed the white clam pizza, I really wish I had the opportunity to try a tomato or pepperoni pie just for comparison's sake.  Nonetheless, I'll be returning to Pepe's again soon.
