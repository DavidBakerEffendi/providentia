OMG!  Hubby and I were looking for a quick lunch on the way to Ikea and found this via Yelp. My only regret is that we don't live closer but from now on all of our trips to New Haven will include a stop to Jordan's to see Cory and Tiffany.  The chili mac dog supreme was excellent and the Jordan burger, with the surprise of a sweet glaze was also a winner. LOVED the toasty, buttery bun on both the dog and the burger...a wonderful thouch. The showstopper of our visit however, was the beans....and I don't even like beans!  Will be dreaming of beans tonight...
