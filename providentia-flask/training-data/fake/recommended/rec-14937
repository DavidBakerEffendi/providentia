My first time at El Camino Real was pretty nice, mostly because the margaritas got me pretty wasted face. I went with my boyfriend and another couple on a Saturday night and was surprised with how short the wait was. We ordered a pitcher of Strawberry Margaritas, chips, salsa, and guacamole as our first course. I have a pretty low tolerance to anything spicy but the chips were still addicting. As an appetizer, my boyfriend got The Chronic, I got the Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich, and the other couple shared a Smoked Chicken Quesadilla. My boyfriend's sandwich was incredible and the Mac N' Cheese definitely made it. My sandwich was fine, although it was a bit dry. I wish they added some more mayo or ranch dressing. The other couple loved their quesadilla. Before completing our entree's, we asked for another pitcher but asked for peach instead of strawberry. After a short deliberation, we confirmed that the second pitcher was also strawberry. That was a small mix-up but based on his overall attitude, it seemed a bit intentional. I guess it seemed easier for everyone involved to fill the pitcher with strawberry instead of dumping the remaining ice and getting a new, clean pitcher for the peach flavor. Whatever, I still got drunk and the strawberry was still good. I'd like to return and give this place another shot since people do seem to rave about it.
