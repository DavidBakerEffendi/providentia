I felt no trip to Philadelphia would be complete without a trip to Pat's for a cheesesteak. It did not live up to expectations. I ordered a steak wit wiz. Â The beef had very little flavor and there was hardly enough onions to make a difference. The wiz however was a good addition, but being from Chicago, the cheese steak from Pat's does not hold a candle to an Italian beef.
