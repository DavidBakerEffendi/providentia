Terrible.  The service was poor, the hostess or manager looked like she was having a bad cycle and the food was like something you'd make in a stupor at 1 in the morning.  Ordered a chicken salad and it was not only cold but raw inside, also ordered the bruschetta and it was puny, and the only whole wheat pasta they had was "tiny shells" that were actually totally flat pieces of pasta, nothing that looked like a shell or anything else.  Mediocre would be a compliment.
