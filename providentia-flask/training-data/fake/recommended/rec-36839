Not much to add to the earlier reviews.  I love the intimate atmosphere and the cozy organization to the seating.  The food is eclectic and experimentive, but without being unsettling.   As an earlier reviewer mentioned, I think it definitely is a pretty good place to take a date.  Intimate enough for real conversation -- certainly quiet enough -- stimulating and different enough to spur conversation, and tasty enough and consistent enough to avoid potential embarassment (you _like_ this food?!) (archly!), diverse wine list -- with a good range of selections for any palate.
