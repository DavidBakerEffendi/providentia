The three stars are only for the food . The wait and the people eating so close next to you are another thing. My advice don't go for brunch . Go for dinner , much less crowded better food because less of a demand. My uncle loves the BBLT when we go also the chicken pot pie. I've gone for breakfast once or twice and the lines and waits were crazy all to be slammed in next to some yuppies complaining about their newest Chors watch not being exactly what they wanted. Best advice go for dinner , head to the sunflower dinner around the corner at least you can always get a table and a decent enough meal .
