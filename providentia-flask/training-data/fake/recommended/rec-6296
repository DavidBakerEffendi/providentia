I have been going here with my daughter since she was an infant and have always been treated very well.  Best service and food there is in Brooklyn.  Best owners as well.  You always know a good restaurant when the owner is around.  Oysters are always fresh and meat always the best cut.  Love the Short Rib Burger and any fish special.  Would love to have more specials than what they have seems that I either come too late or they have shortened the list since they opened.  Walter Foods is always on the top of my list on a night out!!!  Summer time is great with the outside seating you feel like you aren't in Brooklyn!!!
