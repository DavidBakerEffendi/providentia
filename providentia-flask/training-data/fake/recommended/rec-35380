I eat at this restaurant pretty often because it's near where I work. Their katsu is one of the best katsu I've ever eaten. It's very crispy. I've tried almost everythnig but their curry is my favorite. I would like to eat it almost everyday if not for the high calorie. My only disappointment is the cleaness of the restaurant. I saw a cockroach on a wall one day when I was having lunch with my friend. We told the waiter and he was able to cought it but no apology. However, I still eat there becasue I can't never give up their chicken katsu curry.
