this place is awesome. their foods are more than your average sandwich. Â they are very new tastes and have an incredible depth of flavor. customer service is also really great. the first time i walked in, the guy working there was very friendly, starting conversation, and helped me make my decision. i live less than a block away, so i will definitely be going to Paesano's often.
