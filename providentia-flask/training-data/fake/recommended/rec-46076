The first time I went to Vics was with my sister, a friend had told us about it and we are originally from down south where the seafood is amazing. The sushi up north is nothing compared to the ones down south. If you want the same kind of sushi you get down south you would have to pay an arm and a leg for it up north. the first time was amazing. We got the tuna dumpling which is a bite-full. It is definitely there special item. the second time i went, was on valentines day, there were a lot of people ordering to-go orders. my date and i decided to dine-in since there were seats available (very small place) we waited literally over 30 mins for our order. they were making all of their to-go orders before they got to the orders that were actually dine-in. there were people who i saw come in and order to-go AFTER we ordered and they got their orders and left before us. it was disappointing because i really like this place but you're better off getting a to-go order because you will most likely get that order first instead of dining in. other than that, the food is good, not comparable to the south, but close enough.
