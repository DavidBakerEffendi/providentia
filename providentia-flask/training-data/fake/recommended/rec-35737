Have to update on the awesomeness I experienced on my 2nd visit back here. After searching all over for the best place to host my husband's surprise 30th bash, I ended up picking this place because I knew it was tex-mex food, which he loves, and I figured it was laid-back and reasonably priced enough to not be over-the-top for his friends who would be attending. Our waitress, who's name I can't seem to recall now (Victoria, I think?) was phenomenal in accomodating our party. She was speedy in getting the downstairs space of the bar ready for our bday crew before my husband arrived for the surprise. She was very attentive in taking drink and food orders for our party even though we were all over the place.  She took care of storing away the birthday cupcakes I brought to the bar, and reminded me to bring them out after dinner when I was too drunk to remember.  It was a perfect scene for my husband's bday bash, thanks jose p!
