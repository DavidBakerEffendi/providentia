Frequented this place quite often in dental school. The food is OK, though they've been two times at lesser where my order took an extremely long time, while the rest of the group had their delivered in 10 minutes of so. Both times I requested a refund since my lunch hour was over. Their cheesecake also taste like cardboard with the consistency of cottage cheese. Not good.
