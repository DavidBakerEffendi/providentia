Yikes. I really wanted to like this place & was so excited to try their brunch, but DAMN Balthazar was disappointing. On top of the ambiance being a little claustrophobic, the food was down right horrible. My friend & I split the french toast (decent, but nothing special) and the omelet. The omelet tasted like it was made with fake liquid eggs Â & a slice of kraft singles cheese. No veggies, no nothing! I don't mind spending a pretty penny on tasty food, but the price was outrageous for the quality of the meal. This place is overrated & a huge tourist trap!
