This place was so good it compelled me to write my first review. Being a vegetarian with low funds and a penchant for dining out sucked until I tried Alyan's out last Saturday night. I love middle eastern food and the BYOB thing is equally attractive. We had the feta and olives to start, which of course led me to salivate over what was coming next: the hummus was excellent, and the spinach and mushroom pie delicious. I also had to get stuffed grape leaves which were nice and fresh. It's a tiny place with friendly staff and good, affordable food. It's all I need.
