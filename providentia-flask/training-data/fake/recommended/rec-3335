I think this may be my favorite Chinese restaurant in the Hartford area.  It's primarily a take out place, but I like my food hot so I'll eat there in one of the 10 total seats or so ( and btw, it's byob).    I've been a handful of times so far, and the meat has always been tender, vegetables fresh, and the sauces flavorful.  I find the portions very reasonable as well.  I like spicy food, so I'd recommend the chicken or beef with garlic sauce or the szechuan pork dinner specials.   If you're looking for authentic chinese, this probably isn't the place for you.  But it's a good meal at a good price and probably relatively healthy depending on what you order.  One final note: the service very friendly.
