How annoying it is, Jess, that you spy on people like that. Kinda creepy. This place just opened btw, be a bit more gentle and patient. There are other places in Bushwick to dissect and I'm sure you'd find a lot more to worry about...in any case, the couple of times I have been here have been spectacular, the food delicious, and the service friendly and quick. I love it.
