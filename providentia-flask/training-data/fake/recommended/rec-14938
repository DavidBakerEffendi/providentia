This was good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back. The place is an authentic noodle house - you get what's on the menu, nothing more and nothing less. It's beyond affordable - dinner for 2 cost $20. We opted for Chicken Chop Cut Noodles and the Brisket Noodle Soup - both were solid: warm, flavorful, noodles were fresh and there was plenty cilantro. I just didn't think it was over the top amazing - like some of these reviews have raved.
