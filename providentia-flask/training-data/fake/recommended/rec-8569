I asked the guy at the register his favorite and he said the cheese steak. I got that and I'm happy I did. He was super friendly and talked to me while I sat. The cheese streak was better than other local spots known for hoagies. I also got the tiger fries after. They were okay. I liked the cheese streak so much I'll such with 5 stars
