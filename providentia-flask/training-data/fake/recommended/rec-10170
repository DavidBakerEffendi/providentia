I had my birthday party here this year. I made a reservation a few weeks in advance and had to call to confirm on the day of the party. The place is cozy, intimate and stylish. It's a little difficult to find since the exterior blends in with the rest of the block. Both the drinks and the tapas are delicious. My party of 12 tried about half of the items on the menu. The fried goat cheese, brussel sprouts and truffle surprise were favorites. This is probably the best tapas place I've found in the city. I definitely recommend Alta for a special occasion or date. I can't wait to go back!
