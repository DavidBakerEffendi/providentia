I haven't had an amazing burger in a while.  The two8two burger is great.  It was juicy, and tender.  The hint of spiciness from the chile made the whole burger irresistible.  I was craving for more after I inhaled my burger.  On a side note, I also had the nachos, which were okay, I've had better.  The service was good, I will definitely be coming back soon.
