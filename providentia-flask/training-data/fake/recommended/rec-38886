Very disappointed with our dinner tonight. Restaurant was empty and of course they sat another party next to us. My husband and I had dined there 2 years ago and it was decent. Returned this evening and it was not good. Courses were rushed even though it was not crowded. Â Food was cold and unappetizing. My husband told the owner that we were disappointed and he responded that we don't need customers like you. Well guess what, Philadelphia doesn't need restaurants like you. Ten years ago this may have been the standard but today don't waste your time or money.
