I have had two AMAZING experiences at Cafe 72 by Cuginos. This restaurant is consistently friendly, attentive, and efficient, and the food is absolutely amazing. Even on Sunday mornings when I expected a long wait, I was seated within 5 minutes. The atmosphere is also really nice. Â Even though the restaurant was full, I never felt rushed or pushed to eat quickly. I love the decor as well! The dishes are constantly changing, so you have a chance to try many different dishes. I especially like the Italian influence on brunch favorites. For example, during my first visit I was blessed with an egg white omelette with pesto, tomatoes, mozzarella, and spinach. Best omelette I've ever eaten. And even better was the cannoli stuffed French toast. That's right. Cannoli. Stuffed. French toast. Need I say more? Cafe 72 is constantly creating new dishes and spins on the classics, and I am proud to say that it is one of my favorite brunch places of all time. Run, don't walk to this amazing restaurant!
