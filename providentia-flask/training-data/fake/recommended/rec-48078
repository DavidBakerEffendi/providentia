This is such a hidden little gem. Really excellent dinner- fresh food. Loved everything. The pace of our dinner was extremely slow, which we didn't necessarily mind, but the waiter bought us dessert because it was so slow, which was nice. Flour less chocolate cake was delicious. I cannot WAIT to go back
