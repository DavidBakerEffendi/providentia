The food is below average for Korean food I've had. The beef ribs were dry and tasteless. I ordered the ribs because the waitress recommended it. What a mistake! The Soondubu is ok, not even close to to be good. The environment is unbearably noisy. You can't carry on a normal conversation 'cause you can't hear yourself without screaming. Â Not a place for a sober person to go.
