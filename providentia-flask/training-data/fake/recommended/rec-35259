This was one of my favourite food experiences of New York. After visiting the Tenement Museum close by, we briskly walked here in hopes to get in early before the rush. There were about 6 couples in front of us eagerly waiting for the doors to open and escape the cold December weather. In keeping with the Christmas spirit, with much amusement I ordered the 'Jingle Balls'. These meatballs were made from reindeer meat with orange zest and juniper drizzled with a cumberland sauce with a currant, chocolate demi-glaze. I was like a child unwrapping numerous christmas meatball presents! A real treat. Don't be intimidated with the hipster cool vibe it gives off. The meatballs are amazingly creative packed with flavour and the staff know there stuff and are always on hand to offer recommendations and suggest the best fit for your stomach. So go ahead and indulge!
