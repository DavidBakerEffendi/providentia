I LOVE this place!!! The secluded ambiance, the delectable and fresh martini's, the music that makes you feel like you just stepped out of The Great Gatsby, and the super-hot male bartenders. I came here about three years ago and have loved this place ever since. Came in on a Wednesday for my birthday with friends, and to my surprise they had an impromptu burlesque show! Although it does get a bit crowded with ladies, (guys, this is definitely the place to be) the martini's are the best I've had in New York City! Try the Amelia!!!
