Tucked away on the 9th street, Cha An is a little oasis in the busy New York city.  Straight up the fleet of stairs, behind those fabric curtains is a tea bar.  I like their $10 daily special.  On Mondays it's Chicken Soboro (minced chicken with fresh herbs and rice), a side dish of chicken simmered in broth, some pickles, and genmai (brown rice green) tea.   Black sesame pudding is as good as everyone mentioned, topped with black sesame ice-cream and a piece of honey glazed thin pastry.  The $16 special A on the multi-grain porridge was however not so impressive.  It did came with a delicious chestnut cream tea roll with berries though.   We've also attended their tea ceremony ($15/person), lasted about 30 min that includes only 2 pieces of plain mochi and a taste of Matcha.  It was a very very brief intro on tea ceremony, and the hostess even dressed up formally for us.  I thought it was interesting but didn't really worth $15 for that though.  Then again, I'd love to come back again for their delicious dessert and tea!
