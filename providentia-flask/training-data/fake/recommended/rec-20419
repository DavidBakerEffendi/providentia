What I love about Five Leaves is that the dining experience somehow manages to feel season-appropriate, no matter what time of year. It's the perfect place to seek shelter on a frigid winter evening, huddled close to your companions in the crowded dining room, sipping a fiery hot toddy out of a mason jar and enjoying hearty fare. Come summertime, it's also a great place to grab a juicy burger and sip lemonades on the sidewalk. Though I'm in love with their regular burger (comes with an amazing harissa mayo!) and order it every time, my friends have practically deified the monstrous Five Leaves burger. Â The beetroot ravioli is also a favorite.
