Why have I delayed in expressing my love of Memphis Taproom?  My praise is long overdue. The first time I went here was coincidentally the same weekend that Craig LaBan reviewed it (positively, I might add).  I enjoyed my jersey tomato and tofu salad and the fabulous beer selection, but I *really* enjoyed the saturday afternoon patrons.  Girls doing knitting? check.  Random locals of all ages watching sports in the bar? check.  Couple with a baby? check.  But my favorites were the little old lady and man who came in separately and just wanted to take a look at the renovations, and the woman from the neighborhood who sat down at a table by herself.  She was about 60-ish, wearing a pink sweatsuit, and she ordered a bloody mary and sat there reading her book.  A few minutes later, the owner came by, sweeping the floor.  She looked up from her book and asked "Are you the owner?"  He nodded, and she beamed at him, saying "This is my second time here!  I just love this place!"  Then she went right back to reading her book.  Later, her waiter came by and asked her if she wanted another bloody mary.  She looked down at her empty glass, paused as if thinking it over, and then said "Hey, sure.  Why not live a little, right?" Was it nosy of me to observe all this?  Yep.  I'm a nosy girl.  But, weirdly, I couldn't stop thinking about her for the rest of the day...it was amazing how happy the presence of this establishment in her neighborhood had made her, and her joy was contagious. So yeah...Memphis Taproom fills a unique niche, in that it seems to be highly appreciated by both hipster transplants and native fishtownians.  And the fried pickles are killer.
