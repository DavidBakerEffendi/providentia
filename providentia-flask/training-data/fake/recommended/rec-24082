I love your food, please don't ever change. Ambiance 10 Service 10, friendly waiter, bus service was very considerate. Great recommendations Wasabi mashed potatoes are delicious. Chilean sea bass is phenomenal. Desert bento box is a must. I seriously consider this steven Starr's best joint. Incredible, and I've been here 3 times now and every time is better than the last. Thank you for seating us at the Budda table for our anniversary!!
