After hearing great things from various friends, I decided to venture to Buttermilk Channel. The staff and the atmosphere is great. Nice environment and pleasant staff goes a long way in my book. I wasn't, though, taken by the food. I ate there for brunch. I ordered the short rib hash, which had too much of a spice in it for my taste. I think there was too much cinnamon in it. My friend had the fried pork chop and cheese waffle, which was okay/good. The meat was cooked well, however, the chop didn't hold much way in terms of flavor. If it wasn't for the breaded coating, it would have been a very boring piece of meat. Also, I ordered the warm coffee cake as a side. It came in the form of fa cupcake and was too sweet and on the dry side. All-in-all, I've definitely had better.
