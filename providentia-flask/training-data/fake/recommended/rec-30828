Absolutely amazing food. Every dish is well thought out and extremely tasty. Friendly staff and good service. Very calm atmosphere. Good for dates and family dinners. I went here with my aunt who is a pretty picky eater (meat, and starch, nothing green) and they accommodated... even though they do have amazing food and she's truly missing out. They were polite and respectful about her requests.
