I had to write a review on this restaurant.  My coworkers and I had a wonderful time at lunch.  The service was fabulous.  It's a wonderful day to have lunch outdoors (a plus for us).  The restaurant is nestled on East 52nd between 2nd and 1st (closer to 2nd Avenue).  They have a 3 course lunch special and it was wonderful.  The food is fresh, and their Lebni for appetizer was creamy and refreshing.  I highly recommend this restaurant for lunch and/or happy hour.  I will definitely return!
