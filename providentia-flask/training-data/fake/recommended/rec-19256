The appeal of Room Service does not come with the food, but the atmosphere - its design is reminiscent of a room at an ultra-hip, luxury hotel my wife and I once stayed at in Bangkok as a wedding gift from a friend (we're frugal sorts, normally).  aNd I think this is the feeling the restaurant is going for,.  There are lots of mirrors, and there's quite a bit of metal in the room.  Metal on the chairs, metal on the floor, atmospheric W hotel music in the background. But despite the high-end design of the room , food prices are comparable to the other thai joints along this row. We went for fairly basic dishes, a pad thai and a massaman curry with the fake duck that every thai restaurant in New York very nicely has on its menu..  The pad thai was a bit dry for my taste, but the massaman curry delivered what I needed.
