this place was recommended by a friend and was pretty good.  we came on tues night, and it was hopping.  i couldn't get a reservation for 4 people until 9:15.   the calamari app and and beet salad were delicious.  for entrees, 3 of us shared the roast chicken and monkfish, and they were tasty.  the roast chicken was a great deal, considering you get half a chicken.  we also got the potatoes and greens on the side.  for dessert, we shared the chocolate budino and the salted caramel and pistachio gelatos.  the budino was amazing. i like the feel of the place, since it's a remodeled garage and totally industrial.
