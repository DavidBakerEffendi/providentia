I had been trying to get in for a few weeks now but the waiting time was 1-2 hours long. I finally had dinner there last night and it did not disappoint. The service was amazing; the waitress was charismatic, very attentive and we even got a complimentary beer at the end! The food was very good. The catch of the day dish was excellent. The best part was the bill at the end. Having two main courses, appetizers and several rounds of drinks for under $100 in NY is quite amazing. Would definitely go back.
