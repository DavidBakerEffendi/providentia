Went to The Good Fork last night after they reopened after Hurricane Sandy.  Such great food!  the Brussels Sprouts starter was like a warm salad with the best bacon ever and bits of the tastiest egg.  Happiness making!  Duck and Chicken entrees  were excellent as always! So glad The Good Fork is back!
