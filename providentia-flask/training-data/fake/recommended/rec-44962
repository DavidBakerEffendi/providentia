I went to Ilili with 4 others for dinner on a Tuesday night.  The place itself is massive, with many tables, and tons of diners.  Yet somehow it doesn't feel factory like, and the ambience is actually pleasant, tho it is definitely on the loud side.   We were seated promptly, and provided with menus and water etc.  Then the servers disappeared for a while, which was fine since we were all catching up but could have been annoying if we were in a hurry.  We ordered a bunch of food to share - the standouts were the beef shawarma, lamb kababs and green beans.  Everything else was delicious as well.   Would definitely go here again for a group dinner.
