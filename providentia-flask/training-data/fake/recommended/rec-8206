OK and not the best in NYC. I eat it without any sauce and its very bland because I've had the red and white sauce and they are both terrible. Nothing special at all. The best I've had is "King of Falafel & Shawarma" in Astoria and Midtown East (a couple blocks from Halal Guys). They cook their meat with onions which makes it juicer and taste better. They also have the rotating gyro meat things at their cart! The hot sauce is way too spicy. I drizzled a little bit on and it ruined the meal. And the white sauce is way too heavy. I can eat the entire platter without white sauce, but once I put it on after a few bites I feel sick.
