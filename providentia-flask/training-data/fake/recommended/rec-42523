I originally gave Donostia four stars, but I've been back twice since my first post. Each time with other people, and once with a group. I know that they don't represent themselves as being a restaurant. They offer conservas, Spanish canned seafood. I was disappointed that they've been out of mackerel, and that when they serve tuna--that's it-- a lump of tuna out of a can. They make no effort to provide garnish or make some kind of presentation. The main players here seem to be detached from their role as those making this a culinary experience you would want to revisit. It's not like they appreciate your business. The only redeeming reasons to come back here are that my wife loves the pur√©ed artichoke hearts and their outstanding selection of Spanish vermouths. I would go back for the latter two, but management should be aware that hospitality and visual presentation of even high end canned goods are a key to developing a regular following. I'll be back, but only to see if you can step up your game. I now know where to get the vermouth retail--so I need a reason to keep coming back.
