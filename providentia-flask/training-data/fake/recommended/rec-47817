The food has never disappointed. Even when I get it taken out it holds up well unlike other breakfast places. The service has gotten to be a problem. Every time I try to call in an order I either get hung up on or they just put the phone down so I can hear everything that's going on in the restaurant. They get very rude and I can hear the annoyance in they're voices because I'm calling in. I understand that it can be obnoxious on a busy day but kindness goes a long way.
