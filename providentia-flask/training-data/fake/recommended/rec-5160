Fantastic service is a huge plus. Just came back from a trip to Austin, TX where the wife and I waited for three hours to get in to Franklin's BBQ (supposedly the best BBQ on the globe). The BBQ here was VERY similar -- not as good, no -- but certainly close! Â And there wasn't a three hour wait for it! Highly recommend this place, really enjoyed it and will be back.
