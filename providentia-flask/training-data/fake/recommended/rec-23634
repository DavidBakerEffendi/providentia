We had to stop in for a quick dinner before the Nutcracker.  We only had an hour and our server made sure we got everything quickly.  The lamb was delicious.  My girl had the salmon.  It was ok.  I don't ever recommend ordering salmon at a restaurant just because it is too easy to screw up.  Too fishy.  Anyway, not a bad place to stop in for some authentic greek food.  The decor is very nice as well, even it is a bit Olive Gardenesque.
