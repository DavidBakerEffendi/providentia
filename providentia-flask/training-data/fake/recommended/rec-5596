I went here with a good group of friends after a huge dinner and dancing, and had the most delicious moscow mules (lost count somewhere, Â but I know they were good, heh!!) , which is one of my favorite drinks. Moreover, I really enjoyed the rooftop bar; chilling there was the perfect way to end the evening! That being said, out of a group of 8, two of my friends' drinks were undrinkable. One got a cosmo, and the other got a martini. None of us could drink either, they were so astoundingly bad =( It could have just been an off night...When I'm back in Philly I would consider going back because the deck is so nice, and the people who work there are as well, but I will definitely stick with the Mules and not stray!!
