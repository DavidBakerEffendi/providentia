Very pleasing brunch place.  It had a cozy atmosphere, the waiter was very friendly ( I didn't feel he was just working us for a good tip), and the food was fantastic.  We ordered pancakes, the veggie sandwich, and an omelet.  Though different from each other and slightly different from what I was expecting, they were all outstanding.  When we got the check, it blew my mind that I was getting such a high-quality breakfast in midtown for so cheap.   This being the case, it also surprised me how low the yelpers had rated it.  YES, the tables are a little bit closer to one another than is usual for a small cafe.  YES, i could see it getting a little noisy.  Get over it you claustrophobic  anti-social dickholes, this place is great.  In summary: *Fantastic food *Friendly service *Cheap *A little cramped *A little noisy Definitely going back again.
