It was late and we didn't know what to do after vising the "eh-ok" Pinkerton wine bar across the street, and we stumbled in because it looked seriously adorable and cozy inside and we weren't in the mood for a big meal, so the long list of crepes on the menu outside sounded just right. Boy am I happy we stumbled upon this spot. THIS IS THE DEFINITION OF A HIDDEN GEM! $5 for wine? Yup! $10-14 for AMAZING NOT TOO HEAVY HEALTHY crepes with SERIOUS YUMMINESS INSIDE! I am already plotting my next visit.
