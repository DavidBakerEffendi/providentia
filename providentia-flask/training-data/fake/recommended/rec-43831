Best pizza I have ever eaten. If I were to make a list of pizza places to visit this would be #1 FOREVER. This restaurant alone is a good reason to come to NY. Only drawback is due to it's super goodness and off the chart out of this world deliciousness AKA taste-bud stroke inducing capabilities its really popular. So if you come here a bit too late (around 6) you will wait in line for a long time. I waited for about an hour ........... ANNNDDDD it was worth it. Skip to this part if you don't want to fry your brain with useless made up words depicting how good this place is. Basically if you like come here. If you don't like pizza come here. If you don't live in NY fly to NY then come here. If you're too young to fly to NY wait until you get old enough then come here. If you're too old to fly here threaten to take away their allowance and get them to bring you here. Skip to this part if you're actually trying to get something useful out of this review. This place is awesome just go try it then marry it.
