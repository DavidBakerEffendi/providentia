i have heard so many good things about kyclades that i had to try it, so my boyfriend and I went there last night.  The restaurants design is really cute, you actually feel like you're by the water and the fishy smell fits in with that well  The restaurant was packed to the point of being unable to hear what the person across from you was saying, but very able to hear what your neighbor was talking about ithout trying to eaze drop on their convo, the tables were so close to one another, even the skinniest person had trouble squeezing through the chairs to get to the bathroom. On to the food, we ordered the green salad, and once again the fetta didnt taste like feta, it was just a white cheese with a wierd taste, same texture as feta but not fetta (stamatis and  kyclades must buy their fetta together), other than that the salad was a good size for the price. We ordered the saganaki-fried cheese which was really good i could've eaten like 20 of them and then died with my face in the plate.  The kalamari was my least favorite part of the meal, a whole lot kalamari with absolutely no taste at all.  I tried to put some lemon on it, i tried to put some salt on it, but nothing worked, there was no saving the kalamari. The tzantiki came out after the hot appetizers and my boyfriend asked if we could send it back... enough said.  We decided to spli the red snapper as our main course with lemon potatoes which were good.  The fish tasted fresh and was really good we both enjoyed it and would order it again.  The service was good and our water glasses were always full.     I definetly expected better but i think 2 stars might be too few, 3 or 3 and a half is just right.
