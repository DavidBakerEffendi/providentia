Came with my husband and a good friend and it was all our first times having Ethiopian.  Couldn't have picked a better place.  Staff were nice and ambiance was clean and intimate and hip without being pretentious. But the highlight really was the food. We didn't really know what to expect but all us were blown away.  Everything was incredible. We got the meat combo platter for "two" but it can easily feed 4 people.  Everything was spiced so well and I couldn't stop eating even though I felt like I was about to burst.  Def would come back.
