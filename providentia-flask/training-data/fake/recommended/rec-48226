i have only had the roast pork and the beef brisket, and both(especially beef brisket) are pretty damn good. my only complaint- you cannot get a beef brisket sandwhich before 11am, which if your trying to avoid the long lines full of annoying tourists who saw this place on the food network will not do you justice
