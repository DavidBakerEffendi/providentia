Went with my girlfriend on a Friday night. We got chicken pad thai, chicken drunken noodle, the thai sampler platter and the fried ice cream. Chicken pad thai was fairly close to the pad thai you can get on the streets carts in Bangkok. The drunken noodle was spicy and delicious. I'm not big on sweets so the fried ice cream was just okay. What I was MOST pumped about was that they had (what appeared to be) homemade chili sauce. I ask for this at every Thai and Vietnamese restaurant I go to and am often responded to with a bottle of Sriracha sauce. Went from six to midnight at the sight of it. The sauce was spicy and delicious.
