Had dinner in N Philly on a rainy night. Luckily, there was parking around the corner. On a nonuniform street of grit, next to a church, is Mark Vetri's second restaurant. An extremely warm atrium abutting the main dining room causes the patron seated there to walk a good minute before reaching the low-lit table adorned with small vase and fresh flowers. it is romantic and warm (pun intended!) off came the shawl. Parusso Barolo---$21 for a glass (ahhhhh..dreams of Piedmont). Oversight on our part. Too rich for our blood! Bread basket came with only olive oil...super fresh. Delicious. Ciareghi sausage (wild boar) with polenta and a quail egg---the polenta was still very relaxed and we found it a bit too oily. I tried the candele pasta with boar ragout. Great chew on the gnarled thick carb, and the sauce was very tasty, though could have done with tad more liquid....that ragout. He had the cod entree, which was cooked well, but very very light in flavor profile with its accompaniments. Dinner was satisfying. We were hoping for blow-me-away. Still, for a mid-week meal, place sure was buzzin! PS bathroom is looong haul, alongside the kitchen, if not seated in the main dining.
