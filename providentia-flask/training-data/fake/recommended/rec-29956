Took the fam to Little Italy for the first time, and was looking for a last-minute dinner reservation.  Yelp to the rescue!  The person who took my call was warm and accommodating, and I had a good feeling even before I walked in the door.   They had a fantastic bread basket full of soft warm bread which they were happy to refill, and besides the customary oil and vinegar, even gave us an extra dip of olive oil, garlic and cheese which was delicious!  Among the four of us, we ordered two appetizers and two entrees - the day's special of Portabella Mushrooms (without the meat), a Mozzarella Salad, a Risotto and Gnocchi.  Everything was fantastic, and the service was super quick - there literally wasn't a minute when my water glass wasn't full!  For the vegetarians, they have a good selection of vegetarian entrees too, which can be unusual.  The only reason I rated it 4 stars was that the AC could do with an upgrade, especially on a hot summer evening. Will definitely be visiting here again!
