Ilili was my first experience with Lebanese cuisine, although I am familiar with the Mediterranean palate, which I enjoy.  It is a beautiful upscale restaurant and really quite an interesting space.  There is almost an "Asian Tea house" sort of vibe, with high ceilings, and rooms divided by wooden panels with semi-opaque screens.  We were well taken care of at the bar and our table with friendly and attentive waitstaff. All the dishes are tapas/small plate style, meant to be shared.  I came with a party of 4 and we started with the Mezza Petit, a sampler of several of the tapas, which included some traditional favorites such as hommus and baba ghannouj, but also had some more traditional choices, like the Mekanek (lamb sausage sauteed with olive oil and lemon,) which I wouldn't have necessarily chosen, but really enjoyed. Other favorites from the night included the Lamb Kabobs, which were perfectly spiced and tender, the Duck Shawarma, a sandwich of sorts with a great flavor, served in a cone holder, and the Kibbeh Bi Labon, which were beef dumplings (almost like meatballs) cooked in a yogurt sauce. We shared one dessert, the Essmalieh.  This is such an interesting dessert. It is two layers of Kataifi, which is a "nest-like" sweet crispy dessert food. In between the Kataifi is Achta, a traditional Lebanese dessert, sort of a sweet Ricotta cheese in taste and texture.  This dessert was crunchy and sweet, but not too much.  It was quite different from anything I've seen and was yummy. I really enjoyed my dinner at Ilili and have a new appreciation for Lebanese cuisine.  I would like to return to Ilili and try the many other dishes to choose from.
