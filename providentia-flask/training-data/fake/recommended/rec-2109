We drove up to Philadelphia for a conference and decided to take a couple of friends, who'd never been to Philly, out for a cheese steak. The amazing thing is after a long wait and curt service, we ended up with a $40 plus bill for 4 cheese steaks ( which if you piled all the meat from 4 on one roll, you'd of actually had a sandwich) and 4 sodas. Definitely, a tourist spot. You wait in a long line to have someone snap at you. Granted their menu is small, but not everyone knows the lingo. Sort of reminded me of the soup man from "Seinfeld". Then there's a matter of finding a place to sit and enjoy your bread, I mean cheese steak. It was fun to stand on X street and wander how cars would get through when the two lines from the competing stores merged. Don't forget they don't take plastic, but conveniently located on either street are fee charging atms. Next time, I'm taking the cousin's advice (which I received after this disappointment), and going to Jim's...aka home of the heavyweight. After Geno's, not gonna be too hard to beat.
