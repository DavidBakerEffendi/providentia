I just got back from eating here, and I don't have proper words to describe how great it is--its phenomenal!! After living in Paris for a while, I know a good crepe when I see it. And this place makes excellent crepes. The adorable owner is actually from france, and does a great job!! Super affordable, and very country cute decor. This place makes me want to move to Williamsburg! I will make the trip down here...often!
