Be prepared to wait! The place is gorgeous. The design details from the hand carved and painted ceiling to the ornate antiques makes for a very romantic looking bar. Lillie's is also convenient for the theater going crowd. I was really looking forward to checking it out. We arrived early for our brunch reservation and were seated right away.  We ordered within 10 minutes of our arrival. After 40 minutes we finally got someone's attention and asked where our food was, we were scolded for not telling our server we had a show to make. Even if you don't have a show, in which universe is it okay to wait over 40 minutes for something to eat. We ended up waiting 45 minutes for our food!  Coffee was only refilled upon request. My friends had omelettes which they liked. I had the chicken with roasted vegetables. The chicken was excellent, but the vegetables were undercooked - crunchy parsnips and potatoes. There was no bread  or toast served with the meal. Also, the misleading special posted on a sign outside was a bit annoying; it was only available weekdays. I'd go back for a beer at the bar, but there are better places for brunch. FYI the seating is a little awkward. Everything is very high off the ground, whether it's the high bar stools or the banquettes.
