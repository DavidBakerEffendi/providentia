4 1/2 stars! Love this place!  Makes you feel like you're in Paris. Upon entering the restaurant, it's a bit chaotic and crowded, with guests arriving  and leaving and just walking around, appearing somewhat confused.  But once we were able to check in, we were seated after a couple of minutes.  Do make sure to make a reservation in advance.  Although we did hear the host give estimates between 30-45 min for a table of two during lunch, which we didn't think was that bad.   The menu items appear to be what I would call "comfort French food" (onion soup, mussels and nicoise salad).  All items were delicious!   You are seated very closely to one another, where at times, it can be very difficult to keep focused on your own conversation, esp if you are seated by someone who is very loud...yup, that was in our case. However, the food, waitress and decor and ambiance of the restaurant all made up for our obnoxious neighbors! Definitely will make a point of returning!
