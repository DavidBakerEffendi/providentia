I was here for brunch with my boyfriend. We came here on a Saturday at around 2:30pm and were seated right away without a reservation. This place is pretty spacious so I'm glad they were able to accommodate us so quickly. I had read online that they served gluten free bread so I asked if they had it (they didn't mention this on the menu). And sure enough the waitress said that they did. I ordered the goat cheese sandwich on gluten free bread (without the goat cheese - ironic, I know! But I am after all vegan). This comes with grilled eggplant, onions, peppers, and zucchini. The sandwich was greasy, bland and dry. It was supposed to come with a tapenade but mine didn't have any which made the sandwich really dry. The side salad is a mixed greens salad and came with a vinaigrette dressing (I have no idea what the dressing was because the waitress had no clue, when I asked her whether it was vegan and gluten free, she just shrugged. It really irked me because I clearly motioned my dietary restrictions before I ordered). The salad itself was just a greens salad; I wish it had some nuts or something for crunch and texture. My boyfriend ordered the steak and eggs, the eggs were fried and the steak was medium. The dish was hearty and filling but nothing to write home about. Personally, I felt the food was average at best and the service was subpar (or at least our waitress was).
