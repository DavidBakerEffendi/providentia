School is out, so we decided to kick back and take it easy for the day. We rolled into Habana Outpost, a real gang of four, and checked the space for a free table. At first we had no luck, but after about a 5 minute wait we scooped up a couple chairs and took over the first available table. "So this is what 70 degrees feels like," she says, as she slaps on her sunglasses and crosses her hands comfortably on the back of her head. Two of us share a guacamole & queso burrito, the righteously famous corn, and some guac and chips, while we all enjoy an icy cool cup of iced mojito. The burrito is cold, which sounds odd, but on a warm spring day like no other, it's just right. The queso and guac are mixed excellently with rice and beans, with a side of jalapenos. The fantastic corn is something out of a Paula Dean throwdown, but the portion size is forgiving. The guac is rich in texture and flavor, although slightly overwhelmed by the raw red onion. The mojito is nice and refreshing, composed of crushed ice, lemon, and a barely traceable taste of rum. These aren't your typical mojito ingredients, neither does the drink actually taste like mojito, but it's still highly enjoyable. Nice atmosphere, happening people, wicked vibes, tactful portions, and a potential sun tan make Habana Outpost something to write home about. But don't bring your date here!
