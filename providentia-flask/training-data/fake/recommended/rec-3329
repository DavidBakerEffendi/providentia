Jahm Ske's and Dunn's River are neck and neck in competition. Sometimes Jahm Ske's seasons their food better, other times it's cold or older. Dunn's River, to be honest, might slip up every so often, but they follow through with generally consistent quality food. I just hate when they sometimes leave those little black pepper balls in there. The taste is hard and overwhelming of black pepper. 1.) Service: Dunn's River moves pretty quickly. Normally I will find myself waiting in the midst of several people in front of me. If I were to time it, I would believe my order is ready in the matter of 5 to 10 minutes. The staff is nothing but sweet. No lip, no mean face, no attitude. Just sweet, helpful and accommodating. Kinda like the way the culture is in the homeland, Jamaica. Dine in or take out. You choose. 2.) Client base: The place I would say it pretty big for customers to dine in. It's amazing how many kinds of clientele come here. Business men, doctors/nurses, families, teens, etc. Apparently people love Dunn's River. 3.) Food: I have a dish or two that i'm comfortable with. I normally choose the Curried Goat with Rice, Peas and Veggies. It's normally served temperature hot, a little spicy, and the seasons are great with the goat tasting nice and juicy. Just watch out for the bones that are left in them, you're going to have to spit them out. They have a fridge filled with Cream soda, Birch and Root Bear, Coconut Water, and other soft drinks. 4.) Prices: Definitely an inexpensive place. A large entree. is anywhere from $9 to $12, depending on sides and add ons. 5.) Impressions: I come here for take-out. Fast, low price, High quality Jamaican food.
