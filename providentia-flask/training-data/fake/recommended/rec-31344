Went there last night with another couple for a night at a DDD restaurant. this is not a diner, drive in or dive but okay.   their menu is seasonal so you are going to see different things there.  We had the peanut brittle (which is pretty much peanuts with some sweet bacon flavoring on them), the squash appetizer (nice crust and flavor) the pork belly and roasted grape app (SO GOOD) the friend chicken (eh - moist chicken, okay waffle, GREAT KALE) and a ricotta dumpling dish (no flavor, needed salt). the drinks were alright.  not my favorite but we each left with a prepackaged cookie without even ordering dessert- so you could say i left happy. if i came back i would get a burger.
