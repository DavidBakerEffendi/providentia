I have been there for lunch and dinner, with child/ without child and the service has always been great (friendly and attentive), the food yummy and the atmosphere so cozy.  The beauty of it is that there is something for everyone.  My 6-yr old was quite happy to have a crepe with nutella and whipped creme for dinner and I thoroughly enjoyed my La Chevre.  Just had lunch there and it was a  perfect mid day break topped with a gorgeous rose and La St Jean De Luz.  We will continue to eat here as long as they keep up the 3 wins with service, food and atmosphere.
