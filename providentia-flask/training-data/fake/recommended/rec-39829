Been here a few times. It is great! The Brisket is perfect and unlike "some" places, served hot! You can actually see the smoke rings and the various layers of flavor. I'm hooked! The ribs, which I finally tasted (i was hesitant to veer away from the brisket), were excellent as well. The Chorizo! also great.. just enough spice to make it interesting without being overwhelming. Had a small problem with my takeout last night, but they made it right! Immediately. Insisted. Love this place and you will too!
