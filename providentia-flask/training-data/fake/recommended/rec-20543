Want market price eggs? Look no further than Tia Pol. I had no idea that eggs were seasonal, but I heard that chicken is - thank you, Stone Barns. I think I was too bemused to ask where the eggs came from, but I won't be shy next time. I was here for brunch today and spent a total of $13.50, tax and tip included. What a deal! I was afraid that the market price eggs would be some obscene price, which would make me want them more, but luckily they were $8.50. I had the market price poached egg, which was served on a bed of lentils and sausage. I was happy as a clam, lapping up the sandy green edges of my bowl with big spoon. My friend ordered the market price scrambled eggs with salt cod, which was also delicious, and two others ordered the pork and roasted bell pepper sandwich. Yum. I'm not sure what vegetarians or vegans would do here - there are always the potatoes I suppose. I'll definitely be back, but I might bring my own coffee cup next time because I always feel unnerved when I can't fit my finger through the handle.
