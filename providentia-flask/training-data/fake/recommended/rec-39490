update- after looking at my other reviews, I guess I am kind of liberal with five stars! I'm hesitant to give five stars to anything, but I honestly can't think of one thing I didn't love about this place. Everything I ate was delicious and it was a great overall experience. I don't eat a lot of barbeque, but I do love food and have been wanting to come here ever since I saw the monstrosity of a line for the stand at Smorgasburg. Since we don't eat it a lot, my boyfriend and I went a little crazy since we wanted to try everything. I had the pulled pork and he had the brisket. Both were AWESOME. I personally preferred the pulled pork since the brisket had more fat on it that I could taste which I don't like. Delicious none the less. We also both had the vinegar cole slaw which was FREE. Slaw is one of my favorite foods so that made me very happy. We also tried the sweet potato casserole, the baked beans and since my boyfriend felt the need to have something green, we got the edamame and sweet pea salad. Neither of us particularly like baked beans but since everyone on Yelp was talking about it we had to try it. They were everything they're cracked up to be- they turned me into a believer! The sweet potato casserole was also delicious. The edamame and sweet pea salad was forgettable. They also had a good selection of beers, though we didn't drink. The entire thing for two of us was also $27 and we had dinner for at least two nights. Plus we totally didn't need all those sides. Just the slaw would have been more than enough. The only thing that could have put a damper on the experience would have been if the line were long or we couldn't find a table, but we didn't have any issues with that! Highly recommend!
