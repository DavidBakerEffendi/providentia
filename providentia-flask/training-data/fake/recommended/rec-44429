This is a place I discovered a couple years ago and am glad I did! The food is great. At this point I must have had everything from the menu at least once and I'm still waiting to be let down! I've brought family here, friends, dates because I always know what to expect and it's nothing but the best. Whether you want a nice four course meal or a quick pizza and a beer, I think you'll be impressed! I asked them if they could make me a Chicken Parm Pizza and they were more than happy to oblige even though it's not a regular menu item and that's why I keep coming back. And one more thing, a ridiculously diverse selection at the bar. They carry my favorite brand of Irish Whiskey when many other establishments including those going for the who Irish Pub thing do not. Much respect.
