We've eaten a lot of Cuban in NYC and the food can sometimes be heavy handed. The food was well cooked especially the pork shank and the grouper specials.....excellent crust...delicious sauces and beautifully presented. Â Did I mention the silky mashed potatoes??? The chicken soup was excellent but a little salty...however the toasted garlic bread that came with it was warm, buttery, garlicky and irresistible. Our service from Sandy was excellent. Sangria was strong, and little dry and not too sweet. For dessert we were torn between the tres leeches and Cuban bread pudding. We went with the yelp favorite.... Tres leches and we were not disappointed~it was light but creamy. Overall a great atmosphere with a romantic ambience and Spanish music playing in the background. We came on Sunday evening and did not have to wait for a table. Great dinner... Will come back to try something else off the menu.
