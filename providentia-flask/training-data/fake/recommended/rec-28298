Sweet Afton sort of looks like Bedford Ave threw up all over it, and the bouncer at the door kept saying I reminded him of his ex wife (I don't think this was a compliment) but besides that, I love Sweet Afton. The space is very cozy and Party of Five like in it's vibe. The Malbec is amazing and the bartenders will keep that glass FULL. It gets crazy crowded, particularly in the winter, but there is ZERO attitude here so it's all good. Great place to warm up on a chilly NY night!
