I have been here for 1h and 25 min and still did not get my pizza. We ordered an appetizer that took 45 min to come and came cold. There are not many tables eating dinner here and 1h and 25min later they are still not bringing it...for being a Brooklyn place it sucks. The neighborhood is known for good food experiences and this is obviously the exception. Never coming back, go to Luzzos ( right next door)
