The Pizza was great.  Their beer selection is a wonderful representation of the local breweries. The place was hopping... the band was great, yet something was missing... our beers all arrived with the appearance someone had taken a good sip out of them...yes the infamous short pour. Not to be deterred we ordered appetizers, and found our waiter was attentive but overworked, we ended up getting our own plates , napkins and silverware.  More beer, (still short) pizza's..ran up a good bill..and then the final straw..no sooner had we paid the bill and the owner swung through and said "will you be leaving soon?" Ouch. Not likely to go back
