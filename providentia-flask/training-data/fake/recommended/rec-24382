This place is amazing. I'm not even kidding. We sat at the bar area and had a bloody mary and mimosa to start off while we decided what to order. The menu is very tempting but we both went with something on the chalkboard! My husband had the Lucky Shmidt and I had the Chico Grande. Both were excellent but the Lucky Shmidt was out of the world. Chicken tenders on a bun with jalape√±os and chipotle mayo?! My husband wouldn't even share. We came on a Sunday around noon and were able to get seated right away. It also is cash only. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because the bathroom was filthy.
