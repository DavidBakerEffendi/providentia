Very charming, rustic looking cafe with a laidback energy. It's on a beautiful and tucked away street in Brooklyn Heights, which definitely adds oodles of whimsy to the whole experience. This girl who worked there kept bringing in crates with bottles of milk... I liked the coffee, but was not bowled over by the breakfast. There weren't lots of options (rage), and the soft boiled eggs over crumbly tortillas that I ended up ordering was competent but WAY overpriced (flames). Cash only? Ugh.
