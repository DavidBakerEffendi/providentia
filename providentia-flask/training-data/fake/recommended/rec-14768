I recently started working in this area and so I've been looking on Yelp for different places to order lunch. I found Room Service listed on Yelp, and I found their menu on menupages.com (menupages.com/restaurantâ€¦). I ordered chicken Pad Thai from their lunch menu. It was tasty, not at all spicy, and I got a good-sized portion (I actually couldn't finish it all).The bean sprouts were crunchy and fresh. The lunch came with my choice of appetizer, so I selected the chicken satay skewers, which were nice and tender and had a tasty peanut sauce. It was between those and the corn spring rolls, so maybe I'll try them next time. The bill came out to a little under $8. I enjoyed this lunch a lot, and I'll definitely order from them again.
