Absolutely delicious. This is one of my favorite restaurants, period! The food is excellent, and I love the tapas style. My boyfriend and I typically order 5 tapas to share between the two of us, and that seems to work well. The wine is great, although I have noticed them upselling a bit recently, which makes me feel a little weird. One great perk is a token for a free glass of wine if you fill out a survey for them. Half priced wine bottles on Sundays is a godsend! The ambiance is very enjoyable for a date or for an evening out with friends. Very cool, upscale, earthy decor. Good music, and it's generally not too loud. My piece of constructive feedback relates to the service. Barcelona has a multi-server model, which can cut down on wait time. However, if they are going to continue to pursue this model, the servers need to maintain consistent communication with one another. When they are not, the meal becomes very disorganized and a little stressful. We have had experiences where we were asked to give the same order multiple times, or where we were brought the check before we had completed the ordering process. Go! I love it and you will too!
