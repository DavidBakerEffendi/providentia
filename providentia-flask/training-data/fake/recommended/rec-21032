Really good! Highly recommended. The space is really comfortable, though small. Service was very friendly and attentive. We started with pumpkin soup (a special--get it while you can!), which was bursting with a perfectly balanced array of savory flavors, and tuna prepared three ways, each interesting and delicious. My main course was "twice-cooked" duck with blueberry sauce and mushroom risotto. The duck was wonderful--tender breast meat cooked rare with crispy skin and a leg portion that was falling-off-the-bone tender. The blueberries complemented it perfectly. The only negative was the rice, which was more like pilaf than creamy risotto. My husband had ossobuco (also a special), which he loved. He wasn't thrilled, though, with the mashed potatoes that came with it--a bit bland. Some interesting choices for dessert, but we were too full to try any. Will definitely return.
