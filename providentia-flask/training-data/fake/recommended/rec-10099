My friend and I came here for brunch. After reading such rave reviews I had high hopes for the food, but brunch was a little disappointing. AMBIANCE The decor is really cool with very tall ceilings, long flowy drapes and wooden patterns with artfully placed lights on the ceilings and down the walls. Its a great sight during the day, but judging from the pictures this place looks startlingly beautiful at night with only the soft glow of the scattered lights. FOOD Brunch was good. But it wasn't spectacular. I've yet to have a fantastic brunch in the city. It's from 12pm to 4pm on Saturday and Sundays. With tax the brunch prix fixe comes out to $30.48. You have a choice of Coffee / Orange Juice / Grapefruit Juice And a  choice of Pomegranate Cava / Mimosa / Bellini The coffee is good. They actually give you sugar cubes. The mimosa is good as well. You also have a choice of one main plate & one side. -Awarma Eggs in Cocotte Lamb confit with three poached eggs and arugula salad The arugula salad was fresh and crisp and the eggs were perfectly poached. However the lamb confit looked like dog food and it wasn't very flavorful at all. I wouldn't recommend it. -Mekanek Sauteed lamb sausage with lemon and pine nuts This was very poorly made. It was like stringy broken up pieces of lamb in a flimsy casing. While it was poorly constructed the taste was OK. SERVICE Out server was very friendly. I was a little annoyed when they  couldn't figure out how to charge the American Express Giftcard  I gave them. Other restaurants were able to charge it without any problems. OVERALL While I had a great time with my friend I wish I could say the same for the restaurant. The place has a very cool look but the brunch food I had was not very good. Even though I got a lot of food and drinks for $30 I regretted coming here. Avoid brunch. I hear lunch and dinner is better.
