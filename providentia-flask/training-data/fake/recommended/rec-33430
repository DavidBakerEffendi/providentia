Hard to complain about a place where so much passion and a delightful purity of execution. This is one of the most honest business propositions I've seen: one man charges a higher-than-average amount while you wait for him to prepare your pizza personally for you. He's not fussy, but he's painstaking. Every detail clearly matters, even after 50 years mastering this repetitious trade. The resulting pizzas are truly delicious, though I concur with others who have mentioned that it might be even better with less of the drizzled oil. I am personally a GREASE LOVER, and was still a bit turned off by the quantity of oil. It made it harder to enjoy as many pieces as I really wanted to. It's charming, yet kind of annoying, that they don't do anything to really streamline the ordering and waiting process. Â People who are eating in are so desperate to claim seating that they'll jump in and claim one of the very few tables, even if their pizza won't be ready for an hour. In fairness, "it all worked out in the end," but maybe something as simple as a number system that gives you rank over other people who have ordered, would calm the scene a bit (and give you an idea about how long it will be until your pizza is done). I give this place 5 stars because the extreme pros for me far outweigh the annoyances. It's delicious and worth an experience. You get a taste of the pizza, but also a taste of inspiration: follow your dream.
