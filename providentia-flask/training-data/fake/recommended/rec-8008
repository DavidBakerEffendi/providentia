A friend and I were craving savory curries and delectable mango sticky rice so we grabbed a few bottles of vino and situated ourselves at Vientiane Cafe. The space is small, but clean and comfortable. The wait staff was extremely courteous and prompt with our orders and didn't try to charge us extra for uncorking. I got the yellow curry (which is Massaman to me) and my friend got the green. Both were generously portioned and colorful. I would have liked by curry a tad less runny, but it tasted quite good and had the right touch of sweetness. Needless to say, my friend and I ended up consuming a great deal of wine and lost track of time. We noticed the staff was closing, but they were really polite about it. They didn't say anything to us or passive aggressively thump around tidying up, they just waited patiently for our oblivious drunk selves to schlep our stuff and leave. I would definitely come here again because of the excellent service.
