I can see going here just to drink; the interior is fanciful-- lime green walls, octopus chandelier, and horror movie figurines on little sconces on the wall. Feels a little Fear and Loathing, in a good way. The food, however, was not good. I ordered the vegan burger and it was mushy. It was a cheap frozen patty, not even grocery store Morningstar brand quality. Carnivore in the group had similar complaints about his beef burger. Ambiance is cool, though, and beer selection was eclectic. Eat before you go and you'll be fine.
