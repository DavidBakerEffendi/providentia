Cheap and very filling big bowls of food. The wontons here are very good as a lot of people pointed out, though I wasn't blown away. Get the stewed beef with anything (my friend got it with dry noodles, though I imagine it's very good in soup with wontons too)--it's very tender and absolutely delicious. I tried Shanghai noodles with wontons, though I think Cantonese egg noodles go better with them. My only complaint is that the service is horrible. The waiters ignore you a lot of the time, even when you talk directly to them.
