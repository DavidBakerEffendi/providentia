No better hotdog in Philly and I tried them all. I need to state up front I prefer a natural casing dog that is cooked on a grill so this eliminates most of what passes as competition. Been here three times in the past month since finding this spot. Their fries are top of the line- as good as any you will find in town. I am not a flashy hotdog eater. Tried the Chicago and found it okay compared to the dogs at Portillos in Chi Town but I am happiest eating a plain dog with mustard and onions. My lady ate the Mexican vegetarian style dog and absolutely loved it. Decor is nice and clean. Staff is friendly and to the point. If you want a great hotdog this is the place!!!
