Just had a bad experience at Uva with a manager(?) being extremely rude and condescending to our friend with a baby.   Instead of offering us another table or anything kind, she gave us looks and kicked us out as soon as the bill was settled - even had the nerve to say something to our friend.  Very disappointing for a place we've been coming to for years.  Hope they're doing well enough to not need repeat business.
