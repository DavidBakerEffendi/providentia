This review is 100% based on the beer. I haven't had the food. I'm really impressed with this place. I'm always skeptical of beer joints that tout their love of European brewing techniques, but Dirck's does it well. The Augustus Weizenbock was strong, thick, and smooth. My wife really enjoyed her Farmhouse, and we both enjoyed an unnamed wheat cask they tapped before our eyes. They value beer, and they do it well. Bravo.
