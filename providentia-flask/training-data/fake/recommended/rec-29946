OMG! I love this place. It's super sexy the food is phenomenal you must try the rose jam its outta this world. The cheese selection is fantastic the wines are amazing! Here's a tip if you're in a date and want to spice things up order the mulled red wine, MAJOR aphrodisiac! The waiter sent some over on an awkward first date and let's say it did the trick, we couldn't keep our hands off one another. Squid salad is also a must! And the hummus!!!! Have the hummus!!
