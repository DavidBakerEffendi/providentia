Big fan of Rotisseur's chicken banh mi and roasted potatoes but decided today to try the Bo Ssam. Took it to go and headed home with a little trepidation--why mess with a sure thing--but I was not disappointed. Loved it and may never go back to the chicken banh mi again! Service is always friendly, too.
