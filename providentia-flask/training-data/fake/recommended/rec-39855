My God, do I love this place! Since moving to the West Village, it has quickly become one of my favortie spots, and probably not for the reasons you think. Everyone told me that I should come to Corner Bistro because "they have the best burgers in the city." My suspicion is that these recommenders were drunk by the time they ate the burger (and that's why they thought it was so good) because by the time you get through the line you've probably had at least 2 or 3 beers while waiting. Perhaps this is Corner Bistro's plan all along...but who cares! Hard to complain about standing in a line, when you can drink delicious beer at the same time! Oh, so back the burgers, I really just don't think they're as amazing as people claim, but they do the trick, especially during late night hours. And their fries on the other hand are awesome! (Definitely fried in bacon fat of sorts - watch out vegetarians!) Plus, the staff is extraordinarily friendly, and even though it's crowded, I generally find the people who go there to be fun and nice. It's a great spot.
