So I really want to love the Vientiane and have it be my go-to thai place....but I have never been wowed. Recently, I came here for UCity Dining Days. It was crowded but they seated us....and then ignored us for about 20 minutes. No water, no service, no nothing. Now, like I said, it was full so it is a forgivable offense albeit not excusable. The food: it's good. Not great, but solid. I had a curry dish with tofu that had a nice kick to it. The spring rolls were good as well, although everything seemed to be a very small sized portion. Vientiane Cafe is fine if you are in the area, but there are so many better options in Chinatown/Center City if you feel like venturing out.
