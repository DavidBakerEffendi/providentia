This is our favorite neighborhood restaurant. We eat here at least once a week when it is warm enough to sit outside. They do have heating lamps when it is cooler. Indoors the acoustic is really bad and it can be difficult to hear a conversation. The food is good....predictable.... not gourmet but tasty every single time. The fish is always fresh and cooked to perfection. The service is nothing but excellent and always super friendly We like to go there because of that too. You always feel welcome. It is BYO and price of meal matches what is on your plate. With that in mind there is only good to say about BPG.
