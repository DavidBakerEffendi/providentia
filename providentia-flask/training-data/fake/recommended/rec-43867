A New York institution. I've been coming here for 12 years and it has never changed. Make no mistake, they do a simple service but they do it well and they've been doing it for a long time. If you want a good burger, cheap beer, a shot, Â or like me, all of the above with a chill old school neighborhood vibe then this is a place you'll like. If you want to be treated like a princess then stay away cuz you ruin it for the rest of us.
