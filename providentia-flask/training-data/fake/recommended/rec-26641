Not a bad place, but a bit on the pricey side (naturally). Very family friendly and located in a neat area of the city; the crowd is mixed, which is kind of a rare sight. I noticed the ear-buds worn by the staff too and I'm not quite sure what warrants that. In the beer garden you can't open a tab, which is somewhat unfortunate; their reason was, "It's too high volume to keep track." I don't know if they'd run your credit card with every transaction, but that would become really annoying after a while so whatever -- carry cash. They have pretzels 1.5 times the size of my face for $8, which was all I had left after I got my half liter of Dogfish Head Seasonal so I couldn't tip the pretzel girl. She made a face while counting the cash and saying "It's eight dollars and you gave me... eight dollars." Before that I was feeling bad, but after seeing her make that face I stopped giving any semblance of a shit. Also, they have curry ketchup. It's delicious.
