Very interesting delicious food here! We came here and In all honesty I only expected the usual presentation of some sushi and vegan choices. I was completely taken by surprise when the dishes came out. Colorful and very delicious. This place is Vegan friendly, so all my Vegan NYC friends and Yelpers, this is the place for you! Another great feature, is that there is online ordering!
