This pizza is not your typical NYC fare. Definitely more of your Italian variety, unless you ask otherwise. Most dishes are thin and light, to the point where one could eat an entire pie alone. The pasta and salad is definitely something you're going to want indulge in as well. Make sure you go all out here. Come with an appetite, and leave way too full.
