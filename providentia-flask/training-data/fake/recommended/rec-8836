I get the hype now. $6 for a gigantic plate of food? And the white sauce mixed with the red sauce (impossible to eat that red sauce on its own! and I love spicy) is so good. I don't know if I liked it so much because I had some liquor in me, but that's when people usually go to this place anyway, right?
