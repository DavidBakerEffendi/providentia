Great Ramen, always know I am getting quality when I come here and the pork buns are just amazing. If you can deal with the wait it's well worth it. The environment and decor is really well done and I love how the restaurant workers all shout out hello as you walk in. Would definitely go back multiple times as I would love to try everything on the the menu!
