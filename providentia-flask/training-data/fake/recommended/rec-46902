Dee-licious! I love tastes of things and they way the menu is set up, they encourage you to order a couple small plates each.  Italian tapas if you will.  We took them at their word and ordered loads for the table. They were all delicious and the perfect size to pique your interest and leave you wanting more. We got over excited when ordering and managed to order too much pasta & secondi, delicious as they were.  If I was to go again, personally I'd stick to the intro dishes. Drinks wise, they had Woodford so I was delighted but the wine was warm when it arrived.  They did everything to chill it down and make sure it was at optimum serving temperature for the rest of the bottle. Service was super and the interiors are intimate and gorge.
