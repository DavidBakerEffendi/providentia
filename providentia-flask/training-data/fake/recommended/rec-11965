really good value for a place that looks like it could be really expensive. small pastas but one of the best pastas i've ever had. in general they're small portions, but even if you order one item per person from each main group, it comes to about $50-60 a person (no wine). they have Suppli (fried rice balls- my favorite) but you have to specifically ask for them from the bar. and they aren't as small as some other places either. great service though more on the leisurely side. will definitely go again!
