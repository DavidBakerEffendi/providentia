We heard a lot about the Max restaurants in Hartford.  We're not big on steaks so we decided to try their "eclectic fusion" restaurant called Trumbull Kitchen.   When you drive up, the first let down is when the valet parking guy asks you for $9 "in advance."  That's a bad sign for a nice restaurant.  Can't they cover the valet parking fees?   The restaurant was fairly busy on a Friday night.  We were seated toward the back of the restaurant.  The service was efficient but the food was not up to its billing.  My wife had the seared salmon and my son and I both had the seafood pad Thai.  The salmon was good but the pad Thai was sloshy, sticky, and over seasoned.  Neither of us finished our dish.  It was too much. The prices were reasonable but we would have gladly paid more for a better meal. We were disappointed in the overall experience.  If a restaurant bills itself as "eclectic fusion," it has set a high bar for itself.  Trumbull Kitchen didn't live up to its billing.
