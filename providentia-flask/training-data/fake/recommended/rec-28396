Went with a group over the summer.  I have a lot of issues with this small sandwich eatery.  The baby string beans were delicious, but we wanted extra bread to dip and it's not free.  Not only do they charge you for extra bread, but they give you panini bread.  Embarrassing.  How bout a nice baguette?  The staff is a little weird and hippyish.  Service was slow. The paninis were good, but pricey and didn't fill you up.  They aren't served with anything on the side.  Would it be asking too much for a pickle or some slaw?  I would've eaten 2 full panini's, but it would have cost me over $20.  Not paying that for bread and cold cuts.  We did polish off a few bottles of the Palazzone white wine which I would recommend. The food is decent so it does not deserve one star, but I would sum up my experience here as Il Ripoffo.  Too bad Yelp doesn't have a "Good For" category as a snack because don't come here hungry, you will leave the same way.
