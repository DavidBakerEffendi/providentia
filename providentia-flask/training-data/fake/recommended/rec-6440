BREAD BREAD BREAD!  Can I just say how wonderful it is to be able to run over and get great bread on my way home or in the morning?  I've been waiting for this for years.  All the bread is fabulous.  I'm so thrilled to be able to get delicious breads (and the pretzels are pretty good too!).  Why has it taken so long for Park Slope/Gowanus/Cobble Hill to get a great bread store?  Thank You, R&S
