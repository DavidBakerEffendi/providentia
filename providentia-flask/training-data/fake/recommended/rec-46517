I LOVE this place! I have been coming here for years and it never disappoints. They have an outrageously fabulous selection of Spanish wines by the glass as well as the most tasty tapas in town. My personal favorites are the chorizo, pork belly , ham croquettes, potatoes w /aioli.. hell, it is all phenomenal! It is worth the wit for one of the tiny tables or wedging yourself into a spot at the bar, you will not be disappointed, promise.
