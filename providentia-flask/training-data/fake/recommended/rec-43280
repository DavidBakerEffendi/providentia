Another great find, thanks to Yelp. After wandering around on a rainy Monday and having zero success since just about everyplace is dark on Monday in Philly, I searched Yelp and found this gem! Great atmosphere, friendly staff and delicious food! I had an amazing veal dish and some friends had awesome house made gnocchi, all awesome. Everything we had was delicious, fresh, well prepared and very flavorful.
