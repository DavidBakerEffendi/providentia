This is my favorite bar in NYC. I've been holding off on reviewing, because real estate at the bar is competitive enough to begin with, why let the masses in on the best spot in town? But alas, The Jeffrey cannot be my best kept secret, it is just too good, and it looks like it has more than caught on. The Jeffrey has it all, a constantly rotating variety of craft beers, the friendliest bartenders in town, crafty cocktails, and a perfect bites menu. We were going to move out of the neighborhood this year, but now that the Jeffrey is open for business, I'm inclined to stay. Order this: - Truffle popcorn - Reuben Jeffowitz or Tuna sandwich - Cheese/charcuterie (generous portions!) - The Ginger Beard or Campfire Margarita from Jacob's cocktail lab - Any beer the bartenders recommend, and check frequently for new brewery events!
