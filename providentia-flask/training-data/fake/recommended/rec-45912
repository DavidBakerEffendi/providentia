What a wonderful place to go for sushi and hibachi.  The service was excellent and they truly went above and beyond for a birthday we were celebrating.  The restaurant doesn't look like much from the main road but the actual restaurant is around back and it is very nice both outside and inside.  There are plenty of hibachi tables, a sushi bar and restaurant seating.  If you are looking for a great place to enjoy Japanese food, you can't go wrong at Edoichi Sushi & Hibachi Steakhouse.
