OH..MY..GOODNESS.  Let me tell you, the roast pork sandwich is the best sandwich I've ever had.  The BEST.  Hands down, the most delicious sandwich out of any variety of sandwich I have ever tried.  Can you tell how much I love this place?  Haha.   I know some people think this place is overrated but let's be honest-they're popular for a reason.  Order the roast pork sandwich with the broccoli rabe and the sharp provolone-there is no other way (in my humble opinion) to have it.  The roast pork is soaked in it's own juices, and placed on the most perfect bread, sturdy enough for the juices to soak in but for the bread to still stay intact.  The sharp provolone and sauteed broccoli rabe is the most perfect compliment to the pork...you just can't beat it. Sure you can get roast pork sandwiches all around Philly, but a trip to the Reading Terminal Market in general is a must do while in the area, so I highly suggest you stop by Dinic's and have a bite.  I think it's definitely worth it!
