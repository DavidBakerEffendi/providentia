I went to Balthazar  for a relax Sunday Brunch. The restaurant is packed, and a bit different from what I have been experienced with funky decor, homey style,France restaurant. But the food is great, especially what I order, highly recommended if you are a big fan of smocked fish, the egg norwegian. The fresh red smoked salmon work beautifully with the homemade hollandaise and the warm egg yolk. And the Chicken liver add just the right flavor on the fresh toasted French bread.... But some dish are too much fatty added for someone who want a refresh brunch to start the day. The overall service is OK, the server forgot my juice is a big deduction  in my overall satisfaction!
