This place is everything I love in a bar: great beer, delicious apps, chill vibe. It's cozy without giving up an urban feel. I got the Philly pale ale and vegan popcorn appetizer. The popcorn was a little greasy, but that's not a complaint. Service was friendly and quick. The bar was crowded but there was a lot of table seating. Noise level was good. You could hold a conversation easily but there was still music playing. If I lived in Philly this would be my home bar. Loved it! Hope to come back soon.
