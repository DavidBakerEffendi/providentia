First place that my gf and I went to in Philly during our first road trip together. I couldn't have made a better choice. The atmosphere was really chill and relaxing during the heat wave on Friday. We started with the cornmeal crusted oysters and split a mixed green salad. Both were incredibly delicious. I ordered the brisket sandwich w/ mac n cheese. She ordered the fried green tomato BLT w/ okra. We both had affairs with our food. The beer menu was really neat and organized. The cigar city brown ale was stellar on tap. The service was fine. Surprised that there only seemed to be one waiter working in the middle of the afternoon. I really can't wait to come back here again.
