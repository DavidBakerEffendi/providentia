After years of using Yelp, I'm writing my first review because I loved this place so much.  The chuletta puts my Cuban grandmother to shame and the sangria is better than most of the "authentic" stuff you'll find in Spain.  The place is beautiful and the staff and owner are ridiculously friendly.  This is the kind of establishment you genuinely want to see do well!
