This place is a hidden gem.  Mamá visited our table.  We had Empress Tofu as an appetizer,  my first time trying tofu and it was delicious. We also had Pad Thai Noodles and a house special fish that was not on the menu, but was also delicious as well. You can't leave without trying there Thai ice tea, a must try. We will definitely be returning.
