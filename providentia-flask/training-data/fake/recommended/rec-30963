My favorite 'local' spot in East Falls and favorite drinking spot in Philadelphia - great neighborhood spot with plenty of character and characters. The chicken cheese steak is one of my favorite sammies anywhere. Wings are solid but beware of Wednesday Wing Night - you'll need to get there before 7 if you want a seat. Try the new "pig wings" - very tasty and generous portions - especially if you like pork. Also a great place to watch a game - lots of nice flat screens all over the place.
