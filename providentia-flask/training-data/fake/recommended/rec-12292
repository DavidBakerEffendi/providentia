It was decent, but I don't get the hype. I waited like 40 minutes to eat. I was dying to have some great pancakes. I ordered a latte, hot apple cider, a side of 2 eggs, bacon, & pancakes. My bill was like $35. Â It's NYC, so I wouldn't be put out about the price, if the meal had been great. It wasn't. It was ok. The pancakes were a bit of a disappointment. Based on the reviews, I expected much better. The service was great, but I wouldn't waste my time waiting for breakfast here again.
