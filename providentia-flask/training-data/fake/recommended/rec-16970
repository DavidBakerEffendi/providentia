The place is pleasant and quant with quite impressive and mouthwatering menu to choose from, however the price for substitutions or addition of ingredients Â to your meal is steep in my opinion (average 3-5$). I had the pear and fig infused goat cheese salad which was very good; and I also dabbled a little in my family's selection (pizza Mezza Luna and Gigi salad) which also was really tasty. The extensive desert menu leaves quite an impression with us indulging into Pizza Nutella. It does bring out your inner chocolate loving kid and it is really really good. The service was prompt, food arrived in a timely fashion despite a fairly busy Friday night crowd. Overall, it is an enjoyable experience but a bit overpriced for the type of fare it offers.
