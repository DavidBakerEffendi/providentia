Crockadeli is the best place to sandwiches in the area, by a long shot. Huge selection of subs, incredibly welcoming staff, and plenty of other snacks. It's worth going to even if you have to drive a little ways to get to. Real food! Not Subway or Wawa shitty subs. Try one of Crockadeli's subs and become a believer.
