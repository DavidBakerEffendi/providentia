It was pouring rain and we had just landed in NY from LA.  Sunshine to a storm and we were starving after getting on the plane at 3pm @LAX and landing around 11pm in NY. We had just checked into our hotel and were STARVING. This hit the spot!! Yum, we got the lamb.  We ordered two, but one would have been more than enough.  It was delicious, but nothing I would wait in a long line for.  I drenched it in the sauce and for the price and quantity it was a great deal.  It's nothing spectacular--dont think you'll be blown away.   But it is good ol street cart food and I woudn't change a thing!
