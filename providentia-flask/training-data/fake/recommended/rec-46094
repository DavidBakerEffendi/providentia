Went here for a company dinner.  What a nice place.  The food was great.  Waiters were great.  Managers came around to check on us.  I did have 1 problem.  This place challenges my motto "I will not pay good money for a bad steak".  Well I ordered the New York Strip steak.  Normally I would not walk across the street for a New York Strip as I am a rib eye guy from Texas.  I don't know how much it  cost but it was on par with top steak houses.  Cooked as I ordered, medium rare, tender and hot on the inside.  Excellent.
