came for brunch when visiting friends for the weekend. Food was great, hefty portions. I didnt mind the slower service since we spent the whole meal catching up and could tell they were wanting us to leave after we paid our tab. My bloody mary was a meal in itself. This place is on all the lists to go to in chelsea for a reason :)
