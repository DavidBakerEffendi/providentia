Went here last night with a group of girls for my friends bday.  None of us had been here so we weren't sure what to expect. Parking is hit or miss.. Half of us got spots right in front and half had to park a few blocks away. The menu was a bit confusing.. Very fancy Italian words and cheeses I had never heard of. Also the lighting made it really hard to read the menu.  I asked the waitress if people can do family style and order a few things and share and she said of course that most people do that.  So we ordered 2 apps (fried calamari and veal meatballs) a gnocchi pasta dish and 3 pizzettes (margarita, spicy sausage which was VERY spicy and a balsamic fig, prosciutto and Gorgonzola pizza).  Everything was delish! We ended up taking 2 pieces of pizza home. Since we were there for a bday we asked the waitress to bring out the smore pizza for dessert.  We sang (loundly!!) and all shared in its deliciousness.  Overall we had a great time.  DEF make a reservation on the weekend..  Ours was for 8:30.. We were there chatting til after 11. the ambiance was perfect for us being that it wasn't super fancy, my only complaint was that the menu was hard to read.  You really can't go wrong with BYOB
