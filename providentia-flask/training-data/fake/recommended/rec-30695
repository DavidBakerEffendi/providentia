Went here last night for dinner with a large group of friends. I waited for my friends to arrive at the bar and sampled a glass of the Napa Valley Cab while I waited. Little did I know, Cookshop's cocktails are some of the best I have tasted in New York. When we sat down, my friends and I ordered a sampling of cocktails from the list and they certainly did not disappoint! I had a beet martini, which didn't look too appealing initially (bright red and looked like it was going to be some God-awful sweet concoction), but when I took the first sip my teeth began to sing! One of the most innovative and addictive cocktails I have ever had. I don't know how the bartender did it, but it was pure heaven! Made with a special kind of gin that is supposedly more mild, the drink went down like water- I drank almost three of them throughout the night. If you are a beet-lover and appreciate nature's candy like I do, then this is the cocktail for you. I ordered the beet salad to start (I know, I just can't get enough of them) which was served with a thick Greek-style yogurt and fresh herbs-very tasty. I also ordered the sea bass which was also served with a curry and ginger spiced yogurt (yes, I am also a yogurt lover), and sauteed rutabagas and parsnips atop black lentils. The fish was delicious, but perhaps slightly overcooked. I tried my friend's scallops-tender, cooked perfectly, and paired with the most delicious cauliflower. Another friend ordered the spiced fries-very yummy. I didn't taste her pizza, but it looked great-melty, golden cheese with a thin crispy crust. All in all, our meal was excellent. The decor is beautiful. I have heard Cookshop does a fabulous brunch as well, but have yet to go! Definitely check out Cookshop for a great dinner-at the very least order a beet cocktail at the bar- it will not disappoint!
