So much food!  Amazing service, but very pricey.  Would have given it a 5 star if it wasn't 50$ a person.  Water glass never got even close to being empty, food flowed from the waiters like a river.  Food was great, we had a large table most people that were in our group wanted medium rare meat so it was a bit painful to always have to send them back to get me something well done. Come hungry, don't eat for a day before hand, or at least do not eat breakfast and lunch!
