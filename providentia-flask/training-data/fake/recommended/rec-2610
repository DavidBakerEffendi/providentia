I find this to be one of the best places to eat a good Italian Center City dinner in the summer. Mercato opens up all their window-doors, and the noise of conversations, cooking, and the smell of good food hits the street. The menu changes often, and they have original food for hearty and light pallettes, and some great bread to munch on with your salad. The chefs prepare things that are unique, you'll wish they'd have again when you return, but you'll be glad they're forcing you to try something else (if that makes sense). It's a nice BYOB, and despite the fact that you're a few blocks removed from the bustle, you feel like you're in another city, or having one of those contemporary Italian dinners they have in the movies (not the stereotypical Soprano's crap). I love the exterior too, with the former grocery logo/ads on the side too. Well done.
