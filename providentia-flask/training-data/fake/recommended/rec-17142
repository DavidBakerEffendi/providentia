Nevada has been added to my list of go-to diners (it's only #2). I've dined here a number of times but was only moved to write a review after my most recent visit. I must admit I was never blown away by a dining experience at Nevada but I never left feeling hungry, unsatisfied or disappointed either.  But after I tried my friend's chicken fettuccine during my most recent visit, I was very impressed. Now, chicken fettuccine not a dish I would typically order at a diner. That's something I would leave to Olive Garden or some place but I must say that that dish was delicious. The chicken was tender and whole dish was very flavorful. I myself ordered the french  toast sticks since I wasn't in the mood for anything too heavy and I was on a budget. They were very good-- couldn't have been better in my opinion. Now I think the thing with this place is, depending on what you order, you can be very pleased or not very impressed. Another friend of mine had the fried wings and those were very good! Another ordered some sort of sandwich but it didn't look that appetizing. I once ordered the shrimp wrap with waffle fries. The wrap was okay but the waffle fries were really good.  so I guess it's a toss up but they do have the ability to impress me. They've proved that.
