Ilili has a really nice bar lounge decor and main level dining. Their cocktails while they sound appealing did not elevate the experience, more style than substance. As for the food, their Hummus, Babaghanouj, fluffy pita, Â roasted bone marrow, and brussel sprout starters were VERY good. I am not a fan of grape leaves and theirs did not change my mind. Everyone was stuffed by the time the lamb and black cod entrees came - which were average dishes. Not bad but not memorable either.
