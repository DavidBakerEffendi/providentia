omg, this place is so damn good when it's effin' cold outside, you're drunk, and you're broke after an expensive night out. my friends have been talking about this place so much that my buddy took me here. the heavily-bearded dudes cooking the chicken really weirded me out - do they have beard-nets or something? anyway, i paid $12 for 2 bowls of chicken and rice, and asked for hot sauce. we walked a few blocks to my friend's pad...and the amazing goodness ensued. the bowl is simple: grilled chicken over orange long-grained rice (i was so drunk i thought it looked like cheddar-cheese shreds and freaked out. lol) with iceberg lettuce and pita bread. the white sauce was good - tasted like sour cream and yogurt combined. definitely not healthy, but what kind of cream-sauce ever is? (insert dirty joke here). my friends warned me about the tiny-container of hot sauce, but i normally put hot sauce on EVERYTHING and braved it. it was pretty damn spicy, but i still dipped my fork into it with almost every bite. my mouth was completely numb later, but nothing a few starburst jelly beans couldn't relieve. all in all, this place is the bomb. where else can you find cheap good food at 3am in new york? i'm definitely coming back.
