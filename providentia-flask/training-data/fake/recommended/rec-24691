Had insanely delicious, cozy, intimate dinner here. All our dishes were amazing (particularly the calamari and the asparagus apps, and the lamb entree). Flour-less chocolate cake recommended by our waitress was incredible. Great service, lovely ambiance (that lighting! that incredible smell wafting from the semi-open kitchen! that perfect music!), delicious food. GO!
