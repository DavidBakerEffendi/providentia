First off, the girl Kat who takes orders at the register is THE BEST!!! She was so fun, nice and animated while taking our order. Despite that is was a busy day at the market she made us feel like her only customer and continued to treat each customer the same way. I was very impressed by her! Now to the food. OMG! I ordered their kids cheese sandwich for my daughter and snagged a bite after I had my cheesesteak and found myself wishing I had gotten a sandwich here instead!!!! The cheese flavor was so creamy and the bread was heaven. I'm going to dream of this sandwich until my next visit to Philly.
