We have two toddlers so we are so grateful for Blue Ribbon. We go as a family at 5 or 5:30 and the restaurant is full of families - yet you don't feel like you are in a kid's restaurant. I get the house rose and the salmon - my husbands orders the skate and we throw the loaf of bread at our kids - not really - but it helps. They have a great kid's menu - and its clean and fresh - we green beans and chickens tenders that aren't frozen - its all good
