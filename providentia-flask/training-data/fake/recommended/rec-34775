Lidia Bastianich's fantastic restaurant in the heart of Restaurant Row deserves all the praise it receives. Although not always necessary, it is a good idea to make a reservation even for parties of 2 (my mother and I were turned away one busy Saturday night). The restaurant is capable of accommodating large groups as my husband came here with 12 of his buddies one week-end night. MENU HIGHLIGHT: All you can eat homemade pasta, this option includes either an antipasto or a salad (both are good, yet I recommend the antipasto) - dinner $22.95/per person or lunch for $17.95/per person. They also have a lovely (and long and impressive) $25 per bottle wine list selection.
