First the food: do not miss the brussel sprouts with hazelnuts, the marriage of tastes and textures like Bogie & Bacall - ludicrously satisfying. The exquisitely calibrated lobster salad made me feel decadent like Edie slumming it with Andy, filling but light, leaving room for bites of my mate's very tasty cheeseburger. The fries are phenomenally good which is very important because a milquetoast fry can ruin a dish and these are darn perfect, robust and crunchy at the tips. I was very impressed with the fried chicken, moist yet grease free, nice seasoning. The broccoli rabe in anchovy vinaigrette was like a tepid bath on a cold winter morning, the only blemish gustatory-wise. Both the key lime pie (zingy and not too sweet, could've had two) and the chocolate bread pudding were solid finishes. The overall experience at Walter's is akin to drinking one of their bourbon cocktails: pleasant, vaguely sexy, and over much too soon. I'm perennially ravenous so you'd think I'd be over the moon to blink and find my food before me but it comes so fast I wouldn't be surprised to find Rosey in the kitchen flinging out dishes from a Food-a-Rac-a-Cycle. The actual food doesn't suggest 'instant' nor do the the warm aesthetics from the dandyish decor to the very friendly waitstaff -- you want to linger a little and the lack of lag time between dishes sort of made me feel like a mere $ 'gotta turn the tables get more customers in'. It seems incongruent with the ethos of the place. I mean, hell, one look at the bar set up and visions of a boozy afternoon of oyster clam claw chowing to a handsome soundtrack (Eric B & Rakim to Joy Division) ensure my return, so it's a shame I can't at least imagine doing the same at a table. If you're hungry and not in the mood to wait go very early or after 9:30.
