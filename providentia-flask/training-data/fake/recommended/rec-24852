I. Love. Rouge. In town for a friend's wedding, the first plans I immediately made were to go to rouge for the "rouge burger". Yes - all yelpers have reviewed this as the best burger in the city - and I have to agree. The challah bun, the perfectly cooked patty and the ripe tomato on top truly make this the burger of all burgers. Ok, back to the place itself. The decor is adorable and posh without being stuffy. The table next to me was a bit whiny about not getting a basket of bread, which I do think is a bit skimpy of them. In order to nibble on something before you get your order, you're forced to get an appetizer (hence the one star deduction). Bread (sticks) never hurt anyone!
