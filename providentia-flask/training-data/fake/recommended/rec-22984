Unfortunately, I had a very bad experience here last weekend, I thought I would share, to hopefully prevent this from happening to others.... I was excited to try San Sai, as we love sushi, and have yet to make it there. The location is great, and the view is wonderful. Unfortunately, the food did not live up to these same standards. To begin with, San Sai is EXTREMELY overpriced for the quality. Id say on average a roll os about $4-$5 dollars more than the same quality/size rolls would be elsewhere. For an appetizer we had the miso and mushroom stuffed lobster tail. I was excited to try this dish. When it came, I was dissapointed to see a TINY lobster tail with hardly any meat, that tasted previously frozen. It was frustrating. After our appetizer (which took about 30 minutes to come out after ordering) we waited another 30 minutes for the rest of our food to come out. For our main course we ordered 7 pieces of sushi, a spicy tuna roll, a volcano roll, and another roll that escapes my mind at the moment. The volcano roll was presented nicely, but like all else, was WAY overpriced for the quality and size. It didnt have a single note of heat, which was mentioned on the menu, and our main draw. The most disappointing part of the meal was when we bit into our Spicy Tuna roll, and realized the chef had forgotten to put the spicy mayo in it. When we addressed our server about it, she didnt even offer to bring us a new roll. Instead, she brought us a side of the "spicy mayo" which tasted like cheap mayonnaise with the slightest touch of Siracha. I feel like when you pay $120 for 2 people to eat sushi, bringing a side of the ingredient that the chef forgot to include is a complete insult. We left there unsatisfied and still hungry. Its unfortunate, because we love supporting our local restaraunts, and rarely have bad things to say. We are generally easy customers. However, after leaving San Sai, I felt like I had been taken for a major ride.
