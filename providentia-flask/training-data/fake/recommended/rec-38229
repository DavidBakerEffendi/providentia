Coming from California, I'm having serious boba withdrawls in Newark. When my roommate told me about this cute little cafe that serves everything from coffee to smoothies to bubble tea AND asian homecooked food, I was hooked! Try the passion fruit green tea with mango pop boba. The tea is very flavorful and the boba actually pops in your mouth - like those you can get as a topping at Yogurtland (I hope people know what I'm talking about) The lunch specials are also quite a bargain. $5.50 for one dish and veggies. The menu changes everyday (i.e. soy chicken + broccoli or mapo tofu + broccoli, Â both over rice) This might be my new cafe spot! They have a great outdoor seating area and free wifi, great for the remainder of the summer. I might be the only party pooper here studying though. :(
