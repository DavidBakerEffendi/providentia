After getting a major dose of hype for Umami burger, I was prepared for a letdown but no. This place definitely has one of the better burgers that I have ever tasted. When comparing "chains" this place schools In and Out, Shake Shack, Five Guys and etc. I had the "original" and it was pretty much cooked to perfection, the sweetness of the bun contrasting perfectly with the parmesan chip and perfectly cooked juicy medium rare beef. The fries were cooked well and the different flavored sauces are a nice touch but the star of the show was definitely the burger. At around 12 bucks a burger, it should taste this good and it delivered. We went around 5pm on a Sunday and it was already kinda packed with a 20-30 min wait. And when we got upstairs they had a leaky air conditioner that kept on dripping AC water on me which was kinda annoying, but BURGER.
