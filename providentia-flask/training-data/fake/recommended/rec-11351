after watching the "black metal vegan chef: pad thai" youtube video, i implanted into my friend's head the idea that pad thai must be consumed in the near future.  since she scoffed at the idea of actually MAKING the pad thai per the vid, she suggested this place near her abode.  my friend, her ladyfriend, and i sojurned to this previously unnoticed hole in the wall.  we beat the rush and got a table immediately.  the environment was quaint and warm.  i sensed that they didn't take credit cards and the host directed me toward an ATM down the street.  the wait staff was friendly and happy to serve us.  we brought a bottle of wine. my friends ordered their desired pad thai but i can never say no to red curry.  the waitress convinced me that salmon would go best with the curry and i asked her to kick up the heat on it.  she was right, the salmon worked great, though i could tell the filet was previously frozen. it was a bit tough and grilled without any seasonings.  the curry was spiced perfectly and the helping of food was enough to leave me full, but not overstuffed. i tasted my friend's pad thai, which also didn't have the heaviness that you'd expect from the dish.  it was light, airy, and full of flavor.  for desert i ordered the banana and chocolate spring rolls with sweet peach dipping sauce and they got the sweet coconut sticky rice.  i'm not a fan of coconut so i stuck to my sweet and melty spring rolls.. omg... so good.  get. them.  i WILL be back.
