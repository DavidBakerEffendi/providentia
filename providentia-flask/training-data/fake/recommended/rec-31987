We'd heard about the place and for one reason or another just never took time to visit.  Last Sunday, on the spur of the moment we wandered in.  The place was packed, a fellow greeted us and ask if we had reservations. . . we didn't and sat at the bar only a moment before a couple opted out of dessert and left. The food was fabulous . . the service was fabulous and the entire experience was enjoyable.  As others have mentioned the portions were generous and make great left overs! I'm eager to slip in some evening and catch the music.  Staten Island was, in the late 60's and 70's, a hot music scene and it seems places have kind of been popping up and vaporizing . . . so this could be very cool. Eager to return.
