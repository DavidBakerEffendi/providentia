Was there on Friday night. This was my 3rd visit. Was a good deal with grupon. The place was crowded as I expected. The wait staff was limited as the waiter explained that there were 2 call-outs. Overall, the service was a little rushed but I can understand the circumstances. As for the food, the portions were good , food was served warm and well prepared. I have to say that this was not the best that I have had in Newark, but I would make a return visit. The parking lot across the street was near the restaurant and I did not have to search the streets for a parking spot. You get a bang for the buck. Beats eating at lame places as Olive Garden , TGI Friday's etc. When you are finished with your meal you can actually say that you are full. Suggest that you make reservations on the weekends.
