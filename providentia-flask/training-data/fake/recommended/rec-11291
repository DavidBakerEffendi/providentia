I am extremly fond of Fond.  Wow.  Great bread.  Terrific service.  We had the tuna tartare and the foix gras for appetizers and the octopus and a monkfish special for entrees.  Everything was excellent.  The octopus was incredible.  If you are at all hesitant about eating the octopus, don't be.  It was cut up into small pieces and mixed in with a delicious blend of rissotto, saffron, chorizo and more.  Tastes like chicken!  Can't wait to go back for more.
