Other than a frightening warning by local police to not take out our telephones lest we get mugged in this 'hood, this was a good dining experience. I had the sliced beef noodle soup and the noodles were awesome! The soup was comfort food at it's finest, perfect after a long trip. It needed something to lighten it up - some lime juice maybe - but delish nonetheless. This place isn't much on aesthetic, but the affordability makes up for it.
