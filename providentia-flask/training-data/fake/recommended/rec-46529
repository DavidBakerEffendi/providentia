I really had no desire to come eat in little itay. I told my friend's boyfriend that the places are touristy, expensive and not good, yet somehow he had this idea that he wanted authentic cheap italian food! Little italy is probably the last place to go for authentic cheap italian food. We went to Pellegrino's purely based on the high reviews from yelp. This place was exactly what every restaurant is like in little italy (except for some of the cool new restaurants that have opened up)....expensive touristy and not good! i do not recommend!
