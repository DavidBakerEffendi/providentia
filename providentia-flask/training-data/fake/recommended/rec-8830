Walked here from 40th/5th one night to get some late night comfort food since I've heard so much about this highly rated cart. The line was snaking long when I first arrived. The owner came by and started giving out free yellow reusable bag printed with their name and logo on it. I spent the time in line chatting on the phone, so I guess it wasnt too long a wait. I ordered chicken over rice with extra white sauce since it came highly recommended. Wow, what can I say. If you're ever in NYC, definitely try this out!! I like the fragrance of the piping hot chicken and it worked so well with the white and hot sauce. The portion was a bit too big for me so I kept half of it and continued eating it for the next day. It was still good even after being left in the open for a day. But nothing beats having it piping hot and fresh next to the cart!
