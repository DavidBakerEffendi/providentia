Great service, and wonderful ambience. The server known as Triple A is awesome! I went there for my birthday, and she brought out the creme brulee (which, might I add, was divine) with a little candle on it. The Warm Goat Cheese Salad is perfect. I also had Blackened Mahi Mahi, which came out exactly the way I was hoping it would. We tried a bunch of oysters, all very flavorful and juicy. I love this place!
