Oh my gosh! Delicious food! I am still thinking about the lechon! I went with three friends and we all loved the entrees. The ceviche appetizer was ok but very small. We ordered the sangria and all thought it was tasty but we couldn't really taste the alcohol (which is fine by me since I don't like strong drinks). Service was prompt and courteous. We went around 4pm on a Saturday so it wasn't busy at all. But by the time we left, it started to fill up. As i said, the entrees were great. I got the ropa vieja and let me tell you, it was a whole lotta food! I don't eat much anyway but this was still a hefty serving. It was flavorful and the meat was tender, the rice was good and the plantains complemented the meat so well. The friends ordered the lechon, skirt steak, and fish (which I think was flounder) and were all happy with their choice. Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant.
