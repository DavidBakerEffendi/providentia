After reading many favorable reviews, decided to try this place for brunch. The service was good, but the food was meh. I ordered baked eggs w/Tuscan Kale/Pork sausage, thinking I was going to have a side of kale and sausage links, but what came were 2 runny eggs on top of a bunch of cooked kale with *tiny* bits of meat mixed in, where's my sausage?? It looked the opposite of what I pictured. My friends' orders were probably better, but there was nothing special on the menu that really made me want to go back. The decor was average as well, honestly, I don't know what the big deal is about this place. Maybe it's better for dinner.
