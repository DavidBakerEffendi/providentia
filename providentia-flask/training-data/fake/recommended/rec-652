Bring the pain.   I confess.  I wantonly covet the sweet, searing blaze of hellishly spicy foods.  And, having tried the original, Prince's Hot Chicken in Nashville, I came in with sky-high expectations.  Which Peaches met and wildly, recklessly, exceeded.  I ordered my chicken "Hot."  And, let me tell you, that chicken was hot.  Not girl-next-door hot.  Not sexy librarian hot.  I'm talking full-on black leather bikini-clad stripper carrying a flame-thrower hot.  So hot it was almost kinky.  It bordered on depraved. All kidding (and stripteasing) aside, this is excellent fried chicken.  Served on the bone, with savory-sweet spicy, crispy skin and flavorful, juicy meat, it's everything you ever wanted in a plate of fried chicken.  For those who don't enjoy being scalded and forced to beg for mercy during a meal (you poor, poor, suckers), they also offer "Mild" fried chicken.  And, for the criminally insane, they offer "Extra Spicy." I have made a long, and largely fruitless search for good fried chicken in NYC.  Finally, my quest is at an end.  Peaches serves by far and away the best fried chicken in the city.  And the crazy part is, they serve something else, which almost rivals the chicken:  Pies.  Fresh-made fruit pies, to be exact.  I had the blueberry apple pie a la mode, which inspired a state of joy, inner peace, and reverence for the divine that I thought was reserved for the afterlife of saints.  I can only hope to make many more pilgrimages to this hallowed house of flesh-igniting deliciousness.
