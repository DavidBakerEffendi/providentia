I'm seeing some negativity in a lot of the recent reviews, but I had a very good experience here. I like that they have a good selection of really interesting beers that are brewed on site.  I had an IPA, a Russian imperial stout, and their Forbidden Fruit.  All were of very high quality and reasonably priced.  The Forbidden Fruit, though,  was not really my cup of tea, being more like a cider. I was pleasantly surprised with the fish and chips I ordered.  They serve up a really big piece of cod, and it's not overly breaded.   The ambience is good, and it's pleasant to sit at the front bar with the big windows looking out on the street scene.
