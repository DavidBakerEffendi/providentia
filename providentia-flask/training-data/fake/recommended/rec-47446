281 reviews ?!? Ok, the drinks are cheap (if you are a beer person) and the food is cheap, but generally good - but it's impossible to find seating after 4pm and always ridiculously packed. The best time to get a seat at the bar or one of the tables would probably be lunch time or post 3:00am (NOT on weekends). They are also cash-only and the bartenders have tremendous attitude - not quite why. I think Artbar or Johnny's on Greenwich AVE and w12th are far better alternatives if you are considering a drink or food in west village hood.
