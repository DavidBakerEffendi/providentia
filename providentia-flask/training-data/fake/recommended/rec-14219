Really a 3.5 star rating.  Came here for lunch with a colleague.  Definitely a snooty air about this place from the maitre d when my boss told him we didn't have a reservation.  It was not busy at all and that really bugged me.  However, the bread sticks were quite yummy.  I ordered one of the specials - flounder filet with sauteed spinach and potatoes and I ABSOLUTELY LOVED it.  The service left something to be desired - I just liked to be checked in with once in a while.  It took FOREVER to get our check but man....I will have memories of that flounder for many years to come.
