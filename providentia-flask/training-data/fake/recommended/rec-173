Slowwwww service bordering on inattentive.  We sat for 20 min before I had to get up and ask for the kids soup. I never received mine.  Food was more interesting than normal - the shumai while normally simply shrimp were spiced up with additional greens and such. Dirty plates were left lingering on our table for at least 15 min.  We ended up moving them to an adjacent table ourselves.   A shame because the place has the feel of a joint that should have provided a much more enjoyable experience.
