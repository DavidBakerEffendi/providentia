I love that this place is only a few blocks from my apartment. The staff is super friendly and the happy hour is amazing! 2 for 1 wine (with some great choices) 2 for 1 beer 2 for 1 mezes Happy hour is between 5:30-7:30 and for practically nothing you can have some amazing food (meatballs, beet salad, hummus, pita...) and get a very nice buzz going. You have to sit at the bar or the front table for the happy hour but they also have a back area if you want some fresh air.
