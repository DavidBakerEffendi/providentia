From their website: "To all of our loyal customers who made Little Fish what it was, we would like to thank you. Without all of you, Little Fish would have never been so successful. As you may have noticed, the condition of the building in which we lease space has been rapidly deteriorating. After many months of attempting to get the building repaired, we have become increasingly worried about the safety of our establishment for our customers and employees. Because we can no longer safely operate out of our 6th and Catherine location, we have decided to close Little Fish." --Mike and Marilyn Stollenwerk
