Place is a diner-- I had not expected that for a Cuban place Food is really good-- had the arepas... 2 mini sandwiches.. wanted maduros, but they didn't have ripe plantains, so that was a bummer. Got a side of sweet potato fries which weren't that special.. but it came with chipotle mayo which was pretty kicker My friend had the corn pancakes.. a litter tougher texture than regular pancakes and there was a nice corn aftertaste Service was good
