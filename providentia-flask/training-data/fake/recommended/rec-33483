While I think this is a solid restaurant, I wouldn't necessarily state that they're the best tapas in NYC.  The txipirones en su tinta (squid in its ink) were pretty good, but not out of this world.  I much preferred las navajas y almejas (razor clams and cockles) as they were perfectly succulent and garlicky goodness.  My all time favorite tapas, la tortilla espanola, fell flat.  I've had/made better.  That's a bummer since I feel like it was a wasted carb.  The patatas bravas, according to C, were delicious.   Overall, pretty tasty, but I'd only go if I were in the 'hood.
