This place is Vintage. This place is Cheap. This place is AWESOME! With a small sign in the fire escape that says Happy Hour all day.  5 dollar special: 16 oz PBR and shot of well bourbon.  Also all the domestic drafts are 3 dollars each day!! WHAAAAA??????  (Double take, head-shake, exasperated look in confusion)  Are we still in Manhattan?  Yes Virginia, moderately priced domestic spirits can be found on the Island, but you just have to venture down into the Financial District. As with the prices, this establishment looks like nothing has changed in at least 20 years.  A very vintage vibe indeed, in fact the Whitehorse was mentioned on an episode of Mad Men (granted it might have been the one up town).   The best times to visit are happy hour when the wage drones come out of their mighty towers and wind up here.  There is a pretty rocking jukebox blasting a variety of good drinking tunes.  Also there is a host of pub grub that can soak up the cheap booze. So pick a Friday, punch out and get back in the saddle and ride that Whitehorse into an epic weekend.  Hi Ho Silver!!!!!
