Yelp led me here and I will be going back next time I am in NYC.  The guy who rang us up was friendly and talkative -giving us tips on what to order.  I ended up with a slice of pepperoni, and the hubby with the Grandma's and the chicken pizza.  All were fantastic.  It was a tiny little place and we spent enough money that we could have bought a whole pie back at home, but the cost was worth it for this tourist!
