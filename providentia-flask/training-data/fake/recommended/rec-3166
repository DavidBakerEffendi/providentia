went back and the food was just meh. Â i had chicken and waffles and it seems like the lost ideas for making american food more 'zesty'. one tip - get off the american food bandwagon and explore some different flavors do or dine also try not to put the sauce between the meat and the waffle, it made my waffle turn into a rubbery overpowering snot ball. sorry but true. it made me feel like i could have spent half as much elsewhere and had much better food. plus side, ask for a marker and you can tag their bathroom...legally. unless of course you havent already :)
