Excellent Authentic Greek Food This place is not small but because it is so popular it is always busy and crowded and can be a little tight. Weekend are the tightest. They do their best to get as many people seated as possible so you don't have to wait but you sitting close to other parties. All of that is something you can deal with because the food is very good and the prices are reasonable and you can't go wrong with whatever you order. They have fresh fish and a large amount of true authentic greek dishes.
