This place is fantastic. I went here with my wife last Valentine's day.  It was raining and we didn't quite know where to go.  A friend familiar with New York suggested this place so we hopped on the subway and went there. It was super packed, but we decided to wait at the bar until a table was ready.  One of the very nice waiters was off duty and we were sitting next to him.  He got us a table much faster than we would have and even sent over a free glass of champagne for my wife and I.  The service and food were excellent!  We're definitely going there again next time we're in New York!  5 stars.
