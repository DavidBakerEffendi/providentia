Yeah!!!  Down to earth service.  Always fresh, flavorful food.  THE HOMEMADE JAMS. Can't even deal with them jams.  Their biscuits are amazing, but I'm really just in it for the jam.   Frittas are always poppin' off with fresh ingredients like veggies and fancy cheese.  That's what I always order- because I like to pretend to be healthy, while I order 2 extra biscuits and sneak the jam containers from all of the tables surrounding me. Last time they had TWO TYPES OF JAM. So needless to say, shit got real. Server always keeps the coffee flowing like champagne at Jay's table in the 40/40 club.   Sam you beautiful bastard of a South Philly gem, don't ever change.
