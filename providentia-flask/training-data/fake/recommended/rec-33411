The Good: I ordered the BLAT. Bacon, lettuce, avocado, and tomato on a slightly toasted kaiser bun with chipotle mayonnaise. It was divine. The bacon strips were nice and thick, and perfectly cooked. The other ingredients were super fresh. I paired it with an Arnold Palmer. The Bad: My server was Bridget. I found this out when she brought me the bill. But I must use the term "server" loosely. Because she never brought me a menu. She never actually took my order. She never checked on me during my meal. Who did all of this? The busser and the manager Ruben. I offered the 20% gratuity tip to the busser, who truly deserved it, but he refused to accept it. Because I am not an asshole, I left it for Bridget anyway after telling Ruben about my experience. Overall, Walter's is cool. I do like the vibe, the menu looks interesting, and I definitely want to check out the bar. But if Bridget's ass is working, I do not want to be seated in her section.
