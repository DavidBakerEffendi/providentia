If anybody watches Treme, you might recognize this restaurant from Season 2 Episode 6, "Feels Like Rain."  They even have pictures of the actors near the cash register at the front. Big Wong has tasty, cheap, and greasy Cantonese food.  I've been here a few times, as the first time I came here I noticed the 2 ginger scallion lobsters for $20 deal.  The lobsters are obviously not going to be huge lobsters, but they definitely hit the spot and are worth the price.  Usually get those with some type of fried rice or noodle dish and veggies.  Everything has been consistent so far. I don't get why people complain about rude service in cheap Chinatown restaurants.   They're pretty much always rude, but the food comes quick.  I came in here once with some friends from Japan.  One of the servers used to live in japan for a bit, so he was unsuccessfully trying to spit whatever Japanese game he had at the two girls.  Fun to watch.
