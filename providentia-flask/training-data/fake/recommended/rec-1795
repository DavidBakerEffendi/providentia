I can't speak highly enough of The Mood Cafe. The guy running the place gave us an outstanding background & description of each of the dishes, delighting those of us in the group who were unfamiliar with chaat.  His charm also worked magic on the food: it was mouthwatering; An impeccable explosion of sweet & savory.  We sampled a few dishes & shared it family style.  Each dish was unique and flavorful. I cherished every bite and look forward to the next time I'm in town. First stop: Mood Cafe, a delicious destination for locals & travelers alike.
