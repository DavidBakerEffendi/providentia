About a month ago, my family suggested we get take out from Bar Taco. Circumstances prevented us all from physically going to the restaurant, and I was skeptical of the quality of the tacos once we got back home. I was pleasantly surprised! The tacos made it back in tact, not soggy, and in good shape! Everything was packaged well, and just as good as it was in the restaurant. I might not order the corn next time, as this is much better as soon as its prepared. (The corn in general is missing a little something, Toro in Boston makes a similar dish that puts this to shame) And the staff even threw a few beer cozies into our order!
