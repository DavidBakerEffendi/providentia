We really liked this restaurant, with a few reservations. First, the pluses. Amazing lobster entree, and really friendly, knowledgable service. Great coffee. And oysters. And the heirloom tomato salad was very nice. The minuses: the baby lettuce salad was swimming in a sort of Caesar-style dressing - should have gone much lighter on the dressing. And worse, the desserts (chef's seasonal special) were cloyingly sweet. Like, really really sweet. Next time, a different salad, and the lobster!
