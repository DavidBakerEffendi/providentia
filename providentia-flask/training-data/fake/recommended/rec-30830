Had the oh so overly praised egg sandwich, I don't know what other people got, but my sandwich consisted of the following... The bread flavor was great, but it was dry/old, burnt and barely cut open, super under seasoned roast pork, a beautifully soft cooked egg that was however awkwardly balanced on top of the uncut burnt bread and under seasoned meat, which made it impossible to eat... All that for $7?...
