I have never had a good experience here. I'm giving it a second star anyway because I have a couple friends who love the food and insist we come back, so they are good for them, I guess. The food is just...blah, though. Half the time it tastes reheated or like it needs double the spice in order to get closer to an authentic flavor. It's rather bland. The chips and salsa ARE good, but at the same time, I'm not going to go to a place just for the chips either, so I wish the rest of their food was better.
