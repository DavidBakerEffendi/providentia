Food snob from San Francisco says to New York chic friend "give me the best meditteranean spot in NY for a group dinner." Alta. I called two months in advance and spoke to a very nice chap. We ended up talking for about 20 minutes and sharing food snob secrets (he'd lived in SF) before I booked my reservation (a must). The food at Alta was fantastic! Even the Greek boyfriend in tow from SF was impressed. There was 8 of us and we ordered a lot of things on the menu. I absolutely loved: the bacon wrapped dates, fried goat cheese (HEAVEN), lamb meatballs (don't usually eat lamb), spinach salad, smoked mozzarella, filet mignon tartare, and the pork ribs. I docked a star for service. Not very attentive or friendly. More like "tell me what you want, I'll send it through." That's cool and all. Maybe that's more NY but I think a check-in is always good and we weren't checked in with between plates. All in all though: fantastic.
