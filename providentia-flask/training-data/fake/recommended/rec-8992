The French Toast was REALLY good.  The savory ham/egg/cheese crepe was only ok.  The service was average... not too friendly, but not too unfriendly either.   It was very hot in the back of the restaurant.  I wish I had not been wearing a sweater because it would have been more tolerable.   I think I'd go back if I lived nearby, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here again.
