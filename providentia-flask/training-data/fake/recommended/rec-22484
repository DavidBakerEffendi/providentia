Great food. You can tell it's fresh and that the new owners care about what they serve. They decor is quite nice and the jazz playing makes it far more comfortable than any Qdoba or Chipotle I've ever been in! I had a burrito bowl which was prepared quickly with tasty incredients. The serving size was just right. They're doing a great job and they're definitely worth the visit for a quick lunch.
