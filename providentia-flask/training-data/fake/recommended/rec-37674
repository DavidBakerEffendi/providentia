This is what the menu says about Shawarma: 13 Shawarma Slivers of chicken and lamb, charred onion, preserved lemons, on a bed of homemade hummus, served with freshly baked pita bread II doesn't say 5 or 6 shreds of chicken / lamb, but mostly chickpeas on a bed of hummus. This place has gone downhill since opening. Cutting corners in the wrong places.
