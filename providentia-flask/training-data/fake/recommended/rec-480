A cute little bistro on the East side of town. The service was less than spectacular with a not very attentive staff.   I ordered the hanger steak, which was flavorful but doused with too much sauce.  I went with a large group, so we ordered most of the main items on the menu.  I was able to try a bite of each of my friends' dishes.   The mussels and risotto were probably the best items on the menu.  The other dishes like the seafood spaghetti were average. I'll probably try other places in the area before I come back here again.
