I seriously cannot stop thinking about the Whaley burger. There was just the right amount of each ingredient. Burger was just juicy enough without being too greasey. Just enough pineapple and beet to sweeten it up without it being too sweet. You can't go wrong with a fried egg on anything. And the bread was a nice change from a typical bun, not too thick but sturdy enough to handle all the toppings. My boyfriend hates beets and he even happily hate this without taking them off. I also tried the Bondi which was packed with flavor as well. We were lucky enough to be seated right away on a Sunday afternoon. But the place is tiny so I can imagine having a long wait on a Friday or Saturday night. The staff did seem to do a good job of keeping things moving. Overall I will definitely be back here again and can't wait to sink my teeth into another Whaley burger.
