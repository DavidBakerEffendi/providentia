Cool Thai restaurant. I went here with coworkers. Get the Thai Iced Tea. They serve a very authentic version. (Be warned, it's uber sweet.) Take their spice recommendations seriously, even if you are one of those people who, like me, say, "I definitely can take spice!" Your tastebuds might decide otherwise...not speaking from personal experience, of course ;)
