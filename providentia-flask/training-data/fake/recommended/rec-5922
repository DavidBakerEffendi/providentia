Nothing like ordering their out-of-this world hummus right before 1AM and grabbing a chilled local brew, cozying up next to the bar, and sipping on into the early morning.  Even more preferable when it's busy, this bar is totally too cool for school. Whether it be the late night Jenga games that can break out at a moment's notice, or the genuinely friendly and welcoming bar staff, I will take JB's over any high end bar any day of the week.  I mean seriously, who wants to go to a fancy Martini bar in Rittnenhouse and pretend to have a black Amex and a family dynasty when they could enjoy really good locally grown food and local brews, that's more Philly to me, call me crazy. Try the octopus and Hummus, it's a sure win.  The menu can change frequently due to the local offerings, which makes it exciting.  I went there one night and was so starved after not eating all day and devoured their Hanger steak and frittes, totally annihilated.  The most satisfying meal I have had in a long, long time.
