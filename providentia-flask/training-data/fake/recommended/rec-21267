I think this just may be my favorite place in the city. The service and the place is perfect. After spending quite a bit of time in Spain with my bf... upon landing in the US we already missed the food.  We were determined to find a restaurant that brought us right back.  Arriving at Tia Pole we knew we had found it...we frequent this restaurant any time we get a craving for delicious tapas. Must haves: Sepia, Pulpo, Pan con tomate and prosciutto, Sangria, patatas bravas, and everything else on the menu.
