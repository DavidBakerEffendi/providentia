My husband and I have ordered from here a few times and loved it each time. The first time we did not know what to expect and completely over ordered. Portions sizes are great and we could both eat from one order (and he's not a small guy). Our favorite is the brisket, but the ribs were great as well. The rub combined with the smoke creates an unbelievable flavor. The meat was not dry which made it much easier to enjoy the smokey flavor. The sides are also fantastic. Our favorites are the corn bread and Mac and cheese. The sides go perfectly with the smokey flavor of the meat without over powering it.
