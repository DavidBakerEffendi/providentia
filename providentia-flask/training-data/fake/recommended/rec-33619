What an absolute treat! The food, ambiance and service were just perfect. I ordered an heirloom tomato salad with mozzarella and basil. There were about eight different beautiful varieties of tomato - light green, dark red, bright yellow - sliced thin with just the right amount of meyer lemon olive oil and course salt. It was a feast for the eyes as well as the belly. My entree, salmon with corn salsa and grilled peaches, was wonderfully flavorful. It tasted fresh and summery and the flavors of the food really shone; there was no need for a heavy sauce or too much oil. I can't wait to go back.
