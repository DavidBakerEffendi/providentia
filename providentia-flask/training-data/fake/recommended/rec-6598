The meat is awesomely tasty.  With street meat, you can pretty much always count on the gyro being tasty and delicious (and at 53rd and 6th they do gyro right). The difference between 53rd and 6th and other street meat vendors is the chicken.  The chicken is moist and tasy and utterly fantastic.  The rice is also flavorful and tends not to be overcooked. Let us move on to the sides.  The yogurt sauce is good... but I honestly don't think its great.  I have the haunting suspicion that is quite similar to water-downed mayo (sounds grosser than it tastes).   I do have a problem with the hot sauce.  It is just too damn hot.  I know 53rd and 6th is famous for having some of the hottest hot sauce.  But honestly... why?  I am drunk and its 330 in the morning.  I feel very confident... I can eat anything... what's a little hot sauce.  A little voice in my head tells me to be a man... so I keep adding hot sauce.  I add too much and my mouth catches fire.  It is unpleasent.  I blame 53rd and 6th.  I place some blame on the alcohol.  I do not blame myself.
