You walk in and you feel like you are in the basement of someones wine cellar. The tables are crammed together and the wait staff are not loyal to their kitchen, by blaming them for a missing order that failed to make it to us. They did however compensate by sending us over a cheese dish however it's inexcusable to blame your kitchen. The Turbot was phenomenal and the lamb was pretty good too. However the food was not as good considering what you payed for the meal.
