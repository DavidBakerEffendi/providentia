I am a huge fan of this place.  Brought my family here the other day after racking my brain for a good NY restaurant to share with the out-of-towners.  They were both very impressed with my restaurant picking skillz. My go-to is the Kitchen Sink Salad.  You get your choice of balls and sauce and it comes over a variety of Chef-selected vegetables which are always perfectly seasoned and delicious.  Now that I am 100% gluten-free, I love that their chicken balls are gluten-free, but I highly recommend the spicy pork balls.  All the sauces are delicious.  I usually go with the standard tomato, but the mushroom is pretty damn good. The sides are a good size for sharing.  The polenta is to die for.  I also commend them on their spinach portions.  We all know how much spinach cooks down and sometimes when I order a side of spinach at a restaurant it's almost laughable how small the portion ends up looking in the dish, but TMS definitely does not skimp on the portions. There's usually a wait whenever I go, but the bar is first-come, first-serve, and they can also text you when your table is ready.  Epstein's bar next door is a great place to grab a drink while you wait as the bar at TMS is small and usually full of people eating delicious food and, let's be honest, who wants to stare at that on an empty stomach. Bottom line: Delicious meatballs. Nuff said.
