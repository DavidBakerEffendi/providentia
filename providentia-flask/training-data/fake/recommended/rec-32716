Decided to try it on a Friday night after dinner. As soon as we walked in the music was super cool. And lots of people were dancing at the bar area. The place looked pretty cool and the decor is simple but feels cozy.  Most of the clientele looked late 20s early 30s and nicely dressed. The outdoor seating area was full so we seated inside. The waiter came right away and took our drinks order. A few minutes  later he came back with the order. No mistakes, the drinks were perfect. We only ordered drinks but can say the prices on the menu  looked standard for west Hartford. I will definitely come back and have dinner or lunch.
