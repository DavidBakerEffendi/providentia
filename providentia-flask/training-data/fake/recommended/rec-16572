My boyfriend and I went to Graffiti last night for a late dinner and had a fantastic time. The service was quick and FRIENDLY. Refreshing. Although the place was really small, it wasn't TOO small but felt more intimate and cozy. Drinks=Yummy The bf got the Prosecco Lychee martini, which was delicious, and I got a nice glass of Cab from India (who knew?!) that they let me try before pouring me a big glass. Food=excellent. We asked for the chef's recommendations and were not disappointed with our 3 selections: Candied Ginger Scallops, Duck Gratinee, and Pork Buns with Apricot Chutney. It was definitely enough for 3 people. We also ordered the Chocolate Hazelnut cupcake for dessert to share, and that quenched our appetites perfectly. All of the flavors went together really nicely and smoothly, even though they looked a bit dubious in the menu. I would absolutely recommend this place to friends...if they can get a reservation. Apparently from reading the reviews, we were very lucky that calling at 8:45 on Sunday night for the last 9:30 seating worked out for us.
