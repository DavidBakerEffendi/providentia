My boyfriend and I love this place! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is how small and packed it always is. Especially on weekends and even week nights. It's always better to make reservations and if you ask they will not seat anyone near you which is super accommodating and nice since they lose a table. The food is amazing for the prize and the noodle combos and the catfish are a must try. Oh and their 7 spices fries have changed my life!
