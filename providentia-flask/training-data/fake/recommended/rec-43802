My boyfriend and I have been loyal customers for over a year, as the dishes have always exceeded our expectations. I would recommend this place over Pho Dang and Pho Hong, as their portions are generous (especially the noodle soups and rice dishes) and affordable (between $6-9 for an entree). If you are trying this place for the first time, I recommend any of the noodle soups (the wonton noodle soup is my boyfriend and I's favorite!), dumplings, lo mein dishes or fried rice dishes. The lo mein and fried rice dishes are safe bets for those who enjoy these dishes in other Asian cuisines. Quick tip: The small portions of the noodle soups, lo mein, chow mein and fried rice dishes are incredibly generous -- you may likely have leftovers! The ingredients are fresh, as the owner of the restaurant also owns a market across the street, and the kitchen is located behind the counter, so you can watch your dish being made. The limited seating may deter some people, but it is well worth the wait. As someone who grew up in New York City with an abundance of Vietnamese restaurants around, this restaurant does an excellent job of making comparable authentic Vietnamese dishes.
