Out of 4 or 5 choices we made, the waitress managed to get 3 of them wrong. As in, the wrong kind of pasta for the kiddo and the wrong sides for both of us. Unfortunately for us, she got the steak order right. Note: don't order the steak. Despite being listed on OpenTable as 'good for kids' - don't be fooled, they have no kids menu, and your only real option is small pasta plates. The staff was friendly enough, one of the veal dishes was good, and the house cabernet wasn't bad at all. But honestly, the best feature of the restaurant is its proximity to the Hyatt. Hopefully you'll look for more than that.
