This is the place we go when hubby allows me to choose a restaurant.  Always the generously-portioned arugula salad, squash blossoms if in season.  I like fresh healthy food prepared with a light hand - no matter my entree choice, L'amante will come through for me.  I am expecting the protein to be prepared properly, but as well the vegetables are beautifully prepared and integral to the dish, the starch (if any) will be an appropriate serving and flavorful.  Priced about the same as comparable Burlington restaurants = 2 people ordering an entree each, a modest bottle of wine, and sharing an appetizer = $100.
