Came here for breakfast and loved it. I had the arugula and date salad, which came with pistachios, oranges, and feta, and I ordered a side of bacon. I was expecting just a few pieces of bacon, but they give a ton of bacon, maybe at least 10 pieces? It was more than I could eat, but luckily my dining partner helped me out. Perfect yummy breakfast that's filling and energizing without weighing me down. Dining partner had the vegan scramble, and she seemed to enjoy it.
