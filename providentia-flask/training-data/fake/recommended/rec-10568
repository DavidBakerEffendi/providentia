I've went to this place twice. The first I just had dessert and what I found that time was and awesome twist on something very comforting. It was the brownie wonton sundae I think. Totally hit the spot since I was craving something rich and sweet. They also have some pretty unique coffee drinks to offer too! The second time I went I actually had something from their lunch menu. I ordered Â the french dip and some onion rings. I actually really enjoyed the onion rings there very much as for the french dip it was pretty decent but nothing too special. Either way I left satisfied. What truly got me was how cool the space felt. It was super low key and had some pretty interesting art pieces hanging around from locals. Also what I had observed was how some of the random art was drawn or left behind from customers or regulars that drew on the paper that's actually on the table. I found that to be unique, sorta an homage to their customers. On another note the customer service was always decent. The server was very kind and sweet, she always made it a point to stop by the table and check in when she made around the floor. Super friendly staff and chill environment. If you are looking for a no frills place with something different to hit that craving you can't quite figure out. I'm sure you'd find something here. Not the type of place for coffee snobs or hardcore foodies, but a chill place that you can find food to feed the craving and casual coffee for friendly meet ups. ** one last note, parking was never an issue for me but they do not have their own parking lot and depending on the time you may be looking at walking a block or two to get to it. Which I find weird for a suburban area
