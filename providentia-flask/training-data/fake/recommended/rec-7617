Nothing is more deceitful than the notion of an authentic Viennese coffee and hot chocolate (did I mention the "hot chocolate" was clearly not Viennese & was made with hot water & some sort of dried instant mix) so tawdry and cheap. Shame on you Neue Gallerie. The ambiance did little to excel in wonderment with a cheap chandelier and paper napkins, tepid hot chocolate and lastly (children cover your ears, ladies have your smelling salts at the ready)... An unpardonable presentation of the refreshments in... Plastic "glasses" with no handles. I deign to write this unfortunate experience and would not besmirch my lips to EVER refer anyone to this drab, overpriced, disappointment of a Viennese experience. Cheap cutlery, no table clothes, indifferent waiter, and paper Napkins to boot. Avoid this place. Refinement and ambiance are strangers. I found myself quite  préoccupé, and tried to carry myself away from this barbaric slaughterhouse in the guise of a Viennese cafe. And now my review is Fini
