Peaches Hothouse is awesome. It was the first dining/drinking establishment I patronized when I moved to Bed Stuy.The atmosphere is very cozy and the chicken is great, I would recommend getting it hot or extra hot if you like spicy food. I think brunch is a great time to eat at Peaches but so does everyone else in Bed-Stuy so either show up as soon as they open or expect an hour long wait(hence the 4 stars). The service is pretty good, the hostess made me comfortable while waiting, she gave me (free) coffee as I waited outside. On the flip side, Peaches is good for drinks. I had 3 generously poured Jack Daniels(dont judge me) for just $18. Can't beat it. Love, love, love Peaches!
