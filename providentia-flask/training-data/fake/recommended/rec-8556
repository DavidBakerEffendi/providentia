After abstaining from Indian food after getting deathly ill in West Philly about 5 years ago, ekta is quickly helping me regain my love for Indian food . Unfortunately for me Ekta is not very close to my South Philadelphia stomping grounds, but when I can get my hands on it I am a happy girl. They give you a good amount of naan, which is not too thin and not too thick. Their prices are reasonable and the portions are good (much better than Lovash) I recommend: Mutter Paneer (7.50) Saag Aur Paneer (7.50) Chicken Korma (about 9) I know there are some negative comments about consistency with Ekta but I am pretty sure they have worked the kinks out. It is definately worth a shot. Oh and if you think you don't like Indian food, the above mentioned are definately great to start with! Hopefully I don't get too hooked...all that yummy food might lead to bad things!
