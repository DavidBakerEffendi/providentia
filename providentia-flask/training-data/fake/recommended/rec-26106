Went here last night with my girlfriend and it was a really great experience. It was funny because we tried to get reco's from the waitress and she said, as most do, that everything is good. But this time it was totally true. You really just have to look for a crepe that has things that you like in it, and you'll absolutely love it. And they're a pretty good size. The place was so cute and cozy and everyone who works there is super friendly. After we sat down for a bit a really talented musician came out and completed the evening with some perfect music for the atmosphere. We were dreaming about renting the whole place out one night for all our friends. Would be totally worth it. And to the girl who gave the bad review because they were confused about you wandering in off the street to use their restroom: Grow up. This place is as near to perfect as I've experienced.
