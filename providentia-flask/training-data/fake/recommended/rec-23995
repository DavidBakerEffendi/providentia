The food at Alla Spina is really good. The menu is mostly 'takes' on common dishes, but Â fancied up. The portions are small and meant for sharing. The balsamic glazed ribs are amazing (but only 2 ribs is $16). I also loved the eggplant fritti (so much that I got it twice!). A recommendation: watch what booze you order (unless you're drinking beer). My standard cocktail (Bluecoat gin with soda) ran me $11.00 a glass, when I get them everywhere else in Phila. for $5 - $8. When I got the bill and had to throw in $44 + tax/tip just for booze, I was a little cranky! The service is quick, friendly, and knowledgeable (and they have a knack for 'recommending' the most expensive items :) ). I went for my birthday and we ordered 2 desserts, and they brought us a third dessert complimentary... that was nice, it's always fun to get something for free, but it would have been cool to comp us one of the things we already ordered instead... because we couldn't eat 3 desserts so left behind some of the dessert we DID pay for. Anyway, the food is good and the ambiance is nice too... my boyfriend called it "A better version of The Industry" (in Pennsport).... that's about right! I look forward to returning and sampling some things I didn't get to try yet.
