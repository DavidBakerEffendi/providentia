Food and atmosphere was really good. The place was big enough for 15 friends and we had a 21st birthday dinner.  We got the chicken combo and we were all satisfied with that. For most of us, it was our first time there. So it would've been nice if the waiter actually helped us right away instead of sitting to the side for half an hour. I basically had to call over and ask the guy if he was our waiter.  Plus, he never asked us about how dinner was and the food (oh, and there was hair in my friend's rice). And $20 extra to serve cake? What a ripoff. Plus, we had strawberries in our cake which was gone after they cut it. What's a strawberry cake without the strawberry...? I would go with just a couple of friends, but not in a huge group after this experience.  I heard the one on Woodhaven Bl. had better service - I would rather go to that one if you're coming from LI.
