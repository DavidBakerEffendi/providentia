Sad.  Honestly, it wasn't the worst experience where you walk out mad because of such a horrible experience, but we did walk out hungry. We went on the earlier side, 6ish, and there were seats available.  We were told there would be a wait so the kitchen could "catch up", I appreciated their honesty, so we went to the bar for a drink.  Beer on tap wasn't working, so we got bottled.  We sat down relatively quickly and the waitress was nice.  That's kind of where the good experience stopped.  The crab cake was the same texture and color all around, some celery and Old Bay to garnish would have done wonders.  The oysters were nothing to write home about, and the lobster, while cooked well, wasn't anything special, and lacked the usual "lobster utensils" and butter on the side.  But no worries, there was plenty of butter in the potatoes and snow peas to dip your lobster in.   They got really busy while we were eating and sat another couple with us, not a big deal had the rest of the experience been amazing, and it did take a lot to no tell them to go pick up dinner from Fairway. Being from Maryland, I had high hopes for a "crab house away from home", sadly, that place was not Brooklyn Crab.  They definitely have some major kinks to work out, hope they do before crab season ends.
