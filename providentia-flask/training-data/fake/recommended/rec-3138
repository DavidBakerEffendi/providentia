First let me tell you what's good about this place. The bread is good, the calamari is OK, the hummus and babaganoosh are excellent, the Turkish coffee is OK, the baklava is excellent (the best I have had so far) and that's it. I had the the Doner Kebab and so did my son. We left most of it. My wife and daughter had the Beyoglu salad and they said it was OK. The whole of the Eastern European waitstaff was not rude, but not all that friendly either. The water glasses were not filled except when we were ready to leave and had asked for the check. They looked angry. I would go here for dessert...nix that... I'm sure there are better places to get Turkish dessert. The hummus and baklava keep them at two stars otherwise I would have rated them one lonely star.
