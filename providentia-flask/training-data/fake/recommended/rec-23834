Had dinner here on a friday night and overall came away satisfied. Prices were right in line with quality and service. While I was not overly impressed, (I got the chicken) but the food was prepared correctly and the portions were appropriate. I strongly recommend the octopus appetizer as it was done to perfection. The space is small so be mindful that you may be seated in close proximity to others.
