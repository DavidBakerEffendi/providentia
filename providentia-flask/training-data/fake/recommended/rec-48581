I was visiting the nearby Rodin Museum. It was a beautiful day, so my husband and I thought a nice cold beer and a nibble to eat would be perfect. We headed to the Belgian Café. A short walk from the Rodin, we arrived and saw there was outdoor seating available. Saturdays and Sundays they have a brunch menu. We had already had breakfast, so we looked over the burger menu. We saw the brie and jalapeno burger and decided to split it. Along with the burger we ordered a side or fries and a couple beers. The beer selections is long and distinguished. I'm by no means a beer snob, but I enjoy Belgians. I ordered a St. Bernardus and hubby orderedt a Belgian. I can't remember the name but it had hints of ancho chile's that you could taste on  the front of your tongue. Our burger arrived and they kindly cut it in half and put it on another plate. It.was.delicious. Spicy, but the creaminess of the brie balanced it out. You could also tell the burger was high quality meat. The fries are shoestring, my favorite and was served with a flavored mayo that had a kick. I added some to my burger. We ordered another round of drinks and wrapped up our visit here. I really enjoy the outdoor seating, beer selection, and food quality. I will definitely return if I'm in the neighborhood.
