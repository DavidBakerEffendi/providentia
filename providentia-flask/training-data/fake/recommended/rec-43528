I went here last night because it seemed quieter than other places in the neighborhood. I wanted dinner and drinks but not club music. It was pretty average. The food was delicious. The beer selection was a bit disappointing. It was cozy. Our waitress gave us the dessert menu even though we said we didn't want dessert. Â There were sports on television. I'm not really into sports bars/restaurants, so I found that to be a turn-off. Overall, it was just okay.
