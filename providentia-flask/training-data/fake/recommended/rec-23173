We really enjoy this place. We mainly get it delivered (very fast, efficient delivery) and have been rarely disappointed. Dine-in restaurant is also efficient and friendly. Food is always fresh and flavorful and is exactly as ordered (even for a take out order). I really enjoy their brown rice and make sure I order it with every entree. Spare ribs are tasty. I always order the chicken with snow peas...always ask for spicy; it's wonderful.
