There used to be a couple of branch locations of Uncle Willie's closer to where I live that have subsequently closed due to a tough economy. Thankfully this location is still in business, and is well worth the drive. I have never had a bad meal from here, and over the years I do believe I've sampled everything their menu has to offer. Top notch barbecue that would make you swear you actually were south of the Mason-Dixon line.
