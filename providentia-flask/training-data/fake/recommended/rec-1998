Tonight was my 1st trip out of the capital city and i was so excited to go anywhere. We were headed to the big city to watch the jazz festival which was pretty tame and mellow. While we were there, we walk around everywhere to check out burlingon and finally we found this place so we got the table outside and try all of the sample for $6 and some of the beer were pretty good. I personally like the one w.the fruit in it and everything was ok. My class order the fried oyster and there were like 3 or 4 pieces for $6, crazy Finally i order the onion rings which was pretty tasty and we order a few more pints..overall it was ok Our waiter were slow but it was a ok place to go again
