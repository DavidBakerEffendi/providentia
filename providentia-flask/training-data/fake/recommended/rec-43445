The best sushi I've had, handsdown.  Better than any place I've been to in Seattle, LA, NYC, even Tokyo (although my sushi experiences here have been limited).  I loved how they had multiple types of uni, Maine would defnitely be my favorite.  The white king salmon and horse clam were also some of my faves.  If you're ever nearby and love sushi.  I mean... love sushi.  Please.. Please, don't let this oppotunity slip by.  If you're lucky enough, you'll get served by the master himself Yasuda San.  If so, be ready for a history lesson of sushi :)
