Cute place. At 7 on a Tuesday night there was no wait for a table of 2. Fun cocktail menu - I tried the spiked apple cider which was just ok but had fun choosing what to have. Brisket - wasn't really into how it was sliced, slices were on the thin side and allowed the meat to cool down too fast. The spatezel wasn't as good as I had hoped for either. I do not prefer my spatezel wet and there was quite a bit of juice on the plate which took over the flavor and also ruined the texture. This dish was not bad, but I would not recommend it. Fried chicken was absolutely delicious. Moist, salted and juicy. I'm a bit surprised there aren't more reviews mentioning the cornbread though. The cornbread was fantastic! This is definitely the dish to come here for. Spotted a few burgers being served and they looked quite good...definitely going to try that on the next visit. With the check came 2 chocolate gingerbread cookies that were also great. I aspire to bake cookies so perfectly crisp on the outside and chewy in the center. Summary: Skip the brisket. Order the fried chicken. Don't miss out on the cornbread and have a cocktail while you're at it.
