Char No. 4 is one of those classy whisky/bourbon joints. When you walk in, you get that beautiful smoky smell and the quaint glow of lights. It is so nice that you just want to kick back with your favorite glass of bourbon. There's no kicking back though because Char No. 4 is an experience. having one of their prix fixe meals with whisky pairings is quite a delicious experience. One that has to be savored and enjoyed. I love that they have so many rotating choices on their menu and they are so willing to spend time explaining the various liquor choices to the clientele that may not know the difference between the malts, distilleries, or barrels that are used in each varietal of whisky. Such a delicious experience. Go and go now.
