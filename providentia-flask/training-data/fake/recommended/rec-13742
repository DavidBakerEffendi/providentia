Thanks to a tip from Matteo, I knew I had to go here.  In fact I made a trip here (from Queens) merely one week after hearing about it.  We ordered both versions, quickly took our photos and scarfed it down!  Yes, it was everything I had hoped it would be - chunky fresh lobsters, toasty bread and just the slightest touch of butter/mayo.  I wish I could have eaten it slower to truly taste the flavor but I couldn't help it.  No worries, I'm sure I'll be back very soon.  I loved the pickle but could have done without the chips.   Oh my friend preferred the Connecticut version while I stayed true to the Maine; but honestly both tasted wonderful. Seriously, who needs to travel all the way up to Maine?
