Finally got to try the infamous Halal Cart on my trip to NYC this past week!! YAYYY!! Finding this place was as easy as finding the long lines (And it is right next to a statue)!! My friends were almost fooled by HalalGuys on the other side of the street but I knew that this place didn't even have a name - hence the name simply from its location. Anywho, got the chicken and lamb over rice. YUM. You can put as much white sauce and hot sauce and BBQ sauce as you like!! And that hot sauce is HOT. I LOVE spicy but this stuff is LETHAL. My tongue was on fire!! I loved the rice and the pita bread. They give you a really good portion for $6 and I had enough for a yummy leftover b-fast the next day. Haha. Overall, its yummy in my tummy and i am DEFINITELY coming back here next time I visit! Note: Came here again (Afternoon time) and they don't let you put on your own sauces...Boo, just ask for more sauce and stuff...I guess night time is so busy that they just leave all the sauces out for everyone to hoard around! :P
