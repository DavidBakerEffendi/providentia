When ever I am in the area...or make my way to this great find for something light and extra tasty...i make sure to go to cafe gitane.. time slows down when you are sitting outside enjoying their coffee or tea..and/or having a great slice of toast with avocado..with a hint of lemon and olive oil.. or when scarfing down on some hearty hummus... be sure to stay..enjoy the food..the staff who are very easy on the eyes and the warm environment
