Absolutely adored this place. You see, I'm a pessimist. I like to think of myself as a pragmatist, but at this point I've seen too much, so let's just go with pessimist for the sake of brevity. I'll see something good, and immediately I'll think "...alright, I'm ready for the letdown..." So I walked into this place and my expectations were low, even though I consulted my trusty Yelp and knew that others had really liked it. We weren't greeted by anyone, and just kinda sat in a nook. Some friendly patrons and the barkeep eventually told us that we had to order at the bar, and that it was CASH ONLY policy. They have an ATM on premises but the folks I was with were already annoyed (they're from California...) So we waited and played Jenga--they have a ton of games tucked away at a nice corner of the bar. Our food came out very quickly and we were all famished so we dug in... I had the grilled cheese with red pepper soup. Alex had a cheeseburger with fries and so did like two other people. Someone had onion rings. Someone else had the pulled pork. The grilled cheese was BOMB. And everyone else was mesmerized by their food--we went from a table of hooligans to a table of well mannered, hungry people in a matter of seconds. I was really pleasantly surprised. This place is bang for your buck, charming, and delicious. It appeals to everything I look for in a boyfriend....err, I mean bar. That was a bad joke. Okay, but you should still go here.
