The food is good and cheap, and the guys here are friendly. Tends to get crowded during the courthouse lunch hours and there is limited seating. This problem is compounded by people who like to camp out here even though they've long since finished eating. I stop in here from time to time when I'm working on Staten Island. Though these days, I'm limited to a chicken gyro, because most other options amount to 2 days worth of calorie intake (see my Biryani House review). All in all, not bad, but nothing to flock to either. Everything in moderation.
