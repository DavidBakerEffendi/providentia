There's nothing like walking into a place by yourself and feeling completely at ease. Barboncino's gave me this feeling last night. Generally I'm always out with friends, but I have those nights where I want to go sit at the bar by myself, order small plates, and drink fancy glasses of wine while interacting with the random bar floaters to my left and right. However, this place is ideal for groups who like to drink, eat, and be loud. Like a magnet I was pulled in here last night after their 1st happy hour but before the late night one had started. I sat at the bar and tasted a few wines before settling on a dry white, ordered an appetizer that had roasted peppers and capers on a bed of burrata which was so healthy and fresh tasting, and chatted some nonsense with other guests and ordered more wine. A few glasses later, I'm sharing a Margherita pizza with the dude to my right and shooting the shit with his two amigos at the end of the bar. The bartender, Derrek, was patient and chill, and the other employees seemed pretty mellow. Bounced before I could convince myself to go balls-deep on Fat Tuesday..still not sure why I thought I should stop. Definitely trying to make this my late-night, munchie place. Cheap happy hour lagers and well-crafted brick oven pizza.
