Um holy wow! Sooo good!!! Definitely share so you can try as much as possible.  We had the hummus, squid, Fawn-tons, Chicken and Waffles and duck breast.  The hummus is probably one of the best we have had before.  The squid was fresh.  The Fawn-tons were really good too (but not my boyfriends favorite).  The Chicken and Woffals were SO GOOD - i never order that sort of thing but it was so worth it.  The duck was good but I wish I tried the fish and chips instead.  Happy eating!!
