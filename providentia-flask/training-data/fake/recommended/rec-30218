What a great experience. Staff were friendly and helpful and couldn't do enough to help. Menu was very good, and we really enjoyed our meal. The waitress even gave us some fizz to help us celebrate with! I thoroughly recommend this place, and have told friends who are about to visit the big apple to consider a visit.
