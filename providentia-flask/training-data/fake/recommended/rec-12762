I loved that there was a variety of hand pulled noodles to choose from.  I never had so many options.  Usually you just get the regular size ones or knife peeled and pick your toppings.  Luckily I came with a friend, so I was able to try different ways it can be prepared.  I decided to try the fat and wide hand pulled noddles with dumplings and wonton.  I liked the wide ones better with noodle soup.  I think that the fat ones would be better as a stir fry.  I also liked the dumplings better than the wonton.   They should really install a window or cut out an opening in the wall, so you can see the noodles being made.  When I first heard banging, I was a bit startled and then I realized they were just freshly making my noodles.  I had to really lean over, where I was sitting, to see the noodles being made. I will definitely return and try other noodle options.  Great, cheap, hole-in-the-wall spot.  Oh and bring a friend so you can try different options.
