tried again. they have switched their "restaurant" location.... it's actually right across from the take out section which is interesting in and of itself, because they just walk over and get everything from the takeout side. hmmm... the buffet was ok. it had great potential, but it was just ok. even if onions, garlic and mushrooms aren't used, so many other spices can add texture and depth to seasoning the food or one runs the risk of bland food... the food on the buffet was bordering on bland, as is their customer service.... i enjoyed the firmness of a tofu dish but the seitan was soft.... the butternut squash soup had great potential, but it was like, at the top of the peak needing a little something to push it over the edge... hmmmm... peace & spice
