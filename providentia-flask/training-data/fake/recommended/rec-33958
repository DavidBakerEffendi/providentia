I'll preface this by saying that DoD is not for everyone. I wouldn't bring kids or uptight people because there is a healthy dose of OG rap that plays there uncensored - which I grew up on - so that's legit. This place embodies the new Brooklyn, it's unpredictable, unconventional and a mixed bag - in a great way. It mixes exotic ingredients with the basics, clashes cultures, mashes up the classics... It's refreshing. More importantly - IT WORKS. The decor is quirky, service is friendly and prices are reasonable - but I don't go to restaurants for a bargain, a friend and a fun place to sit. The FOOD is off the charts. I started with the squid and the Nippon nachos. Whoever put dumplings in place of chips in a nacho supreme was a genius. The squid was cooked so well, perfectly firm and not chewy, the dipping sauce spicy and bold (and presented beautifully). We went with the chicken and waffles and the flank steak next. Chicken had a lovely crisp skin, nice combo of sweet maple and salty. The waffle creates a fluffy texture. Flank was a gorgeous medium rare and I liked the sauce quite a bit. The veg were tasty and I loved the yuzu, which I've never had before. We split a snicker bar after - which seems dumb at first, but they ARE tasty and honestly what'd they charge $1 more than you'd get in the deli? I think that $1 might be worth it rather than walking the streets in bed stuy at night, don't you agree? Overall I really enjoyed my experience and can tell the chefs are truly talented and passionate (and timely, food didn't take too long at all). Definitely going back.
