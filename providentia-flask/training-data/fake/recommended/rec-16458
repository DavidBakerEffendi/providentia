Went for a group lunch on a weekday and it was great. Among a group of 5 we shared two large pizzas and two appetizers, we each got a soda and the bill came out to a bit over $100. Gratuity automatically included. Pizza is delicious and decor is cute. We didn't try the pasta but I plan to next time.
