Heard so much talk about this place being a great post bar food spot when I moved to area. Place was the definition of a health code violation the second we walked in and confirmed when the guy handling cash touched food without gloves. Food itself was bland, place is only in business because there's nowhere else like it in area. Won't return, disgusting.
