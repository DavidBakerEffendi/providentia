Came here Monday for early dinner because there was no wait. I realize now it's because they are more popular for brunch. But either way I love their menu. Tried their hummus and falafel. Both were so delicious. Their appetizer, watermelon salad was also perfect. Especially for the hot weather. Their service was really nice. Our waiter was extremely kind and patient despite how picky I was with my food. Also outdoor seating is a must. I think it gives off a different experience than eating in the restaurant
