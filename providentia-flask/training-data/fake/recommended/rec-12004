I know there are plenty of haters out there but I'm pretty fond of Ssam Bar. I've now done a dinner here and the bo ssam, and it's my favorite of his restaurants, except Ko which I don't have the patience to try reserving. I am obsessed with their uni appetizer - extremely fresh Santa Barbara uni sitting in a delicious green broth that was tangy and rich at the same time. I think they change the uni dish often so maybe I'll never get to have it again. The beef tendon was a bit disappointing - but then this dish is prepared so differently everywhere and I like it a very specific way (if only they didnt take it off the gu-shine menu!) The hamachi was good but not particularly memorable, and the same goes for the steak. The pork buns are always good. I have to say the bo ssam is a LOT of food for a fairly reasonable price - $200 easily feeds at least 10 people, more if you have some dainty eaters in the bunch. The pork is falling-apart tender, but also a bit underseasoned and greasy (as expected). However, since you're supposed to eat it with all of the extras I guess it's better that way. We also got the seasonal pickles platter which was surprisingly good (I'm not a huge fan in general). I didn't realize it would include so many veggies and asian pear as well. So I'd definitely come back here for a la carte..but order a little more carefully. Once was enough for bo ssam, glad I finally tried it but not something I need to go back for. Â Service here was fine - nothing special but no problems either.
