Had lunch at Carmine's.  We had a Caesar salad, sausage and linguine and shrimp scampi served family style for a party of five.  The portions where huge.  We were able to finish the salad and shrimp and most of the pasta.  Pasta was cooked perfect and coincidently came with 5 pieces of sausage.  I would suggest this place.
