Dimsum sampler was pretty good. Presentation js not their forte, but hey, as long as the food is good. I want to try getting a whole plate of dimsum next time I go. I also ordered tomyum soup and spicy combination soup. Spicy combination soup was disappointing, but tomyum was ok. Soup base was good, but chicken pieces in the soup were too fibrousy and not well seasoned. I am going to try curry soup next time.
