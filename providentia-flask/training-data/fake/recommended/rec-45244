Just discovered the place this weekend and was super excited to spread the word (came back the next day for my frappe and brought another friend)! Their selection of coffees and crepes is plausible! We  had a Chicken Fajita panini, Turkey & Sundried tomatoes panini, Nutella & Banana Crepe, Capuccino, and of course Frappe!!   (2 thumbs up!) The server is very attentive, always smiling but not over-doing it. Saturday evening, we had a table outside and the next day inside. Both spots were great, the atmosphere is very relaxing, classy, European style cafe, exactly what the area has been missing. The interior look sharp, modern, with today's hit music playing in the background. Would strongly disagree with a review below comparing this place to Eclectic in Montclair, it's not even comparable (Eclectic is very outdated, old, with torn couches, inattentive service, poor coffee and  food selections).   Kafe Neo definitely saves me a trip to the city.
