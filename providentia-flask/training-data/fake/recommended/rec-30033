Would probably give 4 1/2 stars if I could, but this Princeton staple was very, very good. Restaurant has a cool classic feel to it with towering ceilings and interior brickwork. Stays very busy, but you don't feel on top of other tables or rushed through your meal. The oysters were fresh and served with a homemade garlicky sauce. Clams and garlic in spicy red sauce was just right. You pay a premium for the seafood, but you get what you pay for and they don't gouge you on the drinks and desert.
