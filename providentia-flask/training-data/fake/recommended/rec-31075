I wanted to like this place more - but there were just too many misses when we went there last Saturday night. Hit - got a great table outside, the wait was less than the hostess had told us. My burger was good - I ordered it medium-rare and got it medium, but otherwise not a problem. Misses - brought the wrong burger to one of the people at our table, we were almost done our food before his corrected burger arrived. The cheddar short rib fries were lukewarm and really not that impressive.  I found them bland and boring.   There was no salt and pepper on the table and I know that Garces is an Iron Chef and all that... but I like to be able to salt my burgers and fries. I would try this again, I think it has potential - but the service was average, the food hit and miss, and quite expensive.
