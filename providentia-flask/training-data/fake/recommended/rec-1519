It was a cheesy night (pun intended); it was a night filled of cheese but it was also a long overdue reunion of my flatmates from studying abroad. And what brings people together better than cheese and wine? We started with the Beecher Cheese Plate and added on two meats for our sharing starter. Each cheese and meat came with another element, just little taste to emphasize the flavors. The salty prosciutto came with sweet figs while the other cured meat came with green green Castelvetrano olives. The cheeses were less memorable to me-- one was sharper, one was smokier while the last selection was mild enough. To share we got two of the Cellar's Mac and Cheeses. The first baked mac and cheese was littered with kale and spicy peppers bringing earthy green elements and a juicy intense heat. The other elevated the childhood favorite with meaty pork belly and tickles of soft fennel. The meat was delicious and cut some of the sharpness, but did not alleviate the grainy texture of the cheese present in both versions. We also had a lovely light salad with pretty nectarines and creamy soft moments of burrata. The cheese was so smooth and moist it was practically spreadable, impeccably countering the crunch of the fruit. The subtle strand of basil added a savory note, which complemented the drizzle of olive oil, but at the same time brought out the freshness of the stone fruit and the kind of organic nature of the cheese. The toast points, however, were too crunchy to be enjoyable with the other parts of the salad. The cellar space is super dark and trendy, but also at the time warm and quite noisy. The subterranean eatery exudes intimacy, a place for sweet rendezvous or group gatherings, though the noise level and overall tightness could present a problem. The staff is knowledgeable and descriptive, while the menu of sharing plates and lighter bites stem from the cheeses made in house. I wonder what the heartier mains have to offer, or if it's just a cheesy kind of spot.
