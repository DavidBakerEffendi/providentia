First thing first- the food was amazing. Â Unfortunately the service out ways the quality of the food. The guy who seems to be the owner was more concerned with playing DJ. He took requests of songs from a select group of customers and blasted the music so loud that it was inaudible to listen to my own conversation. The wait staff were not attentive enough to refill our water and did not notice our empty glasses until dessert arrived. It dampened our meal. Next time I go, I'll order takeout.
