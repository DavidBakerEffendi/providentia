My experiences at Osteria have truly been worthy of five stars but I don't feel right doling out the last one as my perspective is skewed. A relative of mine worked at Osteria and my family was treated like royalty whenever we came here. As a result, I feel that it is only right to withhold a star until I'm able to return and dine without the perks. I have probably tried between 15-20 different wines from the list and every single glass I have had was thoroughly enjoyable at a bare minimum. I feel confident saying that Osteria has one of the best wine lists in the area. The sommelier, bartenders, and servers are very knowledgable and, if you prefer to rely upon their expertise, can match up a great wine with your food. Although I think all of their offerings are excellent, it is the pizza that I crave whenever I think about this restaurant. Marc Vetri has done a commendable job at using it as a vehicle for upscale food. The best meal I had here was when I went with a large group and we ordered nearly every pizza on the menu. I highly recommend this approach.
