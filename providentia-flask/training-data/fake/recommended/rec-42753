BEST first impression of Philadelphia food and hospitality and Tommy DiNic's! After a red eye flight from the West coast, I was  eager to get out to the city.  Reading Terminal Market and Tommy DiNic's were first on the list, but Lorrie M. and I had to practice delayed gratification because that line...at 1pm on a Friday...was FIFTY minutes long! But there is a damn good sandwich ahead and it is worth waiting for. When we got to the counter to order, we simply couldn't decide!  Roast pork...beef?  All sound great.  So we requested that we get a half pork, half beef sandwich with spinach and peppers.  The man at the counter suggested that we try the broccoli rabe and the sharp provolone too.  Well, okay  ^^  We went for ALL the toppings in one super sandwich. This was simply a life changing sandwich.  Both the juicy meat choices were sliced perfectly.  The peppers, broccoli rabe, and spinach, while not my traditional sandwich toppings, balanced the flavors surprisingly well (pssh no place for tomato and lettuce)!  :)  Finally, the sharp provolone, adds a welcomed contrast to the meats and veggies.  This was no ordinary "melty cheese."  Sharp provolone kept it classy, purposeful, and held the sandwich together! Side story:  Since our sandwich was fairly complicated, upon initial sandwich unwrapping, we received the wrong order -- 1/2 pork, 1/2 beef no toppings.  I went back to request the toppings, but before I could ask or break my confusion, the staff pushed a whole new sandwich in my hand!  We wound up with two huge DiNic's sandwiches!   The owner is seriously sweet though!  What a charming family run business with some of the best sandwiches and a warm welcome to Philly. Just a quick tip: pass the time in line and stave off your hunger by grabbing small bites from other vendors.
