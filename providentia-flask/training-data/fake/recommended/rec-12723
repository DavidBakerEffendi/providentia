Read about this restaurant in L.A. newspaper, so took my son there - a major pancake fan - on recent trip to NY.   There is a wait, but food is very good.  Even fried green tomatoes!  Anyway, pancakes are large ($15.00 for 3!) and with them you get a very tiny cup of maple/butter syrup (delicious).  However if you'd like a bit more, not uncommon when eating pancakes, you will be charged $2.00!   When the waitress said this I wasn't sure I'd heard right.  Really?  Even the couple next to us (who overheard) looked taken aback.   Gave the 4 stars for the food, but the syrup deal tainted the experience.  The little things do count.
