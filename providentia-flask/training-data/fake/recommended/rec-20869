Just another 53rd and 6th review for the masses to read. I like this place because it is cheap and filling. I mean for the size that they give you, it nothing to complain about. The food quality may not be as great, but HEY its a food cart on the side of the street not a sit down restaurant. I give this 5 stars because of the classic nostalgia of tradition that I have made. Which is pilgrimages to the cart when ever either I or my friends are not sober. The food is best enjoyed at the night time and when the person is so called "not sober." Other than that, try not to eat to fast your you will FEEL LIKE A PLATTER! trust me on this, after eating so much, you will understand when you finish one platter in one sitting!
