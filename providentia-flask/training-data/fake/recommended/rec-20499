Updating my review tonight after a most excellent pie on my latest trip from california back to my native town of bloomfield. Hats off to the folks at Vinnies even though I know that Vinnie is not the name of this great entrepreneur. I was just a kid when I first tasted this pie nearly 40 years ago as a paper boy who lived at 5 bay ave just down the street from the original Vinnies location. I watched as this fine pizza company blossomed into a powerhouse of flavor and I am so happy that they have enjoyed their present Broad street location for many decades now. If I still lived in Bloomfield I would weight 500 pounds and I would own this joint.
