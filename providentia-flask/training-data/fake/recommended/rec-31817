Hmm, Melograno, finally I've got around to visiting your new location.  Shows my laziness that a restaurant I went to all the time when it was two blocks away has managed to be avoided for over a year because its now 6 blocks away! The new setup is nice.  It is quite a lot bigger than the previous place and has lost some of the cosy feel because of that. We arrived and were seated promptly on a Tuesday night.  However, we were then left to sit for 10 minutes with only iced water and unopened bottles of wine after the serving staff completely forgot us.  It took a couple of prods to finally get things moving.  After that, service was quick and friendly.  Staff don't seem quite as on the ball as at the old place. Food wise.  I started with the Sardine special which was top notch.  My girlfriend had the Herring fries which were also excellent.  Lightly battered and with a nice aioli dipping sauce. For the main I went with the Pork tenderloin and Pork belly kebab.  The tenderloin was fine but it didn't stand a chance next to the exquisite belly.  This was extremely well done.  A friend went with the saddle of Rabbit, which sadly whilst tasty, was far too salty and didn't allow the rabbit to shine. In conclusion, the food at Melograno is as good as it was.  It's nice to see that they have finally mixed up the menu a little as well.  Hopefully this will continue.  Service definitely needs a little work though.
