Lately, Cedar Park has seen a little boom in economy. Vietnam Cafe came in around the same time Dock Street and Wake Up Yoga came about. Unlike Dock Street, I don't see myself getting sick of this place. It's owned and operated by the same family that runs the beloved Fu-Wah right next door and the food is out of control good. I went in two days ago for the first time since their grand opening and my belly was happy. We started out with grilled shrimp, then the pork claypot which is amazing. Also, the vermicelli special, which has every kind of meat ever. All for under $40. As we ate, all we could murmer was, we are so glad this place is here.
