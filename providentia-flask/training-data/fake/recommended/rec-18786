Best wine bar on the upper west side! Nice waitstaff, extremely yummy food especially the inexpensive and large flat breads (love the mushroom one). Can ask for a small taste before ordering most wines and beers. Good for meeting my girls after work for a drink and also good for a date if you are not a very loud talker as you may need to share a communal table though there are many 2 person tables as well.
