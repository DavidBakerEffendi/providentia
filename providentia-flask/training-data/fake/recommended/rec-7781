I don't usually like sandwiches. Remind me of floatation devices. All that bread. My friend convinced me to go. Very low expectations. Thought I might have to fight a foccacia or something. Or a sub. I had the Panelle for four dollars and a little boat of fried potatoes with cheese on it. Rich chickpeas, potatoes, banana peppers, no bulky bread; instead, something crusty and subtle. I had a bite of my friend's lamb sandwich -- I think it might have had...figs? on it. Lord in heaven. I have not enjoyed a sandwich as much since I had a lamb gyro at a street stand in the south of France in 1994. Not exaggerating. Hard to believe you can walk in and buy one of these sandwiches almost any day of the known universe. Do it. Massive five stars.
