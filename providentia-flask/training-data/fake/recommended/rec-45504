Best thai food ever. Authentic and delicious. The thai iced tea.. Mmm... and the green curry is sooo spicy i can hardly eat it but i cant put down my spoon cuz the spices in it taste so good.  Even the thai fried rice, pad thai are above average.  There is usually a wait here though so its best to go early. I believe they DONT take reservations but its well worth the wait. It used to be a tiny hole i the wall but its popularity has elicited an expansion and thank goodness for that (or else ill never get a seat) Its not huge but it can accomodate a group of 10 or so.  Yea go here its good stuff.
