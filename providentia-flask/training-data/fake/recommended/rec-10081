I just found this place after noticing their sign outside. At first I could not find it despite the sign because the actual place is inside the lobby of the office building at the address. Head on in to the deli where it's like you stepped into some family's kitchen. I had a platter with rice, steamed veg and HALF A BBQ CHICKEN! and a can soda for $8+tax The chicken was juicy and tender and the sauce had a slight kick to it, it was delicious! The best lunch I've ever had in this area. I'm definitely coming back!
