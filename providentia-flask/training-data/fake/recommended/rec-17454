This place honestly is not my cup of tea. I've had Ecuadorian food but not like this. First of all, the place is in a sketchy neighborhood infamous for carjackings, robberies, and assaults. So be wary if you choose to park your car... anywhere. Secondly, the ambience of the restaurant is OK. It's the most they can do with Ecuadorian fare I guess. But ambience doesn't really bother me because it doesn't compare to the food. The food is really nothing to be amazed or wowed at. Actually not at all. I was not suffering from any kind of sickness or allergy, and found the food to be incredibly bland and badly seasoned. It grossed me out so much I attempted to eat the rice and couldn't even take one more bite before I lost my appetite. That day, there seemed to be flies buzzing about, and THEY didn't even touch me food. (hmm, what could that possibly mean?) Anywho, to each his own. I will not be returning to this restaurant ever again and don't say I didn't warn you.
