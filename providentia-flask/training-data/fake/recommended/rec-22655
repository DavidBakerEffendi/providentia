I stopped in once on a Friday night for a beer with a friend. Their beer selection is to notch.  Comparatively though,  it was a bit pricey.   Other area bars charge about eight dollars for a pint.  They charged the same price for a twelve ounce plastic cup.  Which brings me to my second issue,  craft beer in a plastic cup? Strange combination...
