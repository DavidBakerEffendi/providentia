Will never go back here. Ordered a tossed salad and told them I was on a gluten free diet. My salad came with cured meat and cheese (both hidden sources of gluten not to mention I am allergic to pork). When would you think a tossed salad has meat in it? Service was really bad (she got mad that I wanted another salad) and a very small tossed salad with salmon is not worth $13. It is worth going if you need your colon cleansed before a colonoscopy.
