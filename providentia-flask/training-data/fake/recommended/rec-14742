I've been here twice and the food is pretty good! The pork ribs and the chicken barbecue are awesome! The beef short ribs, not so much, they were not awful, just really dry. Their French fries are really delicious and so are the beans. The service is very friendly but can be really slow for the delivery and in the restaurant, but the barbecue is made to order, so I would rather wait for good food then have not good food fast. On a busy night like Sunday, I recommend picking up your food instead of having it delivered, it's much faster.
