Only beer & wine served here, no hard stuff. Our server was VERY pushy. We ordered beers and wanted to talk and catch up. Waitress came over every 2 minutes to take food order. She had no personality, made our meal unpleasant. We told her it was a special birthday, she didn't say or do anything. Our food was just ok. The squid (appetizer) did not taste fresh. Very noisy room.
