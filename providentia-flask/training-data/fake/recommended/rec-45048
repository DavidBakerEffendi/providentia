I went with a small group to The Smith for dinner.  It was a cold and blustery Friday night.  Our reservations were for 8pm, and we were seated promptly.  The restaurant and bar were hopping and full of energy.  We ordered apps, wine, cocktails and entrees.  By all accounts, everything was excellent.  I ordered the hangar steak - the portion was good and the steak was tender and delicious.  I also would recommend the champagne cocktails - they're fantastic.   And.... a couple items of note: - The Smith is great for 2 - 4 people or larger groups.   - The dining room can be loud and bustling. - Downstairs (by the restrooms) there is a photobooth. - The brunch is said to be phenomenal (I have yet to try it). - The portions are generally quite generous. - Not great for a romantic dinner.
