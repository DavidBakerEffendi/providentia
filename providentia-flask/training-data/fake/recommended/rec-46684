Good environment. 5-6 seats at the bar.   I waited for my friend awhile at the bar and ordered the chicken lettuce wraps which were quite delicious.  Then when we sat, I got the PCU noodles w/ chicken (basically Pad See Ew w/ the smaller noodles like pad thai noodles).  It was delicious.  I get Pad See Ew everywhere I go and this is probably top 3 that I've had, and I've had A LOT!   The best part about this place! is the make-your-own Thai Iced Tea.  I love Thai Iced Tea and also get it everywhere i go.  This is the first place that I've been to that gives you all 3-4 ingredients separately and then you pour it into the glass and mix yourself.  Usually it's all in the glass and you just mix.  I'll go back just for that experience.
