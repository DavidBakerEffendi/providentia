Absolutely loved the location, atmosphere, wait staff, everything here! Everything that my friend andI had was fresh and delicious and I had zero complaints. We started with the beef carpaccio and cavatelli as appetizers. Both were FANTASTIC. The beef carpaccio had french fries and onions and ugh everything about it was just awesome. I would absolutely recommend this dish, it's just so good. My friend wanted to try to cavatelli which I wasn't sure about ordering, but I'm really glad we did. The pasta was cooked perfectly the proscuitto was just salty enough and again, just perfect. We shared the short rib as an entree and it was served on a bed of cheese fondue. When we cut into the short rib it was so tender and just fell apart, as it should have! Basically, there wasn't a piece of short rib left on that plate. For the sides we ordered the old bay fries and the brussel sprouts. ABSOLUTELY get the brussel sprouts. They're cooked with bacon and nuts and apples. I didn't think any of these flavors would mend together, but oh they did. The fries were crispy and i'm just a huge fan of old bay seasoning in general. Wish we had enough room for dessert but we were so stuffed from everything else! I am definitely going back here. Perfect place for dinner in West Village.
