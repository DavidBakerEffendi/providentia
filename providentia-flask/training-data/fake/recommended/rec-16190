I took my girlfriend here for V-day (sorry ladies) and was anticipating this 25 rated zagat restaurant. I ordered the goat cheese gnocchi and she ordered the blood-orange salad for apps. They were amazing! The gnocchi was the best I have ever had in my life. For the entree, I ordered the Duck and she got the sirloin steak. The duck was good, but the sirloin was cooked well instead of medium as asked. Now, the service took forever and our server gave us an attitude for not ordering a dessert. He just stood there and paused in disgust that we were not ordering one (we are health nuts). It was a very uncomfortable moment. All in all, I loved the atmosphere and the apps were to die for. Great place if they get the service down right.
