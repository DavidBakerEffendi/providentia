Love Barcelona! Food and service are always great! I would recommend making reservations or getting there early as it does get busy. We always order (tapas) the calamari, beef and chicken empanadas, and the patatas bravas. Love the portion sizes, as you are able to try many different foods on the menu without stuffing yourself to the brim.
