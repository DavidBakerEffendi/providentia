Had one of the best, if not the best, eggs benedict ever today at Rabbithole (is that the best name for a restaurant?).  Perfect combination of savory muffin (better than English muffin), spicy bacon (not Canadian bacon which surprisingly I did not miss), and eggs.  The roasted rosemary potatoes were outstanding.  All this for $9.  I will definitely return for this dish again, and bring some of my friends.
