Okay. Let's just say I live in MA and would drive 5 hours to VT just for the Red Onion Sandwich. It's huge and you can split it with a friend. People are grossed out hearing it has green apples on it, but they are sliced so paper thin and compliment the rest of the ingredients. I get mine on sourdough bread. Very small place though, but I always get a seat regardless.
