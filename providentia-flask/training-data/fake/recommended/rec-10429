Solid. Went for brunch, was super pleased to be handed my own little plate upon arrival with a nice little slice of walnut raisin bread and a perfect pat of butter. It was just enough, and it was that "good bread" - I mean, not fake good in the scare quotes - but like, REALLY REALLY good. A nice touch. I actually hate feta and cucumbers and olives and was merely appeasing the whims of my bestie when she sugges(tie) --(HA) -- here... She lives around the corner and lives for it here, at Meme. The sunny window seat thing had me sold. So Melissa and I strolled, all the way from where we were, to where the Mediterranean is at... Anyways! I got a normal entree - eggs benedict and added smoked salmon. Delicious! Perfectly poached bursting with yolk eggs. Slightly lemon-y, lighter than average hollandaise. Nicely done, not too sinful or heavy. Perfect amount of potatoes on the side, and nice chunky bits of green and red pepper to boot. All very gourmet, and at prices that aren't too explosive given the chi chi-ness of this particular HOOD. Orange juice was aaaaahhhhmaaaaayyyyziiiiiiing. Fresh squeezed....And $5. Which is a lot. (Take Note - I don't think that damn price was on the menu). Total contradiction of sorts - I'm all: It's not too expensive! Yet it is! But, you know what I mean. Anyways this place is pretty good. I'm likely to get (happily) dragged there again.
