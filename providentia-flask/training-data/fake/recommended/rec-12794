I really like their Hokke Teishoku. Definitely can make you full with good portion of side dishes (pumpkins and steamed egg) and right-grilled fish (with rice, of course). You will definitely leave the place with satisfaction. The dessert was just so so, though (we ordered Crepes with Green Tea Ice Cream and Red Beans inside), largely because the crepes were very dry.
