the best crepes in town are located on the temple campus. try the chicken cordon, the nutella/strawberry, the berries boston. really you cant go wrong with anything there. prices are more than reasonable. the service is quick. food truck is clean. i wish i still went to temple. i think i kept this place in business when it first opened there. thumbs up!
