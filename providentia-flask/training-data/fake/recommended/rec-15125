Still a fan of this intimate little wine bar. There is probably better food to be had in Philadelphia, but if you are looking for a casual intimate spot to relax and enjoy some wine, this is the place. They offer over 60 different wines by the glass! We enjoyed excellent service from the bartending staff. We were offered tastes of the wines prior to committing to a glass. Excellent experience at the bar! I was not a fan of the French Onion Soup - the broth was not as hearty as I expected. However, my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the calamari and flank steak. The calamari delivered small, tender tempura fried rings which were served with a smoked tomato truffle aioli. My husband was not a fan of the aioli, but enjoyed the calamari with just an extra bit of lemon. I, on the other hand, found the aioli flavorful with my only complaint being it was so thick the breading was pulled off the calamari. The flank steak was flavorful, cooked perfectly to order and I loved that it was served with fingerling potatoes (which were delicious by the way). The kitchen is open until midnight every night, but Vintage does not open until 4 during the week and 2 on the weekends so if you are planning on a quick midday stop for a glass of wine and cheese or charcuterie, this is not the place. Still one of my favorite stops in Philadelphia.
