This place sat in my bookmarks forever, I drooled over the pictures and reviews, finally my turn came last week for me to find out if all the hype was real. I walked in and I was the only customer, like they were waiting just for me! I knew I was in heaven because there were 2 bottles of Sriracha (my favorite condiment) on each table. I placed my order quickly "taste of maine please" they were in the middle of shift change but still polite. Few minutes later my order was up, the rolls looked way smaller than all the pictures, I knew it was a half but it looked like a 1/4. I was still excited, I tried the lobster first, good but could have used a bit more seasoning, the crab was perfect & the shrimp too. I do think it's a tad pricey but they are definitely giving out quality ingredients no fillers just fresh seafood. I'd come back for a crab roll!
