This 1 start review is solely based on the delivery and customer service experience I just had with this place. Their food is really good so I would suggest going to another of their locations and check it out. I placed an order on their website which said it would take about 45 minutes to deliver. After I waited 1.5 hours I called them to see what was going on. They put me on hold a couple of times to look into it and let me know I should get my food in 8-10 minutes. After another half hour I called again and after talking to 3 people, being put on hold for large periods of time, my order was nowhere to be found. The whole thing lasted 2.5 hours and was extremely frustrating. I am not planning to order from this place ever again.
