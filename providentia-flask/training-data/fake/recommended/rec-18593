Great restaurant. Good for breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, late night, or just stopping in for a drink and a snack. Pretty much all of the food is outrageously good. They make just about everything in house (cured meats, juices, sodas, bread, etc.) and buy all local, organic, free-range ingredients. Prices are about what you'd expect for the area. I personally like it for late night after going out, as it's open 24 hours, but worth checking out any time of the day.
