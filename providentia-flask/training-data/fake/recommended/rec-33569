Came by for brunch on a Sunday morning right when they opened. I'll review food and service separately. I ordered the Royal Eggs, with bacon. They were absolutely amazing, I generally am not a runny yolk person but these would be my exception. They came with toast, great combination. I opted to add bacon, which was a great choice. Bacon was perfectly cooked, crisp but not overdone. I don't even think this is the best brunch dish on the menu, i.e. It gets even BETTER. I will be back. Now, service. They have 5 star food, but 3 star service. We arrived right as the restaurant opened and were having a leisurely brunch, as it should be. The server came over within 3 minutes of us sitting down and asked if we were ready to order. Asked for a minute. Server came back every 3-5 minutes and was a bit pestering. Restaurant was still half empty, I wasn't sure what the hurry was and I don't enjoy being rushed. Ordered, asked to add bacon to my Royal Eggs. Got a massive plate of bacon that was just ridiculous for one person. I thought, no way $1 gets me this much bacon. I was right. Server added a full side of bacon. Not a big deal, just annoying. If I wanted a pound of bacon, I would ask for it. Lastly, asked to split the check between two cards and server put the wrong amount on the cards... Not sure if maybe it was an off day, or server was new, etc. I'll be back but will request another person. Would definitely recommend. Great place for brunch and I'm excited to go back and try their dinner.
