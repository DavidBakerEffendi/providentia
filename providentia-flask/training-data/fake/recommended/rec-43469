Steven Starr really put his focus on experience to good use here.  This is one of the best places in the city to loosen up with friends.  The food is delicious (though the menu is a little limited), the beer list is good and, most importantly, it's a naturally fun environment.  The outdoor seating (complete with enough fire pits that, even on the coldest winter days, you don't mind sitting outside, the jenga blocks on the tables, the ping pong, both inside and outside, and even the flow of traffic which makes you naturally get up and circle around, gives the place a fun, laid back atmosphere. Another nice factor about Frankford Hall is that it strikes a nice balance between being laid back and sufficiently classy that you won't feel awkward if you go there on a date, with a work friend, etc. If you're looking for a fun place to have a few beers (and maybe an excellent sausage), this is the place.
