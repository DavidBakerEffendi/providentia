Best Thai food this side of the pacific and the best I've had outside of Thailand.    We've been going here for years and have never been disappointed.  The food is delicious, it's one of the few restaurants that will actually prepare a spicy meal on request, and it's a BYO, what else do you need?  Just be warned, even their "mild" dishes are fairly spicy and their "Thai spicy" is the spiciest food I've ever had at a restaurant in this country. The restaurant is a very casual dine-in restaurant with prompt service and a relaxed atmosphere.   My only regret is that I finished my meal and now have to sit by as my wife enjoys her amazing leftovers.
