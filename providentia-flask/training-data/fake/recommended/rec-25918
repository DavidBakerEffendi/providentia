Well maybe I shouldn't have announced to the table next to us that the guy's balls were huge, but really, they were enormous. His meatballs could have fed five people.. each. I got the lobster cannelloni due to all the raves here on yelp, and believe me, it was amazing, but everything else was incredible too. He got veal marsala, perhaps the best I'd ever tasted, and we started off with baked clams. Add a bottle of wine to the mix and it was the best meal I'd had in a very long time. The only mistake I made was not telling the waiter that it was his birthday because before we knew it another couple stole the spotlight. They turned down the lights and a dramatic rendition of "happy birthday" started playing as a candle lit cake was brought out to the couple. You snooze you lose I guess.
