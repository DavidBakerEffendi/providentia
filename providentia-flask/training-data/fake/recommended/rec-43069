I only came here for drinks, but immediately fell in love with this place. The decor is cool and makes for great ambiance. Their food looked good, from what I could spy, but their mojitos were AMAZING! They had multiple kinds with so many fresh ingredients- my favorite was the mandarin orange mojito. I can't wait to go back to try the food... and more mojitos!
