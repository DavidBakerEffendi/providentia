I passed by what used to be Je & Jo on the way to Sullivan Street Bakery. What stood in place is a small coffee bar named The Jolly Goat that carries Sumptown Coffee. My first thought: YES!! I don't have to settle for bodega coffee anymore! It was too late to get caffeinated, though, but I still popped in to take a look. The space remained the same - cozy, clean, no seating space except a few seats at the window. It was then I discovered they also carry Melt Bakery ice cream sandwiches (no more traveling to LES for those) and Blue Marble ice cream, which is perfect for this sweltering hot weather. I'm a fan! Welcome to the neighborhood and thank you for providing is with good coffee and quality ice cream!
