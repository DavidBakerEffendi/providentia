it's awesome and cheap, and very lively inside. we split the tom yum koong soup (perfectly balanced between sweet and spicy), the green curry with beef (outstanding, i wish i could drink the sauce) and the glass noodles with shrimp (very good but nothing to go crazy over). i will definitely be making the trek over there to try more!
