Disappointment at best... both service & food were sub par. Service: slow waitstaff, confused about who was our waitress because many people came to our table, they didn't refill our water glasses or chips, waitress brought out wrong food and on top of that it was cold. Food: We ordered the traditional guacamole which was the highlight of our meal. Along with this we also ordered the chicharrones (crispy pork skin) which was incredibly hard to even bite into, it tasted stale and my friend couldn't even take a bite it was that hard... we sent those back to the kitchen and they took it off our bill. The time in between the appetizer and our mains (we ordered taco) was ridiculously long. I don't mind waiting in a restaurant for food, but when it comes out less than lukewarm and tastes like it was cooked the day before I get upset. We had the chicken, pork, fish, and shrimp tacos which were all unmemorable. Overall the staff looked confused and were not prepared, good idea for a restaurant but the menu was not executed well. I feel bad because it's the opening week, hopefully the staff are able to sort out these issues.
