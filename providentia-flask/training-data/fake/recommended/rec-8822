I've eaten here a couple of times and have been fairly disappointed by the noodles -- don't get me wrong, they're fairly tasty but they just aren't that great and certainly don't live up to the hype. Pan fried is better than in soup but neither is incredibly delicious. Place is divey but the waitresses are friendly. For some truly good noodles, go to Xi'an Famous Foods instead.
