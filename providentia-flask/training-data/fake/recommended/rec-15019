Had dinner here last night with 5 of my friends. A few people in our group had been before, with mixed reviews (2 said it was fabulous, 2 said it was okay). My dinner was delicious. I started with the grape leaves, which are served cold--absolutely perfect after a hot day. I moved on to the special red snapper entree, which was grilled and served with the a tomato avocado relish. It was amazing! Other folks in the group started with the wild mushroom bisque, which they claimed was a bit too thick..more like a sauce then a bisque. Â Two people had the avocado and tomato salad which, by all reports, was fabulous. Entrees had by others included lamb chops and the roasted chicken. All reports were that the food was really good. The waitress wasn't perfect but very nice, and that kind of thing doesn't bother me. All in all, I think Aksum is a great addition to our neighborhood. Looking forward to returning with my husband!
