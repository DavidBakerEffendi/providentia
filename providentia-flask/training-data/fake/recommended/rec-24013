Meh? I am trying to like this place, especially after building up to my husband about how much better east coast pizza is than west coast pizza, but Luigi's didn't really do it for me.  It was a-ok, as pizza often is, but nothing to write home about. The sausage was ground and had a weird flavor. The cheese clumped together and was oily in kind of a bad way and not that oh-yes-yum way. On a side note, I am also somewhat perplexed by their marketing. The "fresca jester" freaks me out a little bit w/ that mask and the side of the box says "home cooking cost more... we know." Maybe I am just missing it but what does that mean?  Are they saying to buy their pizza instead of cooking at home? Or their pizza costs more because it's home cooked? I'm not trying to be a nut - I am actually confused, but I guess that's neither here nor there.
