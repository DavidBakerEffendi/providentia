So apparently this is the famous one. Though I got confused at first because there is another hand drawn noodle shop by a similar name in Philly China town. Good beef noodle soup, good noodles, can't complain. I don't know why, but it just doesn't give me the happy feeling the other hand drawn noodle shop does. Maybe because I visited there first? Honestly, I prefer the other one for its unlimited pickled veggies, and more convenient location.
