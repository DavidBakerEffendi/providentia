THE WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED. This is no exaggeration - I've had better service at a McDonalds drive thru. 25 mins for an adult milkshake on a slow day w/o any explanation? I live in the Piazza and have eaten out at pretty much every place in a mile radius, but seriously, waiting over an hour w/o a crowd on a rainy Sunday afternoon w/ no crowd for a cheeseburger? The decor is awesome, great atmosphere, food is very good but I will not step foot back in this place just b/c the place is run by teenagers who must be trust fund babies, think they run the place and believe they are cooler than they are (I've actually met a guy who bartends there at another bar who was very cool so I can't say everyone is a Dbag who works here). I ended up speaking directly to the owner b/c the service was so bad that day and management was run by an immature asst mgr who needs to find another line of work. He ended up telling me his wait staff was still "green" - this after they'd been open a year,and btw dude, telling a patron your staff is green & expecting us to accept that is ridiculous. I'd like to recommend the place and go there again if it wasn't for some of the staff who works there .. esp since its in my backyard. In the meantime, unless you only care about hanging out in the "it" places don't bother unless you want to have the same frustration ... there are plenty of other places around here who care about your patronage.
