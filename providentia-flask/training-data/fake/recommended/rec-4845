When we hit the sidewalk after dinner we both looked at each other and said: never again.  The service was harried and rushed, my four scallops were overcooked, the risotto was undercooked, and the bread guy actually took a long moment to comtemplate our empty bread plates and decided one slice was enough for us and walked away.  Did I mention the air conditioner dripped water on me about once every three minutes?  And all this for $33 a plate!  Here's the deal:  if you're charging $33 bucks for four ounces of fish everything better be pretty top shelf.  It wasn't.
