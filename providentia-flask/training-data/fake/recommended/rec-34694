Great Ambiance. Simple and efficient. With classic and contemporary Bollywood songs playing to keep you distracted from the long line, the efficiency and ease with which you decide your Kati and place your order is a quick and easy process. Straight forward menu with about 14 variations on the classic Kati roll we ordered the chicken tikka and unda shami kabab rolls. Fresh ingredients coupled with minimal spices that dont overwhelm the food was a great light lunch with lots of flavor.
