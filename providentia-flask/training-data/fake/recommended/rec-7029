I was excited to come here.  Very excited.  But the experience (meh)... underwhelming. * I've had time to mull it over, and this lukewarm review could be a product of my unreasonably high expectations at the time, or they are well-founded. Bar was scantily attended, I did show up at a phantom hour of 4:00 (purgatory time between lunch and din din).  I had been craving a burger for a while, and the pictures and reviews had my expectations at full blast.  The burger, deceptively small when taking into account the pictures, but still thick nonetheless.  The patty was tasty, juicy, and well cooked; I'll give them that, but I guess you gotta request bacon if you don't get a bistro CHEESE burger (I don't do the cheese thing).  Additionally, if you're gonna have a thick juicy patty, it would be pretty reasonable to expect a bun that won't be too easily shred through and soaked by the grease/burger juices (would you put a fat guy in a little coat?  makes no sense).  The fries... overpriced McDonald's shoestrings, and a bit dry at that. In the end looking back at the experience, I either overpaid OR the cashier/bartender isn't good at math OR the blackboard listed prices are completely out of wack.  I had assurances from said cash dude that he calculated the correct prices in the correct fashion, and as a trusting fellow (and illiterate when it comes to chicken scratch handwriting) I took his word for it. I might come back, but just step it up guys... I do see the potential.
