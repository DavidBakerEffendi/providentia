Have to agree with Jill H. It breaks my heart to write this review. The decor is gorgeous and the owners are sweethearts. But our meal was just mediocre if only considering the food that was served. Even though the presentation was pretty, the dishes were a miss on taste and texture. It just wasn't cooked properly. This should be adjusted considering the price. I love this place for trying to be sustainably sourced. I love that they have gluten free items. I love the attentiveness. And I love the interior decor. But the food sadly fell flat.
