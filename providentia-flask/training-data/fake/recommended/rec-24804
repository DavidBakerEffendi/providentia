My boyfriend and I went here for an early Valentine's Day dinner.  We made reservations but it turns out we didn't need them.  There was practically no one there when we arrived, except for another couple.  More on them later.  The food was excellent - some of the best Thai food we've had (not that we're connoisseurs or anything, we just like yummy Thai food.)  I got the duck fresh rolls and pork drunken noodles, and my boyfriend got fried calamari and pad see ew.  We enjoyed it all.  He even tried the duck (not too adventurous is he.)   My biggest beef was the set up of the room.  We were seated so close to the only other couple in the restaurant that we felt like we were on their awkward second date with them.   They were definitely talking alot, and talking loudly.  I tried giving them the side eye, but to not avail.  Next time we'll just ask for a different table.  And there will be a next time, unless we can find a way to have them deliver to Manayunk.
