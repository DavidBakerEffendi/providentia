Very good! Calamari is usually very good but tough tonight. For me, if I'm cooking calamari, I'd taste one from every order. If it sucks, don't send it out. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen. Overall, good food at a reasonable price. At times I think they're slipping but they pull through with a nice dish. Give it a try.....if you find yourself sitting next to stay-at-home Montville moms...asked to move. They'll give you a headache...cheers
