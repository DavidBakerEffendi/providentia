I've now dined at Battersby about a dozen times and each time I'm blown away.  I mean it when I say it's the best meal you can get on Smith St.  The chefs are smart and innovative with their flavor profiles. The polenta soup with Maine shrimp made me swoon!  The octopus and chorizo, delicious.  I could eat the kale salad every day of the week.  And when they have lamb on the menu, run, don't walk.   I keep going back because I know there will be something new and delicious every time.   The service is impeccable, no snotty I don't have time for you attitude you find so many places these days.  I can't wait to see what spring brings to the table!
