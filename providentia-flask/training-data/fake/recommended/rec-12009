Room Service has a very nice trendy decor and great drinks. I got the honey Ice Green Tea and it is refreshing and a little bit too sweet for my taste. Service was quick and the food we got were excellent. I ordered the most spicy dish on the menu and it was truly spicy although not as spicy as I thought it would be. My boyfriend's curry dish was savory and creamy. I had a great time here and this is actually one of my favorite lunch spots in the city.
