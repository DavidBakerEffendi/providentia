Great little BYO on mythical sansom street (where all the good food seems to be in CC). They do need a little smoothing over with their seating policies as seating 3 people at a table while waiting for a 4th takes up exactly the same amount of room as seating 4 people. Anyway, their food was very well done. Not splashy, not overdone portion-wise (which tends to be the case at random Italian restaurants you go to), and just the right/subtle flavor to their dishes to make you feel right. To be honest, I can't remember what I had....probably because I couldn't pronounce the thing. Isn't that a rule somewhere? The more you can't pronounce it, the tastier it is? I'd definitely repeat, oh, and bring wine (and make sure your whole party is with you to save some grief).
