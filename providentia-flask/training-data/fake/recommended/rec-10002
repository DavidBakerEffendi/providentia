Stopped by here for sunday breakfast after realizing it was so close to my new place... It's your normal, casual diner. For breakfast had their bacon, eggs, and potatoes. Their potatoes are like IHOP, the thin hash type potatoes. All in all, everything was good. Coffee was okay. Services was good. They do have other things on their men that I would like to try... I think I'll be stopping by a few times to see what else they would offer.
