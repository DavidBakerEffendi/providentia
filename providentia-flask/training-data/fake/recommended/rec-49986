I read the reviews and I was expecting a really bad service and attitude etc but I am glad to say I didn't experience anything of that sort! The place was clean. The servers were nice & polite. The food was amazing we ordered halwa puri and some kebabs, salt lassi and mango lassi , everything was amazing. Good was hot and fresh. I am definitely recommending it to everyone who wants good Pakistani food. Loved it, 5 stars!
