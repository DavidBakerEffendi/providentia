I like this place.  It's cool.  Get there at 5 when they open...they crowd fast.  Shellfish up the kazoo.  Great service. Great great service...this is so important to me.  We ordered the shrimp, lobster and king crab legs. Each come in a separate plastic bag filled with spices. We ordered medium heat...sooo hot and spicy.  They give you blue rubber gloves...oh how I loved loved loved that.....they shove a bib around your neck...much much needed....they give you a set of tools and a bucket to toss the shells....my son and I were happpppy campers!   So why am I giving four stars and not five?....everything was a bit overcooked...can you say a bit MUSHY?!!   Yeah..made me sad...because everything else was awesome.  Paying $35. For a big mushy lobster...eh!   I'd go back, just to try again...believe it or not...hopefully they get it perfect.   Oh..btw...we had the Brussels sprouts sautéed with mint and cilantro....mmmmmmm nice flavor.
