You're beautiful. We should date. My Dearest Locanda, Your brussel sprout dish tops anywhere else (and yes there is a competition) in NYC. The Noir, Pinot Nero, Tenuta Mazzolino, Lombardy is worth salivating over. Â  The service, ambiance and food is excellent. Definitely worth going to, but be sure to make a reservation in advance unless you get there before 6pm or after 10pm.
