Ugh, oh my god. OH MY GOD. I am obsessed with this place (and it is slightly out of my price range -- ie, 10$ meals are slightly out of my price range -- and that KILLS ME). I have been there twice.  I wish I could say I have been there eighty thousand times. On my first trip, I got the shrimp burrito.  I didn't realize that burritos other than the "gringo burritos" are actually very small.  However, the shrimp burrito had AMAZING flavors (garlic mayo, tomatoes, fried chicken skins!!), and I only wish I had six more of them to keep tasting that deliciousness.  I ordered an endless chips and salsa to fill up, and the red salsa is fantastic, as are the chips.  They have very good seasoning and something faintly cheesy. On my second trip, my friends and I ordered a pitcher of margaritas and fried pickles.  The margaritas don't stretch too far but fuck are they strong.  The fried pickles were fantastic, and the spicy mayo they're served with is literally the perfect counterbalance to their acidity. Then, I got the fried chicken sandwich. JUST DO IT.  A piece of fried chicken bigger than my hand, a fluffy sesame seed bun, tons of delicious mayo, a huge plate of fries, fresh bibb lettuce.  Oh god, I can't. JUST GO. (Re: service; I have been when they are incredibly busy, and the waitress was not very attentive.  Totally forgiven, as the food got to us at reasonable times.  Also, have I mentioned how fucking GOOD this place is?  Just scuttle over.)
