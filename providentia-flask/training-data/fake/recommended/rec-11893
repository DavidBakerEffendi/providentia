Read great reviews about the corned beef hash and had to try it. The meat was so good, it was worth the slightly above average brunch price. The only reason I took a star away is because the waitress offered me more coffee (my cup was still half full) and I accepted - "oh that's good" I told her, after about 2 extra ounces of coffee was added to my cup, and somehow I was charged $6 - for 2 cups of coffee... Okaay, thanks?.... I mean, the coffee was good, but not $6 good. Either way, I still went back to have the CBH again - no coffee refills.
