Drunk, tired, and lost in New York does not bode well for most people.  It landed me in line at 53rd and 6th. After an abusive night at the local watering hole, my overworked stomach needed some love.  Having had the Salmonella Dogs, the Roach Coach Tacos, and other various street concoctions throughout the land, I must say that this is by far the best.  It hits a spot in your stomach that no late night meal has ventured into before.  The harmonious copulation of chicken, lamb, rice, white sauce, hot sauce, and lettuce oozes joy in ones mouth. I want to move to New York just for this cart.
