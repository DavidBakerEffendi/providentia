The food here is DELICIOUS!!!  Went here with a friend to celebrate a new job.  We both had glasses of white sangria that was quite strong for me.   We shared a few plates: Fried Goat Cheese with Lavendar Infused Honey - creamy & tart & sweet all at the same time.  Really divine. Bacon Wrapped Dates & Olives - this was my friend's choice and I don't like olives at all but I didn't want to seem picky so I ate it anyway.  I was surprised by how good it was.  Salty and crunchy, great combination. Pastrami Ravioli - I dearly wish that this plate was bigger.  I have never had anything like this.  The flavors were intense and everything just fit really well together.  Heaven on a plate. Braised Beef Short Rib - Melt in your mouth goodness.  Nothing too over the top. The atmosphere was great, not too loud.  Lots of people and candlelight.  We were seated in a balcony area that circled the main dining room so we could look down at other customers.   I wouldn't go here often as it is a bit pricey and it's sort of out of the way and a little hard to find if you've never been here before.  Actually I don't think I could find it now...
