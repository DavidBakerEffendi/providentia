I visited Palazzo's a few weeks ago on a Friday during the end of a snow storm so I have to admit from the beginning that it was unusually slow because of that. It's off of Bloomfield and I can't comment on how the crowds, the wait or the service usually are on regular Fri or Sat nights. Our service was excellent. They sat us in a secluded area by the window and the closest people were a few tables away. The privacy was great. The waiter was perfect, in that he wasn't hovering and wasn't MIA. He had a great personality and answered all our questions. The ambiance was excellent. Music wasn't too loud or obnoxious, decor wasn't tacky or cheap. The menu was excellent. Entrees were $15-$21 and they had great specials. What we loved about the menu is that it wasn't "typical" italian, where the only things on there were baked ziti, lasagna, and ravioli. Actually, none of those things are on the menu. The menu was unique and modern and the food was very impressive. It was clear that the ingredients were fresh, not frozen, not wilted, not dry, etc. I had whole wheat fettuccine with artichokes, mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes. My boyfriend had two huge chicken breasts with mushrooms and sausage. Both of us brought the left-overs home, which is rare for him because he usually finishes it, but it was too much food! We brought out own wine since they do not serve (common to many Montclair restaurants). Highly HIGHLY recommended, but call to find out about reservations and wait times.
