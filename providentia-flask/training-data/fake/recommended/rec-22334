We discovered this gem when driving back home to Connecticut from Virginia on the Sunday after Thanksgiving in 2011. Traffic was at a standstill on the turnpike so we got off for a detour and looked for lunch places. I found this on my phone and since we love Thai, we decided to try it. Everything was amazing. I love Thai food and I eat it all over. This along with a place near my home in CT tie for second place behind a restaurant in Seattle that was simply divine! Everything was perfect during our first visit. So perfect, that we decided we would stop by again on our way back from Virginia again this past Thanksgiving (2012). We had Crazy Noodles & veggie fried rice & veggie spring rolls with turnip sauce. Again the decor, service, and food was excellent. The waitress asked how much milk we wanted in iced coffees. It was so good it makes me want to drive from CT down to Trenton just to eat here again. I felt like I was transported to a different place each time we walked into the restaurant. Noticed a good review in the Times posted in the window on our second visit. They rated it as Worth it and I completely agree! If you like Thai, go here. Stop reading this review and just go! It is amazing!
