This is my new favorite French cuisine restaurant!  The decor was warm and inviting and everything I'd imagine it would be like in France, although I'd never been there.  I had the crisp pork belly and my wife had the duck confit.  They were both cooked to perfection and had nice presentation.  The flavors were delicate light and subtle so you can really taste the natural flavors of the meat, whereas the texture was amazingly crisp on the outside and rich and savory on the inside.  The only thing missing was a fruity apricot glaze sauce to balance out the salty with a little sweet.  We also ordered a side of pomme frittes since Bobby Flay said it was the best thing he ever ate.  It was good, but didn't make me fall out of my chair or anything.  The Stump Town coffee was a delight and great finish to such a savory meal.
