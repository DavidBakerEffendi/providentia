The cat's out of the bag! Bijan's is no longer my lil' secret. The second time I went, it was packed! This was during after work hours, let's say around 7pm on a Thursday. My coworkers and I were lucky enough to pull together a few tables and own the back section of the place. The cocktails on the menu will run you $10. Trust me when I say this is a good deal. The bartenders here are NOT shy with their pour. I had one milf for the night and I considered myself pretty tipsy and I did not order any food at the time. My third visit, I cam here with my brother. We ordered a LOT of food. The wings, flat bread pizza and calamari. The wings were perfect. Juicy, crunchy, spicy. The blue cheese dip could be its own dish, seriously good. I was very impressed. Look... Get the food, have a drink, enjoy my spot. You're welcome!
