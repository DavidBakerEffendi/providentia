Came by here for a Yelp event and was blown away. The upstairs had more rooms than I could count, each with its own unique theme! Want to stop by the tap room, the wine room, or the whiskey room? Oh, there's also a sports bar area, or more of a lounge if that's what you're feeling. The beer selection was great, and the appetizers were delicious, too, ranging from shrimp to wings to nachos and hummus. Honestly, I had no idea there was such a find in the area, and I can't wait to head back.
