Probably a fun place if you're just going for drinks, but we attempted it for lunch.  With all of the great places in the neighborhood, why not go somewhere else?   The service was terrible and the food took terribly long to get to the table.  The owner was apologetic, but waiting an hour for blah food is about 55 minutes too long.  Oh, and if you know that the soda is always flat, why serve it?  Why not fix it?  Would have been more satisfied had we gone across the street and bought a role at Sarcone's.
