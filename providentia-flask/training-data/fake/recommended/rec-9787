More than decent tapas place on the westside.  Bit on the pricey side for the portions though and not exceedingly creative.  The squid and rice in black ink is a standout, though while I was mind blown the first time I tried it (melt in your mouth creamy and bursting with flavor), the one I had more recently was a bit bland and left a lot to be desire (not sure if it was just a fluke or what).  The potatas bravas are also excellent.  Everything else I've had have been tasty but not super memorable, except the chorizo in cider, which I didn't like because the sausages were too fatty.   Not a bad choice if you're in the area, but there are better tapas places in the city so I wouldn't go out of the way to come.
