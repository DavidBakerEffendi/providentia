My best friend came into town from LA for her bachelorette, and being that she is now from LA, she only eats gluten-free. It's not the Gwynneth Paltrow induced gluten free- she really has celiac disease. We met up off the Bedford Ave stop with our other best friend, and we were famished! So she suggested Desnuda. Fabulous choice, Liz! We ended up sitting at the bar, which at first felt like we wouldn't be able to talk with one another quite well since we haven't been all together in almost 4 years. Not the case. Our bartender/chef was amazing. He held our attention while leaving us to catch up while munching on yummy truffled butter popcorn. The beer list is solid- it has a fusion of local and South American beers, and my friends absolutely loved the their mezcal cocktails. The highlights are definitely the $1 oysters on Monday night. The onion jam the chef prepares is spectacular, but I wish the oysters were different. I'm less of a Virginia oyster dude- give me long, salty New Brunswick oysters! Our meal was fantastic- a mix of raw and semi-cooked to cooked dishes. The Brussels Sprouts dish was awesome. It had a maple sauce that was infused with chili or cayenne that packed on the heat at the end. The seared scallops were tremendous- like sliced marshmallows charred at a campfire with the tasty rawness you'd expect. I liked the ambiance and the bathrooms were nice. Great job, Desnuda. I'll bring my chefs by one Monday for sure.
