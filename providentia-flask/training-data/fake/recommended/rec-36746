I had not been to Philadelphia for years, and Fork was the first place I hit, half an hour after my luggage came off the plane. I'm still a fan.  The food is super--I had a thick pork chop, perfectly grilled, crusty on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside, over a kind of bean ragout.  Super nice...my mouth is watering as I recall this dish.  Nice wines by the glass to go with the meal. Something that Fork does particularly well, though, is to be single-diner friendly.  There is a really nice bar in the center of the restaurant that is first come, first served.  It's a kind of buzzy place in the middle of a classy restaurant so I can drop in, have a glass of wine and a great meal, survey the scene and be entertained by the yuppies, bankers, cougars, posers, etc. and not feel self conscious about being solo.  Very nice for a solo-traveller! This is the kind of restaurant I wish I had near by--it's the kind of place you'd like to walk to.  It would improve property values nearby as well as quality of life!  But I'm OK with visiting Fork now and then when I get to Philadelphia...
