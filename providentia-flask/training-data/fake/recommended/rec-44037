Good food, nice staff, great service, cute decor. I honestly recommend this place to everyone. Its a nice place to bring a few people to hang out and a lot of people go on dates here. They also host a lot of free events (which is how i discovered it) so check it out next time. I even met the owner and he recommended other good restaurants and dishes to try in the area. I love the udon and dragon roll sushi but I sometimes stop by JUST for the Mochi ice cream, it is soooooooo good. Never had a bad dish or bad experience here. Just to emphasize how nice they are, I sat on their seats outside one hot day because I was so hot and tired and the waiter came out and offered me a glass of water! 5 stars for not only being a good quality restaurant, but for being decent people. UPDATE: Zento is still one of my favorite regular places to visit. You get to know the staff very well and the owner often comes down and mingles with the guests. They frequently hold events here and it is just a lively place to be at.
