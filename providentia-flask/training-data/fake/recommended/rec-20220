Dinner there last night for Father's day, with my dad and a friend.  Very busy, but we were able to grab a spot outside after a brief wait. As much as the southern food vibe is grabbing hold of NYC at present, I felt compelled to go for fish, as I often do.  I had the hake which was light and tender (think cod, but less fishy), pan-seared and very lightly breaded, to near perfection.  The accoutrements really won me over on this dish.  Anise flavors and beautifully arranged plate kinda knocked me out. The beer list is solid and the service was fine.  Look forward to coming back soon!!
