Buttermilk please! Everything about this brunch spot was the perfect touch to my morning. The locale, the atmosphere, the people, and the food all made for deliciousness. I loved that every brunch entree came with your choice of mimosa, bellini, or sparkling wine. How did they know? My fried pork chop and cheddar waffles could not have been more tasty! The pork chop was surprisingly juicy and the waffles tasted freshly made. I Â YUM! I couldn't help but share an order of buttermilk pancakes with my husband. They were perfectly soft melt in your mouth goodness in every bite. I haven't had better. WANT SOME NOW! My husband ordered their in-house smoked salmon that tasted super yummy too! I loved how the eggs were still a little runny and not overcooked - just how they should be. Buttermilk Channel was possibly one of the best brunch spots I've ever been to. Being from Chicago where Brunch is a MUST, this spot tops it all. I just wish I could travel to Brooklyn every week for my buttermilk pancake fix. My stomach is smiling at me right now... :)
