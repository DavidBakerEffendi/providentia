What a nice surprise for South Orange. From the the start to finish it was delightful. The menu is great with just about anything that you desire and presented the way it should be. The food is very good and the staff is very friendly and helpful. The bar area is very nice and has a warm feeling to it and you can eat your appetizer or dinner there. The prices are reasonable for this upscale restaurant and make a Â reservation on the weekends.
