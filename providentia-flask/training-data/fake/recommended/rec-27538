We tried to make a reservation for Sat and were told it was a walk-in, we don't take any reservations. So we showed up early around 6:30 to go here for dinner and was told there was a 30-45minute wait, but nobody is waiting ahead of us. A table opens up and we ask him if we can take the table, he says no you have to wait 45minutes. We ask him why, and the host says well there are people on the list ahead of you and i'm going to give them a few minutes, we ask him how many more minutes? He says 5minutes. 20 minutes pass and the table is still free sitting there by itself. A couple seats open up at the bar and he asks us whether he wants us those instead. We tell him we want the table and give the bar to the people who are not here, and he says no I'm not going to do that even though it has been 30 minutes he has been saving the table for someone who is not there. He actually started shouting "do you want the bar or not?" in a completely inappropriate manner. It turns out that the host was actually calling his buddies to save the table for them, while they took their leisurely time, and making paying customers who were right then and there wait. I was a frequent customer here but never going to come here after this, they don't deserve any business with the cronyism shown by this this guy. Management should re-evaulate the types of people they hire over here. Â The emo looking guy is an a$$hole.
