Didnt even make it to a table. Don't bother coming for breakfast or brunch unless you're a rich looking white lady. My fiancee and I waited 15 Â minutes to be seated. While we sat waiting, we noticed a couple of women (white) come in after us, they were in groups of two as well. Why were they seated immediately and we waited? We came from Jersey City to try this place... never again. "Excuse me, your racism is showing..."
