I've been here 4 times and I'm not that impressed. Some of the food is good, but it isn't exactly Thai.  The supposed spicy dishes I've had there lacked the sweet heat that Thai food gets from those tiny little dangerous peppers.  Another time I ordered noodles that were slightly burnt and a little too salty.  The wait is often long and I just don't understand why everyone loves it so much.  The staff is nice and the prices are good for Park Slope, but that doesn't make the place or the food wonderful.
