Fantastic food with a reasonable price point. We went with a group of 5 for brunch- the restaurant is a bit small and was a little warm (it was a hot August afternoon). The good and drinks were all excellent- we especially liked the fried rice. Fresh ingredients and not huge or heavy portions. I highly recommend for brunch and will be going back for dinner.
