Based on appearances this place seems perfect, but something is just weird about the format. Ordering is super confusing. There are multiple counters displaying different types of items and boards listing the menu... Yet you seem to be only able to order and pay in one place.  The menu next to the register listed many lunch items, but when I asked about salads I was directed to check at another counter, then had to return to order.  Same for desserts.  Luckily it wasn't too crowded but I imagine at busy times it would be chaotic. The food is solid, but not really Belgian as it claims. Service is a little slow and you still have to bus your own tables, again having to go to multiple locations to put tableware vs. garbage. One would think they could borrow an engineer or designer from nearby Yale to study the space and suggests a more practical use of it!
