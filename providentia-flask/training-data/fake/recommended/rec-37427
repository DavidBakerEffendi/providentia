Have been here two times for brunch and dinner, and thoroughly enjoyed myself. Wish I could come more often: the food is awesome--love the flavor combinations of fresh, spicy, and sweet in every dish. The plates are great for sharing, and I've found everything exceedingly delicious. Service is really kind and cute. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a great atmosphere and something different. Probably very nice option for a date.
