I think you should stick to the $6.50 lunch special. If you dont it seems like a waste of money to order after 4pm, Its the same size meal, but before 4 you get a roll or soup for free and less money. My Sesame chicken is $12 after 4, ALONE but before 4 $6.50 with a roll or soup?? thats the rip off trick. Still love Zen :)
