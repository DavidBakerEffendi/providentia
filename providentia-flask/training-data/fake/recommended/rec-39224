Hype city for bros with a fancy food vocabulary. It's cool that you source locally, but do better with it! Maybe it was over before I began. Maybe I never gave it a chance when I entered and saw the Happy Hour bro clientele and the Happy Hour bro staff. Maybe I ordered the wrong menu items, rather than the monthly season menu. Maybe it's me and my attitude. But seriously, no. We sat at the bar and still were barely attended to. Â It shouldn't be that hard to flag someone down when you're sitting literally right in front of them, but it seemed like the staff was more invested to talking to one another. The winter pig was fine, with a nice blend of rich and fatty pork belly and sweet apple. (Some arugula would have brought it to the next level.) The short rib sandwich, on the other hand, was just gross -- too many bitter flavors without a complement. I didn't even finish my half. After a sandwich each, we were both still hungry. (But why?) The dessert special, the smores, tasted like two Trader Joe's graham crackers with chocolate and marshmallow but cost... $8? Was it $8? And the plate was hot from the oven, which no one bothered to tell us but I learned when they put it down on the opposite side of the bar and I tried to move it. OOF. Lousy service. Uninspiring food. So many happy hour bros.... Not for me.
