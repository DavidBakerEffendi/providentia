Delightful cafe that epitomizes the charm of the West Village.  The existence of this kind of cafe alone makes me want to live here. We were three and had yogurt with granola, a spinach and herb omlette (+fries), & pancakes.  All dishes were great, but the granola was particularly good!  My husband said his latte was the best he'd had in a long time. We also didn't have to wait, which is unbelievable on a NY saturday in the West Village (was about 12:30 when we got in).  Is it the recession that is kicking in??  All the better for us since, even in times of recession, weekend brunches are our necessary staple!
