I don't write reviews if the place is shit, unless is dog food. This is not one of them. Skip the beef and pork, this ain't the real Nicks on 20th & Jackson or Springfield Delco but don't get ready to walk out. The burgers are the best and even Zagat rated the southwestern burger best in philly. While I got beef with their selection of local burger spots I agree these are the best burgers in olde city with spot on sandwiches and standard bar food. Try the thanksgiving sandwich, big moist turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce and drizzled with gravy inside a kaiser. But I digress, cheeburger, cheeburger chump. And some old guy in a 30 yr old kenzo pride shirt, not some hipster who would get the shit kicked outta him by a smoker at K&A
