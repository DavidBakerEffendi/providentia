It's been almost two years since I've been here, but I came across the place while tolling around yelp looking for something new to try. Given the really high marks this place gets, I feel the need to put my two cents in to say that I honestly have no recollection of the food. My only memories are of how stiff the wait staff were, how difficult it was to get information out of the sommelier, and a general sense that we could always "feel" the staff around us. I've been to my share of Michelin-starred places, so don't think it's that. Certainly no one was rude (far from it), but this restaurant can only relate to one type of diner.
