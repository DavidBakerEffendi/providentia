Effing Fantastic!! With a throwback to the old days when wise guys would wack your brother for his lunch money ya just feel alive when you wait for a table. In a time when family values and traditions go together like Â immigrants and social security they have actually kept the ingredients as secret as the decore the same... My favorite is the white clam pizza and a few Peronis to wash it down. If your on the 'berry please give it a shot...... You wont regret it!
