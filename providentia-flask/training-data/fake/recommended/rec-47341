This is quite literally the worst food I've ever had in NY in 40 years! Pasta with Lobster sauce which was essentially pasta with canned pearl onion sauce-not the slightest hint of Lobster. Halibut that was unseasoned, overcooked and clearly, once frozen. Frito Misto-unseasoned, horribly greasy and tasting of cheap overused oil. The food came out of the kitchen so quickly, it was obviously pre-cooked. (The neighboring table's roasted chicken came out of the kitchen in less than 10 minutes!) This is just another West Village eatery (like the Waverly Inn and Spotted Pig) that is nowhere near as good as the hype. In fact-it was disgusting.
