Some co-workers and I ate here while on a business trip recently. The food was amazing, the staff extremely friendly and the drinks were perfect. They even gave us a free treat to go because we were too full for anything else and told them we had long flights the next morning (homemade biscotti). Love this place. I'll go back every time I am in Hartford.
