Based on some of the other comments I take it this is not the place from that famous song, but if it's not the place Susan Vega was singing about it should have been! This place has really good food, but it's really all about the service.  From the kindly old guy behind the counter, Gus who brought over a pop up book for my son. To the staff that greet you while on the line in front of the place with complimentary coffee, cookies and cinnamon toast, to the waiter we recognized as a PhD student friend of a friend who insisted that egg creams should only come in chocolate and gave us a free one to compare against the vanilla one we ordered.  Definetly a great place to go for a brunch.  Just be aware that there's only a few tables inside so you'll most likely have a bit of a wait, but even while waiting the service makes it all worth it. Bonus: The food's good too!
