The food at this restaurant is always really tasty and priced well. The first location, which has shut down, was more of a whole in the wall (not necessarily in a good way), but the new location has a much nicer feel inside. I've never actually sat down at either location because I just get take out, but i do recommend this restaurant. I took one star away just because its never as spicy as I ask them to make it, but I will repeat regardless.
