Often a place can be measured in terms of how they deal with a mishap. Juventino is smooth and professional under pressure. My friend and I went there for brunch and when the waiter brought us our drinks (2 french press coffees and 2 mimosas), he accidentally hit the edge of the tray, lost balance, and the drinks tumbled onto us. Within seconds, several staff members were there cleaning up, taking care of us, and apologizing courteously. Both my friend and I have worked in the restaurant business, so we understand that these things happen and we didn't expect anything. But the manager came by and said "Please order whatever you want, brunch is on us" and he gave us a few recommendations on what to order. What made it extraordinary is how often they came by to check in on us, to refill our glasses, and to make sure we were okay. It wasn't overly apologetic, just a genuine "We want to make sure you enjoy your brunch even if you're soaking wet." The 5 stars is not just because of this mishap. The food is OUTSTANDING, the atmosphere makes me want to move in, and the staff was superb. If I lived in Park Slope, this would be a weekly treat for me!
