Lunch is fantastic , have tried the salads ,delicious, fish tacos very good and filet panini   absolutely delicious.  Dinner a different story, my husband got the short ribs all one could taste was the A-1 steak sauce it was cooked in...awful.  I got the salmon with beet risotto...salmon very bland, left with skin on that wasn't cooked crispy but a rubbery soggy mess, risotto tasted like absolutely nothing,  no seasoning , no flavorings and especially no beet taste to it at all.  Will be back for lunch very good, and their soups are delicious.
