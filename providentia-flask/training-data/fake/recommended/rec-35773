Wit Wiz! My REAL Philly Cheese Steak cherry has been popped! What's better than greasy cheese wiz dripping down your arm? Nothing! That's what-- Nothing! Everyone is right, cheese steaks just don't taste the same anywhere else. I'm thinking it's the bread. Their bread is very distinctive. I like that they provide cherry peppers as a condiment. You don't find that at many places (at least in Chicago, because Chicagoans can't get enough of fatty giardinera). Awesome experience. A definite must for anyone visiting the city of Brotherly Love.
