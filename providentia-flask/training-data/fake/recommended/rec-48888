Delicious, reasonably priced and impeccable service. Bonus that it's BYO. I've been here twice, as a couple and as a large group to celebrate. The food is absolutely delicious, I've tried 6-7 items and each was better than the last. Big fan of the Peach SoCo Short Rib as well as the Chicken sandwich. The servers are so welcoming it almost feels like a dinner party. Really knowledgable about the menu, and entertaining. There's games to keep you occupied... really well done. It's never as busy as it should be. It's a little far back for foot traffic to notice when compared to El Camino or Ferdinand- but it's worth walking the extra block.
