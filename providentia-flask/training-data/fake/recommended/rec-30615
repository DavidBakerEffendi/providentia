A great meal.  Hate paying $36 for a strip steak but it was the best I ever had.  The place has the potential to become on overly trendy hangout - but the food is simply tooooo goooood and the service was very good.  Its on 10th and 20th so you really have to want to get there, but its worth the trek.  We had gnocchi with veal meatballs, garden salad, strip steak and tile fish (gnocchi and tile fish were specials).  For dessert we had chocolate cake and homemade "candybars" - yum. Definitely will be back.  If I could give this 4.5 stars I would. Only drawbacks would be limited by-the-glass wine selection and the place is not exactly small but its definitely not big.  Probably not good for parties of more than 6.
