Atmosphere is nice and service was not bad but the food is below average. Wonton soup broth is very high in sodium and wontons were cold. Pork egg rolls have potential but were served fried on the outside but cold on the inside. Korean wrap and Pad Thai were heavily sauced you could not taste anything but the sauce. I would not recommend this place at all based on the food alone.
