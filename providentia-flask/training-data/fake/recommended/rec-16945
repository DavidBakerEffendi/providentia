One of the best places for Cuban food INCLUDING the city.  Yeah the music can be a little loud and it gets crowded but it only adds to the festive atmosphere.  The place is also probably the best managed restaurant you will ever see.  The owner is def on top of things.  Ate here countless times and never had an issue and the food was always amazing Recommend going off peak hours
