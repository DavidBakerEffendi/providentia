Great food and service.  We went there for dessert one night and we had the 5 sampler and it was so good we went back the next night for dinner and the hostess remembered us and said welcome back!  Great service, my only negative point is the Udon noodle soup, it's more of an appetizer rather than an entree.  It had only 8-10 noodles in it.  My daughter was hungry still had to order 2 more bowls and asked for extra noodles.  But the waiter was very nice about it and brought the extras over without a comment (but did get charged $2 for it).  Finally the last bowl actually had more noodles in it.   Totally recommend the place.
