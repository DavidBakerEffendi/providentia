what a cute little restaurant :) i like the cicadas hanging on the walls & want to get one for my apt!! service was extremely slow, and it wasn't even a full house.  we waited about 20 min before the waitress even brought us our menu, and then about 10 min more after we were ready to have our order taken, but the waitresses were ultimately friendly which semi-made up for it.  they were conversing with some of the customers. food was delicious, we had the shrimp crepe as well as the chicken & mushroom crepe and both were very flavorful & filling.  for dessert we went for the pear, homemade chocolate, and almonds crepe.  SO SOSOSOSOOSOSOS GOOD.  i will most definitely be back.
