What a wonderful experience my boyfriend and I had here and it did not break the bank. Roberto and his staff were a pleasure. I really enjoy supporting hardworking, yet wonderfully delicious restaurants. It is so close to me as well. Please excuse my spelling, but we had the veal piccatta, crab meat fussilli, neopalitano, complimentary brushetta, and mussels. I ate everything on my plate. Perfect portions! BYOB! Enjoy your time here!
