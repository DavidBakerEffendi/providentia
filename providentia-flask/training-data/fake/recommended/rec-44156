Stopped in on a wet & foggy Monday morning recently. Needed something in our bellies before driving home to Boston.  What a great breakfast.  We both had the Vermonter Breakfast Skillet.. Absolutely delicious. Home fries on the bottom were nice & crispy, the corned beef hash was homemade and the eggs on top were made perfectly to order. With a very friendly & sassy waitress to serve it all up, it was a great meal and a great ending to a superb weekend in Vermont.
