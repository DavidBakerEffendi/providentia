Vientiane Cafe is a great spot for dinner, but even better for lunch. The dinner crowd is often a big one with long wait times, but lunch is usually quieter & you get your pick of tables. When it's nice out, sitting at one of the outside tables is lovely. Their dinner prices are a bit high, though the food is good quality. Also, their crispy noodle salad is *technically* a salad because it has a sprinkling of scallions and a sprig of greenery, but mostly it's tasty sauce and little fried noodles. Not something to order if you're trying to be health-conscious. Their lunch special is a moderately-priced three course meal, consisting of a soup, an appetizer, and the main course. Each category has several options. I prefer the coconut soup, which is creamy and tangy, with a nice assortment of veggies, though I'm not a fan of the peppers. The dumpling appetizer is not very good. Although the dipping sauce is just right, the dumplings are kind of chalky and bland. I suggest the fresh spring roll with strips of fried tofu and two dipping sauces instead. The entrees offered are mainly curry variants, as well as pad thai and a few other things. I enjoy their pad thai a lot, and it's good with beef and great with chicken. I'm giving them three stars due to a few unpleasant incidents, one opf which I'll detail. We were waiting to have dinner for a while, and we'd left and come back to kill some time. The waitress had said 20-ish minutes, so we were back in that time. We waited some more, and then we got seated by one waitress. Unfortunately, a moment later, another waitress unseated us and told us we'd have to wait at least another 20 minutes, if not more. Needless to say, we were rather disgruntled. The waitstaff should really be more coordinated and communicative on busy nights. And long story short, we went home and got delivery.
