I was underwhelmed. My friend from the Bronx insisted we eat here and that it is the best Italian ever! She recommends this place to everyone. I really liked the atmosphere, the people that worked there and the guests that were dining. Great vibe. The food was average. They forgot to bring my salad I ordered before dinner and never even mentioned it later that they forgot or acknowledged that I ordered it. My butternut squash ravioli was mediocre and they left me no reason to want to come back to eat here. I heard the lasagna was good but I didn't try it.
