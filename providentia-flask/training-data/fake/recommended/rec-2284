I was a tourist in Philly, so I went to both Pat's and Geno's.  This place had the better cheesesteak, but I really was not that impressed with either.  I've had better cheesesteaks at Philly Connection. Although Pat's had a better cheesesteak than Geno's, they are really rude.  If you don't order it the "correct way" and don't have your money in hand ready to pay, then they will get all over your ass.  I guess this is the Philly way of customer service. Also, the bread is real tough, but the people I talked to from Philly told me that's the way it is supposed to be.  I prefer soft bread with gooey cheese and hot juicy steak.  That's not the style in this city.
