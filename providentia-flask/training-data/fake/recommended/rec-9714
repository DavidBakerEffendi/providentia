$54 for 7 people....for DINNER! And um, for really delicious food! We were all full at the end and deeply satisfied. This isn't a fancy spot but it's great savory Malaysian food and it will fill you easily without you needing to reach deep into your wallet. I've been to Nyonya many a time since I was a kid and it's still that good! This was my first time at this location and I thought it was cool that it's updated with a bit of a contemporary feel - very appropriate for NY right now, esp in that neighborhood. The roti with curry is a classic must have appetizer. The coconut rice is also one of my favorite staples. And last night I ordered my usual Seafood Scramble Egg Chow Fun. It's so good! Usually I can eat the entire dish myself but I actually already had dinner before coming so I only had half (split with my hubs). It hasn't failed me yet. I'll be back for more. *note: this isn't the place you go to for a fancy ambiance, service or super cool clean bathrooms. This is solely for amazing Asian food at an amazingly cheap price.
