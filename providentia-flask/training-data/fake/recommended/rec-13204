My husband and I went here last Saturday and it 100% lived up to the hype. The food was fantastic, as I had hoped. My husband had the eggs benedict with a spiked Arnold Palmer and I had the southern breakfast with a biscuit on the side and a bloody mary. Everything was prepared perfectly and full of flavor. The customer service was excellent as well. When we arrived we were warned it would be a 1.5 - 2 hour wait and that they would text us when our table is ready. We walked around the neighborhood for an hour and then our table was ready. The server was quick and efficient as was the food preparation. I liked that it was a small restaurant. It allowed for a more intimate and cozy dining experience.
