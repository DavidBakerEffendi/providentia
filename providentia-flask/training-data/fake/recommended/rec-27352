Every time I go to NY, I have to make my Cafe Haban run. oh.... the grilled corn.... so... good... It's such a simple dish but AMAZING. If you come here, you HAVE TO HAVE TO order the corn. This place is crazy busy so sometimes it's better to just go next door and order to go. I had Huevos Rancheros for breakfast and I forgot what I had for dinner but everything was super super good. Although, I have to say, I enjoyed the brunch more. When I went to the To Go side, I tried the plantain chips with garlic sauce which was really yummy too. This place is just overall, really good. The only downside is the wait.
