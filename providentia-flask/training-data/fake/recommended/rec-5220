This place is probably going to go out of business. Food quality is horrendous, even compared to other buffets.  Guy behind the grill is on his phone the whole time, which is ok because the selection was anything but fresh.  Staff was ok, voiceless emotionless automatons though.  The selection was poor and not really worth the$50 for one adult and two 11 year olds that we paid.  Soup was good enough to eat.  That's the best thing I can say.
