I took my hubino for brunch for his bday and we were so happy!  We loved the decor & watching all the awwweesome food & presentations walking by.  I made a 3:15pm reservation on OpenTable via Cookshop's Yelp page at 1:30pm the same Saturday afternoon.  Arrived at 3pm and had the option of sitting outside (too chilly that day), so we waited about 10 minutes for an inside table to open up. Food: - Cookshop Scramble $14 (caramelized onions, cremem fraiche, chives & buttermilk biscuit, & smoked salmon - though the other meat option is pork sausage.  Came with a salad).  He gave it 4 stars. - Pizza $13 (very thin crust with toppings that created great juiciness - ramp pesto gave a great lemony flavor, pecorino cheese, mozzarella, & ricotta.  I'm not a ricotta fan, but I didn't even realize it was there.).  I gave it 4 stars. - Side of Grits $6 (yummmm). 5 stars. - Coffee $3(?) - Bottle of Sparkling Water $7 - 3 scoops $6 (rhubarb sorbet - WAAAHHHH GIMME MORE!!!, mango sorbet, vanilla ice cream). 5 stars. - Black Bottom Fluffernutter Pie $8 (WOW! WOW! WOW!  Peanut butter crumb crust, chocolate fudge cake, peanut butter bavarian & bruleed meringue). 5 stars. Bill came to $60 + 20% tip = Super! Service: I wish I knew our server's name...he was AWESOME!!!  Sooo friendly & a smile-face.  He knew all the answers to our questions and had a great sense of humor.  He also let us know the menu changes daily & suggested calling ahead to ask if a specific item is available that day...if not, the hostess can let you know what is similar on the menu :) Conclusion: GO TO C--DOUBLE O--K SHOP!!!
