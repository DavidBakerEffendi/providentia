I live two blocks away from this place and in the years I've been here, have never tried it. I went out for a late lunch with some friends and we felt like burgers and had heard great buzz about this place and went. Now, this is not the greatest burger I have never had. The honor of "Best Burger In NYC" for me goes to Korzo on 7th. That being said, it was a really good burger. It was a "normal" burger in the fact that it didn't have weird stuff on it like rosemary pineapple aioli or something. I was craving something traditional and that's what I got. The proportions of cheese to meat to vegetable to bun was good. It really hit the spot. Also, it was not overpriced. The location is also nice; I've never stopped in because most times it's packed on a Friday night, but we went in on a weekend and were the only people in there. The service was prompt, the food was good and they played nice music (anybody who plays The Black Keys is good in my book). Sure, it was a little loud at points, but not terribly so. Alphabet City is sort of a dry area for good burger places that aren't very expensive. Korzo is great but pricey and I don't have that kind of money for every time I want a burger. Anybody who says that Veselka has a better burger just... does not know burgers, period.
