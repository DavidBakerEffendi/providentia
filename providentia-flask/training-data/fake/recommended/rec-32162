We went to the bar at happy hour for drinks and some appetizers. I told the bartender I needed a moment to decide and to go ahead and get my date a drink. My date ordered a draft and it tasted "metally". Well she nor the other two bartenders ever returned. Meanwhile, they served drinks and food to everyone around us. I made several attempts to get someone's attention. The bartenders were too busy fraternizing with the "locals" and arguing about mixed up food orders. Too bad, the apps actually looked good too. After about a half hour, I threw some cash on the bar for my date's drink and we walked out. Unacceptable. That place draws a sketchy crowd anyway.
