Yay, my favorite spot at Temple!!! Can't believe I haven't yelped it yet. Nice hefty crepe (it did get a little small over the last 2 years, but still good enough to fill my appetite!) and a drink, around $5, yes you've won my heart! I remember freshman year when I was first introduced to "the crepe truck." Ever since then, I've gone almost every other week for one, then started going less and less, but every time I visit, I'm sure to grab one of these fellas! Their phone number is on my phone to avoid the wait :D Why thanks, yes I'm a bit of a fatty. My usual, Nicole's Southwestern. There's also the uh.. "something dozer ribs" I don't remember the name but just as good! the meats are different. Nicole's southwestern uses like cheesesteak meat, and the other one is more of a chunky beef of some sort. Both uses a mix of ranch and bbq sauce. YUMMMM. I enjoy that combination very much. (I'm not hungry, but my mouth is watering thinking about this?) They have sweet crepes and savory crepes. I'm just in love with savory crepes. They have a lot of combinations to choose from, but I just like the taste of ranch and bbq and ALL the veggies.
