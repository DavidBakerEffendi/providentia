I was with a group of 5 ladies celebrating one of their birthdays! We waited in line for the famous ramen store before it was even open. Yep, there was a line that was very long, before the store was even opened. After a wait of around two hours, we were seated. The staff were all very welcoming. The food we ordered was trying out different ramen for each person, and the roast pork belly buns for appetizers. I think you have a choice for tea / water as the free drinks (I think I chose the cold water.) The food itself was tasty! The buns tasted good, but it wasn't spectacular. The ramen was good indeed, but in my head I didn't think it was worth a two hour wait. If I wait two hours in line, I really want it to be something GREAT! Overall, I wouldn't mind coming back with enthusiastic authentic ramen loving fans, but definitely just on a day when it's not that long a wait.
