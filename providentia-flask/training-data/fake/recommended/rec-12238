I love "Americanized" Chinese food -- I could eat it 7 days a week. However, Yao's food showed me how greasy the take-out Chinese can be -- because this was extremely tasty and not greasy at all! I ordered the Chicken and Shrimp with Mushrooms. It was so good. And very cheap. Under $10 for my meal, which came with soup, and a large portion of crispy noodles. They also provide you with ice water and hot tea. Great experience. Very friendly people. Nice place to grab a bite before a movie. (Montgomery Cinema is right across the street).
