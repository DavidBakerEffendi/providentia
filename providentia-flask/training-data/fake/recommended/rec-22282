This review is long overdue. My husband and I ate at Caseus in April and it was a culinary adventure. We are big fans of the owner from his Cooking Channel show, "The Big Cheese," so we had great expectations for Caseus. We were blown away. The service was exceptional. The staff are extremely knowledgeable, patient, and courteous. The food was divine. We could not stop ordering because we wanted to try everything. If you are interested in cleaner, greener eating, Caseus will not disappoint. The cheese shop is wonderful. While it is pricey, you get what you pay for, and what you get is high quality, unique cheeses. It's nearly a two hour drive from our home, but we cannot wait to go back!
