I can really live in this restaurant!!! i mean it, literally. A friend of mine asked me years ago: "if some day you can only eat one cuisine for the rest of your life, which cuisine would you choose?" and i said: probably Thai food. Well, fortunately that day never come...just to let you know i'm a huge fan of Southeastern Asian cuisine, the curry, laksa, tom yum, coconut sauce, sticky rice...etc. And this restaurant really rocks!!!! It probably the best Southeastern Asian cuisine you can get in NY. I also have some of their chinese dishes, they are also surprisingly great!!! And the price is CHEAP.
