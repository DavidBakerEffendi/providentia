Came here for my birthday with high recommendations and got a table quickly despite the line and the rain. The happy hour drinks were tasty and I had the white wine sangria. The fish was totally delicious, smothered with capers and olives. I also got the tostitos which were gone in less then 10 seconds. Â  After having 'real' Mexican in LA, I am happy I found this place right by my house where I can get the same thing!
