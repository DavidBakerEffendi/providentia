I do not frequent the restaurant, as I know it can get quite crowded and there is not much space to wait. I usually get it delivered, which is fast (granted I only live about 10 or so blocks from the place) and cosistently delicious. Although a side note here would be that occasionally on saturday evenings, the delivery can take a bit longer, but I have never experienced poor quality. I am a big fan of the original pizza, but with extra riccotta. (ordering extra cheese is an option for all those people who seem to have a problem with the fact that this traditional pizza does not ooze with cheese; I like the combination of the mozzarella and the ricotta...). I also always get the cesar salad (order the dressing on the side for 2 reasons-they totally overdress the salad, as most do, and with the amount of dressing that they give you on the side, you can add extra lettuce and have a large salad enough for 3 people). The cesar salad is really, consistently good, as is the pizza. I really like Archie's quote because it is so true! Lombardi's becomes addictive, and with the salad and not too much cheese, I can convince myself it is not fattening..... As far as people who seem to want to eviscerate this place, let up. It is "traditional" meaning not americanized, overly cheesey, pepperoni pizza. As for someone who starts drinking at 3 in the afternoon, and is surprised when he doesn't wake up naked being-what was it?-humped by an animal, I don't think his opinion should matter much to anyone (not including the fact that he would prefer digiorno's pizza...frozen, no less). But go, see for yourself. Just remember-it's deliciousness, and perhaps proximity to your apartment, may increase your waistline. Don't say Archie didn't warn you.
