The food was excellent and the staff was very helpful. Our group had misrepresented our size when we made our reservation. We told Balthazar that we had 4 in our group when we actually had 5. They were able to respond very quickly to this and we only had to wait a couple of minutes for them to prepare our table for an additional person. I had the duck confit which was very good. We also had the escargot, a few other appetizers, and some wine. Everyone at the table was impressed with their food. The atmosphere was quite enjoyable. It was crowded, but the noise level was just about perfect. There was a good buzz in the room, but you didn't have to shout across the table to be heard. Overall the food was very good. Loved the fresh bread that is produced at the Blathazar Boulangerie. I'd come back here for another business dinner.
