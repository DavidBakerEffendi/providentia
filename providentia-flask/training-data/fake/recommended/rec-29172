I just finished a doctors apt and was going to go to the noodle bar on 10th street but it was packed so I looked on Yelp and found this great review for Blue Sushi. I am a huge fan of a 2 sushi restaurants in south jersey and decided to give it a shot. I was a little upset that this was a byob and i had no thing to drink but i got a surprise from Hendra the owner. The place is very welcoming and it was a quiet Nite. I ordered stream shrimp shumai which was very good. Im not a big roll fan but I ordered the Temple. It was fantastic. Spicy yellow tail tempura flakes wrapped in black peppered seared white tuna glazed with yuzu sauce. Just awesome fresh with great flavors. I had some salmon,ikura and octopus sashimi. Fresh and very good. I'm waiting for my next roll but just finished my second shot of sweet potato vodka compliments of the owner Hendra. Tasted like a mild saki. Loved it. Â My Jefferson roll just arrived. Wonderful finale.
