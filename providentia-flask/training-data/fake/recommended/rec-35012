LOVE LOVE LOVE. The food here is decently priced for the portions served. We make an annual dinner her especially for Father's Day! The filet mignon on a stone is great and combo dishes are served as well. The service is always speedy and attentive. Â Every time I try something new I love it. Also, don't forget to leave room for desert its so amazing!!
