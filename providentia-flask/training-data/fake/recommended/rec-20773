Indeed, as good as it WILL EVER GET Once Dominico passes away his art of making pizzas will be lost and no crew of Mexican "chefs" will replace him...this was the downfall of Grimaldi's, Lombardo's and don't even mention L&B in the same sentence as Di Fara's. those guys aren't playing in the same ball park, neighborhood, heck not even the same SPORT. Di Fara's is in a class all by itself. It's like having a friend who's mom makes the BEST (enter whatever dish you love most) yet this is actually open to the public...proved you can handle the line, you pansy :) the original is awesome, the specialty toppings are awesome (although if you like SEVERAL toppings get the square (a pound of amazing dough) KEEP IN MIND: ALL INGRIDIENTS ARE IMPORTED, something you simply WILL NOT FIND ANYWHERE! :D enjoy! SUGGESTION: if you're not sure which toppings to get, ask Dominic Jr (the younger guy with glasses) and he'll recommend some AMAZING combos!!! now enjoy!!!
