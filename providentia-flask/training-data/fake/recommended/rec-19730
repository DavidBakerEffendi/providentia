One of my favorite tapas places in NYC.  Great selection of wines and tapas.  Tia Pol also offers really great brunch too. Why not 5 stars?  3 things - 1) It's such a small place that it gets jammed pack and it's ok for smaller parties but not when you have a larger party.  2) One of my favorite dishes - the white asparagus salad is so inconsistant. I really need to keep track of the nights I have it when it's best so I only order it on those nights. The best version of it that I've had has had just the right amount of salad dressing and enough asparagus. 3) Tia Pol took away my favorite dish on the menu - the octopus salad. The one they have on the menu now isn't the one that I love, but a newer version of it.   Are these 3 reasons good enough to take away a star?  Maybe not..but it's still one of my favorite places and perhaps I'm trying to keep the rating a little lower so the lines don't get longer. ;)
