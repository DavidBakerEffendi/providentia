Terroir Tribeca is a little hipster-y and it isn't quite as cozy of a venue as I normally like in a wine bar, but it's a very cool spot and was busy. I know why it was busy too; they have great happy hour specials! They have a selection of about 10 to 12 wines that are all $6 per glass between 4 and 6pm. The regular prices of the same glasses are between $9 and $13. This is a great reason to come in early. The service was great and my waitress was happy to make some suggestions along with very good descriptions of the wine. This summer has been declared The Summer of Riesling at Terroir, so all of the white wines by the glass are Riesling. Luckily, Riesling can be either dry or sweet, so if you're a white wine drinker, you're sure to find something that will suit your taste. I recommend the 2009 Hermann J Weimer Late Harvest Riesling...it's like drinking heaven. Awesome place with a fun vibe. Go there this summer, especially if you're a Riesling fan!
