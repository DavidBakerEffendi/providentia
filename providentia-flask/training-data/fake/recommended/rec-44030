One of the best mussel dishes I ever had!!! I would have drank the broth that they were cooked in if people were not watching :). I will definitely order the mussels again (Thai Chili flavor). Also, the waitress was so nice. Her name was Jacquelyn. She really seem to love kids. My family thoroughly enjoyed our dinner tonight!!!
