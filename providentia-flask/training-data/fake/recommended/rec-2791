Great food and I love that everything is customizable. No qualms about the atmosphere or product. However, this location has a really snotty manager. We found a hair in one of our dishes (it was clearly not any of our hairs), and our attitude was, "hey, it happens, but we should let them know." Our server got the manager, who came over and immediately said, "there are no women working in the kitchen, that hair isn't from us". We pointed out that it was VERY clearly not any of ours, and she was just very rude and accusatory, as if we were lying. She was so off putting that was didn't even accept her begrudgingly offered replacement. We will go back because they put out a great product, but this was really uncalled for.
