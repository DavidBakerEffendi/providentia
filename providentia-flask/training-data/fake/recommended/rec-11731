WOW!!! Â Understated, minimalistic but comfy setting...Well worth the 30 minute wait (even with reservations) for "Sunday Supper"...The menu offerings rotate...The food is very good to exceptional in a Southern Style sorta way...Sunday Supper was three courses for $25 and to me a New York deal...The restaurant is small, kinda cramped but hey; it's NYC...An East Village Gem!!!
