As I walked on 2nd Avenue, I saw tons of places serving brunch but none were packed even at 1230 on a Sunday afternoon! But as soon as I reached Cafe Orlin, the crowd was so big I couldn't even see the restaurant.  There is definitely a reason why. Cafe Orlin serves an incredible variety of brunch meals. You can choose from a menu that serves food with your choice of coffee and a cup of fresh squeezed OJ, or another menu that includes a brunch cocktail for only $6 extra. Then there's a variety of signature dishes such as the pumpkin pancakes that are on their own. The food is delicious, the drinks are incredible, and the service is phenomenal.   Don't let the crowd scare you! It was less than a 40 minute wait! Line goes fast.
