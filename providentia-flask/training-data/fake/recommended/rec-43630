I was just there a couple of hours ago. The food is amazing. Definitely go with a friend or two and sample a while bunch of mini plates. There quail eggs with the sausage are so yummy! Also try there spinach and shrimp tapas . 4 plates are enough for 2 maybe three people. My friend and I spent 43 dollars (sans tip) and its very hearty and filling. Don't let the price scare you. Very authentic Spanish food, not Latin, Spanish. You'll enjoy this although the service isn't all that great. The atmosphere though is fine for something business casual... Which we didn't know upon entering. Questions?? Comments?? Concerns??
