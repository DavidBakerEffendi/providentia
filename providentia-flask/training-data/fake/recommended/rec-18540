Perfect addition to a neighborhood that almost has any food you can imagine. The portions are great for the money. I got 4 massive ribs for 8.50. You get a half a chicken for 7.50. I had the sweet potatoes w/ pecans too which was delicious. The ribs had a ton of quality meat on them. The rub is great - little spicy and nice and salty. The layout is open-air with big huge windows- perfect for the summer. Service is quick and quick turnover on the seats...so ample seating. Looking forward to trying the brisket and pulled pork. I'll be coming back and probably updating this rating to a 5.
