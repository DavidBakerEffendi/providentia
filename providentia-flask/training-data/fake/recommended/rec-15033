Terribly cheap and ridiculously delicious. I've passed this noodle house 92837489327483274 times and never stepped foot inside! Well that is until tonight and now I realized I have been missing out! I ordered the seafood noodles and my friend ordered the duck noodles and both were equally delicious. Our food came out fast and I think our bill came to like...12 bucks. 12 bucks!!! The place is kinda small but hell, I'll definitely be coming back!
