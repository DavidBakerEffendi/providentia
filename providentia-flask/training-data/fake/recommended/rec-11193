Mmm, this place is delicious.  The food tastes like it should be really expensive, when it's actually very reasonably priced.  The atmosphere is decent, although sometimes I felt like the tables were a little too close and you're dining with the stranger sitting next to you.  We went here for Valentine's Day last year and it was a really good meal.  I have to agree with the person who recommended the spring rolls.  You're only getting half the experience if you don't try them!
