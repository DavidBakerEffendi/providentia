What I love about this place is that you can step inside on an early summer evening and grab a beer by the bar and listen to a blue-grassy band and nosh on BBQ and feel like a world away from New York. Maybe it's the air off the bay nearby, but really it feels like a glorious getaway. It feels like a homecoming; you can let your hair down. Don't come a prime time and expect speedy grub: the line can be long. Good things take time. This place does not serve food in a New York minute. But if that's what you're looking for, this isn't the right spot for you tonight, hun. Try the wings. Thank me later.
