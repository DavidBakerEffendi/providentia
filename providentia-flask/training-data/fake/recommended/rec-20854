The food is decent standard Vietnamese fare... my gripe about this place is sometimes they're randomly closed, sometimes I don't understand what they're saying, and the one time I came here they gave me something completely different from what I ordered. Â Its a white box, no decorations kind of place too... so don't come here for the atmosphere.
