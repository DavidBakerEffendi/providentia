I had one of the best meals of the year (so far) here. Yes, its hidden. yes, its kinda similar to other pricey brooklyn places (Dressler) but you get what you pay for. The food is so delicious- try the pork belly slider, a major highlight of our meal. The vibe is refined without being stuffy. The cocktails: inspired. The waiters are laid back but attentive and knowledgable. The space is nice and not cramped and they now take credit cards, FYI. If i could afford it, I would eat here every week. The only teensy problem I have with it is their dessert menu could you a little oomphing up. They are a tad boring and do take while..
