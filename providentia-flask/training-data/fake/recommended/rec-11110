One of my ABSOLUTE faves.. for a myriad of reasons.  The staff is great, the kitchen is clean, the food is consistently stellar, the selection is diverse and the atmosphere is relaxing, cozy and intimate.  They even do the fish tank up, right at the beautiful copper bar located upstairs.  The draped ceilings with the small white lights add that tranquil ambiance.  My favorite...the chicken liver pate.  I also love the ahi.  Seriously, you cannot find a bad thing on the menu (unless you are talking calories). :) I have yet to taste a less than wonderful dish.
