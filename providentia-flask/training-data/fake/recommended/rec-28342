One of the best bars in NYC!!  Great Beer, really good food, and a laid back, unpretentious atmosphere.  Music is at just the right volume, so you can actually have a conversation, and the bar staff are always friendly.  Good for date night or catching up with friends.   Beers are outstanding, with a great selection of rotating cask ales, and beers of the month.  Equally as important - they keep the pipes clean (important stuff), and everything gets pored properly.  They had Sawtooth ESB there back in March on a really good creamy nitro poor, probably the best beer I've had outside of England.  Shame on you, Kristy M, for dragging me away from my third pint :)    Food is the usual bar stuff, but done really well, normally go for the burger with bacon, Irish cheddar, and onions - rate it up there with Soho Park.  They keep serving late too (until 1am daily), and the quality doesn't seem to go down.    This place reminds me of the best local pubs in England - you can always get a good beer and a bite to eat without having to deal with any b.s.
