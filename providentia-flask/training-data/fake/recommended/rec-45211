Allow me preface this by saying that I've been to Just Jake's for brunch a few times several years back and it was great. The restaurant area in the back was quaint, cozy, and decorated nicely. Now? It looks like who-did-it-and-ran. Tables strewn everywhere, blasting flatscreen TVs surrounding the room, and stacks of board games all over the place. What in the holy hell? No place settings, no decor, nothing. It was no longer a restaurant space...it was an all-purpose room. Our menus were stained with God-knows-what and mine had a hair lodged in between the plastic. Beautiful. Â Had it not been 10 degrees out and had we not parked right outside, then I would have left. Brunch menu options were underwhelming. We both ordered a 3 eggwhite omelet with spinach, mushrooms, and onions. Our omelets were insanely greasy but the "mini potato pancakes" were as dry as construction paper. Shouldn't it be the other way around? Toast was stale, stale, stale. Even my club soda tasted strange. We were the only ones dining there until a trio of clueless out-of-town tourists joined the "WTF party". I felt awful because I recommended and brought my trusting friend to this pathetic place. I am the Yelp Queen for God's sake. This kind of crap will ruin my reputation! Brunch? Just Jakes? Just terrible. Just don't.
