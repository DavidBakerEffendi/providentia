Osteria ranks as one of the finest dining experiences I've ever had. I was in attendance with a large group so there was much food ordered and sampled in typical tapas fashion. The service was excellent, glasses of water and wine topped off as soon as either glass was nearly empty - and I never had to ask. Appetizers were a marinara pizza and another one with arugula and prosciutto. Bother were fantastic, with a thin flaky crust. Next we ordered a vegetable tray with an assortment of different things, what stood out to me here was the seared brussels sprouts. Finally for the appetizers we had a cheese plate that was also enjoyable, although I don't know the names of the cheeses, they were all delicious. My first of two courses was chicken liver rigatoni with cipolline onions and sage. I've never had chicken liver before but this was outstanding. My second dish was rabbit with pancetta, sage,and polenta (grits). The rabbit was pretty good, very "bony" but I'm told that's to be expected. Dessert was the cantucci sundae vin santo marinated almonds (taken directly from the menu: osteriaphilly.com/menu). Basically vanilla custard with almonds and this kind of wine sauce. Very good! I had an Italian red wine throughout the meal, selected by one of the more knowledgeable wine drinkers at the table and it, too, was excellent. Taken in consideration with the friendly and attentive staff, our nearly 4 hour dinner didn't feel long enough.
