My brother and I decided to head over here for lunch. While walking there, I saw a bunch of celeb photos and signatures and stuff on the wall so I figured this place must be pretty good, however, I was in for a huge letdown. I seriously could have gotten a better Philly cheesesteak from Carl's Jr. The bread felt like I was eating cardboard. The meat was really dry. It was overpriced and expensive, and I was really scared to order since we're not white and they are known to be racists. Also, my brother's cheesesteak had A HAIR in it. He was eating his 2nd or 3rd bite when he noticed some white thing sticking out. He pulled on it and out came about a two inch piece of white hair. It was disgusting and we had to throw away the whole thing. That was a nice 8 dollars in the trash. So all in all, this place should be avoided at all costs. Those who say that this place is delicious and good are dumbasses. The real secret to finding a truly delicious Philly cheesesteak is you have to go to the ghetto places!
