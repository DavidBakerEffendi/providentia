Finally the famed Cali-based Burger Joint, Umami Burger, arrives on the right coast for the first time this week! With so much hype going on about this place in the West Village, I'm surprised I got the chance to try it out with minimal wait during the dinner rush. Ideally, you want to put your name down before 6pm, otherwise you're looking for a 1.5+ hour wait at least. I managed to get a table for a party of six people, the trick is to have someone come early and place your name at the top of the list, so you get priority later, since they don't seat anyone until the entire party is here. Once we were seated, we went all out with truffle fries, Cheese tots( off the menu item), and truffle burgers all around. The Truffle burger I had was literally the best burger I have had in New York City, and completely trumps Shake Shack by a mile. It was like liquid gold and all the flavor's melted in my mouth. The truffle fries and cheese tots were amazing as well, along with their array of sauces (garlic aioli, diablo hot sauce, jalapeno cheddar, Umami homemade ketchup). The food went well, with their beers on tap, especially my favorite Ommegang Belgian Pale Ale. The best part of the meal was that they gave us a complimentary order of truffle fries, and the burgers were all half off (because the buns were too small!) Bill for 6 people came out to $110 including tax and tip. The service was on point and were ever so helpful. Welcome to NYC, Umami Burger! I'm happy you landed on the other side!
