We ordered take-out from here every night while in the area on business. The food is fresh and delicious and the menu is extensive. I'm going to miss the chocolate covered strawberry smoothies when I leave. The portions are gigantic. One salad or wrap could easily be split with someone else. I wish I had one of these in my neighborhood back home. The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars is because of the bland dining area and there isn't a lot of parking. Don't let that stop you from getting food from here though. They also deliver to nearby hotels.
