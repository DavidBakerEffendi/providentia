I would get the burger here.  And beer.  That's what I would get here.  And that's it. The line can be long at times but easily negotiated with enough cheap suds.  However, the beer sometimes amplifies the sound of the 24 year old Goldman/Barclays/Citi BROS high fiving and commiserating over the day to day struggles of being second year analysts.  That only happened once and can be expected elsewhere in the WEST VILLAGE. The service is great and the people who work here generally keep a very cool head despite having to walk through the somewhat unorganized and sometimes disrespectful group of people in line. Anyway, I never say no when someone suggests Corner Bistro.  I even suggest it myself from time to time.  I'll keep going back.
