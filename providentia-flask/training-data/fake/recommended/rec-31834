I stopped  by before work with my 6 y/o nephew to grab a bite before a long day to just have a very nice time, a good meal, and an excellent service. The food is simple yet with a variety of elements which upgrade the simplicity of well known things as "French Toasts." The place is small but got there before the local crowd got in. Finally the review is more about the service which in my opinion is one of the best I've experienced in a long time. Good job Mr. Chase Redmond who acts as a host, server and general manager. I did not have a server I had a group of people taking care of me and making sure I'd have not just a meal with them but an experience. Everybody was friendly on point and knowledgeable.   I would try this place again, no doubt.
