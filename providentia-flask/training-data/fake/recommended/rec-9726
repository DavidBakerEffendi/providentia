i just looked around and thought "i don't think I can be happier"..... must go for the bo ssam (whole pork butt)! the pork is so tender that it just falls off the bone and trust me i'm cuban i know pork and this is better than any pork i've ever had on christmas eve. we had a party of 8 people and we sat there for two hours until it was all done because it was simpley so delicious. it reality you should go with 10 people because I ate more than I do on thanksgiving. tip: must book about a month in advance thru their website and it much easier to snag a reservation for lunch time. best meal i've had in manhattan hands down!
