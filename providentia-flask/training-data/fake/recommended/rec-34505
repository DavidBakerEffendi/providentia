I am giving 1 star becuase there is no option for 0 stars. I asked to have a roti made separate from the rest rest of the meal. The servers adamantly refused. We called the maganer and he swore at me.. Do not eat here. This is the worst place to eat ever. Do not spend your money here, you are better off taking a crap on the street and eating it yourself.
