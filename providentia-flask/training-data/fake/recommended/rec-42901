Went there on a Friday night.  So crowded! Three of us got seated at a small cocktail table next to the bar.  People were hanging out at the bar but basically hanging over us.  As a result, service was a bit slow, but not terrible. The staff was attentive and helpful.   As far as the food goes, I had the gnocchi and the cappellini (i'm vegetarian). Both dishes were SO GOOD.  The gnocchi was especially good (one of the best gnocchi dishes I've ever had). The sauce was so savory and delicious and the shitaake mushrooms were perfectly cooked.  The cappellini was the right amount of buttery and the red chillies were a great touch. We tried two desserts - the chocolate milk cake and the cheesecake. The cheesecake was really good. The chocolate milk cake was decent.   The drinks were delicious! Overall, I think it is worth coming to the place if you are willing to deal with the  fact that it is really crowded.
