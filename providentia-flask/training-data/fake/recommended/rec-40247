It seems as if their food as fallen off a bit. It's not what it used to be. Their crab Fries were the best. Now the last couple times my ram y and I were there, they were soggy like they were sitting out for a while. The beer hasn't been down to temp (warm). I don't know what it is about the sandwiches I can't really pinpoint it, but they aren't Â as good as the past.I have to give it to them for their king crabs they are always great. The service has seemed to be falling off. Maybe in a whole the food quality and service reflects the management. I'm not sure. I just hope they get back to the way things were in the past.
