I ordered some catered food from here. The Chicken Abruzzi is wonderful; my guests loved it! I'll give the food five stars...the only problem is watch out for the "hidden charge". When placing my order, I asked if bread came with it and was told,"Yes". Was expecting a FREE baguette or something. My husband picked up the order and was charged $5 for a Panella loaf from Calandra's bakery. Apparently our order wasn't large enough to warrant the bread and utensils reserved for a larger catering job. Not good.
