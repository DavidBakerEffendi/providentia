This used to be a less than mediocre Irish pub. My wife and I had a burger here previously and it was a joke. When we saw an advertisement for a meatball restaurant that also served beer, we were excited. Punched the address in the GPS, only to pull up in front of the place we previously didn't care for. A vinyl banner was put over the original pub's name. We figured we'd give it a shot. Once inside, it became clear that it was still the same place, with simply a new name. Still the exact same drunk retired construction workers at the bar, being loud and obnoxious, harassing the bar tender and dropping two loud F-bombs in every sentence, for everyone in the establishment to clearly overhear. We were there, hungry, and took a table anyway. We ordered fried cheese bites (forgot the exact name) for appetizer and to our surprise, they were delicious. I had a classic meatball sandwich and that also was really tasty. My wife had the smashed balls sandwich with spicy sauce and loved it as well. We might go back. However, the ambiance really needs a makeover. The place hasn't changed one bit, except a new chef. I'd go here for the food, but would never consider it for a dinner with friends or a nice night out. We were the only eating customers at 6pm on a Thursday. There was a handful of older gentlemen at the bar, as described above. If it wasn't for the appetite for a nice meatball sandwich, we would have made a 180 upon setting one foot inside. A younger, hipper crowd would probably never consider this place, which is a shame with the now great food. We'll be back, though.
