I'd give it 4 stars for decor, its the food they need to work on. Brunch started inauspiciously when we were told they were out of bacon. The coffee situation-- single-cup, double- or large-size French press containers only-- struck me as a petty extra expense and overly restrictive. The digital timers they put on the coffee carafes, while a delightful refinement in theory, forced us to listen to them detonating periodically all around the restaurant. My mushroom, egg, potato, cheese dish was just that-- a series of ingredients in a bowl, neither terrible nor particularly good. More dramatic was the side sausage. My first bite practically conjured the animal and its enclosure right there at the table with its unnerving gaminess. Others pronounced the bluefish waffle dry and the carbonara undistinguished. With the bill coming to $35/person (including tip) for our table, I'd say brunch here is an eminently skippable experience. addendum: I guess brunch just started here so perhaps they are still ironing out the creases...
