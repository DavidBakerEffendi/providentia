came for brunch.  it's a decent deal at $18 for a drink and a brunch entree. I had the nutella french toast and it was quite good.  not as sloppy as i imagined it would be.  the bellini i ordered really sweet (too sweet for me).   my friends really liked the shandy and the burger.   The side of bacon I ordered was excellent.  Very crispy and flavorful. Portions were adequate.   The main reason i wouldn't rate 4 stars is the wait time/seating process.   1) it's crowded, so its tough getting a group in there since its so popular 2) waiting sucks. We showed up on saturday at noon and were told it was a 1.5 hour wait for a party of 5.  I get it, it's peak brunch time at a well reviewed restaurant.   So we left a number and went around the corner to see if we could find anything with a more reasonable wait.  We hit up some spot on 3rd bet 28th and 29th and are just about to sit when we got a text saying a spot opened up and we had to get there in 5 mins to secure our table.  We do so, but when we arrived they tell us we should have checked in so we have to wait some more.  It was confusing.  We got seated about 10-15 mins later.  Service was adequate considering the volume, the staff was definitely working hard. TL;DR - the food is good and price is right but it's not worth waiting over an hour for it.  Larger groups will mean you wait longer.
