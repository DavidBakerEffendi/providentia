I kept hearing about this restaurant & how great the food is, so I decided to treat my boyfriend. As I've mentioned before he is a tough critic and he loved everything. I also enjoyed everything I ordered. The tasting desserts are a must and great for two people. The service was fantastic! I also liked the energy, it wasn't too loud and it was classy but not stuffy, and nice but still casual. However my boyfriend said the 2nd time he went with his friend that is wasn't as great but still very good. I will definitely go back.
