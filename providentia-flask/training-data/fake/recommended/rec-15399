Good bar. I really enjoyed the beer I had. I was looking forward to the parmesan wings, that looked great on some photos on Yelp, but to be honest I wasn't crazy about them at all. They were thin and meh. The BBQ ones were much better. I also wasn't a fan of their shoe string fries which is a surprise because fries are almost always good.
