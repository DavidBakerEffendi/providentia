I'm not a fan of places with glitzy decor like Room Service.  There's some kind of cognitive dissonance between the food I'm eating at the ambiance of the place.  Regardless, seating was well spaced out (the chairs suck though), service attentive, and food delicious.  Food, of course, is the most important thing at any restaurant and Room Service delivered. Surprisingly, for such an [attempted] elevated environment, the food wasn't that expensive.  Probably the only thing that I felt was a ripoff was the mojito I got.  It was good and boozy... but yeah, a mojito is a drink anyone can make at home so now that I think about it, I'm not even sure why I got it. This place, because it's in Hell's Kitchen and kind of hip, usually has a wait for tables.  I'm not sure what their reservation policy is but if you're going with a date the wait shouldn't be that long.  Order yourself a silly mojito while you wait on your date.  It's definitely a decent date spot.  I was seated in a dark nook, which was kinda cool.  Dark nooks attract, or at least can let you get away with, certain kinds of behavior.  Yeah so, ladies meeting their first okcupid date at this place... serial gropers will be even more encouraged in this dimly lit restaurant! lulz.
