I honestly feel if I give Balthazar a bad review someone in a European fitting black suit, black leather gloves, no socks and Gucci loafers will show up in the middle of the night and put a bullet in my head. I'm one of those New Yorkers who needs either an invite or passport to travel above 23rd street so SoHo organically becomes my NYC home and some of the better known haunts become my urban kitchen. Balthazar is one of those kitchens. Being French myself (though not having been back to France in more then twenty years) I can't say honestly that the bistro reminds me of hard bread, smoking women and skinny, non threatening men like the true French experience Â and that's because Balthazar is filled with celebrities, snobby New Yorkers and never wash too often Europeans. All that evil pales in comparison to the New York ad people who frequent that place for their free lunch or meal care of their Agency. But you don't come to Balthazar to eat the people, you come to eat the food which more then just a bit good. Nothing stands out but it's not to say that nothing is exceptional. Rather, everything is equally very good and nothing all that remarkable. 'cept maybe the check which makes you wonder if the restaurant is helping pay down France's national debt by charging so much...even for SoHo.
