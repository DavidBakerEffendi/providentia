WooHoo everytime I go to the Reading Terminal Market i have to go get me some DiNics! Its one of the best sandwiches i've ever had! It was also voted Best sandwich in America! Get here early b/c they almost ALWAYS run out of the Broccoli Rabe. The best way to have it is to get the Roasted Pulled pork with the Hot peppers, fresh parmesan, broccoli rabe, and extra juice! Its the perfect sandwich as it has the meat, dairy, and greens! Dont miss out on it! HIGHLY recommend it!
