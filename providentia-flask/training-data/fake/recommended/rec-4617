If you love sushi, hibachi and pricing deals...you'll love Kumo. Kumo is conveniently located on Elm and State Street in Downtown New Haven. The ambience is semi-dress/casual but it depends on which night you visit. The size of the restaurant is great and features several hibachi tables, sushi bar. drink bar, and separate booth/table dining area. But let's get down to the nitty-gritty. I have yet to have a sushi roll that I did not find appetizing and I've only done the hibachi once but it was really entertaining and the food was delicious. The hibachi can be a little pricey but you are paying for someone to entertaining you with food right as you are sitting. The menu has a wide variety of hand-made rolls, sashimi, and entrees. But the best thing is the 50% off all sushi and sashimi. The current sign says all day Sunday, but I have had the pleasure of benefiting from the discount on a Friday and Saturday. Call ahead to check on the pricing, and if you are planning for a hibachi night make a reservation. The one downside to Kumo is the herd of people who ambush that staff for the hibachi, typically on Fridays and Saturdays. There is a lot of sake flowing so the patrons tend to stay over their typical dining time. So I recommend getting their for an early dinner or trying to make an early reservation. The later into the evening the more likely the longer wait. P.S. The parking lot in the back is a little small but there is street parking...just like everywhere else in downtown.
