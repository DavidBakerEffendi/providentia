Went on a weeknight for the happy hour scene. No real happy hour specials, however that is literally the only negative about this place. AMAZING thin crust pizza, I went with a pepperoni and onion pie. Also tried the house brewed blonde ale as well as the amber ale, both great and very fresh. Will definitely be back to check out the fri/sat night scene as it looked like a place that really rocks with a good bar area and then separate dance area. Cant wait to get back!
