The 2-stars is for the sever we had and although the foods is ''good", I've had better. The server is this little blond girl who walked around with a major arrogant snotty attitude (ugh, who needs that when you go out to enjoy the evening).  At one point she even did a "wave-off' hand gesture to my boyfriend as if disregarding him off.  I've been a server and one should be gracious.. after all the guest are paying your bills.  If it was me paying the bill I NEVER would've given her the 20% my boyfriend left her.  He just chalks it us to: WE WON'T BE BACK AGAIN
