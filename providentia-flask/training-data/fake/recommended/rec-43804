Best Vietnamese food in the Burlington area. Portions are generous and affordable. I've yet to try something that wasn't absolutely delicious. The banh mi sandwiches are a fantastic deal. Â Other favorites include the Pho Bo beef noodle soup, the Nepali style house special chow mein and the hand made dumplings. Good options for vegetarian and gluten free folks.
