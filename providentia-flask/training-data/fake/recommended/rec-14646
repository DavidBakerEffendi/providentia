Everyone and their mother's co-worker's cousin's mother-in-law's step brother talks about Lombardi's like it's the BEST pizza in the world. It's not! After all I've read and heard about it from reviews and people, I decided to eat here during my stay in NYC in early September 2009. The place was packed! Thank God the wait time was only 15 minutes or I would've dodged out of there. There's only 2 real choices: Gennaro's Original Pizza and Gennaro's White Pizza. We ordered the original, half with cheese & pepperoni and other half with cheese & tomatoes (because I don't eat meat). I have had SO MUCH better. The sauce was lacking flavor, there was barely any cheese, and the pizza overall wasn't baked well. I've tasted better pizza in New York New York Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. I thought I'd have better pizza in the real New York, but I guess not. Also, the fountain drinks are not bottomless, this is just absurd to me! I had to slowly drink my root beer so I didn't run out. There's also a Cash Only policy which is crazy! They'd make so much more money if they accepted debit and credit cards. The wait staff were not friendly, but not mean either. They just took our order and never really bothered to ask us for anything else. The pizza here is not at all special in my book. What a waste.
