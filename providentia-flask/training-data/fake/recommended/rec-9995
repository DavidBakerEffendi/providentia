Empanadas delivered to your door 24 hours a day?  This is absolutely BRILLIANT.   I cannot tell a lie, I consumed said empanadas while under the influence of many an adult beverage at 2am.  But, that being said, these were the best empanadas I've ever had (and I've had my fair share!).  My absolute favorite was the Americano.  I realize this isn't the classiest combination ever but holy hotdog, Batman, it was amazeballs.  I was also a big fan of the Viagra.  There was a whole shrimp inside mine, not to mention all the other seafood goodness.   I'm sad we don't have an Empanada Mama in Chicago.
