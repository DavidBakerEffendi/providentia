The food here is excellent.  The mussels and prosciutto pizza were both delicious, leaving little to be desired.  However, the wine here is just awful.  The waiter's own recommendations were awful, including a red which was mistakenly served warmer than room temperature.  It's a shame that in spite of good food, my dining experience could be so diminished by poor drink.
