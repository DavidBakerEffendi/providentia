We were excited about this place after reading all the reviews.  I know my fair share of authentic Chinese (LA, NY, and even lived in China) - and this place SUCKS.  The noodles have no flavor.  The beef is so-so at best.  And the place has a stench smell to it.  Don't waste your time to come here.  There's TONS of other places you can go instead
