Came here around lunch time today after much anticipation. Overall, a very solid pizza place. What I loved: the crust! So thin and crispy (but not overly so)! Probably the best crush I've had, beating even some of the most delicious pizzas I've had in Italy. What I didn't quite enjoy: we had the Nepoletana, which is the margherita pizza with anchovies. Â The anchovies were REALLY salty (well, they are anchovies, after all), but it was somewhat overpowering. We also got the mixed salad, which wasn't anything to write home about. They only accept cash and AMEX.
