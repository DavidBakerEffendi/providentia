This new place opened up around the corner, and it looked pretty interesting (the name, I mean, of course).  The host and waiter were funny and entertaining, and the food did not disappoint.  It was indeed salty and fatty.  Bacon flavored popcorn to start the meal was amazing, and I don't even like bacon!!
