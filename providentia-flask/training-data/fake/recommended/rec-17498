The place was extremely busy (which I hear is normal) and I was waiting to be seated on a narrow staircase with my friends.The owner came up to me and we had an amazing conversation about global politics. Not only did he constantly compliment me, he offered me a $100 voucher for use at the restaurant on my next visit !! ! When I told him I was with 3 other people and if he would make it 4 $25 ones (so I could give one to all of my friends) he did that with no problem. He then personally sat us with his favorite waiter and made me a special meal (since what I originally wanted was not available) which was delicious. Amazingly delicious Cuban food. Everything from the steak to the empanadas to the plantains were seasoned perfectly. It is BYOB but they can make drinks from what you bring. Â  Although it was busy we felt as if we were the only table there. The owner even walked us to the door and made us promise to return. Wonderful experience. I will be going back with my friends.
