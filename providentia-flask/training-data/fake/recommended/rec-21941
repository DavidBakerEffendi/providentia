Do not come here!!!! This is my new favorite resturant and I'd hate to have to wait because I recommended this goldmine.. This place is amazing, it serves as a Â warm comfortable and extremely clean atmosphere. The staff is kind, friendly, fast, efficent and talented. Everything comes served on fire, or scolding hot! If you want to play with your food, or have fun, this is the place. This is amazing as a first date resturant or if your trying to impress someone. The steak on a stone, is the most dinner fun I've ever had. Do not dress to impress, because you will oil stain your clothes ( a little) but its well worth it!!!! The parking sux! but that is the only down side! The food is incredible, the service is upbeat! You will go home stinking of meat, but you will have the time of your life. I never had so much fun at dinner. GO, GO, GO!!! but make reservations before hand! Steak on a stone - YUM!!! I'm going again next wknd - Its my new favorite joint! so cozy, and wonderful. Wished I knew about this place a long time ago! PS - Make sure you never come here, so I will never have to wait!
