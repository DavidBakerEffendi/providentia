This review is purely based on brunch. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! After reading fellow Yelp reviews, my friend and I ordered the bread basket. Please note that it's not just bread. It has donut holes, mini muffins, banana bread, scones and other delicious mouth watering sweet goodness. I ordered their fried chicken on sweet potato waffles. The key is gravy. They smother it and it's absolutely delicious!!!!!!! Waffles were a little bland and not what I was expecting (I was expecting waffles to be completely made up of sweet potato, but it wasn't), but their gravy just makes everything better. Also, I had their salad and omelet. Perfectly seasoned and cooked and light. I highly recommend it with the fried chicken because it's heavy. GO FOR BRUNCH! It's a really cute place, layout is nice and how can you say no to bread basket filled with goodies?!
