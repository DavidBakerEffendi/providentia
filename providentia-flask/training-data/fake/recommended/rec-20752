My friend told me to try their chicken over rice, I did, it was amazing! And now I keep going back! They have actually more than one cart. There are usually one long line for the cart on 6th & 53rd, but no line for the other two closely adjacent, one on broadway and 53rd, the other on the other side of 6th & 53rd, Â you just need to make sure they are the same people wearing the same uniform. The portion is so big, I usually get one bowl for two meals. It's still delicious the next day after you heat it with microwave. Seriously one of the best thing in NYC
