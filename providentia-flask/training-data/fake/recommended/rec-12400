I went there for early dinner, and the place is almost fullpack. Once we finished, there was a long line to get a table. So i read reviews that they serve big portion, and its very true. So me and my sister decided to just order 1 pasta, linguine ala vodka sauce and it tasted delicioso!! The sauce was just perfect and too die for. The price is also reasonable, one portion will cost you around $28, you'll able to share with 3-4 if its me. We ended up took took the rest of pasta to hotel. We wanted to come back before heading home to try another menu, but we didnt make it. Service was good, so if you're in nyc please make a stop at carmines.
