Man, this place is great. Just go settle up at the bar, have a drink, and have Sweet Lou drop some knowledge on you. Everytime I've been here I've had an incredible time and its, by far, the best happy hour in the city (in my humble opinion.) Also checkout the burger special which changes every week...it's available Tuesday and Wednesday and features a whopping, amazing burger (with a cheeky name) a beer and a shot for $15. You can thank me later.
