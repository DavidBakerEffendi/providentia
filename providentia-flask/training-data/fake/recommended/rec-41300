With waits of over an hour it is pretty obvious Chuko doesn't need anymore glowing reviews.  Still, here is one more.  I love this restaurant.  The ramen here is deeply flavorful and the sides perfectly prepared.  This place is my comfort food spot in the hood and my wife and I go here more than is healthy.   Here's what you should do:  Go to Chuko.  Put your name on the list.  Smile when they tell you its going to be an hour and then go across the street to the Weatherup and get a cocktail.  Johnny's Manhattan is cocktail perfection.  Sip manhattan until Chuko calls.  Then walk back across the street and order the kale salad, the brussels sprouts, the pickles, and the kimchi ramen.  Eat so much you think you are going to die.  Then finish off the broth.  Go home, lay on the couch and rub your stomach.  Trust me, you won't regret it. So, so good.
