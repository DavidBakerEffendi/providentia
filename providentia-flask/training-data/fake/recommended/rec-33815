Quality Sweets is a small restaurant hidden away within the chaos of Isleins Oak Tree Rd. They have the most beautifully decorated, delicious, melt in your mouth mithai EVER. One can simply never go wrong with choosing from the wide assortment of mithai Quality Sweets offers. Also, they have a great variety of snacks and appetizers to choose from such as samosa chaat, papri chaat, dosa, etc. The papri chaat here is amazing! I've tried papri chaat at every restaurant I've been to and will have to say, this place beats them all. It has just the right texture, taste, ingredients and amount of condiments.
