The food here was amazing...heaven in your mouth!! Due to the large crowd I had to wait about 45 minutes to be seated, but it was worth the wait. The service was great, the food came fast and the place was nice and cozy!! I definitely plan to return...ooh, please try the Creme Brulee French Toast!!
