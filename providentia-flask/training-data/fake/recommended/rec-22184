The food is fine, slightly over priced, but fine. There was a mix up at the bar over our drink order and when we complained the manager, he took the bar tenders word and charged us for the mistake. I have worked in the service industry, I get that its a pain to deal with miscommunications, but there is a reason there is the saying the "customer is always right" exists. There are lots of other places I can meet my girlfriends for dinner and it won't be at Heirloom.
