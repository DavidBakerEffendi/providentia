The owner is so very warm and accommodating ...which in my opinion is the first thing that draws someone to like a place. I was here during a Thursday mid-morning/afternoon, while waiting to be seen by my customer, and Almas prepared a delicious late breakfast-to-lunch foods. There is wi-fi available, clean restroom upstairs (where there are dining area tables available). Great Ethiopian coffee she adjusted to accommodate the American palette. Great Pandora station for easy-going music.  And of course I tried the vegetable platter and specially loves the split pea and savory lentils. The beets were also nice way to offset the chickpea and red lentil(?) which had a bit of heat.  A nice vegetarian platter if you come hungry, or appetizer for two. Alma says that there is also a 2nd location in Norristown which I will make a point to visit when I am in that area. Thanks for a pleasant dining experience :)
