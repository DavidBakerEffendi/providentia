I usually get my banh mi (not bahn mi) fix at Saigon. The Chinatown joint is good but they are nothing compared to Xe May. Since I have always love pork on my sandwiches, I had to try the "Super Cub Classic." It is the first listed item on their sandwiches menu and is made up of barbecued pork, pork roll, headcheese and pate with daikon radish, pickled carrot, cucumber, fresh cilantro, spicy mayonnaise, jalapeno, black pepper and optional sriracha. The meats were moist and incredibly tasty. The fact that it was not too greasy made it even better. It was different from the traditional meat and I liked how they were thinly sliced and encased by the perfectly toasted baguette. I love the crunchiness of the fresh bread because it was really savory, and yet it wasn't too hard to scrape the top of my mouth. Believe it or not, the crumbs flew out of my mouth during each bite. I actually felt sorry for the people that had to clean up my mess. Even though the sandwiches are a good size and adequate enough to fulfill a lunch or dinner appetite, I would love to see a higher meat-to-bread ratio in the future. Must try the whole wheat baguette as well (which was sold out during my visit). Can't get enough of meat and fiber! With all due respect to the traditional banh mi, the best sandwiches these days are the ones with a variety of creative flavors. You can find them here. For those of you who love new-style banh mi sandwiches, this is the place to be. Xe May deserves 5-stars for the great food at the right price with awesome service. I would definitely come back to try the tacos, salads, sides and the exotic drinks. And of course, the yummy sammies!
