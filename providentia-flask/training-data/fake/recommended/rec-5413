I had their seasonal pumpkin pasta dish with assorted squash and andouille sausage. A bit pricey at $19 but it was good. The portion was good as it gave me a satisfying dinner and a small bit for lunch the next day. The flavors were in such autumn harmony. This was the first time I've had a meal here but I have stopped by for a drink a few times and they were good and the bar tenders have always been attentive and creative with suggestions if I wanted to try something new.
