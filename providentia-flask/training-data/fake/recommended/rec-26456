A must for any burger-phile! *This place is cash only but they have an ATM in the establishment. Beware of the high ATM fee. I'm not saying this will be the best burger you'll ever have (I'll reserve that for when I invite you to dinner), but it's definitely worth trying. For $8, you get a generous sized patty in-between two buns struggling to keep it inside. The patty itself is juicy (I get mine medium rare) and has a wonderful grilled flavor. What makes Bistro Burger so special is its no-frills concept. It doesn't have fancy toppings or surprise-ingredient fillings. It doesn't have seasoned buns (which one reviewer was expecting). But it's the simple-but-done-well concept that makes it so great. Nothing takes away or distracts from its savory, juicy, plump patty. Last words: Bring cash. And I like soggy fries (fries sold separately). Don't come here expecting the universe out of an $8 burger. It doesn't try to be something it's not and it's comfortable with who it is: "I'm just a burger, standing in front of a boy/girl, asking him/her to love me." Take it for what it is!
