it has truly been awhile since i was really excited about the inventiveness of a chef in philadelphia.  sure, i've been to a lot of restaurants that make good dishes...and i go back to them to eat those dishes.  but petruce was different: i tried things i was apprehensive about, and they were all amazing.  i'm not a chicken liver fan -- i've tried it easily ten times before...and there was always something about the graininess or gaminess of it that put me off.  this was totally different in both regards, and the pickled rhubarb and fresh sourdough it's served with is incredible.  the flavors and composition of each of the seven dishes we had were spot-on (head lettuce, sweet potato, beef tartare, chicken liver, lamb ribs, chorizo, and spanish mackerel).  i moved to philly in 2001, and this is one of the best meals i've ever eaten in the city.
