The service here is definitely not the greatest and the workers can be rude at times. However, I am able to look passed all that because the food here is very good for a diner, in my humble opinion. I've been to tops diner, state street diner, tick tock diner etc. Nevada has to be up there, maybe not the best, in terms of quality of food.
