Classy, friendly, warm place with excellent greek food. The lamb is excellent -- most, flavorful, and tasty. Dipping sauces are well seasoned and good. The fish though is a little hit-or-miss; mine was Â on the dry side and not as good as some of the other dishes they have. Nice wine list of greek wines.
