Tried the lobster mac+cheese from their stand at the little food market at Herald Square today.  It's amazing, perfect, last-meal-worthy...but -1 star for a few shell bits in there.  There were about 5 pieces of lobster meat in mine, but 3 of them were ENTIRE claws.  I was impressed.  Is that $12 worth of lobster? maybe not but...I can't be mad.  I'll be mad when I've finished my leftovers and want more.
