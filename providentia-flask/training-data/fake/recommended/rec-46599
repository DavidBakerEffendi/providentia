Delicious, fresh & healthy food! Everything in their store is gluten-free, which includes the pita chips, wraps & cookies! It's pretty self explanatory, choose a base (black rice, spinach salad or wrap), choose a 'protein' (grilled veggies, chicken, steak, falafel or tuna), Â choose up to three toppings & two sauces. I actually had four toppings, which was $.75 additional (no biggie). I chose black rice, falafel, beets, cauliflower, feta & cucumber/tomato salad, with tzatziki & lemon tahini sauces (plus a side of hummus & pita chips). I'm not one to usually go for healthy & gluten-free, but I'm really glad I came here. Everything I ate was delicious! My only 'negative' comment is I'm disappointed in their lack of a drink selection. They have a variety of unsweetened iced teas & lemonade, and the menu says they sell homemade sodas, however I didn't see any in the drink cooler behind the counter, nor was I offered any when asking about drinks. Not sure if they just were sold out of their sodas, or were trying to sell their iced teas. Although they did have a water cooler with small cups (for free water) on the window counter by the entrance. Overall, a great place for lunch & I will definitely be back (just maybe with my own beverage to drink)!
