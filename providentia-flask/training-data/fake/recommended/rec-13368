This review is for delivery. Order placed via Seamless. 7:24pm Estimated Delivery time: 45-60 minutes 9:15 I call to find out where my order is, I'm told my order is "out for delivery" 10:05pm My freezing cold food is delivered. I understand things happen and they gave me a delivery window. What makes this order from the Smith extra painful is the mandatory tip required. I always tip well, but when you take 2.5 hours to make a delivery (10 (ten) blocks away, something is wrong here. There is NO incentive for them to make a prompt delivery of hot food because they get paid regardless. Avoid at all costs.
