This was a decent place to get lunch.  We had ribs and pulled pork sandwiches and both were delicious.  The ribs came with a choice of two sides, my friend chose the potato salad (a little on the eggy side) and very tasty coleslaw.  Lunch for two totaled less than 15 dollars. This place gets two stars because it was dirty.  There were flies everywhere and that could easily turn someone off from wanting to eat a meal.  The owner and service was fine.  Overall it was a reasonable and tasty lunch experience.
