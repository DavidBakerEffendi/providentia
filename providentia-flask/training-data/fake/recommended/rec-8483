Crab cake sandwich was awesome! Aioli on the side was spicy and delish. Crab fries with cheese dip were yummy and plenty for 4 gals to share. Friends got philly cheesesteak and buffalo chicken cheesesteak-very good. Saw several kids and families there on a Saturday evening.  Service was good....they serve as the food is ready so one of us was just getting our food while the others were almost done....no biggie but just be aware.  Would definitely return.
