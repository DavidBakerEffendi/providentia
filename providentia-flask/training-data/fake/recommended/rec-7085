Lovely atmosphere, great service! I went with my husband and we had a great time, waiters were very caring and offered us some good advice on wines. We shared some appetizers, one main dish and dessert. I loved the zucchini pancakes and the ratatouille. The shrimp casserole was really good but a bit to heavy for my taste, a bit too oily. The chocolate and raspberry cake was very nice. Â  The menu has so many inviting options that is hard to choose what to order :) I will come back again!
