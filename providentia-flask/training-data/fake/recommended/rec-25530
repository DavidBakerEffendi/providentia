we were strolling in New Haven and found this on Yelp.  Very happy we went!  you go here for the drinks and stay for the food.  The drinks are not your normal bar drinks...  very different but delicious combinations that feature the liquor not the mixers...  Had an Old Fashioned that was out of this world..  also recommend the Sazerac!   if you like bourbon or whiskey you will not be disappointed.    The kitchen has extremely limited capabilities so the food menus was not extensive.  we had the BBQ meat pie which was excellent but a touch overpriced at $9.00  Other than that, the service was awesome.  Really enjoyed our time here and can't wait to come back!
