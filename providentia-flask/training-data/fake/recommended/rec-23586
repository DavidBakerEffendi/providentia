Decent food and the warm cozy atmosphere during a VT winter is really inviting. The onion soup and beef bourguignon was definitely good, as was the service. With that said although the food was good I don't think I will be reminiscing about this place when I think about the best French restaurants I have ever been to. I would also say that the price, although not ridiculously expensive, was somewhat surprising for Burlington. Overall a good experience, and a solid three stars.
