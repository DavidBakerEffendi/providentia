My go to place whenever I want to eat "healthy-ish" and want to eat good.  It's just chicken after all right? *just ignore the grease and the awesomely delicious green sauce* Green Sauce? did someone say green sauce? I have friends who put that on everything.  Forget frank's hot chili peppers.  Green sauce goes on everything! My friend even puts it just on rice. Anyways, great food.  Best chicken in the city.  Great side options, good sangria, and also love their ceviche. The restaurant has an awesome vibe and decor - great place to bring a date or celebrate a friend's birthday or what not.  Even if its just chilling at the bar, this place is great! Little hint: take-out is a lot cheaper than going to the restaurant - not sure why, but no complaints.
