No complaints. Food, ambiance, wine, staff and attention to detail were superb. 10 Nutella stuffed donuts instead of 5 would be the only thing my boyfriend and I would change. Sommelier Jordan extremely helpful and approachable. Waitstaff Matt and Sarah personable, knowledgeable and flawless. Buonissimo.
