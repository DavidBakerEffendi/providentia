Went here for labor day brunch. While they're brunch menu isn't a big jump from their regular menu they do have some nice dishes. I had their Burger Deluxe with bacon, chedder and special sauce. It was a pretty standard burger but exactly what I was hoping for, thick cut bacon that you could actually taste and cheese strong enough to contribute to the burger and not be over powered. The rest of my party got the bucket of mussels which was devoured and the BLT+E with the egg being the "brunch" portion. We all agreed that the fries were very nicely done. All in all a place that I will likely go back to, but have to check out a few more places first.
