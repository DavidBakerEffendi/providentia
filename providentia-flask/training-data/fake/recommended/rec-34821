I think I am a bit of a snob when it comes to certain cuisines, and Thai is one of them. I experienced the real deal in Thailand and ever since have not found anything comparable. Therefore, any review of a Thai restaurant is going to be amazingly biased! But I shall continue to strive for near objectiveness. I've walked by Room Service numerous times but never made the journey to a table. Decided the time had come. A friend from overseas requested Thai food, so I took a shot in the dark and brought us to Room Service. The decor and ambiance is great, half night club, half wanna be sex party. It has all the nuances of a trendy restaurant in Chelsea. But it's also unique in the fact that it dives head first into the idea that you are eating at a hotel. Cool digs. The food was in fact. Damn good! Ordered some Pad Sai Eew and Pad Thai, as well as, a few other appetizer items, including dumplings. Once they arrived I was shocked. The pad thai was HUGE overpowering the plate and delicious too! Everything was hot and nicely prepared. Not too much peanut and not too much spice. It was definitely some one of the best Thai I had in NY. But not THE best. Overall, I'd definitely recommend it someone looking for a fun and trendy place to grab Thai in Chelsea.
