Wow, what an amazing meal! We got the marrow, sweetbreads, asparagus w duck, and grilled trout. Even though the items on the menu were familiar classics, every plate was creative, surprising, and fun to eat. Service was great, decor is really nicely done, and cocktails were strong 'n tasty. I can't wait to come back!
