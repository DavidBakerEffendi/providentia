Room Service is among the more decnet/hip Thai restaurant out there. Food is only worth a 3.5 star-- mediocre, nothing too impressive (seriously, Yelp should have 0.5 star increments, I've seen so many 3.5 star reviews ...) YET I am giving Room Service a 4 stars for its superb services. I went here with my family for the first time. Intrigued by the expansive menu, we picked quite a few dishes from almost each section of the menu (think app + curry + salad + noodle... ) After a long day wandering in the city, we had really big appetites. Yet when the 4th dish was served, we realized that we'd overestimated our capacity. So I asked our waiter if the kithcen had prepared the curry chicken. He saw that "full" was written on our faces AND he OFFERED to cancel that dish all together! What a pleasant surprise. Clearly they are investing in long term customer base, which I believe is the only viable way to do business.
