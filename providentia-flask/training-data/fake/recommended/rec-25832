I would have loved to have given them 4 stars...except...well...they kinda...forgot about me. I'm in town on business and I find this place on Yelp. Great, I thinks, a little out of the way Italian place. And the food lived up to the 4-star reviews. Delicious, fresh, garlicky. Awesome. But then it got busy. And then they forgot about me. Sure..I'm dining alone...but how did they know I wasn't ready to drop a chunk of change. No water refill. No bread. No one to ask if I wanted a second glass of wine. Wine!!  Disappointing. My meal was delicious.  Maybe next time I'll have to ask some stranger on the street to eat with me.
