Lived in this neighborhood for 10 years and was never enticed to walk into any of the restaurant reincarnations that have inhabited this corner. But no more.  The fam had a really good meal here tonight.  Hubby is a total beer snob, and was soooo happy with the beer selection (and his chicken pot pie).  I had the special:  grilled shrimp on a bed of velvety polenta with mushrooms, tomatoes and capers --really good! Also enjoyed the beet salad and awesome chocolate cake for dessert (three huge layers of super moist cake with a thin, only slightly sweet vanilla icing--enough to take half home with us). Nice, comfortable atmosphere, too.  We will definitely be back.
