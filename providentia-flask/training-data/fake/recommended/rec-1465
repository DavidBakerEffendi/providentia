"OMG! OMG! OMG! " consider that said, repeatedly yet not manic or  loudly.  More like slowly waking up from a dream that you still can't wrap your head around, it was that good.  I wonder if I should wait longer before writing anything about this place, as I feel like it's possible I was secretly drugged with happy pills(?)   So I tried a number of FDR dishes I shared with a friend tonight and each one kept appearing as perfect as can be.  The scallops and black pudding, the gnocchi and snails, the sunchoke and pear puree with smoked trout... the skate and coconut curry, the pork extravaganza ... it was all amazingly rich and flavorful and yet somewhat light - as heaven should be.  OK, OK Im sounding a bit too much like I'm still on the food high, which I am I suppose, but even the galumpki on the pork dish was incredibly light and wonderful. Basically we over-ordered and still couldn't resist dessert.  The camembert ice cream atop the toasted spongecake was seductive - you could pretty much see cartoon, throbbing hearts in my eye. The portions are generous for the quality here so beware not to over order, just visit often! OK I'll shut up now.  Im done professing my love for the best meal Ive had in a long time.... and I eat embarrassingly too often to admit with any truth.
