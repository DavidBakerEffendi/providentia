Another fantastic Astoria brunch spot! If you come here, you need to get a panini. It's what they're known for!  They just taste so cheesy, warm and fresh! I have never had a bad panini there.  Also their crostinis are delicious too! I had one once that was topped with mortadella, rosemary aioli, and parmesan cheese.  It tasted as good as it sounds.  The decor of the place gives it a very cozy vibe.  Most of it is made out of wood and there is an outdoor area which is great to sit at in the summer time.  They have a great beer list too!
