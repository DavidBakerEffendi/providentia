Eating good on the cheap in the city? hells yes! This tiny establishment has a nice selection of dumplings to make your heart smile. On the day I visited Prosperity, it was raining outside and very crowded so I wanted something a little more portable to eat. I went with the sesame beef pancake filled with carrots, cilantro and beef. It was a sandwich of tasty ingredients pressed up between 2 pillowy pieces of bread. One bite and I knew I had made the right choice. It was delicious and quite filling for just $1.75. If you have a chance to swing by this place, both your belly and your wallet will be very happy!
