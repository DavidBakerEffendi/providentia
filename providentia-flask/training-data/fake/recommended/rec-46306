Came here with family; 4 adults, 2 kids. Waitresses were very attentive, definitely a laid-back vibe here. Sat in the patio. They have pretty japanese trees & colorful sun umbrellas for shade in the back. Our waitress was really sweet, came by often, had a smile on her face. The food is yummy. Cauliflower is a must. The pancakes were a hit, I had the MOB dog; flank crusty light sweet potato bun, the dog is made with chickpeas, the dressing for my salad was light and tangy, the ice cream is delicious. I have to say, I'm a fan of the chef; she serves yummy, clean tasty food; everything came out in a timely manner, it's very kid friendly; with wooden blocks, etc to play with at the front of the restaurant, nice outdoor patio in the back.
