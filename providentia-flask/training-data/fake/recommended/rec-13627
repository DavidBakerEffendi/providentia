Dare I say it? Don't go truffle everything. It's really overwhelming. Just get the fries OR the burger, don't get both.  However, that being said, the original burger was better than both truffle fries and burger. I kept reaching over for my husband's burger because I loved the parmesean crisp.  I'm also really impressed with how fast they seated us during lunch, which worked out conveniently since it was birthday!   Just like Dan T though, father's office is still my fav.
