Went there for lunch with thee wife couple days ago around 3pm. Place was busy and looked clean, we ordered pizza with eggplant which was good and tasted fresh, I also have to say the dough was really good and the pizza was perfectly cooked. I always get heart burn after pizza but this time I didn't. Waitress was nice and attentive .
