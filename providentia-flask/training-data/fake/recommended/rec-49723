Good brunch place in the city. The place is new and is still not well known so it doesn't have a 2 hour wait list like other places in the area. The decor reminded me of Brooklyn. A hipster vibe. Simple. Casual. No fuss. The food was good. I ordered pancakes and they came with three flavored butters which was cool. My boyfriend ordered the shrimp and grits. I tried some and it was very good. I would defiantly give them 4.5 starts for food. The only reason it is not a 5 is because I have been spoiled with some very good places in Montreal and I am particular about brunch. I liked that the place had good food, pleasant service and a short wait while it was still pretty full.
