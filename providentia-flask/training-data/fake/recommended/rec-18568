I know everyone goes here for brunch, but we went for dinner. It was bustling and loud, but I thought the service we friendly and attentive. They gave us sparkling & filtered water which was actually kind of a nice little bonus. I had the bibimbap which again, was probably not what people usually get, but I loved it and ate the whole thing. I'd go back :)
