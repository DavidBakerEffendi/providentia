My entire time dining here was practically begging for a review. First, I will like to jump on the bandwagon by proclaiming that few can beat the Red, White, and Blue special. AWESOME. The night prior a friend and I had spent the entire evening looking for a place to get oysters that didn't cost an arm and leg and this is the place! AND A DRINK?! I sprung for the house white and it was good for the deal. All in all, $8 for everything that can't be beat. I am guessing the staff also knows the popular allure of their special and scoff at the hoards (such as myself) that come through their doors for it. Basically from the moment I had order the special, the service went from mediocre to terrible. Our waiter barely exchanged more than five words with us and when our orders finally did come out, he basically dropped them on the table. I should have figured with a name like FISH, this was place was going to be a bit pretentious but sheesh! Further, I had to ask for the standard pre-meal bread which is fine with me (it's a busy place) but I couldn't help but think that our waiter was treating us like freeloaders. I can understand as he figured that our grand total of $32 (we got two specials each) was not going to net him as much tip per percentage as other patrons but still, c'mon. Lastly, towards the end of our dinner, a girl next to be briefly screamed as a cockroach made its way from one crevice to another. I know it's NYC and am not sure if the policy is to overlook such things in reviewing, but was definitely something that stuck out (though by no means dismissive of my experience).
