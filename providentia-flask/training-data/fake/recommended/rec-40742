We went to Jones for dinner for the first time tonight. Our wait tress was great and told us all about the specials. She recommended the macaroni and cheese for the app, which was outstanding - just the right amount of crunch! I also tried the blueberry lemonade which was the right blend of sweet and tart. However, I had been looking forward to the Chicken and Waffles for a while, and I was disappointed, very salty, and not quite what I had expected. But my husband got the Chicken Pot Pie, which was excellent. The crust was perfectly flaky, and the vegetables in the pot pie were so fresh and flavorful - it tasted like they just took it right out of the oven. Overall, a very pleasant dining experience. I wish I had saved enough room for dessert!
