Whenever I'm in the East Village, I'm usually bee lining it to the Texas size margaritas that only BBQ's can provide. Unfortunately, the tourists I had tagging along weren't so much into BBQ's style. I am, however, UBER glad we kept walking past BBQ's on St. Mark's and found Cafe Orlin!!!!! From the outside, the cafe doesn't look to be too spacious, but once you head inside you toss that notion out the door! I had to wind my way through the place just to get to the outside seating area (in our case our table was sectioned off from the rest of the outdoor seating which gave it a more private feel!! awesome!!) I ordered the Orlin Burger (wasn't feeling too adventurous). It was a 100% sirloin burger with a blend of Mediterannean spices, served on ciabatta bread! It was DIVINE. I was in heaven!! The salad we got for the table I wasn't too crazy about. It was all arugula, which is pretty much the ONE leaf I don't like. For dessert we had the special of the night which was a warm chocolate cake drizzled with what I think was white chocolate syrup. I'm relatively sure I'd murder for it. Our waitress was extremely friendly, and well, yeah all right I was totally diggin her!!!!! She was from Georgia (country not state), absolutely gorgeous and OH YEAH THIS IS A REVIEW, provided excellent service!! ; )
