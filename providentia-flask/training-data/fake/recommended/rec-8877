Ok, first of all who in there right mind would give this place a bad review?!? I get that opinions are like a--holes, everyone has one and they stink, but if you bash Corner Bistro, you may have to turn in your New York card. This place is a West Village institution. This isn't the Ainsworth - its a old time bar with a great burger. Straightforward, inexpensive, and perfect. Thank god for places like this, as New York City increasingly becomes Duane Reades, Starbucks, and Subways. Order a cheeseburger, fries, and a mug of beer and enjoy the banter. If you are looking for a gourmet meal or a TGI Fridays, you are in the wrong place. This is a classic. Fantastic place
