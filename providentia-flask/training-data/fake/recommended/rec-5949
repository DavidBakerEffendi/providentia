Not impressed.  (Let me first say that I love Greek food and sometimes cook Greek food at home.  No, I'm not Greek, but I feel like I know a thing or two about the cuisine.  Opa!) Went here on a Saturday night and was surprised that it wasn't crowded.  Was it a sign of the economy or the quality of the restaurant?  The saganaki had the look and texture of fried mozzarella sticks.  (When, I believe it should be more grilled than deep fried.)  The cut-up vegetables on the plate (onions, tomatoes, cucumbers) seemed a little dried out.  I ordered the gyro from the dinner menu and was confused to see a pile of meat with french fries --- that's it.  Oh, sorry, a little tub of tzaziki.  I asked about a pita.  Was informed it was 75 cents extra.  Um, isn't a gyro a pita sandwich?  Oh, and for $15, I expected something more than meat and potatoes on a plate. The meat and the french fries seemed overly greasy, as I had quite bad indigestion later that night.  My dinner companion had a vegetarian dish that was "OK" but this person also made the comment that it, too, seemed greasy.   The servers were all pleasant and quick with water refills.  The decor is cute and we joked with the waitress that we had a view of the Aegean from our table, based on how the wall was painted.  I really hate to give them a bad review, as I really wanted to like this place.  I've had gyros a million times better from little hole in the wall places for a fraction of the cost.  I don't understand the high premium on pitas.  I understand wheat prices have gone up, but that's kind of a staple of the cuisine.   I could possibly be persuaded to go again, to be proven wrong, but for now my gastrointestinal system needs to cleanse.
