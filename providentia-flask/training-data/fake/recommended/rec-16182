I feel soooo lucky to have this goldmine right near my apartment but oh man I'll have to force myself not to go too often.  I went a few times last summer for some outdoor wine and cheese (how can you go wrong?!) but when the weather got colder, I forgot about it.  Tonight though, I decided to go back and actually get dinner and I was blown away.  The ambiance was awesome; decorations included framed wine openers and rustic paintings.  The service was perfect; well-informed guidance with choosing wine and the right balance between checking in and letting us dine.  The food (split: ricotta & honey truffle bruchetta, gorgonzola walnut and pear salad, and pesto shells) made you feel like you were actually in italy or at least eating out because even friends who are good chefs could not have made food this good.  Basically, I'm in love.
