i don't know why everyone is talking about how "trendy" this establishment is...it's just dimly lit. i saw people from all walks of life when i stopped in there to inhale a quick chicken pad thai before seeing a movie. we had to wait for about 10 minutes for a party of two so we grabbed a drink at the bar, which you have to pay for before you sit down-they won't add it to your bill. and everything is in cash, which is a slight inconvenience. the food is damned tasty though. typically low lighting lends itself to make me further investigate what is in my meal because i trust no one ( a la x-files ) with my food, but everything seemed to check out. i had a simple chicken pad thai and it came out in about 5 minutes. we made our movie and i was full. simple, fast, tasty, cheap. out bill was $15 without the drinks at the bar! what?!
