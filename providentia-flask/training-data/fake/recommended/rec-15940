Thursday was my second time at Uva and I loved it even more this time. We did not have reservations for dinner, however that was not an issue as the hostess was polite and everyone very hospitable. As we were seated in the beautiful garden section of the restaurant a nice compliment of cheeses were paired with our wine. My main course (Lamb Shank) was a beautiful infusion of flavors with just a touch of grilled polenta. I can't wait to go back, this is my new fav spot. Â  It's not too loud and everyone is friendly. Casual dress is fine. This is a must go to spot. Ciao and enjoy!!
