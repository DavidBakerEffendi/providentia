Nerai is an excellent restaurant. The service is superb and the food is incredible. My friend and I did their lunch Prix Fixe for $36 which includes a starter, entree and dessert. We both ordered different items so we could share. I ordered the Spreads, Organic Chicken Skewer and the Greek Yogurt, and my friend ordered the Greek Salad, the Lamb Chops, and the fruit plate. Everything was delicious. I highly recommend saving some of your appetite for a dessert. Their greek yogurt is the best I've ever had, and pairing it with the fruit plate was ideal, because we could dip the fruit in the yogurt. I will definitely return to Nerai for dinner the next time I'm in NYC.
