I just love this place for breakfast. The staff are friendly and helpful, the food is awesome and the atmosphere is laid back and accommodating. I live in the Seattle area and travel to Philly a couple of times a year for business. I try my best to squeeze in a trip to Sam's Morning Glory for a breakfast sandwich with turkey bacon. So good! Â The homemade ketchup is an added bonus.
