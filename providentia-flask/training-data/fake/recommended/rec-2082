i cannot express enough my deepest appreciation and gratitude to the owners of this place. not only is your wonton ho fun noodle soup so delicious (and addicting), but the prices you charge?...wow, i feel like i'm robbing you. you've come to my rescue many times during the cold bleak winter days of new york...well, except that week you closed up shop for lunar new years... anyhow, mr. or ms. wonton garden...i thank you.
