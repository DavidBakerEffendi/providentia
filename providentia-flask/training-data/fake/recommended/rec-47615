Mozzicatto is amazing.  We drive from far away just to get dessert. We also take people from out of town to let them taste the mouthwatering desserts like cakes and cannoli. Some of our favorites are cookies, ricotta cannoli, whipped cream cake, and gelato. We also crave their pizza.  The tomatoes and crust are delicious.  On top of all the delectable sweets and food, the prices are reasonable.
