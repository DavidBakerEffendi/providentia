Pretty good. Got the Spicy Mang and the Sweet Tree. The Spicy Mang was not good. The mango was hard and pretty tasteless. Maybe they should make this a seasonal roll as ripe mangoes will be harder and harder to come by as the weather gets colder. The Sweet Tree on the other hand was fantastic! Really tasty and fresh. I'd definitely give Beyond Sushi another try. Oh! I also had a cucumber mint lemonade. Yummy!
