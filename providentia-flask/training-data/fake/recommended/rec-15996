Got in after about 30 minute wait.  I was alone, it was a Monday at 2pm, but alas, I GOT IN!!! Had to avert my eyes from the "B" grade on the front window-this is Totto Ramen, so even a "C" and I would have tried it. All in all, delicious.  I had the Miso Ramen and it lived up to the hype.  The delicious pork ball that floats on top disintegrates and flavors the broth expertly.  The hard boiled egg was outstanding-should have ordered extra. Yeah, believe the hype.  Would love to come again with the husband or friends, but I doubt I can wait that long in the cold!!!
