My experience at Continental was completely coincidental. I came here with some friends after deciding not to wait any longer to get into Franklin Mortgage & Investment Co. We were standing in line for almost half an hour and I just decided to walk off and stopped inside Continental to use their restroom. I eventually decided to stay and do not regret my decision at all. My friends and I each ordered a different drink. I had a Pomagarita which came with a shaker that had a couple of refills in it. My drink was also garnished with a twizzler which I thought was pretty cool, and for $10 you just can't lose. The decor in the space was amazing. Very Trendy! The staff were sweet and funny. If i'm back in Philly I will definitely return!
