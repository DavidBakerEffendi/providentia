Spicy pulled pork street tacos are the real deal! Table side guac will not disappoint as well. Wash it all down with a few house margaritas and call it a day. I've also had the Tacos Alambres which are equally as good as the street tacos. I've been here multiple times and never had bad service. Two thumbs up!
