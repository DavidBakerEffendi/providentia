Holy guacamole! Hands down the best guc I have ever had! Get the one with goat cheese, pistachio, and garlic chips; the steak tacos are awesome as well. If you want Â great service request Seth, it's rare I ask a server for their name but he amplified our experience with his warmth. He is a very knowledgeable and courteous gentleman.
