I love the food here, but the service is generally pretty awful. You will wait about 15mins to have your order taken with not so much as a glass of water during lunch. I've watched the staff text or do everything else before taking an order. I've watched customers get up and leave out of frustration because no one took their order or they just simply forgot too. Go for the food but bring lots of time and patience.
