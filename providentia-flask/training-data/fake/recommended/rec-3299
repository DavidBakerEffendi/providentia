Great Atmosphere, Great Service, Great Food, Great Wine.... What else can you ask for on a special night out? A bit pricey, but you already know that going into a place like this so no surprise there. Our waitress was friendly, big smile, and completely knowledgeable on all the wines on the list and helped us find the perfect white for the night, a Riesling, which I might add was 50% off per bottle.  (They are running a special this time of year.)   The staff of any restaurant can either make it or break it for the establishment and she did not disappoint.   Will I be going back?  Ohhh ya!  Not a place I'd go to on the spur of the moment.  I'd save this place for that special occasion, with that special someone. Ocean Prime, downtown Philly, doesn't get much better for a city this size.  Keep up the good work.
