I ordered take out last night.   Let me start with the food - fresh and good.  Can't complain about the quality - we had the maki combo B, Brooklyn roll and spider roll.    There's parking at the back (always a plus if you are a business on Bloomfield Ave in Montclair).   Unfortunately, Nori does not make it to the top of my list because of my front of the house experience (yes, I know, it was takeout - how bad could it have been??).   Well  - I was almost an hour late because of rush hour traffic and the lady behind the counter was obviously annoyed and was making remarks about how I was late  - did I get lost?  Why didn't I answer my phone when they called (they called my work # from caller id when I clearly gave them my cell - which they didn't call).   Apparently, my apology and explanation wasn't enough - she was making remarks to her colleague while I was paying my bill.   So sadly, because customer service is just as important as the quality of food for me -  given the choice - I would rather go somewhere else.
