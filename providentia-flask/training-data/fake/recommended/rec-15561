I came to this restaurant 3 times in the past 5 months and decided to write a review this time. Fair to say is that 2 out of 3 times my dining experience was excellent as well as the wine list. Waitress are knowledgeable and smart, location is cozy and food is very good. My last visit was very disappointing for just 2 reasons: First of the mushroom crostini that were served were uneatable and had no taste. I only had a bite. But that's fine, iI can understand that one dish can happen to be less tasty than another.. But now it's the funny part that crashed my opinion about this place. I was seated at the bar and the bartender (I think his name was Chris) saw that I left the plate and with an obnoxious attitude told me "You don't eat that?"... so I replied I was not cause "I actually didn't like it" and instead of doing something hospitality oriented - i was not expecting anything for free or looking for a free meal at all!!! - he went on with this statement "God, You Europeans make things so difficult sometimes..." and just took the plate very rudely. Â I didn't make any scene cause I was there with another person and didn't want to act rudely as well.. so I let it go.. Now, I don't know this guy, I'm not a regular, I'm not expecting him to get that confident and informal with me. I'm European, I think the restaurant itself has a European attire, so I think that the guy should be trained in serving properly no matter where people are from and be more respectful like his colleagues. Having said that I will pay a visit to the place (and the guy) again giving a second chance, since the management and other people working there deserve it. Luigi
