Somebody, somewhere is going to hate me for not giving this place a 5. Maybe it was all the hype and building-up, but it was kind of a disappointment! Props to the menu - it looked fantastic. A ridiculously large selection of Empanadas (yummy!), as WELL as other food! We enjoyed Bloody Marys and plantain chips with guac while waiting for our food. EVERYTHING was delicious.... ...But when the empanadas came...they were just alright. I've had much better empanadas at even places like Cuba (restaurant) --these were a little dry, a little thrown-together, a little fast-food. We ordered eight empanadas between the three of us, and none were mind-blowing. Service was okay, decor and seating was okay, but nothing was that impressive. I'd come back because it's cheap, fast, and good for groups - you also don't have to "commit" to one main course, because you can build your own meal from a variety of different empanadas. But unbelievably delicious? Nah.
