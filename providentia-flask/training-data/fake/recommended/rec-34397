While doing research for our trip to Burlington and based on the reviews, this place looked like a must visit.  Not sure if we came on an off day or because we ate lunch, but the food did not live up to the hype.  The food was decent but not good enough to make me want to go back for lunch.  That being said, maybe we would have had better luck with breakfast.
