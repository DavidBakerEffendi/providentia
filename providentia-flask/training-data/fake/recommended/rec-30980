I have seen this place alot and finally after a day of footbal in Fairmount Park my husband and I went with our dog. Great ambience right next to the Kelly Drive. There is even a place to sit nd eat wuth your dog. The food is reasonably priced and though a limited selection everything tastes really good. Great place to try after a walk/workout on the Kelly Drive.
