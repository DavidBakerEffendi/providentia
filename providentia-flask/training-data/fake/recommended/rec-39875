I'll keep it simple: -Best ramen we've had on either the east or west coast -Go for lunch, you'll have a lot less of a wait -Don't expect a leisurely, drawn out meal-- your ramen arrives, perfectly al dente, approximately 3 minutes after you order it. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed here. Â Its great.
