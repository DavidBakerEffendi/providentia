I came here with a family member who was a local New Yorker while I was in New York for a business trip. I had a delicious cocktail, the truffle oil Mac n cheese for an appetizer, and the Salmon BLT (without bacon) for my main entree. Only complaint is that it was VERY difficult to find a healthy option on the menu. Not a good place to go if you are on a diet...unless that diet includes fried chicken and waffles. but great ambiance and the good I got was delicious. Would go again!
