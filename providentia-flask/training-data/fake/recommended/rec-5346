Our party of 10 went here after a show last Sunday.  We arrived early for our reservation, but they sat us right away.  The waiter - Warren - was funny and knowledgeable about the menu and what we should order (and how much).  He treated us like regulars, when we obviously were not.  We had the mussels, calamari, stuffed mushrooms, cold antipasto and fried cheese appetizers.  Then for entrees we did the chicken rollatini and steak specials, along with chicken parm and penne alla vodka.  The portions were huge on everything except the pasta - could have used a little bit more of that.  Food was fabulous, and service was great.  Will definitely go back on our next trip!
