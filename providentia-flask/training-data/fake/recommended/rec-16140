I love this place-its a casual meal with a great ambiance. The decor is nice, as everyone says, and there is a mix of people. It is very affordable with GREAT portion sizes. If you are hungry during the day, they have a great lunch special where you choose one appetizer and a main. And a lot of their popular dishes are on it so it's not hard to choose at all. It's the perfect portion size and they are easy going about omitting certain ingredients from a dish, even when getting the special. I have tried to the Thai Iced Tea with Lime Juice and that was WAY too sweet, I only had a couple of sips. It's the only thing I couldn't finish at that place. My husband had the fried crab dish and he loved it and was full for the rest of the day. Basically, you need to try this place. The corn roll appetizer is also good, as well as the chicken. The appetizers aren't huge, so don't depend on those-you must get a noodle dish or entree. It's worth it. Service is consistent and the prices unbeatable-go go go!
