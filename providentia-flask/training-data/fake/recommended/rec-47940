My girlfriend and I were great fans and regular customers of this restaurant since moving to the neighborhood five years ago.  Last summer, the guys who ran the place left to start their own restaurant (we were told).  We had assumed they were the owners; it turned out they were the managers.  Last fall, we had a really unpleasant experience during a family dinner at PT.  I won't go into the details, but it included not only a problem with the quality of a dish, but also a belligerent response by one of the owners, who had taken over the management of the restaurant.  Appalled, I wrote a scathing, two-star, "what the hell has happened to this restaurant?" review on Yelp.  I subsequently received a very gracious and heartfelt apology from the other owner of the restaurant, requesting the opportunity to make things right with us.  We haven't yet returned to PT, but we will.  In the meantime, I'd like to acknowledge the good faith demonstrated by the ownership.  The food here has always been very good, and I see no reason why it shouldn't continue to be.  Everyone makes mistakes.  Everyone has a bad day.   I'm dearly hoping that our one bad experience with PT was just that, because the restaurant has always been a local treasure.
