Very cool farm to table spot in the east village. Came here on a Saturday night-- mostly looking for delicious food in a low-key/ still hip environment. We were very pleased with the experience. The service was fantastic and the food was fresh, flavorful and interesting. Amongst the three of us we all shared the chicken, kale salad, beet salad, pork buns and carrot dish. All were very tasty, but the reason I am giving this only four stars is because the portions were all very small for expensive prices. I would definitely go back. It is an easy spot for super tasty, fresh food.
