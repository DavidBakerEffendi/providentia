We held an event in the back of the restaurant.  Initially, there didn't seem to be enough ambient light (daylight or otherwise).  It's kind of dark in the back.  So we asked that all possible lights be turned on.  The staff complied but heavy shadows still lingered.  So we opened up the french windows that led to a small patio/stone garden.  When the event began around noon, sunlight poured in from this open area.  This  was crucial as there were many small children running around at this event.   I ordered the roasted pork (pernil?) brunch.  When paired with the sides of beans/rice, maduros, and avocado salad, my brunch was satisfying.  I saw other partyers order the huevos baneros.  That did not look so good.   The staff was friendly and accomodating.  So that was nice.  And they were generous with the mimosas, sangria and coffees.  Good party.  Solid 4 stars.
