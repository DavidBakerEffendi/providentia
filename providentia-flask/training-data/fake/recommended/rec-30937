I went to Brooklyn Flea today and discovered this amazing bread!! the special focaccia of the day, a kale and lemon concoction was simply delicious and the mozzarella and salsa verde sandwich they made was such a treat. Not only did I buy a whole loaf, I also got a brownie and that was simply a dream. Â I highly recommend people check them out wherever you can find them.
