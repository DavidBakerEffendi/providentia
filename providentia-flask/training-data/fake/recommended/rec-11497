Best place in town,  in my opinion! Awesome food,  always polite and courteous everytime I go in. Order a gyro, talk about the Eagles game. Guy tells me the Eagles stink, I tell him the Giants stink, just like being at home. Awesome desserts, good salads, friendly people... What more could you ask for?!?!
