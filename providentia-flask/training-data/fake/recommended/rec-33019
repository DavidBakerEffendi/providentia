Came here with a Groupon or LivingSocial Deal, can't remember which, for Sunday Brunch.  We're always looking for new Sunday Brunch places, so even though this was kind of a haul for us (and we knew it didn't have alcohol), we were excited to try it. Menu is limited, which is generally fine by me, because that normally means they do a couple of things well.  I got a breakfast platter that came with a little bit of everything.  Unfortunately, said little bit of everything was on the cold side.  And if I have any pet peeve, it's food and/or drink temperature.  I like it piping hot, or freezing cold, as appropriate.  This was lukewarm, bordering on cool, and I'm sure we can all agree omelettes and pancakes that are lukewarm are not as enjoyable as they would be if they were hot off the grill.  Also, I'm not sure the potatoes were seasoned even a little bit.  AND they looked crunchy but weren't.  Can anyone say hashtag disappointing? My Chorizo-loving girlfriend gleefully ordered the Chorizo mac & cheese.  In an unfortunate turn of events, one of the chefs in the kitchen dropped the entire container of cheese sauce all over the kitchen floor, so she had to make another choice.  She chose quiche.  If this review was based on that quiche alone it would be 1-star, without a second thought.  It was essentially frozen spinach and half a scrambled egg in a puff pastry shell.  Word to the wise: this is not a test, and that is not a quiche.  Side salad was uninspiring. Service was generally friendly.  They only gave us milk for the coffee (I prefer half&half), which I thought was a little weird, since they kind of brand themselves as a coffee place.  In a pinch it's an OK place, but I don't think we'd make the drive again.
