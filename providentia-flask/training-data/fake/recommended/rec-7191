The ambiance and decor of this place is spot on. I came here the day after Valentines day and expected Almond to be extremely busy for that exact reason but thankfully it wasn't. Upon entering, you are greeted by the kind front of the house staff who will ask you if you'd like to hang you coat, then the hostess will assist you to your table. Shortly after your server brings you water, menus, and tells you about the specials (which sounded delicious). There is an extensive wine list-- if you are a wine connoisseur this is your place! For starters, my boyfriend and I ordered escargot. We both agreed that it was the best escargot we have ever had! For our entrees we ordered the braised pork belly dish and a duck dish (can't remember exactly). Although I am not sure of the specifics of the entrees, they were delicious. Everything was cooked perfectly and seasoned equally as well. I'm definitely looking forward to coming back here! Tip: I think this restaurant is incorrectly listed as two dollar signs, I would find this restaurant to be more of a three dollar sign restaurant!
