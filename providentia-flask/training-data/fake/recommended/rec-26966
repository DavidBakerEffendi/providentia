When my friend Jenn told me we were going to Cafe Clooney, I was so excited.  "Wow, you mean Geroge has a restaurant here?  How exciting, I hope he'll be there!". Disappointment.  Different spelling.  Damn. Regardless of my initial disappointment, Cafe Clooney (oops, I mean Cluny) was a nice little find.  Homey decor, quiet street, good oatmeal.  With all of the street-facing windows, maybe I'll even get to spy me a bit of Clooney next time.
