This place used to be good. Now they suck. I have ordered pick up for the last time. They have given me the wrong food over 6 times. But this time, I actually went back to get the right order because I'm sick of paying for shit that's not right. When I picked it up...no one offered anything to make up for the mistake. So to really make it worse, I get home and there were 4 dry ass fucked up shrimp in the dish!! What the fuck is wrong with these people?!! I had to call and say something and all this bitch does is act rude and say "well sorry". That's it. FUCK YOU THAI CHEF!!! I will make sure to stop anyone I can from going there. It's a shame how bad they fell off...the food used to be good and now it absolutely sucks and the service is even worse.
