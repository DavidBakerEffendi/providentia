I'll be honest. I kind of wanted to hate this place. It's nestled inside a swanky little hotel. Stand in the street and gaze in through the large windows, and you'll see all the beautiful people looking uber-at ease, chatting with wine glass in hand amongst the inviting furnishings and perfect lighting. But hey, as it turns out, it's cozy, dammit, the service is totally on point, and the food is delicious, too. Not one of us - including one ridiculously picky eater among us (I shall not name names) - was the least bit disappointed. In fact, we soon enough found ourselves lingering with wine glasses in hand, chatting amiably, losing track of time, relaxing in the midst of good vibes.
