Totally get what you're trying to do here guys and I respect it. Was so pumped over the concept and style here, they basically could have easily won me over with merely decent execution.   Whiff. I wanted a Center City Paesano's.  Not bland but greasy (how is that possible?!?!) meat overload.  I consider myself a meat-atarian but they had me saying "no mas" after a third of the brisket and a couple bites of the barnyard and the steak & egg.  While the fried onions are good, and service is great, something majorly wrong here. Guys, please...  I'm in the business, meat ain't cheap.  Spare yourself the cost of jampacking the "meh" bread with all that meat....  spare us the agony of finishing it all (hey, people are starving in Ethiopia).  Less meat, more taste.  Everything about the sandwiches are fantastic except for the bread and the meat.  Flavor please!
