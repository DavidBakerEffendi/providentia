All hail, bow down and give praise to the all powerful pizza place on the friggen planet. I live in Bk so I will rave here n there about, Grimaldi's, LnB's and Totanno's - which by the way is the mini me of Lombardi's - but sorry Lombardi's reigns supreme. I haven't been there in years so I did the tourist thing a few weeks ago with some friends that came in from Europe n we came here. She love it so much she said she is crying for being full because she wishes she can just keep eating. So I will end with thank you to the Gennaro Lombardi lineage - Amen.
