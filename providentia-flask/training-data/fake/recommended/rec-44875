Totally worth it. I had been DYING to go here for a long time, and it was well worth the wait. Very small inside, which makes getting a reservation somewhat difficult. We arrived for dinner at 9:30 for a party of 3. Our table wasn't quite ready, so Jared (a wonderful and personable host) told me he'd call me when it was ready and to go have a drink down the block. So we did. Back for dinner, we were not disappointed AT ALL. Jared was AWESOME to us, and our waitress Rachel was really great too. Just very friendly staff that didn't make us feel rushed at all despite how busy the restaurant was this Friday night. Really great staff can totally make or break a dining experience, and they added tremendously to the experience. We had a bottle of red, started with the meatball sliders, which were delicious (and I don't even like meatballs typically). I had the halibut for my entree, which was well-prepared with veggies. Very tasty. We shared a side of Mexican corn - totally get it! So good. Overall, great service, cute location, small but intimate setting, scrumptious food. I can't wait to go back again!
