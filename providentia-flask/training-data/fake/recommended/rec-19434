Just got back from El Fuego.  There was a short line of lunch time workers.  Don't expected any smiles or customer service.  It's all 'head down', 'What do ya what? and 'Next'.  (Not necessarily bad if you're on your lunch hour, but ......)    I asked the server to cut my buritto in half.  He made a face, rolled his eyes and muttered something......  I've been before and was unimpressed (with the food and for the abrupt service), just happened to be in the area and thought I'd give it a second chance. Still unimpressed.    I won't be back again. I've had much better Mexican takeout and MUCH better customer service.  There's plenty of places in the around Washington Square where they appreciate your business and have better food.
