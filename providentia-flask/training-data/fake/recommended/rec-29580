Can I please give them 10 stars?!! Where to begin, my wife and I are in the city from Denver for our 16th wedding anniversary and we had one of the best meals of our lives! Our sever, Marco, speaks multiple languages and was key to our dining experience. The food....it speaks for itself, throw a dart on the menu and you can't go wrong. This is how good it was, on a trip to NYC, we are returning for lunch tomorrow with Marco, WHO GOES TO THE SAME RESTAURANT TWICE IN ONE TRIP TO NY? WE DO!!!
