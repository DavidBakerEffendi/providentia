Weirdly enough, this is my favorite pizza place in New Haven. The portions are amazing for the prices, and the quality is pretty good. I've never had an issue with service- the waitresses are always really friendly and helpful. Way more worthwhile than waiting in line at Peps's or Sally's for an hour for scrappy service and pizza that's only /okay/.
