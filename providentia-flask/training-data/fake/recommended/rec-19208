My only regret is that I started at South St Octoberfest before I made it here! The Pumpking beer was awesome (I'm such a sucker for pumpkin beer anyway, and this stuff was great). My friend died over her mussels. And the grilled cheese.... Was I just too many Pumpkings deep, or do they make a really, really killer grilled cheese? Anyway, it was all delicious. We had to wait about 20 minutes for our table upstairs (4 people, 9:00 on Saturday night), but it was totally worth it.
