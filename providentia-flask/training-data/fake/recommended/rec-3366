I just randomly ran into this place during one of my hungry eat-out nights and I must say I am pleasantly surprised. It's a little jewel that has become one of my go-to places for Italian food close to work. The prices are reasonable, and although the place is a little small, I found a nice place at the bar with some sangria really did the trick.   I must say that the service for the tables are not that great as it does get crowded, but at the bar, they'll suggest drinks and create special orders for you.  I would definitely try out the lunch specials and if you're allergic to gluten, you'd probably want to check this place out for sure.   I ordered the angel hair pasta with a spicy clam and calamari sauce - awesome.
