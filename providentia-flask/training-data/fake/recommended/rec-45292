I loved this place! It's a great little restaurant, which I heard becomes overflowing as the night goes on. I came on the early side with a friend who had been there previously. She recommended the spaghetti al limone and it was amazing. Fresh pasta cooked correctly (al dente!) with sauces that don't overwhelm the pasta. Really really good. I will be going back! And I think they also do take-away/delivery.
