Was a pretty cool looking placing inside & out. Kind of a homey feel to it inside. Couldn't help but notice some people playing jenga at their tables & wanting to hop in, but we were at the bar. No worries though. Drink selection is meh. The girlfriend's not a huge beer drinker, so when she ordered a rum & coke and was told all they had was gosling, was a little disappointed. She got a dark & stormy though, to which she said was quite delish. Bartender was eh as well. Not the friendliest, but made the drinks very well, so I guess that's what matters. And we didn't get food, but only because when we went to order fries & were told they didn't have ranch (the second place that day that didn't!), we were a little bummed. Ah well.. Ok place all in all.
