I love that there is a grocery side and a restaurant/take out side to the store. Grocery side : delicious hummus, babaghanuj, tatziki, falafel, pita bread, olives, and baklava. Can't say I ever picked up something and didnt like it. All was obviously high quality and better than any junk you would pick up at your grocery store. Restaurant side: the bitizza is delicious! I usually get the greek which is feta, olives, tomatoes and onions on zaatar bread. Different but delicious. Kabobs and gyros were flavorful and delicious.
