Very cool speakeasy, SCHEEE. The look: 1930's s Chicago speakeasy. Close attention to detail. The food: highest possible quality, simple( burgers and fries) with a surprising twist on everything- duck fat fries, 8 oz burgers with bleu cheese, lobster roll with amazing sauce, etc. Don't look for ketchup to put on ur burger, there isn't any. The menu is a simple start to a complex journey. The drinks: carefully crafted cocktails. Lots of whiskey. house made bitters, creative and fun. Extensive drink menu. A+ Seating: Motorcycles have more seats than this place. You will wait. It's well worth it but you will wait.
