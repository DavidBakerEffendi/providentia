It's impossible to write one review of Frankford Hall. You could talk about it as a restaurant/bar. You could state that it is a signature Stephen Starr establishment: expertly executed, but unexceptional, and maybe a little overpriced. Do you want to spend a bunch for a really big pretzel? Do you like playing ping-pong by an open fire while drinking a really big draft beer? Do you want to walk into a place and feel like you are somewhere important? If any of these sound appealing, Frankford Hall is a great option. On the other hand, it's hard not to write a review of this place as the beginning of a trend. One can't ignore the fact that this place, along with the casino, amounts to a big magnet for folks from New Jersey and the Pennsylvania suburbs, people who might otherwise choose to pleasure themselves in Center City on a Friday or Saturday night. Frankford Avenue has flourished through the confluence of city policy, a counter-culture, and local openness to change. If you want it Â to become a place that booms with--and let's be honest here-- deutschy dollars, than you would probably love Frankford Hall. For me, I feel a little conflicted every time I come here. It's hard not to think that Frankford Hall's success can only mean that similar venues are likely to populate the avenue in the future, and it's hard not to see that the other side of that growth will be fewer Johnny Brenda's and fewer Rocket Cats.
