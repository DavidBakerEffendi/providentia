The cioppino is a must order. It came with lobster, mussels, scallops, and shrimps in the most delicious broth. I dipped my bread and finished every last drop. It is THAT good. The thai curry seabass special we had was also another solid dish. It was not too spicy but it gave the dish a little oompf. $5 corkage fee for wine and cash only. I will surely be returning! Also, the entrance is located in the middle of the block (we thought it was at the corner but that's the wine bar).
