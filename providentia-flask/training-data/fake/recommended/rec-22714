Ok let me preface this was all the food I tried was extremely tasty, everything was very fresh and perfectly prepared. However, the evening I had here with my friends was just not the greatest. We had made reservations for a Tuesday for a friends birthday, we arrived at 7:30 (the time of our reservation) and had to wait an additional 45 minutes at the bar before we were sat. In the meantime a similar size group was sat at a large table in the next room. When we were finally sat, we were put at a table that would comfortably seat 2 to maybe 4 people as long as they do not have more than one plate a piece, there were 6 of us. We were right in the front window, which had no curtains, and constantly felt the cold breeze from the freezing December air from the door. Getting all the food on the table was like a game of Tetris. The server herself was very nice and attentive, it was just an overall frustrating experience and I most likely will not be going back.
