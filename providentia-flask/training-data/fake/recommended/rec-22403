My wife and I love this place. We moved from NYC to CT and REALLY missed our favorite restaurants. That said Star of India is hands down our favorite Indian food restaurant. Even better than Jackson Diner (it's true) this place does not disappoint. The chicken Korma is amazing. The lunch buffet is to die for, and prices are good. I don't generally write reviews but this place is seriously the best Indian in CT (best Indian anywhere frankly.)
