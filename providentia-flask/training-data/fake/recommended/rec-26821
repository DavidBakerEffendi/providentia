I came here with a friend for dinner on a weekday night and was immediately impressed with the classy and romantic ambiance. We had no problem getting a table around 8pm. Service was okay, nothing to rave about. But let's talk about the food... We shared the Rucola pizza and the Tagliolini Neri ai Frutti di Mare (squid ink pasta). The pizza was made with fresh ingredients with the perfect combinations of tomato, ham, and arugula. The squid ink pasta was loaded with seafood. I had myself a glass of crisp ros√© wine. An authentic and reasonably priced Italian restaurant. Overall, everything was exquisite. I definitely recommend Da Mikele.
