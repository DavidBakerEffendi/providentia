Not that they need another review... But this is def the best halal. Awesome price for a hefty amount of food and these guys move fast so even if there's a line, the wait is only a few minutes. THE HOT SAUCE MANNNN. IDK what the HELL is in that hot sauce but it packs a serious PUNCH. I remember the first time I had it, I was like "wth am I gonna do with this itty bitty cup of hot sauce?!" One bite and I had nothing else to say about the amount! The white sauce is good for balancing out the heat. Going tonight for dinner...
