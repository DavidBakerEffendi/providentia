I think what I like best about Blue Ribbon is their acknowledgment of what they are all about: food. It isn't fancy (in a good way), cutting edge, trendy or silly. You'll never eat anything here that could be construed as a science project or be featured in Architectural Digest. Â I'm not bashing the creativity of others at all, there's certainly a place for that, but sometimes I just wanna eat.
