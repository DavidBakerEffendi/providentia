Great experience this evening with Connor- even being Memorial Day weekend, great enthusiasm and hospitality. Was quoted a hour half and was seated just after 45 min. Bar service was full but bartenders were speedy- so many negative reviews for this place but couldn't complain about one aspect of our meal, even brought out wet wipes upon finishing. We will definitely be back!!! Great summer hang our
