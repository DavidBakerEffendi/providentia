I tried their chicken and waffle, and was pleasantly surprised. The chicken strips were as enjoyable as chicken strips can be, though if they had a nice sauce that could have helped them too, not that they needed it. The waffle was also great, not too soft or too burnt, though the syrup bottle was a little sticky at some places, but eh what can you do. The wait staff is also very nice and the cooks are fast, I always try to come here the morning after a party and they usually bring me as much water as I need. The only down side is that they close at 2, but that is the only thing that motivates me to get out of bed some days.
