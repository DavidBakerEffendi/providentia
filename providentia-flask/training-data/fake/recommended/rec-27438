I was at their pop-up outpost in williamsburg this past weekend, and my friend had asked whether I had smoked weed before I met her up for lunch as she felt i was too "happy and hungry".  And i literally had an epiphany about this place after she made such observation.  Maharlika touches on the traditional but moves it forward to appeal to my adventurous gastro appetite. For the longest time i couldnt figure out why I was so happy when I came here, but this weekend made me realise I was eating the food that was so dear to me when I was young but presented in a way that totally appealed to who I am today.  Its like having good childhood memories re-wrap in this totally new way for me to enjoy all over again.  So thank you for not only feeding my body but my soul,  Maharlika-Mahal kita!
