After only living in New York for three months, I crossed two things off my Things One Does Living In NYC list: 1. Spend too much on shoes. 2. Spend far, far too much on wine and awesome food. Being that Terrior is not a shoe shop, using one's amazing powers of deduction, one can tell that I completed the latter here. And what wonderful food and wine it was. The selection is almost overwhelming, in an utterly brilliant way, of course, that one could spend all day selecting a wine. Since some bottles were simply out of my price range, this helped a little with the "what gorgeous wine do I want to try," and the process of elimination was furthered by tips from the genuinely pleasant staff. Let's just say I not only discovered my absolutely new favourite bottle of wine here, but I broke my mostly vegetarian streak to enjoy the charcuterie. And I will do so. Again. And again. And again. Feeling slightly "off" the next day is well worth it to enjoy the succulent selection of meats, from ham to wild boar to duck to chicken liver. I think I'm addicted to this place.
