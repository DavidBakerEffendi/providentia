Overhyped? A little. Still crave-worthy? Definitely. Buns: 4/5 I've had better for less Cucumber appetizer: 5/5 but portion really small Ramen: really only worth it if you get the extra noodles after you finish the first and leave the broth. I like the Akamaru modern. Samurai rib: 10/5 Â The only really rave-worthy item on the menu...MELTS. IN. YOUR. MOUTH. UGH. That basically sums Ippudo up. I would still allow it its mantle of 'best ramen', but it's still really pricey and the queues drive me insane. I went on Valentine's Day with my ex (then-boyfriend) and we happened to catch the one day that it wasn't so crowded, so that was nice. The one thing I will say is that no matter how crowded they get, the quality of the food never changes. Someone noted that I got the service, sorry! Service is 5/5. There's only been one instance in which it was slow, and that was during a full house and we ordered a lot for a business meeting. All the servers are friendly and capable and often times very, very attractive. (; Favorite server is still Brandon though! He served us when we brought a rowdy group of friends--great sense of humor and very perceptive of our needs.
