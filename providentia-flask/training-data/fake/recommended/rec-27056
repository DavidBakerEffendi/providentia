Went there last night and had just an ok meal but we will be back to give it another try. I think they still need to work kinks out. Service was a bit rough around the edges. My wine was swept away (the waiter even made a joke telling me not to worry, he was just keeping it cold) then I practically had to trip busboys and other waiters to pour me some more of my wine. The bread came and it looked like they had recycled a few scraps leftover from other tables.  It seemed like they had run out of bread. Really unappealing when the bread stinks,  but at least the dipping tapanade was flavorful. Unfortunately we had a late reservation (all they had) and they were out of all but one special, a spicy pizza. We went for the waiter's pick, the rock shrimp app (great) and the frisee with beets (a little light on the beets) and a nasty smelling cheese. Overall not bad, just not all together put together flavorwise. My companion's dish was a pasta with red sauce, meatball was good, I think it was called the Pennoni. I ordered the Lumaconi with swisschard, sausage and ceci beans. The pasta was an odd,large snail shell shaped pasta that was so al dente it was almost inedible. The sausage was sort of torn into ragged-sloppy strings, like they were pulled apart hastily (they were too big and did not incorporate into the dish). The swisschard was almost non existant as well as the ceci beans. Perhaps there were 8 or 9 beans on my plate....mostly it was just undercooked and underdressed pasta. . Overall, the atmosphere was nice (very loud, though) and the prices were very reasonable, so we will be back for another try.
