I do not trust the food here.  The first time I ate here I had the sushi....it smelt really bad and fishy.  I really don't think it was fresh.  Also, my miso soup was oily - yes oily miso!  Say what?!  The second time I went here to join some friends for a drink (they had the hibachi - oily, oily) and the staff were cleaning around us with the most fowl cleaning stuff which seemed extremely rude.   I hope it closes soon to make room for something better.
