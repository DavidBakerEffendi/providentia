My boyfriend is a big, robust Philly man.  Born and bred in the city of brotherly love, he is all about his sports teams and his cheese steaks.  This is by far....no joke...by far...the best cheese steak you will have.   And ya gotta eat it at the bar, which is lined with every type of hot peppers you can imagine...from the wussy, vinegary banana peppers (yawn...so tame) to whole cherry peppers.   I like heat, and am not shy about spice, but some of the peppers I really had to center myself, before I ate on. LOVE the old, cracked leather stools, the selection of beers and the customers.
