Burmese food is a wonderful combination of all the flavors I associate with Asia - especially Thai and Chinese. I trekked over here from S. Broad street while here on business - one gets sick of bar food after awhile. The restaurant is on 9th St, one block over from the main drag. Inside it's pretty standard, not too crowded at 8PM on a Wednesday. Based on the reviews here, I ordered the pumpkin soup, thousand layer bread with lavana beans, tofu salad, and monsoon vegetables. The spices/dressing on the tofu salad were great - lots of kaffir lime flavor, but I wish it had more than just tofu in the salad. The Burmese place I go to in Boston Â has a tofu salad with a little shredded cabbage and peanuts, and slightly more creamy tofu. The thousand layer bread was cold/chewy by the time I got it, but slightly sweet flavored. Pumpkin soup - a bit bland. Reminded me of Indian Dal more than anything. Filling but not over the top in flavor. Monsoon veggies had a unique flavor I couldn't put my finger on. They were good but mushy. Next time I'm in Philly, I might go back to this place, but I have a new appreciation for the delicacy of flavors at YoMa in Boston.
