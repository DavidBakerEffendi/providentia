I remember having brunch down in this area of the Village a while ago, and there was a place that had unlimited Mimosa's for $15 per person. Couldn't find that place, but was glad I stumbled upon this place with my friend. We arrived at 11am on a Sunday, so No Booze, until after noon.  (just be aware)    Regardless, we found more than enough enticing and diverse menu items to keep us occupied. First order of the day, is coffee.  Straight and strong for me.  Fu Fu, and special "creme" for my friend.  Whatever works for you.  But my coffee was refilled continuously throughout my meal, without ever removing my forearms from the table.  Even though that sounds "truck driver-ish", it speaks to a certain attentive level of service. My friend had some egg dish in crepes which was good sized portioned and enjoyable. I asked about their specialty, and they said it was their Mediterranean breakfast, which consisted of Eggs, over a spicy flavored tomatoes and peppers,  all ringed by a fresh pita. (see picture) I ended up not eating the hard yolks, but overall this was very satisfying, relatively light,  and very tasty. Overall, the service was excellent from beginning to end. Clean bathroom, and reasonable prices.  (under $30 total with no booze),  and toward the end of the meal were offered a booze option, since it was past noon,  but that ship had sailed. This place is a solid four stars, if you're into slightly different breakfast options.  (they also had steak & eggs, etc.)
