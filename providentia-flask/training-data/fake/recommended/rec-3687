Constantine is THE MAN. Waited ten minutes in line around 2pm on a Saturday - in those ten minutes, we were fed (free) strawberries, cookies w/ real cream, oranges and coffee. Promptly seated, promptly served. Chocolate chip pancakes and vinegar fries = awesome. And then Constantine sent over a free milkshake for me and my lady to share. You win Tom's. You win.
