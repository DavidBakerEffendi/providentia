Actually, I'm probably unqualified to write this review.  The first time we went, I had the carbonara, and it was absolutely exceptional.  So, when we went back, I had the carbonara, and it was still a frabjous joy.  And the next time we went, it was specifcally for the carbonara, which was wonderful.  And the time after that -- well, the pattern was established.  Lo Monaco's carbonara rocks, rules, and wins.  Their caesar salads are pretty good, too.  But I can't offer an opinion on any other dish. The restaurant is cozy without being too crowded, the staff are very professional and warm, and the drinks are awfully good.  Just don't try the carbonara first off, or you may never get to try anything else.
