Update - I have been here 5-6 times in the past few months. It has become my favorite fine dining option for all occassions, special and random. The food is unfailingly exceptional; the service always warm and welcoming. The porcini flan continues to be the best thing on the menu. The canape (?) that they serve as an amuse-bouche is not on the menu, and it is my favorite thing there. La Fleur is my favorite cocktail, and among the wines I prefer Sancerre. Not surprised at all that Bouley climbed the ranks in the Zagat ratings this year - reservations have to be made weeks in advance. Will go back. As usual.
