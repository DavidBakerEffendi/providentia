This truck is busy for a reason. The Lamb (not cubed lamb, but sliced gyro lamb) over rice with feta and white sauce is great when you want a quick, filling cheap lunch. The white sauce is good, though doesn't seem like it's home made. Home made Tzatziki would make this a great choice. The lamb gyro is typical from any vendor but for the price of $7.00 with a soda is great. The rice is always good. Plan on a line that starts at 12:00 and lasts until 2:00. It moves fairly quickly.
