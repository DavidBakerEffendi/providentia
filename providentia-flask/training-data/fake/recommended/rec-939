If you're the type of person who goes to New York to eat at the Hard Rock Cafe or Guy Fieri's newest restaurant, you're going to love this place (or its neighbor across the street). Otherwise, if you want a REAL Philly cheesesteak experience there are many better alternatives. It's too expensive, unsatisfying, and full of itself.
