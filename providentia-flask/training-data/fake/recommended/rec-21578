You gotta have the word "sucker" written across your forehead to show up at PYT. Remember the time Bush screwed up the "throw me once, shame on you, throw me twice, shame on me" line in a speech? Well, PYT managed to throw me twice. Shame on them. Or wait, is it shame on me? Thanks Dubya. Either way, PYT's service stinks like a dead skunk in the middle of a country road. It's shame-full. We ordered two burgers for take out last fall when they opened. They told me to come pick them up in 20 minutes. I arrived in 20 minutes and had to wait another 20. Then I returned home to enjoy an average-at-best burger which featured future indigestion and heartburn. The second time we walked in on a weekday evening. The place wasn't really crowded, but we stood in the doorway for a good ten minutes before being seated. Another five minutes went by and some staffer came over with glasses of water. He informed us that he had no menus to give us and would be back "soon." Ten minutes went by without seeing a server, a menu, or even the offer of a cocktail. We got up and walked out and were not even asked if anything was wrong when we went past a cadre of employees. The final result was dinner at El Camino on N. 2nd Street. They at least seem to give a damn about their customers! Perhaps they ought to change their name to PDT. Pretty Disappointing Time.
