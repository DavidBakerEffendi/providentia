There's no reason to like this place, but everyone does. This is especially puzzling given that they have some of the worst pizza in New Haven, and there are plenty of other options. But they really shine when it comes to pitchers of Sam Adams, the chicken souvlaki sandwich, and chocolate milkshakes. The best deal is the unlisted "lunch special", a big helping of caesar salad + bad pizza, for peanuts. The waitresses are also very motherly, which is comforting when you are far away from your own mother, as many of us are.
