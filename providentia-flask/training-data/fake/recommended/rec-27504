LOUD. If you're planning to dine at Penelope for Brunch on a Sunday, you should probably bring two things:  earplugs, and a big bucket of good ol' fashioned patience.  The wait was an hour and a half and the UTTER cacophony was mind-boggling.  I know I'm like a total scrooge, but really, if I wanted to feel my brain rattle from people screaming into both ears I would've had brunch backstage at a Justin Bieber concert.  Or at the Brooklyn Brewery.  Ugh.... Noise pollution to the side, the food was actually very good.  I had the nutella french toast with the side of fresh fruit, which reminded me of having breakfast at our family's lake house when I was young.  It was the kind of fresh, homemade meal that normally would transport you, to a little picnic table outside of a campsite where you could hear crickets chirping.  Penelope is kind of like that except its more like eating at a picnic table at the Bronx Zoo with a pack of angry llamas. OK, OK... the cute plate ware, mismatched mugs and a well-presented meal that looked just as delicious as it tasted is what makes up the three stars I'm giving you, Penelope.  Maybe I'll try to come back on off-peak Brunch hours or a Monday night.  And I want to... the dinner menu looked positively scrumptious.
