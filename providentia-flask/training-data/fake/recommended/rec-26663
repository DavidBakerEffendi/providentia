The gyro crepe was poorly made. There were clumps of feta and meat at the top, but towards the bottom, it was only vegetables. If I wanted a vegetarian crepe, I would have ordered it. The pieces of meat i did have were too salty. My friend ordered one of the chicken crepes and specifically asked for no broccoli and she found at least five pieces in it. More importantly from where I stood, I could see the cook throwing trash away with his gloves on and touching the trash/bag and then continue to use the same gloves and make the food. There should be some level of cleanliness even if it is a food truck stationed at a busy college! Higher your standards, people!!!
