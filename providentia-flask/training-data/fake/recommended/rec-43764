5 stars hands down.  Went with a party of about 15 girls for a friends birthday. We had the set menu which was $40 pp (not including drinks) and the food just kept coming. The plates were delicious, unique and delicious! Service was great, we had one gentleman who was our primary waiter, but the whole staff was very accomodating and wonderful.  Food was amazing, service amazing so this is a place I would most defidently go back to!
