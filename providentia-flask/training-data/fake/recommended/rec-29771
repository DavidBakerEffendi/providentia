you can't beat the weeknight  $8 "red white and blue" oyster or clam deal, the best i've come across for oysters in the city.    half a dozen lovely oysters nicely served, paired with a PBR, or a glass of red or white wine.    i'm not a fan of their house white however - usually an agressively oaked chardonnay, which to me doesn't go well at all with oysters - but i've recently discovered you can upgrade to another wine on their list for $2 or $4.    most recently i had the sancerre, which was nice.   basically your oysters are free.  the wine is $12 a glass anyway.     we also had the  lobster deal special, which is add $10 to the usual $16 for the lobster dinner (lobster, steamers, sweetcorn, and super french fries) and get a second lobster for the platter.   there are a few other things i want to try (best value are the items on the small menu card on the table) including a mixed seafood platter that offers a couple of each of their oysters (east coast and west coast), each of their clams, and some steamed shrimp for about $42.    forget the buffalo shrimp - tastes great but an insanely tiny portion!
