LOVE THIS PLACE! Only place in Chinatown left that still has $1 dumplings, most places have increased it to $1.25. I ordered the dumplings and the sesame pancake with pork, DELICIOUS! The place is pretty much a hole in the wall with very little seating but don't let that stop you - just go down the block and sit at the small playgorund =]
