Arrived for dinner with girlfriend on Saturday at 6p. Place has about 8 tables and was almost a full. My girlfriend ordered the sea bass and asked chef to fillet fish. The chef did a good job but some bones were left. The fish was served whole with head and tail. I ordered the pork chop along with stiff grape leafs. We both ordered the small portion. Â The food also came with salad and served with rice. Food was excellent and priced very reasonably. Meal totaled to $40. We chose this place because it was within walking distance to Lincoln center. I would definitely come back again.
