I've now been to Beau Monde twice and had an awesome meal both times. The crepes are out of this world.  Everyone walked away full and with a smile on their faces.  The service can be a bit pokey so if you are in a rush this is not the place to be, but if you have some time to sit, eat and talk this is just a wonderful place to hang out. And after lunch you can always stroll just a block or two and hit South St.
