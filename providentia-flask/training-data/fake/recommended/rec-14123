Penelope has the BEST veggie burger in the city. It's a Gardenburger sandwiched between a warm english muffin and slopped with delicious pesto mayo. mm m. The Veggie Meets Sally salad is also quite delicious- not as tasty as the veggie burger, but healthier. The service is always friendly, the prices are great, and the large OJ actually comes in a large glass which makes me a happy brunch camper. 4 stars because there's always a wait (i wonder why!) and the portions are a bit on the small side.
