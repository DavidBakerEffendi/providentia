We had a 25-person dinner here for a work event on a Saturday night and basically had several tables in the back half of the restaurant. Pizzas came out kind of slowly, but once they started coming out we seemed to have an endless supply. Overall the crust is thick and soft - good but nothing special. We tried a lot of different pizzas and the only one that really stood out to me was the mashed potato with bacon. Salad (with feta, tomato, cucumber): yelp.com/biz_photos/york… This was not very impressive - the lettuce was cut into huge pieces as were the tomatoes, and the feta wasn't crumbled/spread out through the salad very well. The cucumber tasted old and soft. Not many ingredients, not much pop in flavor except for the feta. A few slices: yelp.com/biz_photos/york… Best: Mashed potato w/ bacon pizza - love the pesto potato and crispy bacon! Ok: Mozzarella broccoli pizza - this had a good soft cheese, with kind of crunchy broccoli. Pepperoni - this had lots of meat with crisped edges. Eh: Tomato & veggies - the toppings were not mixed well into the cheese cheese.
