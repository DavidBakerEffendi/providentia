Easily the best restaurant in the Burlington area. An ambitious menu executed with style. Every dish was exciting and full of surprises. Loved the pickle plate, the beets and horseradish, and the pork and beans entree. It also has the only true cocktail bar in town. The drinks offer complex flavors to rival the food. I know this make me sound like kind of a douche, but this place isn't just 'good for Burlington'--if Misery Loves Company were in Los Angeles or New York, it would easily rate among the best in those cities.
