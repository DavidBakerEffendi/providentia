I have eaten here many times and lately it seems like it get worse each time.  The waitresses act like you are an inconvenience, even when you order the simplest thing and the food taste like they haven't changed the grease in the fryer for days.  I used to go here because I wanted a nice place to go to for quick and inexpensive food, but I have stopped because the bad service just isn't worth it.
