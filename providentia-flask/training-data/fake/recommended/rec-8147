This place was recommended to us.  Why?  For bland Vietnamese food?  That must have been why our recommenders liked it--because they've never had good Vietnamese food.  We used to live four blocks away, in the restaurant-desert that West Philly continues to be--where tumbleweeds  of litterers' craft make for most of the street life--but we only ate here once.  We count it a true disappointment, considering people had recommended it to us.  You may hear it's good due to the warped tastes of some neighborhoody regulars, but don't be fooled.  Those people don't know what good Vietnamese food is.
