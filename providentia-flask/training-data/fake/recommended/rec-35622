This place is FN AWESOME! My partner and I decided to give this place a try after deciding against chinese and pizza. Its literally a 3 minute walk from our house so we decided to go for it and boy am i glad we did! We both started out with two shots of tequila (we asked the waitress for her suggestion and she didn't suggest the most expensive one like they do in most restaurants which surprised us both) We downed the shots which they gave us with some yummy red chaser(had no clue what it was but it went well w the shot) ordered a couple more drinks and burritos. My chicken, spinach, mushroom burrito was to die for and my gf finished her chicken burrito so fast I didn't even see her eating lol Overall this place is fantastic! Chic hipsters all over, cool decor, awesome service, and spectacular food. They even have brunch! What more could you ask for? I'm so happy we ventured around to this place we will def be back especially since we are so close! :)
