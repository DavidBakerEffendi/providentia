Fun, fun, fun!! I came out to FH for their Oscars viewing party.   My only gripe was the horrible sound system the comedians used.  Now, onto the awesomeness: *Lots of outdoor seating with heat lamps and fire pits. *S'mores.  Enough said. *Plenty of indoor seating: benches & pub tables *ping pong & foozball.   Enough said. *jenga on the benches. *2 big screens *pretzels, brats, burgers and fries. *plenty of beers, a coupe wines...and mulled wine! *young, friendly crowd *laid back servers. *clean bathrooms. This is a guaranteed good time, whether you are alone, a small crew, or with a big group of friends.  I was alone in town for work, and had a blast..I was able to find a cab home easily....at midnight... on Sunday!!  A perfect night.  Highly recommended.
