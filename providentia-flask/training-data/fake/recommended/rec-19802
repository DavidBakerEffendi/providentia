This place is always packed, it's definitely worth the wait. Personally, I feel their pizza is better than Roberta's. The overall restaurant and their policies beat Roberta's by a landslide. Simply put, if you like pizza, you should most definitely try Paulie Gee's. Their hellboy is sweet and spicy, it's delicious, and Bryan de Parma is so fresh and tasteful!
