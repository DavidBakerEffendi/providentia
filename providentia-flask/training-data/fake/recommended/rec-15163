DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!! Cheesesteaks are good and prices are decent but NOT worth the HOUR wait to get it. Incredibly inefficient service. You can't order until you pay and the lady at the register is also preparing food! Came between 2-3 so not even a popular time. If there is a line out the door you will definitely wait at least 45 min to order. Other places just as popular take 10 min for the same line.
