Just a quick review of this store. I love that you can actually sit in this one. Much more space! They have the same menu as the other one. The fries are always delicious and the falafel sandwich is def my goto. We tried the hummus it was a super large portion and it was very good. Unfortunately Taim has ruined me bc i cant go anywhere else to eat falafel! You do need to get here by 6 though if your driving parking rules change and you will never get a spot afterwards. Happy hunting!! ;)
