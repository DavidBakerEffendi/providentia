Last month when I was on jury duty, I decided to come here during the lunch break . It was nice to know that you get 10% off if you are a juror. My friend had told me to try this place. When I reached there, the line were long and had to wait for 30 minutes before my order was taken. I got the roast beef with spinach. It was the best roast beef I have ever eaten. It was so filling, I did not even have to eat dinner that night.
