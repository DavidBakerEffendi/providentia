The best part of Bodhi is the co owner, Tom.  And the customer service is top notch.  I erg anyone in the neighborhood to stop by and try a cup.  Skip the WaWa people!!  Bodhi cost more because it is a better product.  Next person I see walking buy with a 40oz of coffee from WAWA is getting dealt with!!!
