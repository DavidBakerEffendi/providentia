I have eaten here a few times and the food has always been great.   The wait staff are not attentive. If you want more water when dining you'll have to bring a flag with you to wave in the air because that's the only way your going to get it. Last is Mama, she is great and it 's a nice feeling to have someone acknowledge you and show she appreciates your business. But !! Mama needs to adopt a 3 MINUET rule when visiting the tables". Say hello and stay No longer then 3 minuets. Feel free to come back and check up on things but that's it!  Perhaps a poke with a set of chopsticks are in order to send her on her way. Regardless, the food has been great, Mama's is a trip and the overall experience is worth the venture. BOYB.
