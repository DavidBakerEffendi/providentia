I love this place!  I can't get enough of it.  Every time there is a discussion of where to go eat Pio Pio is always the safe place to go.  Beware of some large dishes. I've seen people order some entrees not realizing that the large Jalea can feed many ppl as an appetizer, and that the chicken dishes is a WHOLE chicken.  The only thing i do NOT love about Pio pio is their hard Tostones... stay away.  Skip some of the appz and go straight for the entree - it's more than enough food. I've tried a few different locations and 44th St is one of my favorites b/c of their expanded menu.  The Ceviche bar is great and it's one of the few locations that serves Tres Leche for dessert.   Chicken + Green Sauce + Yuca Fries + mojo sauce + avocado salad = my regular order.  I always leave there happy and satisfied.  I Love Pio Pio If you are looking for some good baked chicken w/ a few sides go here and share an entree w/ one person... for $26 u can't go wrong!
