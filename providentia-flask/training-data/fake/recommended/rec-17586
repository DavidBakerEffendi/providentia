Get treated like family and enjoy truly fresh "tastes-like-homemade" cuisine. You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu - the taste and presentation are all wonderful. Portions are generous, as much bread and olive oil as you can enjoy, and super-friendly service that aims to please. And yes, if you like coffee and want a little adventure - ask for the Turkish coffee. Enjoy!
