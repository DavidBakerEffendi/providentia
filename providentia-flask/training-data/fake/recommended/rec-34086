Excellent service. The atmosphere was relaxing and rustic. The food was incredible. I had the Brooklyn Meatball Salad. I am super picky about my meatballs and these passed the test for sure. Can't beat the $9.99 lunch specials. This place is a gem. I will certainly be coming back. Had a great conversation with the owner. He was a friendly young gentleman and made us feel welcome.
