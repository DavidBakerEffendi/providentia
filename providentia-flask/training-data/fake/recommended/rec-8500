This is my favorite sushi restaurant - ever! Better than Morimoto. I try to stop by every time i'm in the area. Alex is simply a master of his trade. Everything he makes is brilliant, the sticky rice is outstanding - we always get a side of that alone - the scallop carpaccio is like buttah, and the sushi/sashimi plate is art. He always creates something special for my vegetarian husband as well. I can not speak highly enough for this place.
