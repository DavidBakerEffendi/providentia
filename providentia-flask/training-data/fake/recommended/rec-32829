Very much enjoyed the food here; everything tasted fresh, and they had lots of veggie options. Inside was very quaint and I could see it being a nice date night spot. BYOB although it looked like they had a bar, too. Waitress was very helpful and made several recommendations for us, although the salad she recommended to start with was gigantic (and that was split between two people!). Hummus was so delicious! It does take a while to get the meal, since it is cooked to order, so you need some patience. But it's worth it!
