This place is a pot of gold! I had no idea it was in my back yard. So many unique flavor combos, beautiful presentation, slight language barrier, but extremely nice. I will be back. OK. You are going to be very confused when you look at the menu, so here is the instruction: 1. Mix the soy with a little of everything in the tray to create your flavor base 2. Order Half Herb broth/ Half Spicy 3. Fatty Beef 4. Enoki Mushrooms 5. Spinach 6. Fish balls if you are adventurous
