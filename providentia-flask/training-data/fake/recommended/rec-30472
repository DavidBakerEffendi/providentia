I must qualify the four star rating by stating that these are not the best tacos in New York. That distinction in my opinion belongs to Mercadito Grove. They are, however, the best tacos in the city at the four-buck and under price point. After walking by several times, and reading yet again another Wall Street Journal Lunch Box column review, my timing was off until today. Which once again proved that the virgin foodie experience is often worth the wait. This is authentic, freshly prepared Mexican fast slow food at its finest. You will appreciate the contradiction as much as I did once you try it. The Brooklyn Taco Company is amazing. Modeled after the traditional taqueria, this tiny nook tucked into the Essex Market offers a refreshingly modern, fresh twist to the concept, with an emphasis on quality. And as a California transplant long disappointed with the lack of good Mexican food here, this rivals my favorites in Los Angeles, if only because it has such a unique, individual flair. But enough stroking... Let's move on to the oral exam. I had an ET finger moment when I saw tamales on the menu, but demurred in spite of proprietor Jesse's best efforts to divert me from this thoroughly vegan option. I opted for the chipotle brisket taco, which totally delivered with a thoroughly enjoyable combination of taste and texture, complemented perfectly with a modest chopped mango salsa. So satisfied I was with this, that I decided to go for the whole enchilada, and was rewarded in kind once again for my choice. I'm not sure what the secret ingredients are in terms of the base preparation, but I think it is the sheer simplicity in this and the subsequent assembly that makes each dish. And while I like the East Village location of Snack Dragon close to my apartment, it pales in comparison to this place. (See paragraph 2.) I will definitely be a regular here.
