I have no complaints. Beer is half off during happy hour. Can't go wrong with some Porkslap in a can neither. Royale with cheese is pretty tasty. Their veggie burger is also a nice alternative. Chicken sandwich? Sure! Why not. I like this place better than Corner Bistro. Nicer atmosphere, I love the back garden (heat lamps for the winter) and quite frankly I think their burger is better. It's probably one of the best burgers you'll find in the east village along with great service and nice staff. Unfortunately the prices have gone up a wee bit but it's still a good time. I gave it 4 stars because even though it's not the best burger I've ever had in the city and i'm not a huge fan of their onion rings and fries, it's a great atmosphere.
