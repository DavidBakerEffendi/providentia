Went to Philly from central jersey for an overnight w he kiddies. Found Jones!  Heard they had good Mac and cheese and that would be good for the little ones. We were greeted by Stephen the general manager told is it would be a 25 min wait. Told him how we heard about the Mac and cheese. He said it is said to be the best I'm the city. We took our pager and headed to the counter style bar. Miller high life for the adults and waters for the kids. Beers $4 seems fair to me! As we were sitting there a waitress came up and brought us Mac and cheese! To our confused surprise the manager sent it to us free  of charge They were right yummy We were seated in a booth the decor has a great vibe. I ordered the chicken in a basket and my husband ordered waffles and chicken. I must say it was some if the best fried chicken I have had!! Staff was super friendly and attentive! Totally worth the drive and would go to Philly again just for this restaurant! I will spread the word bravo! You deserve all 5 stars! It's customer service like this that makes all the difference!
