My first impression of halal was that it looks like a burrito bowl. With the choice of lamb or chicken, this is thrown on top of a bed of rice and lettuce and piled with the white yogurt sauce and hot sauce. The hot sauce was actually pretty spicy so unless you wanted a taste-bud shocking experience, tone it down on the hot sauce. The portion was actually pretty decent, enough to share between two and maybe get a small snack elsewhere. If this is your first time also, I highly recommend doing half chicken and lamb to get a taste of both and see which one you like more if you were ever to come back again. I wouldn't say this is better than the burrito bowls at Chipotle, but for being open super late and the convenient location, and also cheap price of course, I can understand why the line always wraps around the block.
