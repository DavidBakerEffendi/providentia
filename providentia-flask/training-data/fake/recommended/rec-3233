Sometimes I have dreams of their dumplings, specifically the mushroom and edamame. I've had some of the best Korean food in Ny and somehow Sampan has my favorite kimchi rice. Their pork bao bun and Korean short rib apps for happy hour are the best in Philly. The mixed cocktail and oyster specials are also unique and priced just right so you can leave satisfied with money for other splurges. Once summer comes, I'll be posting multiple instagram photos of the mini ice cream cones. This is still my favorite Asian fusion restaurant and HH spot for 5 years now.
