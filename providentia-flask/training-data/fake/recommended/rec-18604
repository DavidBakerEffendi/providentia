You will not expect this place to be that GREAT from the outside. I have been living in this neighborhood for few months now and I have been going to restaurants surrounding this one but never dared to go in. But I should have! The garden is great on a nice day. I went in for late lunch with few friends and everything we ordered exceeded our expectations. Amazing Lentil soup, fresh made pita, and amazing Beet salad. Try Pitza! I am lactose intolerant so I can never really enjoy eating normal Pizza but PitZa is great!!!
