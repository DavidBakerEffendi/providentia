I can see why this place is so popular. It's a fun time. The food was pretty good, perhaps not worth five stars but the overall experience makes up for it. There is indeed a line outside around the block, but don't be fooled; it moves so quickly and the service once you're seated is so fast that your overall time including the line is still less than if you went elsewhere. If you're a pancake person, this is definitely a place for you. They were delicious. A woman at a table near mine must have ordered hers with the strawberries, and it had like a pound of really nice strawberries on there. I'd definitely go back.
