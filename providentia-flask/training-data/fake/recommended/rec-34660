The fabled Kati Roll Company does exist. I have been day dreaming about these spicy shrimp rolls for months after Yelp Master Reviewer: Patrick McMeehan recommended these portrayed delicacies to me. I stumbled into the establishment after a brisk walk, during a 4 day liquid fueled Latvian Conference (further definitions remain classified)... I wasn't sure what I was ordering and neither did the gentlemen behind the counter. However, my teachings by renowned Prof. Annavarjula lead me to regain my composure and ability to speak long enough to order "6 spicy shrimp Kati Rolls". To my surprise I received exactly what I had anticipated. 6 tightly rolled, flavor & spice infused shrimp Kati rolls. The taste of these delicacies can only properly be described as a once in life time flavor sensation. So much of an experience that my kindness lead me to share a couple of the remaining rolls with my larger than life totem pole gunboat of a cousin Zus & my dear friend, the wisest of wise "handy" Andy. To which both responed: we are going back tomorrow & they better have these back home. To only properly conclude I will forward Kati Roll Company a quote from my life mentor Maximus Decimus Meridias: "strength & honor!"
