My boyfriend and I had an unbelievable meal here this past weekend. We decided last minute that we wanted to try this place during our NYC weekend and when we called to see if they had a reservation, they told us the earliest they had was 10:30pm. They also said if we wanted to try to come earlier to see if they had a table, we were more than welcome. So we put our name down but ended up arriving around 9:00 and were seated immediately. The atmosphere was perfect for a date night and the clay pots hanging from the ceiling were so beautiful! We ordered the saganaki and meatball appetizers - both great (and the grilled pita they brought to the table really helped with the saganaki). We split a horiatiki salad - the feta was unbelievable and the dressing was perfect. My boyfriend had the moussaka which literally tasted like one of our YiaYias had made it and I had the braised short ribs - so much flavor in both! If we had any room left in our tummies, I'm sure we would have tried one of the delicious desserts on the menu, but they would have had to roll us out of there. I wish I could move this place to Boston so I could eat here all the time. It was such a great meal and I will definitely go back next time I am in NYC.
