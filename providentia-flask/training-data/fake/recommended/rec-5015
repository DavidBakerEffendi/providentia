I feel bad that I don't remember most of the meal clearly enough to write a proper rundown, but I thoroughly enjoyed my evening here (in early January).  I'll echo the praise for the duck meatballs, but the one thing that has really stuck with me is the dessert:  I had the sticky toffee pudding, and it kind of haunts my dreams.  I can still remember how each bite started a little dry and crumbly, followed by each individual crumb suddenly bursting with flavor and overwhelming me with a kind of intense happiness I've only had for a few dishes in my whole life.
