Found this place on yelp and went with it because of previous positive reviews and it didn't disappoint. The location is a little tricky as it's down an alleyway but don't let that put you off. Arrived and staff were extremely friendly and explained everything on the menu and went through any questions we had. The food was delicious not a pick left on any of the 6 plates and 4 of the 6 had different dishes. Waiter was very attentive throughout and checked in on is to make sure everyone was happy. Ordered a couple of bottles of wine which were very reasonably priced and good quality. The overall cost of the meal for 6 of was just ridiculously cheap for the amount of food and drink we had and service was excellent. Will definitely come back here if we are back in philly!
