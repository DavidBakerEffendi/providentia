By far. BY FAR. The best pizza in New York. And I do not take an opinion like that lightly.  I don't particularly like Sicilian style, but the pepperoni Sicilian slice has made me avoid walking within 3 blocks of this place. It is incredible. It's the "I Cant Believe It's Not Butter" of pizza. In a good way. The owners and his son are the coolest dough throwers in Manhattan or any of the boroughs, and I doubt you'll find a better slice in the states.  Go.  Live your life.  Pizza is important.
