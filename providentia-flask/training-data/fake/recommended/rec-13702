Pretty good spot for a sandwich, though you can't eat here. It's a good place to grab something to eat back at the office. I generally get turkey. My coworker swears by the "Smart Duck." They have an interesting selection of imported jams, sauces, cookies, candies, and more. The downside being that it's so crowded, with such a narrow path, you're always worried that you'll knock something over. Looking forward to their new space. It'll be nice to have space to eat there, rather than take out.
