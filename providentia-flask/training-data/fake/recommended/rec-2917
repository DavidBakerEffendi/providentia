So I totally thought I had been to Johnny Brenda's before this year only to find out on a mini bar crawl that I had never been and the place that I thought was Johnny Brenda's because my ex took me there twice was really the Barbary.  Defiantly very different types of establishments, I am glad to have finally gotten to Johnny Brenda's thought.  Beer selection was great, liked the atmosphere of the bar.  The dinning area was pack so I am going to need to come back and try the food at some point.
