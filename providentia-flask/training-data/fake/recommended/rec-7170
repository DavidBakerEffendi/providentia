I like that Yelp is starting to take shots in the dark as to where you've been. Fine, i'll humor you Yelp! *Opens up Yelp * You Next Review Awaits 53rd & 6th Halal Cart "Have you been ?" Of course I've been! This place always has a longgggg line at night. People looking for that perfect greasy fix after a night of drinking and debauchery. For about 6 bucks you can get a choice of chicken/beef/lamb or a combo. Comes with a pita and rice. The star of the show is that white sauce. Straight crack. Be easy on the red sauce thou, really really strong stuff. Comedian Jo Koy explained it best in one of his stand up routines - " no one gives a fck about the chicken" "no one gives a fck about the rice" " it's that motherfckin WHITE SAUCE" youtube.com/watch?v=4kFqâ€¦
