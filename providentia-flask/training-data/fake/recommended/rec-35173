I had always wondered about Market Table. Every time I was in the neighborhood, I peered into the floor to ceiling tiled windows and promised myself to give it a shot! Food was INCREDIBLE. I'm salivating thinking of the gnocci with shortribs--wasn't too heavy and shortribs deliciously tender--and my boyfriends bacon-wrapped scallops were also wonderful. He had lamb shank which comes with gratin potatoes that are so out of this world that I devoured most of them off his plate, and I had the flank steak which was generously sized and perfectly cooked. Great wine list too. Service is a bit slower and food does take a while but it's nice to sit back, relax, and enjoy a slower pace once in a while, especially in NYC.
