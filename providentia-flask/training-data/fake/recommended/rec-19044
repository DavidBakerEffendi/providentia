This place is great. It's cozy, welcoming and comfortable. Perfect for a date or a group of friends.  Wine selection is expansive.  GET THE LORRAINE QUICHE. Gruyere, Bacon, Spinach. This recommendation comes from someone who is NOT a bacon eater, i ordered it to appease my friend and almost ate the whole thing solo....it is DELICIOUS. Definitely check this place out. Fairly quiet on the weekdays, but  i hear the bar gets a good crowd on weekends.
