Yum! Wonderful service, friendly and laid back, great for large groups. The food was a tad slow to come to the table but the place was packed and the food was superb, and kept on coming. Small plates can be fun: Chorizo tarts, goat cheese mousse, tomato poppers, fish tacos, pulled duck sliders, croquettes, lamb pops, dumplings, rosemary creme brule√©, and more. Beer samplers, a wide range of drinks, great music and ambiance to boot. I'm looking forward to coming back.
