I've been there for both lunch and dinner, and the quality of food and service are consistent.  The decor is sleek and very modern but in an understated way with monotone colors, which is inviting and relaxing.  When they have background music, you can still have quiet conversations, which I find it very civilized and is exactly the quality I always look for. The food is very good and some dishes are fabulous.  They always do great with pasta dishes (especially the squid ink pasta that has an amazing texture and flavors).  Duck was great.  The diver scallops and pork belly dish was OK.  (The pork belly was mostly fat, and I felt it was just a tad undercooked -could be me bcoz I like pork skin more crispy than chewy.)  And the baby octopus!  Desserts are always delightful. Their service is friendly, professional, subtle, and not pushy.  And for the quality of food & service and atmosphere they provide, I think it's good value without going over the top.  I also like its location, which is very removed from the street, and great views.
