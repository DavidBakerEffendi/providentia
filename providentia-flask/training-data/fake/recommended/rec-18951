I used to go here when I lived nearby and didn't mind the wait. The wait seems like forever though now that I don't live a few blocks away. Anyway, the food is great and I love these lil hole in the wall places which turn out to be amazing joints. I've always sat at the bar and the staff is friendly and always smiling. If you're a ramen fan, give it a try.
