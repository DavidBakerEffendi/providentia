Small cozy place, friendly woman working behind the desk. I was irritated before walking in there so wasn't in the best of moods so my girlfriend ordered something but I didn't. I will be back to try something in the near future. Her crepe looked good and it smells nice in there as well. I prefer take out for this place but there are places to sit but it's limited. I believe it's cash only but I could be wrong but I prefer paying in cash so that doesn't bother me. The lady offered suggestions to us and was of great help while deciding what to order.
