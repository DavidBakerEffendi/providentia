After watching numerous shows and documentaries about the rivalry between Geno's Steaks and Pat's King of Steaks, my BF and I decided to do our own comparison (aprilsims.com/philly-foo…). Both places are located across from one another in South Philly at the crossroads of South 9th Street and East Passyunk Avenue.  In the middle of the "x" on one side is Pat's and across the street in the middle of the "x" is Geno's. It is a strange configuration, however it has been working for this neighborhood since the 60's and as the saying goes "if it ain't broke, then don't fix it." From Pat's we ordered  a mushroom steak wiz wit. (wiz=Cheese Whiz, wit=with onions) . From Geno's we ordered a steak provolone wit. We sat down at a table halved the subs and began our comparison. In this food challenge Pat's beat Geno's hands down. The bread from Pat's was soft and warm and the meat was sliced thin, seasoned, juicy and tender. We did not think we would be fans of canned/jar cheese (Cheese Whiz) on a sandwich, however it worked and it was a pleasure to eat. On the other hand the bread from Geno's was a little tough and chewy. Their meat was sliced thicker than Pat's and did not seem to have any flavor even though we had onions and cheese added to our cheesesteaks.
