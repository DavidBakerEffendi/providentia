In love with the fresh flavors at Cookshop. We went to Cookshop on the recommendation of the girls working at Story a block down and it was a great choice. The food choice changes based on seasonal availability which is fabulous because you are getting fresh selections with unique recipes.   We had a cantaloupe and watermelon salad with red onion and speck that was so fresh and delicious. Then we shared the fava bean hummus with pistachios, an eggplant purée with cucumber, and fresh feta cheese served with spiced flatbread - it was awesome. Our server (who was incredible) recommended the pizza - his words "the best pizza in NY" - it was wonderful. Fresh tomatoes and chewy crust with a crunch on the outside. It was a great find!
