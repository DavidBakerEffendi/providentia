Disappointing.  There were 5 of us, all chocolate/dessert lovers.   Felt like an expensive gimmicky restaurant.  . Desserts are overdone.  Too many items in each concoction that take away from the enjoyment of the chocolate.   Disorganized and detached staff.  Not the most welcoming place.  We were given plates and utensils to set our own table.   We saw people leave their tables with nearly full plates of their orders. Everywhere you look there are images of the owner, Max Brenner.  There is a caricature of him on the napkins, on the tee-shirts, the walls, the receipts...his name is on the salt shakers, the mugs, engraved repeatedly on the windows behind the seats.  OY!  Really!?
