They have now increased their prices to $7. I think that now that they have a restaurant, they think they're all high and mighty and can charge higher prices! Additionally, it seems that food quality has gone down. The meat has become tasteless and the portions seem a bit smaller. The last time I got served, by the time I found a seat, my food was already cold. You would think it would be fresh since there is a huge line.
