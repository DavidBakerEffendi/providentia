We bought our new years eve tickets for this place. Not only they had lousy DJ, they also had assigned seating. Few of my friends and family bought tickets separately. When I called them to ensure they have seating togather, they clearly said they cannot change the seats. SO much for all family and friends going to the same place! Never going here again!
