I am here WAY too often. It's that good. The food is always amazing, they have a great rotating beer selection, and the service is always friendly. It can get SUPER packed, especially if there's a show going on upstairs, but it's worth it. I've only been upstairs for one show, but the space was clean and roomy. The balcony has a great view. Their Sunday brunch is awesome. I highly recommend JB's. I've never had a bad experience here and I don't think I ever will.
