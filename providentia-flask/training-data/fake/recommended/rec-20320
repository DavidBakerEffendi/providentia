My boyfriend and I recently went to Buttermilk Channel for dinner on a Tuesday night. Both of us live in Brooklyn and had heard many great things about the establishment. It was the first time there for both of us. Upon entering, we were greeted by a pleasant hostess and told there was a ten minute wait. We were fine with that, as the restaurant was quite full. We kind of stood and waited off to the side and the bartender caught my eye and handed me a drink menu. Very nice and accommodating. We ordered one round of drinks. We were sat about fifteen minutes later. The experience  as a whole was great up until being seated and my only gripe with the  over all night was the less then mediocre service by our female  server. The food proved to be wonderful but the server neglected us for the majority of the evening. The  fundamentals of service were not in place and the lacking of the basics seemed even more glaring in such a nice restaurant. Id compare the level of service to that of a diner. Our entrees were great, but we were turned off by the service to stay for desert. Hopefully next time service at this restaurant will redeem itself.
