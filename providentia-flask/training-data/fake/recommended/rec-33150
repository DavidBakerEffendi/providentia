Don't let the appearance fool u as it looks dim and grungy but the reason this place is so busy is the variety on the menu, fair price$ and food so good u feel like u eating at a top notch restaurant, almost had everything on the menu as i make this spot almost every weekend when nothing else comes to mind, i'm a shrimp head so i had the grill shrimp salad to start and it tasted better than other restaurant i had because of their homemade dressing and fresh ingredients, they definitely not stingy on the shrimp and the dressing is so refreshing keeps u wanting more and the shrimp pasta a must try, they even have a special menu which if u get to see the organic chicken that day u gotta try it very tasty with lots of flavor, they even got steak, cuban sandwich, other pasta dishes, chicken and schnitzel, great salmon and did i say a great shrimp salad...staff is cool, most of the ppl eating there are either students, hipsters, artist or locals, they keep it real, nothing fancy (which sometimes i like, i dont feel like dressin up everytime i go out to eat lol) but its all bout the food...
