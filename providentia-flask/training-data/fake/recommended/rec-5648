i LOVE the $8 6 oysters 1 drink (red or white wine or beer) deal BUT I've had some funky tasting oysters here before. I also had a rotten Sea Urchin ( Uni ) at the restaurant so that was also a bit disappointing too.. However, I am happy with the prices and it helps with my oyster fix. The other dishes on the menu are really tasty too, including tuna/salmon tartars, lobster, mussels... It's one of the best reasonably priced seafood restaurants in the tri-state area so when I am feigning for my oysters, I will definitely come back again.
