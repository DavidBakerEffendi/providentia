I love this place and ate here every morning for breakfast during my last trip. The prices are good, it's clean, there are so many options, and it's easy to find something healthy to eat. When I first walked in I saw a big display of drinks and couldn't believe they had my favorite drink! Kombucha tea! I normally have to go to a health food store to find this. I was impressed. They also have coconut water (great for hangovers and hydration) and many other drink options. They have a salad bar, pasta bar, soups, sandwiches,and more. They even sell snacks and candy so there's a little bit of everything there. The staff was very friendly. I mainly ordered omelets, there are many options but I custom ordered mine and was very happy to have a fast, healthy, inexpensive breakfast. There is seating in the front and also upstairs.
