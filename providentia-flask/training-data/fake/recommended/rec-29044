Max Brenner would be good if you go for the right things. The two whimpy stars I gave deserves explanation. I only gave it 2 stars, One for the hot chocolate in a hug mug which was probably the best Ill ever have and I actually bought the hug mugs online for my brothers as x-mas gifts (which went over very well). Then one for the chilli chocolate waffle fries, original and yummy. As for the other 3 missing stars they go to poor waiters, bad entrees, and cramped inside. Went there with the fiance and families around the holidays last year about 10 of us, and they seated us by the bar which means people kept bumping into our chairs and the waiter spilled a hot chocolate shot in my lap, which they didnt even have the manners to comp. The entrees tasted like TGIF on an off night with dryn burgers and over seasoned fish tacos. None of the entrees were memorable and all over priced. The decor is one of a kind but its just not made for large groups or a great dinner. If you go here, just get anything with Â chocolate and maybe an appetizer, anything else will dissappoint.
