I saw this place on numerous gluten free apps and it is listed as gluten free on yelp. IT IS NOT GLUTEN FREE. They had three options (all salads) and not even corn tortillas for their tacos. It's terrible for a gluten free meal. Service was also extremely slow. This was really unexpected as there were only four patrons and two severs. Not good. Maybe swing through here for a slooooow drink and then head three doors down to Reviver for a true delicious gluten free experience.
