Black Bamboo is as good as it gets with Chinese Takeout.... I usually get the General Tso Chicken lunch/ dinner special and you cant go wrong ordering that. The owners of this place are genius's they make higher end Chinese takeout and don't fall into any of the negative Chinese takeout stereotypes Pros: Very Clean Great Food Fair Prices Free Tea while I wait Delivery Cons: They need to get another phone because calls do not always go through Avg. delivery time is over an hour
