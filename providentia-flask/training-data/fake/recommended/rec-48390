My best friend/lover and I found this place while we were lost in Brooklyn riding our bikes. I went inside to ask if they would fill up a water bottle for me and felt really comfortable there. The decor was up my alley, they were blasting "semi-charmed life" by third eye blind, it smelled good and the bartender was super friendly. Since I had never tried Austrian food before, we decided that we'd hit Cafe Steinhof up the next day, since it seemed like it would be a good time. We of course, checked it out on yelp first to know what to except, and got excited to see it had really good reviews. We showed up on a Monday. They have a small menu of like 6 items, and we both opted for the goulash. It was bangin!! beers were good, the kaiser rolls were good, so was the bread pudding, and it had to have been the cheapest and fasted meal I had ever had on a date, EVER! Like 30 minutes tops, totally at like $35 with tip. No time for awkward bullshit conversation there. We were in and out, and off to kill some time exploring and drinking before catching a movie. I LIKE!!!
