After failing to find a different restaurant I decided to settle on this burger place.  I was completely surprised about how amazing and magical this small burger bar turned out to be!   All of the other reviews were right about the special sauce. I think they pour it out of the holy grail onto the burgers!   I also ordered fries and they were fresh and delicious!
