The pizza here is delicious. I had the Diavalo and enjoyed every bite. Having recently learned what veal actually is, I felt strange about eating baby cow meat, so I passed on my BF's ricotta stuffed meatballs. However, he loved them, and judging from the sauce, which I sampled with my pizza crust, I probably would have too. I also loved the ambiance. It was a small cramped space, but managed to maintain a modern, upscale feel. The bar area actually looked inviting and the chalk menu overhead adds a nice, relaxed touch. Though I went for lunch, not happy hour, it seemed to be a great place for a drink after a long day. The service was great, too. My only complaint was that the dessert was a lackluster finale for the meal. We ordered the tiramisu, which I usually love. However, don't be tempted by Zavino's. It's awful. That aside, they definitely know how to cook up a good pie.
