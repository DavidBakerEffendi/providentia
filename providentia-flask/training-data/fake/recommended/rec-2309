I went to this place last week. Â I had my first cheesesteak at Tony Luke's, but didn't review because I had no real comparison. Anyway, went there on a saturday night at around 10 ish. Waited online for about 15 minutes and when I finally got to the counter there was an old thuggish man at the cashier who mumbled my order. Just to make sure, I repeated myself and he gave me a ridiculous attitude, trying to play me like I was a teenage kid. Anyway, I stupidly said I was from NY and he started babbling about the Phillies and how the Yankees suck. He said, "We're gonna get another ring this year. One for each finger." And he stuck up his middle fingers in my face. Is that a joke? I mean I don't expect much class, but I don't expect to be given the finger while I'm trying to order dinner. I'm there for a sandwich, not to talk about your loser life and how baseball is the high point in your day. I hated the service, it was slow(er than Geno's even though the line was twice as long) and this guy just really irked me... I gotta say though, out of Geno's and Pat's their steaks are better. More meat, more cheese. It was pretty tasty. Not to mention their fries are nice and crispy.
