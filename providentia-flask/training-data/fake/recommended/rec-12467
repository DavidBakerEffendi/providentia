Althpugh the food may have been great, the service was horrible. The short lady with glasses was really rude when she talked to us. Me and two girls came and made a rsvp and we were told that they would call us when seats get available. The wait was 45 mins so we decided to go to a nearby store real quick. We came back 15 minutes before our estimated wait.when we got there they said they already called us and the lady rudely said with an attitude "this is why I told you to stay outside and wait". This ruined my appetite for the rest of the meal.
