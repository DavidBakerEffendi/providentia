Oh em gee.  This place is just lovely.  The great ambiance (dark wood, dim lighting, but not overly romantic) and warm/helpful service makes eating at Salinas a truly pleasant dining experience.  I very much enjoyed the croquette tapas, which were delicately filled with what dreams are made of, richly flavored and creamy, and lined up in a single file on the plate like cute, little, round soldiers, very closely resembling a popular part of the female anatomy (that does not rhyme with mulva or Dolores..).  I had the porcella entree, which was an impressively large serving and very tasty.  It came with fried chic peas, which were really nice.  My life partner had a fish dish that melted in my mouth, extremely flavorful and perfectly cooked.  Overall, fantastic dining experience, with quality food and service.  Also, as a slightly mentally unhinged germ phobic freak, I have to mention that the bathrooms at Salinas are so damned nice.  They are unusually immaculate, cozy and handsomely decorated.  Kinda wanted to get a nice, ergonomic chair, put it in there, and read the weekend edition of the NY Times.  I shall return, Salinas.  I shall.
