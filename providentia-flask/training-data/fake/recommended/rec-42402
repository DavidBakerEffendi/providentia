My friend Paden told me this was the place to eat around the Magic Mountain area and he was not kidding. We sat down at the bar to enjoy the bruins game and started with mason jars of PBR for only $2.50! Deciding to start with some apps before we picked out some pizza we got the cheesy bread sticks and fiery wings. Let me tell you, these wings are UNREAL! The sause is the perfect heat (probably too hot for some). My friend went with a pulled pork pizza and me craving a white pizza w spinach and fetta went for more of a veggie route. The pizzas were great! To sum everything up its not the cheapest place to eat but the fiery wings are surreal! Keep up the good work and get that fiery sause on a pizza!!!
