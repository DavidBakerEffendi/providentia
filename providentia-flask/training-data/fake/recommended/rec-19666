This is my second time at bogota and I am never disappointed. The food is so delicious and packed with flavor. I went last night with my boyfriend, and we both enjoyed our meals and drinks... I had the coconut mussels for my appetizer and OMG it was amazing...seriously that good. The empanadas were good as well. For my entree I had the fish tacos, which our waitress told me were catfish.. so moist, flavorful and a very hefty portion including the sides. The beer selection is definitely worth mentioning... I had a beer from Columbia and it was very good. Love this place !! Good food, nice staff...
