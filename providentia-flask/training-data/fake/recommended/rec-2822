I thought I could eat anything, but I can't stomach Ethiopian food.  So, this was my second and last try.  They say it's an "acquired taste".  Whatever - that just sounds snobbish.  Injera tastes like a rotted old sponge, to me. I'm giving it three stars because, as Ethiopian goes, they try and the server was nice.  But, sorry.  Ethiopian cuisine is the perfect thing for when I'm dieting.  Bleh!
