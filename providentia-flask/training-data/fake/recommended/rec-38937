Good bagels, no denying that. They are handmade right in front of you. They have a really distinct... sweetness to them that sets them apart from all the other places. Montreal spice and everything are my favorites. Don't get the garlic. It carries this odd burnt flavor in the garlic that dulls it down and ruins the whole thing. I've had the garlic multiple times (i don't know why i keep getting it; i just trade it with someone else's each time). Their cream cheese is super yummy as well - get the Montreal spice or the scallions. They do have hot drinks-really nice on a chilly day with a warm bagel. They have coffee, hot cocoa, and some cappacinos. Don't go right when they open because they won't have all the flavors. I definitely suggest going there to get some unique and satisfying bagels.
