El Vez is fine. The food is good but not great. The outdoor seating is nice, but the rest of the atmosphere is a little cheesy. It's a nice place to grab a drink in a neighborhood of mostly BYOs and can be a godsend when every other tiny restaurant in Midtown Village has given you a 2 hour wait time. It's a alright place to grab a drink at the bar with friends, but for a meal, you could do better.
