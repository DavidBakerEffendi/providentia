The ambiance feels like you walked through the door into Williamsburg, BK. the mixed drinks are creative and tasty, especially the rum punch. Kind of a riff on a Dark and stormy. All of the grilled cheeses are yummy too. Usually there are lots of people but its not too hard to find a place to hang out. Always lots of fun.
