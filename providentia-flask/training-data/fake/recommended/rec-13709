Breakfast is my favorite meal (after Dessert of course)...but I hardly get to indulge in it because I'm usually too tired or hungover to wake up. The only exception is when I am on vacation- this is when I turn into the supercharged-want to do everything-wake up at the crack of dawn type of person. During my visit to NYC, Clinton St. Baking was highly recommended by a friend. It sure did not disappoint!!! The Blueberry Pancakes were just as phenomenal as everyone said- fluffy and not too sweet. We also had the vanilla waffles with pears and walnuts....equally delicious!! The Truffle Fried Eggs with asparagus and artichoke hearts was something surprising that I've never heard/had before....no surprise here, it was AMAZING. The truffle flavor was strong, but not overpowering. I've been back in the city for a week now, but still have the blueberry pancakes on my mind...yummm...can't wait to go back!!
