The live music Fri n Sat nights intrigued me and so I made reservations couple weeks back for a Fri night Â for me n a girlfriend. It was near the Wilshire where we were staying. We arrived at 9 30 n asked to be seated by the band. Not the best view but they sounded great. It def had the feel of like a chain type restaurant but the live band really kicked it up, they were older, bluesy n playing pretty sick. Sadly when we placed our orders (my salad w/ grilled chicken, her grilled chicken wrap) the waiter returned and claimed they ran outta chicken. Who runs outta chicken?? It was all good cuz the waiter was cool n gave us a round of beers on the house for the inconvenience. Chicken, what chicken? haha.. So I wouldn't go outta my way but for tunes n fair priced food I wouldn't cancel them out either ;)
