Inconsistency. The first time I came here was sometime in Feburary.  I had the spicy ramen with pork.  I can say that that visit was probably one of the best ramen dishes I've had.  I was very upset when I hadn't ordered extra pork.  It was so soft and yummy. One month later--I needed more.  And I got extra pork this time.  However, I couldn't even finish 2 pieces.  The pork was tough and very hard to eat.  My wife and I were surprised at how it could go from 5 stars to a 2 star meal.   Now that ramen season (winter) is over for me, I'll probably give them another shot sometime down the road.
