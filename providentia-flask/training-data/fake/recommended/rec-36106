Yeah, okay, does Joe's really need another review? Well I'm going to throw my SORTA ABC (American born Chinese, but not really) 2 cents in here: 1. Food here is not that spectacular, it's just good to me.  But duuuude it's cheap, tasty, service is fast (even if you wait some pretty minutes for a table), and the quality is consistent.  (I've been here quite a few times thanks to an obsessed fwend.) It has a good, no fuss no muss atmosphere because it's teeming with people and hot steam from those lovely little soup dumplings, and nobody's going to look at you when you bit into a scalding dumpling and act a fool.  Speaking of which.... 2. The soup dumpling is the draw of this place.  Hence, haven't tried much else.  Don't think anything else could be that spectacular.  Very common Asian fare. Was that 2 cents....times a hundred bazillion? Show me the money!
