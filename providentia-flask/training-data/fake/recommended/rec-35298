Wow! I have never been to this part of Chinatown so be prepared that it is not the niciest area if you are heading there. But for the dumplings, it is WELL WORTH IT! Food: - Absolutely insanely good dumplings made in every way (pan fry, boiled, steam etc.) - The ingredients in the dumplings are extremely well seasoned, it is the real Chinese dumplings that people in Asia eat! Decor: - This is NOT a sit down dinner place. I went with a co-worker without knowing that, and we were shocked when we walked in. Think of it as a fast food delivery shop with very delicious food for you to take it to go with. Price: - I was SHOCKED when the cashier asked me 'How many DOLLARs would you like your dumplings' [in Chinese]. Apparently it is $1 per 5 dumplings. I have not been ANYWHERE, including Asia that is A DOLLAR for a dish that I want. [Granted there is the currency exchange when in Asia.]
