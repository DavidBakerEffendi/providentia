I was in here again to buy croissants for work.  This time I got a medely of the 6 croissant options that they -- this time, they ranged from $2.50 - $3.50.  They were flakey, flavorful, and delicious.  This time I tried a raspberry one - just the right mild amount of filling.  My question is still price -- they are even more expensive than the review I wrote a few years back ($1.75 in 2010).  Maybe ingredients are really just that much more expensive these days?  Who knows.  I think I'll probably just find another place to stop for work events in the future.  It might be slightly less tasty, but I'll risk it.
