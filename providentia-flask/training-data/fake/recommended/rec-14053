Took us a month to get a table but it was worth the wait. This is probably my new favorite restaurant, I took off one star for super snooty service (not sure the waiter ever made eye-contact) but the service was efficient at least. The highlights here are clearly the veggies. We ended up ordering a bunch, almost tapas style, because we couldn't decide on just one or two. The wood-grilled ramps were perfection. The peas with mint were just buttery enough. The squash had a perfect sear on it so that the outside was crispy (with parm) and the inside was soft (almost like a mashed potato consistency). We also split an entree, the spinach and ricotta ravioli (we got three each, for $31). The tomato sauce was perfect, extremely fresh and not doctored with any spices, just the right amount of olive oil and salt. Everything was priced well in the $10-20 range (entrees in the $25-35 range) except I think the ravioli were overpriced. They were good but not that great, I've had better elsewhere. A few missteps involved drinks. The housemade soda I had was spring herb, which was delicious, but came without a sprig of anything in it. My friend had the strawberry soda and it was very syrupy and didn't really taste like strawberry, a little odd ($5 a pop). We ordered tea at the end of our meal and the menu said fresh mint tea, so that's what we expected, not TEA BAGS. Hello! Missed opportunity. The dessert menu looked a little run-of-the-mill: chocolate cake, carrot cake, etc., so we skipped it. The ice creams sounded great, we just weren't in the mood. The atmosphere is very casual and relaxing and decorated the way you would think ABC decorates. It's also clean and not loud when it gets crowded and the tables are well spaced. The only downside is that it's a bit of a scene--people who think they need to be seen--and so long as you can find the humor in that and not let it bother you, you'll have a great experience. We'll be back.
