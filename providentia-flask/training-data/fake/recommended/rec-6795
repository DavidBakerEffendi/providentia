I had the pleasure of eating at Matt & Marie's last Wednesday while visiting Philly.  I go to Philly a good amount from NYC and always looking for a good lunch spot.  The place right away gives you an upscale sandwich shop feel. Super clean and crisp looking.  The staff was super friendly and inviting as you walk through the door.  They walked me through the options and I decided to go with the Uncle Guys' Turkey sandwich.  I love the personal touch they give you as they make your sandwich to tell you about the ingredients in the sandwich.  The price seems perfectly reasonable for such a high quality sandwich. I sat down at the communal table and inhaled my lunch.  I couldn't eat it fast enough, it was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had, I also bought some dark chocolate milano's that they sell at the cashier counter! A nice touch if you ask me! If I worked in the area I would see myself having lunch there most days.  Such a nice change from the usual sandwich shops.  The high quality of ingredients really makes a huge difference. I highly recommend everyone in the area to stop by and order up some deliciousness!
