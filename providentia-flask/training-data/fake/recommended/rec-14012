i am from washington dc and as big of a city as we are we do not for the love of god have a decent ramen place!!! so for my visit to ny i told my host that i wanted some authentic ramen...and there was only once place he could think of.... IPPUDO! so we walk to ippudo and enter this dark cave...through some velvet curtains...and am immediately engulfed in a throng of people all cramming to get their name on the list. i elbow my way through and add out name on....a 2.5 hour wait time. ETA 6pm. so my friends and i walk around and come back...we get seated and are greeted with a loud shout from all the servers are sushi bar staff. yay! we sit and i let my friend who has been here before do most of the ordering appetizers: pork buns- mmmm sweet tender pork in a light chewy rice cake with some lettuce and a spicy mayo sauce..delish! tofu..something?- i forgot the name of this but it was tofu in a large bowl with a savory broth. the tofu was wrapped in this gelatin like coating that was SO good!! main: i ordered the special of the evening which was the wasabi ramen with pork and poached egg...this was TO DIE for! i loved how the ramen was infused with wasabi...mmmm not too spicy at all!! and the server came around and showed you how to enjoy and eat the ramen correctly. i was super stuffed after the meal and left satisfied. only complaint i have was that the hostess was RUDE and seemed to hate the world. get a grip girlfriend... and the lobby area where we were waiting was SUPER HOT and humid, while the rest of the restaurant was cool. but the 2.5 hour wait in that area was unbearable.. doesn't help that outside was even hotter...
