just ate there tonight and was very happy.  we got a table in ten minutes and the food was amazing.  I'll be back again and again.  The only drawback is that I got half a dozen mosquito bites while we waited outside, but I can;t blame the cafe.  great choice of drinks too!  Highly recommend the smoked trout salad with lentils and goat cheese.  It's filling and every bite is a unique flavour.
