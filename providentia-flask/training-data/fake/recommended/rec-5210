I've driven all the way from Hopewell to get Lucky Palace cuisine in spite of several places between there and here.  Especially the Egg Drop Soup and Crab Rangoons - they only sometimes have General Zhao's Shrimp, but if you're lucky enough to hit on a night they do - try it. Ambiance .... eh, not so much.  But the food?  Delectable indeed.
