Great authentic Italian sandwiches. I had the Paestum panino. The ingredients are incredible. The prosciutto di Parma is amazing. Equally importantly, it is beautifully cut. The mozzarella di bufala is extremely tasty, fresh and perfectly complements the prosciutto. The small drizzle of extra virgin olive oil is the perfect final touch. Differently from common "deli sandwiches", the Paestum panino is very well balanced, none of the ingredients is overpowering, and the overall flavor is not a confused mix of random stuff. You are able to taste and appreciate the freshness and the high quality of every single thing that goes in the sandwich. I cannot wait to be back to try the other panini. They all sound delicious. I strongly advise you to go and try this place. These guys know what they are doing.
