Charming, if a bit disjointed, thus adding to the former. It's a strip mall taste of gay Paree that offers just enough to make it repeatable, yet nothing outrageous to make it mandatory. The chocolate croissant (light, airy, flaky, buttery) carried almost none of the bittersweet stuff, a stark contrast to the raspberry croissant which lived thick with jammy filling. Both adequately baked, and enjoyable to destroy. Tea from bags, coffee I'll never drink, and both milked with a unique system, conducted as follow: request dairy, they fetch dairy from fridge, they give you dairy in its rawest form (read: a plastic jug), you add dairy and return the jug. I don't think it's too outlandish nor is it wasteful to have caddies, trivets or other means to carry the moo. Just a note. With a display case that looked picked over before lunch and a jovial, albeit somewhat aloof staff at the helm, I could see room for improvement on inventory management and the overall customer flow. But amidst enticing aromas and comfortable lounging (with free wifi), it's already a great place to park and shift to idle.
