While good cooking its uninspiring. So you have a good meal and walk away saying.... So what. Don't regret having eaten there, but don't see any Â reason to come back unless I was in the neighborhood and in need of a meal and didn't want to venture. But in this neighborhood plenty better restaurants loom nearby. Portions also rather small. Could not believe how small the branzino portion is. Was hungry soon thereafter.
