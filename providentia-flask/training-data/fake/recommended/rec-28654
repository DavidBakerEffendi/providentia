I went here after reading about the almond butter puffed quinoa chocolate bar from a yelp promotional email.  We got one almond banana smoothie, and one organic gluten-free oatmeal smoothie.  The smoothies were tasteless.  There is supposedly pear juice in the oatmeal smoothie, and we couldn't taste anything.  Overall the consistency is that of slightly gritty water, and utterly unappetizing. The chocolate bar was alright, but the quinoa isn't honestly noticeable, with no real crunch.  Overall, our snack cost $25, which was ridiculous for food that was ok at best.  Not returning.
