I've been here for brunch a couple of times and it's definitely one of my favourite spots. The pastry board the first time I went was one of the best things I've ever had for breakfast so that always sets things up nicely. I was very happy with my duck hash with poachies, but was looking longingly at my girlfriend's salmon... with which she kindly did a quick swap. I went again on Friday which prompted the review. It wasn't quite as good but this could be because it was on a weekday. My all day breakfast with grits was cleaned up pretty swiftly with a good americano, and the only problem was with all the courses we ordered there wasn't enough room on the table! The service was also very good and much appreciated. Pretty sure that this will be my staple brunch recommendation for anyone visiting the city, so if you get an influx of Brits, apologies.
