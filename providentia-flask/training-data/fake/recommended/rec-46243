My partner and I dined here during our last night in the city, and it was the perfect way to end our holiday trip. We both indulged in the chef's 8-course tasting menu. Every dish was phenomenal made exponentially better by the uber-attentive service. We opted for the wine pairing, as well, which was an excellent choice. Two drinks at the bar, dinner and wine pairing put us north of $400, but it was worth every penny and every minute of the three-hour service. Hoping to come back during our next visit.
