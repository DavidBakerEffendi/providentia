delish. a few friends and i decided to stop at reading terminal market for lunch. after a brief walk around to check out the vendors, the long line, although a hassle, drew me to dinics. if its good people will wait, right? i ordered the italian style pulled pork with sharp provolone and spinach. my friend ordered the roast pork with sharp provolone and hot roasted peppers. the pulled pork was clearly the winner in my opinion... more flavorful, more juicy. at roughly 9 bucks with the toppings, definitely worth it. pats and genos, who?
