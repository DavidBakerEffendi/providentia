stumbled in here after a long day of walking and boy, was it good. i had a lot of pizza on my recent new york trip, and this was some of the best i had. i had the margherita slice and it was just perfect. perfect crispness, perfect flavor, perfect cheese. it's a cozy and clean place and i like the photos of celebrities on the walls who have visited.
