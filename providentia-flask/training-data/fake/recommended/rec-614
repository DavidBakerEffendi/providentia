Pretty awesome white sauce and knock your head off hot sauce make the combination plate into a scrumptious lunch.  The big portion of lettuce, rice, lamb, chicken, and pita was plenty for me and the fiance to share, so it turned out to be an extremely cheap lunch too.  It wasn't oh-my-god, gotta-write-home-about-this amazing, but I wasn't expecting it to be--and you shouldn't either.  It's good street food.  I'll go back when I'm in the area.
