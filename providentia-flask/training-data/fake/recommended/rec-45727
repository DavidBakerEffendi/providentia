So I found this place while searching for local eats on yelp; when I went to check it out with friends they had my attention and my appetite when i read crispy pork belly waffle taco which had the bahn mi veggies (cilantro, pickled carrots and daikon). I especially like their unique menu, friendly owners, and the fact that they are located right in astoria. Will definitely come back for more.
