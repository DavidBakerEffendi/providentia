After reading the long list of Yelp! reviews & food network accolades, we went to Paesano's located at Italian market, 9th street, Philadelphia, PA. First off, this is a really small eatery located in an old neighborhood. So, if you are looking for ambience, this is not the place for you. Secondly, the food is OK but is not great. We had panelle and Gustaio sandwiches. They  were ready in 15 minutes or so .  Both sandwiches were wrapped in a thin tortilla type thin crisp bread and came packed with ingredients & sauce. Because of the heavy ingredients, the think bread was falling apart and this made a  messy eating.  Panelle was kind of spicy due to the hot sauce but was otherwise ok. All in all, we wouldn't go here again as it is not worth the long drive. If you live in the area, it is probably good place for a quick take-out.
