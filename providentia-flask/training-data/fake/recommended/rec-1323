You would think that in a city as big as Philly that there would be better pizzerias then there is. Either you go high end like Bufad or Pizzeria Stella and spend a lot of money for a small pie...albeit a "gourmet pizza' or you are stuck with the pizza place on the corner. Well I came across La Rossa by "Googling" best pizza in Center City and the reviews were good. They won Philly magazine's "Best Slice". It's a pick or delivery business- no tables. They are feet away from Broad and Snyder and I've seen the foot traffic come in from people waiting for the bus/subway. They also sell good Italian bread loafs too. The style is Sicilian (square) with a cruncy crust but still soft dough. A large pie is a great value and more than your money's worth.
