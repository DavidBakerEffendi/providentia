i wish i could give this place 5 stars. if review was based on food alone, it would deserve 5 starts. however, this place consistently has TERRIBLE service and takes an unreasonable amount of time to serve food and drinks. the roast pork, grilled salmon, chicharrones are some of our favorite dishes in the neighborhood, but each and every time we go back (leaving enough time to forget the horrible service from the time before), we are reminded why we don't frequent this place more. what's worse, is that the waiters act very ignorant that you've been waiting 30 min for an appetizer and an hour for your main dish. i understand it is not their fault, and more the fault of the cooks and the general organization of the restaurant, but they do nothing to placate the situation. it seems crazy to me that a place is unable to properly serve customers when full (isn't that the goal of a restaurant, to be full?!). i would recommend going on an off night or early or late when they aren't trying to juggle a lot of tables...oh the place isn't that big either, MAYBE 10 tables and a bar? get your shit together, puerto!
