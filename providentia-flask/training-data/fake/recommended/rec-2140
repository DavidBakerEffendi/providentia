I've lived in Philly my entire life, and this place is far from "King" of anything. These are just awful. I honestly think the ONLY people that rave about these are the same people that visit here at 3am after they're so drunk cardboard would taste good. There are better places in NE Philly like Chinks and Jim's. If you want a good cheese steak go somewhere else, but if you'd like a Wawa alternate after 2am and taste isn't really a high priority, then come here. Atleast you can look at pictures of all the celebrities that tried these awful steaks too.
