The manfried loves him some rye, so I always keep an eye and ear out for whiskey bars that might interest him. I, on the other hand, detest whiskey, so I just come along for the ride and hope they have good non-whiskey options. We wandered into Village Whiskey on our first afternoon in Philly, looking to pass some time before dinner. The place is smaller than I was expecting - long and narrow; had it been prime drinking hour, I imagine it wouldn't take much to get uncomfortably crowded (especially with one bathroom in the place). If you want guidance and info, I highly recommend sitting at the bar. We bellied up to the bar and my friends picked the bartender's brain about their selection. They went once ounce pours, which essentially allowed them to create their own flights. As the non-whiskey drinker in the group, I wasn't as impressed with the cocktail options. Very light on non-whiskey choices, although not terribly surprising with a place that is named after one specific type of liquor. I ended up sipping a tequila cocktail and wasn't disappointed. If you appreciate good whiskey, I would definitely put this place on your radar.
