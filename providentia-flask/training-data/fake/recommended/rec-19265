Last night was my first night in Chinatown, and I am completely happy that I ate here. I had the sliced beef noodle bowl, and it was absolutely delicious. The server was very kind when I asked her questions, and pointed me in the right direction. She recommended the Avocado smoothie, and It was great! The pricing was very cheap, especially for the size. I will definitely return. As a matter of fact, probably sooner than later.
