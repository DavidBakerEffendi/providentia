Horrible experience last night. We were excited to try Public for quite some time now, but were quite disappointed with the service and rudeness we experienced with one of the servers. It took an extra long time for my entree to come out, when the fish finally got there the crust was soggy, left a horrible taste in our mouths, and was COLD. We notified a different waiter that it needed to be remade, but then quickly changed our mind and asked him to not re-make the dish at all. We were done. Our waitress never came back regarding the incident. Before the check, I pulled her aside to let her know that the fish was cold and soggy since she never came by, however the waitress got defensive and started saying "well the fish here is served medium-rare" implying a level of unsophistication... Excuse me, I eat fish multiple times per week in many restaurants, and medium-rare is my preferred temperature. Never have I had a cold soggy fish or a waitress to argue with me about it. Aside from that, ambiance and appetizers were great, but the fish is all I remember.
