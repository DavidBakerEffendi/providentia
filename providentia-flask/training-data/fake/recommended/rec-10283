Fishy Tales by Hot Pots is one of the excellent trucks you will find at the Bushnell Park Food Truck Court; yelp.com/biz/bushnell-pa… With it's splashy paint job, Soul Food and Seafood and ample line of people during lunch I was a tad surprised to see it wasn't list on Yelp.  Now it is.  I'll take this FTR thank you.   Of the nearly dozen trucks I ate at in the same day this was the very last and due to the massive line.  It was the first in the line up on Wells Street and obviously very popular.   I went with the fried clam and chips plate.   As you will see by my photos at $8 this was a huge take out haul and and haul it away I did.   Snacked on some on the way back to my hotel and the full belly clams were fresh, juicy and succulent inside of a sturdy flavorful batter.   Exactly the type of quality clams you would expect in New England.   Insanely huge amount of fries were hot and tasty.   Can only imagine what the soul food here is like, it seemed that most others were order it with greens being very popular.     So there's my tale.  A+ Truck.
