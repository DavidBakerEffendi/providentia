After a couple of recommendations from friends I went to Bloomfield Steakhouse for the first time and was overall very pleased! The house that it is located in is beautiful and holds a significant amount of history which is pretty cool. Decor was also pretty nice and welcoming. It's somewhere I'd go to after work for a quick beer and dinner if only I lived closer. I chose the outdoor seating which is quite spacious and included a fire pit. Service was awesome! We had a very knowledgeable waitress who seemed to be training a new waiter and was able to explain all the specials and even details on how the dishes are made and even the flavors you'd expect! So upbeat and eager to assist in anyway she even got me more excited about my food than I had been previously. Coming to a steakhouse for the first time I'm gonna obviously try the steak and I was not disappointed. Their cowboy ribeye was great and it came with fries which were good as well. Had a side of Mac and cheese as well as the cream of spinach. Those two sides alone are a meal, so guess who had lunch all ready for the next day? This guy. Overall, no complaints and I'm definitely going to be back. I can see myself having one of their burgers in my near future.
