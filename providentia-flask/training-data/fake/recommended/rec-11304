Nice place, good food(I had the burger and it did not disappoint) and great selection of beer. The decor had a very homelike feel. Nothing very special about this place, but overall,  if you just want some good quality American style food with a nice beer selection where you can hang around with a group of friends, check this place out.  One thing that it did lack was TV's, but that's my own preference.
