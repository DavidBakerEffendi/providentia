(Delivery experience) Bleak "Mediterranean" ingredients sloppily thrown into a bowl lazily shimmer at me... First reaction, "Ewww..." Soon, calmer minds prevail with the understanding that looks can be deceiving... Ultimate truth; I am hungry, and hummus, chickpeas, pita; all the basics seem to be here. How bad could it be? Consume... Ultimately only one ingredient was lacking; any basic understanding of how to prepare quality Mediterranean food. Disappointment shifts to annoyance. Honestly this is disrespectful to all who have actually tasted an honest representation, and worse, a sad attempt at gentrifying it. This was weak, weak, weak! At least an honest "Americanized" version would have SOME infused flavor! Throwing bland hummus on top of a mutilated pile of grilled onions, a tiny bit of sad chicken and 7 chick peas does not make a Mediterranean dish! It more importantly does not make a good dish! Honestly, try harder or go away...
