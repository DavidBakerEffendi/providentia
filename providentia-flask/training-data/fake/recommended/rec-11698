Went here for Thanksgiving and kinda regretted it. Last year we went to Back Forty for Thanksgiving and that was much, much better -- more homey, more roomy, bigger portions and overall a better experience for the price. I have only been here for Thanksgiving so perhaps I should save this review for when I've had a non-holiday meal here, but I was overall underwhelmed. I guess if you want cloth napkins, water glasses that don't seem like they're supposed to hold votive candles (cheap, thin glass), you should go to Back Forty. The portions were small, which would otherwise be fine, but I was expecting more pomp and circumstance for a Thanksgiving platter. Overall disappointing; the food was good, but the presentation and attention to detail felt sub-par. Perhaps I'll amend this review or follow up with a more substantive evaluation once I've experienced the menu on a normal night out. Oh, and I have no affiliation whatsoever to their competitor around the block, it's just the closest approximation to a farm-to-table restaurant that I can make an adequate comparison.
