Tiny little restaurant that you can easily miss.  They really should consider a bigger sign board anyway that being said this little hole in the wall is a MUST TRY for anyone who fancies SPICY this place truly gets spice!  When I order something spicy, I really want it spicy.  But what's even better is that they also get that the food needs flavor along with the heat.  I find all of the dishes that I have had here to have very complex flavors and perfectly bold with what you expect from a good Chinese restaurant. It's decently priced and the meat (I usually get beef or lamb dishes) is very tender.  Service is great!  By far, my favorite Chinese joint in the NJ.  They don't try to Americanize their dishes like most places do.  I love it.  Be bold and ask for their dishes spicy if you can handle it. ;-)
