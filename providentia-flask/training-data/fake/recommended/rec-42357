I'll get right to the point on why this place rates 5 stars: The guys who work there know their stuff and are more than happy to talk to you about it. Enthusiastically even. They don't flaunt their knowledge like a cocky wine snob or try and upsell you to something you don't necessarily need. In fact they take the time to find out what you like and make really informed suggestions. I've gone from drinking single malts almost exclusively to enjoying Bourbons and Ryes in equal measure. (and it's a large measure thanks to this place) It doesn't hurt that they use those Riedel-like stemless glasses that really let you get your nose in there and smell all the subtle nuances of each drink. That said it's a popular place right now, going there on a Friday night and expecting the sort of treatment I just described would be mad. Pick an off evening or an off hour (Sunday is great) and go with the intention of enjoying a few 1oz pours. I know I do.
