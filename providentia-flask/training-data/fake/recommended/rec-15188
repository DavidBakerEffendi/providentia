The service is absolutely the worst, the lady took our order was extremely rude and did not take our orders and kept us waiting and did not bother to tell us what kind of cheese we want and said we can read from the board... Â almost walked out of the door, but based on the reviews we stayed. The sandwich was so so and there are a plenty of places have better choices.
