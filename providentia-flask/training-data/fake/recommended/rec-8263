Ordered the Vietnamese Noodle Soup with Shrimp (aka "pho") and absolutely loved it! It is a brothy soup with noodles and shrimp topped with bean sprouts and some fresh herbs (I think I remember there being basil and/or cilantro). It is served in a deep soup bowl and you will be stuffed after consuming it! I recommend asking for some of their chili sauce to spice it up if you like it spicy. The restaurant is fairly small, seating maybe 20 people, and the one waiter is kept quite busy running around to all the tables, so it can be hard to get your water refilled, but otherwise it's a delicious place. I definitely recommend and will definitely be returning for the soup at a very cheap price for the area.
