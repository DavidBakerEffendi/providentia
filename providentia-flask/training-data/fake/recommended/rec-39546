Went back last week and my review pretty much stands. Food is outstanding but noise level is still too high to enjoy any kind of conversation. The waitress assigned to our table didn't appear to want to take care of us as she was busy chatting but another waitress was nice enough to take care us without us having to complain. I was also quite pleased that the tres leches cake was as delicious as I remembered!
