A restaurant worthy of being yelped!  Party of six, 7PM, Sunday Mother's day.  Mind you that I've arrived to the restaurant on a full stomach, when I celebrated mothers day earlier with the family. Super nice and cool owner who really understands the term "hospitality."  The staff were nice, patient and helpful with everything.   Rice balls were amazing, the maki's were great.  But for the sushi eater, please try the seared toro with garlic chip on top.   We'll be definetly back, the food is amazing.
