4 1/2 stars.  I didn't want to like Barboncino, I really didn't.  But I love it.  I've tried every pizza and personally, I much prefer the pizzas with sauce.  I know it sounds boring, but the margarita pizza is the best thing on the menu.  Simple and sooooo good.  They also have a really nice and inexpensive montepulciano/sangiovese blend that I love.  Barboncino also has a lovely ambiance, great service, great bartenders and has made laundry day that much more enjoyable!
