I used to like this place....and I want to STILL like it.....but I can't pretend it is still good.  It has gone downhill - or maybe other places in the area have gone uphill.  Either way, the sandwiches and sides are average at best - definitely not quality deli sandwiches.  The meat is pre-sliced and put into portions in the morning so if you get there after 12 or 1 the meat looks dry etc.   Not sure why this is done.  Every other deli except Subway or Blimpie slices to order. Then today I figured I'd try a bagel (haven't been there in a while).  The bagel was terrible.  It tasted like a mass produce/pre frozen bagel (i.e. bread shaped into a bagel shape).  With the amount of good bagel places around, why would you sell this? That's not gonna fly in Jersey....if you are a Jersey deli you need legit bagels. Overall it just feels like less and less care is going into the upkeep.  This review is not meant to be hurtful - but just honest.  Alan's has been a staple for a long time.  But the truth is, there are a lot of really great sandwich places in downtown now and this type of quality just isn't going to cut the mustard (pun intended). I'd recommend Belgiovines (awesome), HLS, Beyond Pita or even Royal Bagel as alternatives. I'm going to try again in a few months in the hopes that the owners start turning it around.
