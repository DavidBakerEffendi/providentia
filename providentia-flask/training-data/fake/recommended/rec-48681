Another success by tom coliccio .  great concept of a restaurant on the east river with outdoor seating with water view and hear lamps for cold weather nights.  They have their own garden where fresh vegetables are grown and you could see it just before the restaurant.  Very attentive wait staff water glass always fill.  Seasonal menu always changing promising fresh ingredients.  We started with the burratta mozzarella which was served with a light lemon olive oil and small sweet tomatoes and country toasted bread. Entrees were the pork chop and the steak two ways. The pork chop was quite large and served with smoked pork belly over it and sauteed greens.  Very well prepared and full of flavor.  There were grilled peaches over the pork as well which were a touch too smoky for me.  The steaks were a waygu beef brisket and a flatiron steak. Served over sweet roasted beans .  they had about 5 or six pastas that could be appetizer or entrees which was nice.  Very nice drink selection including specialty cocktails, craft beers and a huge wine selection. For dessert we had the panna cotta which was a small portion but was delicious and the flavors complemented each other perfectly.  We also had the 3 sorbets fig pear and lime yogurt.  These were all housemadr from fresh ingredients and perfect for a light dessert.
