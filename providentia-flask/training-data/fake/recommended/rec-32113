This is a place to be! They are quiet during the week, so if you just want to chill out and watch some TV, then this is the place to do it, with good pub food, good beer, and friendly service. But if you enjoy life a little louder, I'd try a Saturday night- a great atmosphere and fun people. And did I mention good bartenders? They make the carbombs right, and don't charge too much for them. The location is less than ideal, given that the only thing close is the train station, which is Â especially irritating if you're driving in, but don't let that stop you!
