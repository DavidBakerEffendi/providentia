Service was absolutely terrible.  Every single rule of restaurant etiquette was broken, including but not limited to forgetting to take one person's order, bringing out entrees while appetizers were still on the table, not bringing silverware with which to eat the entrees until after they were served... I could go on and on.  I was left speechless by how poor the service was.
