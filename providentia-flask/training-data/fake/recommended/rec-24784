We decided to try Fare while dining across the street at Hickory.  We were seated immediately but waited a long time for our server to pay any attention to us. We were seated by a group with lots of small children and the children were all over the place.  That was a mood blower! None the less we moved to the bar after the children kept running around, being disruptive and they even stopped at our table a few times. An adult in the party apologized but it continued to happen :\ The hostess mentioned to the bartender that we'd been there for a  long time and hadn't been served; she also told our server that he'd kept us waiting for a long time.  The atmosphere at the bar was much better, the bartender was attentive and she made really good drinks (I like when bartenders sample their creations before serving them) We started with the baked banana which was very good, i then had the apple ricotta pancakes, also good.  My honey had the meat omelet of the day, it was chorizo, caramelized onions and a few other things but very tasty. Given the large number of great restaurants in Philly, I'm not sure if Ill make it back to Fare.  My experience was simply 'ok'
