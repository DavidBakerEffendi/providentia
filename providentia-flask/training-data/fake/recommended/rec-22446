Great German beer bar with a great happy hour!  The beer can be purchased in liters or half liters depending on how thirsty you are, and all the beer on tap is German.  This is a perfect bar for people watching on Market St on a warm and sunny afternoon (they have outdoor seating out front).   I have been here three times, twice on a weekend night and once after work on a weekday for happy hour and dinner.  It has been great each time.  Friendly service, delicious and well-priced beer, and great atmosphere at any time of day!
