Excellent pizza in an adorable hipster atmosphere! Boyfriend and I ordered one sausage pizza and one proscuitto/honey/arugula pizza. It came quickly but you could tell it was fresh out of the oven. Edges were perfectly crisp. The quality of the crust and the flavor was unbelievable! The sausage was deliciously savory whereas the proscuitto pizza had a sweet taste that complemented the rest of the toppings perfectly. I would definitely come back. Plus it's byob, which I wish we knew about before we chose this place on a whim'!
