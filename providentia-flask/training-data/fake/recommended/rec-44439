The bald head cashier is rude and inappropriate!! i had never been to this establishment before but it was recommended to me by a good friend. I walked up and ordered my food then took a seat nearby. About 30 seconds later (as im textin) the cashier yells "thats your total!" My eyes which were focused on my phone screen went immediately to him and I sat there surprised for a minute until i scanned the area for the register that read $15.79 so i replied "excuse me" and he goes "what? thats too much".... ill never buy anything else from here EVER
