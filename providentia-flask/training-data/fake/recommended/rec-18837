1. Meat. 2. Meat. 3. ... MEAT Consumed: Penn's Special Sandwich Corned Beef Sandwich Oh dear, have you ever experienced a meat coma? WELL, you might get one from Koch's. There's more meat than bread and I can see to a guy or any meat lover, this is THE place to go. The sandwiches are just so meaty and flavorful. The meat is very thinly sliced and so I like that it's not too chewy and your jaw wouldn't hurt from chewing. Does that ever happen to you? Maybe it's just a Connie problem.. Anyway, I really liked the Penn's special and the corned beef sandwiches. I would say the Penn's special is saltier and has a little more meat than the corned beef. Whatever white sauce they put in is also very good and enhances the savory experience of the meat. While the sandwiches are a bit on the pricier end ($10-14), they are very very big and filling. I could barely finish half of it... I don't think I've used the word meat enough in this review. Meat.
