If I could just order a giant tray (TRAY, not pie, I'm from Scranton) of the Farmhouse Flatbread pizza, I would.  Buttery with apples, bacon, and cheddar, it's to-die-for.  Really, that's the only reason it has 4 stars.  Without the pizza, it would be 3. Meal was still decent, though.  Arugula salad with goat cheese and candied pecans and vinaigrette was great, cocktails are always made fresh (cucumber, gin, cracked pepper drink reminded me of summer).  I can't remember what  my boyfriend got, I think some type of steak and asparagus dish and it was cooked perfect, just kind of lacked in seasoning.  I got an open faced bison burger with a yogurt sauce drizzled over it.  It came with roasted potatoes in a tomato sauce and green beans.  Very homey and stick-to-your-ribs kind of dish, though it didn't all seem to go together in taste for me. The bison was awesome and if I could have had just the meat and yogurt sauce with a different type of vegetable and no potatoes on the side, that would have been just fine. Even though I couldn't move after the baseball-sized bison meatball, I still ordered a delicious mixed fruit crumble for dessert, perfect for the season. Overall, I get the whole yuppie "locally grown, organic, free range" hype and the food was all very solid, but I'm not entirely sure it's worth the price.
