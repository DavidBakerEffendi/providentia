This was my second time here. Amusingly, I sat in the same exact seat as I did last time! Different dates...but the new one was none the wiser! I had the oxtail and bone marrow marmalade (once again). Fantastic. It tasted just as amazing as it did the first time. I can taste it all now.. on that FANTASTIC bread... Last time I had the duck, which was quite good. I chose to have the hanger steak this time. Very good, but on the whole fairly standard "steak" fare, which I guess means they accomplished their mission. A steak shouldn't be anything too special, anyway. It's not listed on their wine list anymore, but if you can grab it - try the Nebbiolo. A great wine that I discovered on my first trip there.
