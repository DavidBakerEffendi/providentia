There is so much attention paid to every dish. This is a must go to for BYOB dinner.  The staff is very friendly and stomach starts rumbling just looking through the menu.  You won't be disappointed with anything you order!  I've tried multiple dishes here and have been impressed each time.  This place has become a regular for me to bring people who come into town for visits
