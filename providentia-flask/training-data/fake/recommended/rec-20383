This is my go to place when I have friends that are visiting my hood. The interior is decent for Queens, although not as cute as places in Brooklyn, but I will give them an A for effort. The food here is great. I've tried many dishes, and I have never had a bad experience yet. I love their beet salad! The bacon popcorn that they give you to start with is my guilty pleasure. They have one of the best ice creams I have ever eaten. Thai milk tea ice cream?? YUM! The service is always great, and I will continue to come here.
