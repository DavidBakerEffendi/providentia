Fantastic authentic Burmese cuisine! I lived in Yangon for a few months and it's near impossible to find authentic Asian food in the Philadelphia area. I can't wait to go back. I'd suggest exploring the menu. It may look repetitive, but everything has a great flavor. I shared four or five dishes with my table and loved everything.
