Ssam Bar...disappointing.  Oysters-yuck, worst ever.  Pork buns-good; 4 out of five stars for them.  Everything else: ox tail, pickled things, crunchy spicy whatever was too salty with overpowering flavor, and we had like 3 or 4 other dishes that weren't memorable or that good so...2.5 starts for Ssam Bar.
