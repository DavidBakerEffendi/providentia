Stumbled upon this gem after a lovely afternoon in Central Park on our way to gawk at the Barney's SNL Christmas window display.  My gal pal was hungry and I figured I'd have a cup of coffee while I watched her eat.  The place was tiny with a line out the door and everyone that walked in greeted the staff behind the counter...this looked like a winner.  We grab a table right by the door and I gasp when I see that a capuccino is $4.50.  (I quickly realized that this is the norm - sorry, I'm a cheapo) Anyway, my coffee arrives and it smells divine and I stir and stir and stir and the creamy foam does not dissipate...I take a sip and HEAVEN!  I seriously still think about it and am willing to pay a whopping $5 for it.  My friends sandwich was basic but tasty and the best part?  The BEAUTIFUL people that walk in and out, namely gorgeous Italian men.   I wish I had a place like this in my neighborhood!
