The pizza wasn't bad (did not taste like brick oven) and the service could have been better (if she wouldn't yell when in the kitchen). There were also a ton of fruit flies around the restaraunt so it was hard to enjoy our meal. I don't think I will go back any time soon but I've also experienced worse. :-/
