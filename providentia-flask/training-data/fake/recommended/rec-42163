I had a terrific dinner at a.kitchen last night.  A really great, unusual Slovenian wine was perfect with the blue crab salad with pesto couscous.  The strip steak was perfectly cooked.  Trendoid fools can have the lame Serafina across the street - that makes it easy to get a table at the far superior a.kitchen!  It's not the cheapest table in town, but it's a worthy indulgence.  I'd go more often if it were a smidge more affordable.
