Went with group of 9 people.  Food was very good as usual, however, the service was fair at best.  Waitress appeared completely frustrated and let us know it.  One meal was forgotten, but taken off the check.  Not sure if I would consider going with a larger group again on a Sat nite.  Appears too much for them to handle.
