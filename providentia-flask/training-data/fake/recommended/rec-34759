cute japanese cafe in midtown east, they have packaged japanese fare and my favorite onigiri varieties. I'm here for lunch on most days. A spicy tuna on onigiri and a vegetable juice is about $4, a steal of a deal and a healthy alternative to the more economical street vendor foods or micky d's. Â They also sell warm soups and ramen and udon and it's authentic! Check it out :)
