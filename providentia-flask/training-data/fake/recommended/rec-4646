I suggested Izumi to my friend to see if we could disprove her theory that there isn't very good sushi in Center City.  It was very easy to get to via SEPTA and she had no problem finding street parking near the restaurant (the one-way streets can be a little frustrating so bring a GPS if you have one!).   We came on a Thursday night at around 7 and found the place busy, but not full.  There was no wait and we had our choice of being seated inside or out.  Overall, we both really enjoyed everything we ordered and our server was friendly.  My only complaint was that there were so many "specials" that night that it was pretty hard to keep track as our server rattled that off.  Perhaps the good folks who run the restaurant might consider printing out the specials so patrons don't have to rely on their leaky memories.  We definitely look forward to returning and trying some of the entrees next time.
