I went here for restaurant week (lunch) and enjoyed everything I had. I started with the shrimp which was a nice size appetizer. The chicken sandwich was huge which was unexpected because I thought it would be a fru fru sandwich but twas not. Then I had the delicious chocolate cake, superb. I shared the omelet which, glad I shared and didn't get the whole thing because I've had better. The plating was impressive and added that extra twist that I expect from places that don't have peanut shells on the floor. The staff was friendly and quick when it came to the awkward water spill situation (not me). They did a fantastic job with the menu choices and I would go here again. I plan to try it out for dinner because it looks like it could be a nice place to dine with the lights low. Only hiccup is the dude with the tie that also clears the table, smile sir, it won't hurt your cheeks and it makes the ladies feel special!!
