1 star for beer selection 1 star for atmosphere like the Dogwood Cafe I loved in JP -1 = Pumpkin creme brulee tasting like the filling of the cheap lemon cookies you buy at the dollar store. -1 = Dishes i could have whipped up if I had perused the frozen section at Trader Joes, popped those bad boys in the microwave and served them to guests. Edamame with salt. Garlic and chile wings - it was basically sweet and sour chicken from any Chinese food place. - 1 = Two adults not being able to find an entree they would want to try. We both have grown out of the picky-food stage. So we went with an arsenal of apps. Sigh. It's so close to our place too.
