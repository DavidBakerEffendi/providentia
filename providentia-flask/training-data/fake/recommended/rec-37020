Best place to get sandwiches and salads in New York. I have had sandwiches from many shops throughout the city and the rest of the five boroughs, none of which stood out to me like Chopping Block does. They use fresh ingredients, and the sandwiches are made fresh after you place your order. The recipes are one of a kind. I have tried nearly every sandwich put on the menu, and all of which tasted great. What makes Chopping Block NYC even better now is that they have a full coffee program with great beans and great baristas! Now my favorite place to grab food is also my favorite place to grab a latte or a cappucino. Anyway, if you're reading this review and you need a recommendation on what to order, I highly recommend the PBLT or the Brisket Rubenesque. For coffee, I love the lattes and the cappucinos.
