Prime 16 is a very lively New Haven hotspot. The small and bustling dining room and bar is fills quickly with happy customers. A huge beer menu and a slew of burgers to choose from makes repeat visits a sure thing Â The lamb burger was out of this world. Even with the crowds, our table of nine was served promptly and efficiently. Our waiter was not particularly friendly but he never missed a beat and did a good job.
