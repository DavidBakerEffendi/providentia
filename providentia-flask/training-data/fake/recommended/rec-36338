Every time i come here there's always a long line about a 15 minute wait, but its worth every minute. I'm used to paying 5 dollars for chicken over rice but that extra dollar goes a long stomach filling way. If you love hot sauce, they have the hottest ever. Everyone warns you not to put too much, but i didn't listen. It may not be a nice restaurant with seats, but great halal stand If they were to open a restaurant, business would soar through the roof
