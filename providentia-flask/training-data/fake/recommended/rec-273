Came here this past weekend for a friends birthday, awesome food, weak but yummy sangria, and a pretty rude waiter. First off, the food. We got so much I'm not even sure of everything we had. Stand outs include the coconut crepes, the skirt steak, and the meatballs. You can just order as you go so be careful, it does start to add up! One of the Â things they pride themselves on is their sangria selection, we ended up getting the pomegranate blueberry champagne sangria, the mango sangria, and the red sangria, all of which were delicious but the red was the only one with any kind of kick to it. I don't know about you but when I drink through 6 glasses of sangria I expect to feel some kind of buzz after. Lastly our waiter was super "pleasant rude." He wasn't outright rude but he did have a bit of an attitude with us and tended to be super disapproving when we didn't take his recommendations. Not a big deal but a bit annoying. Go for the food and go for the flamenco, they have live dancing on weekends!
