Came for a date night on a Friday a few weeks back, as well as for happy hour over the summer. Happy hour specials were great, cheap drinks, apps and $1 oysters when you sit at or near the bar. The happy hour calamari was amazingly delicious and a bit spicy, oysters were fresh. Came back for dinner a bit late for our reservation but they were still able to accommodate us. I checked in on yelp for the free spin of the wheel and won a free bottled beer, other options I could've won included some food but overall not too shabby! I ordered the seafood udon and was very happy. Waitstaff was excellent and the ambiance/decor was perfect for a romantic night out. Will definitely be back!
