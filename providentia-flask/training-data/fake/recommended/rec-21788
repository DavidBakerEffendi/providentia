We live right around the corner from Juventino so we were looking forward to having such a cute place so close by. We have enjoyed our food well enough but we recently tried to go and were appalled by their lack of customer service. They seem to have a new policy that no strollers are allowed. I can understand if this was midtown Manhattan but Juventino is smack in the middle of baby central and as a result is eliminating a lot of potential customers.Obviously the management doesn't mind much but we felt like this was a mild form of discrimination. If they want us to leave strollers outside, they should provide a place for their customers to leave them safely. I dare say we live in a city where anything not locked up is fair game for anyone to take.
