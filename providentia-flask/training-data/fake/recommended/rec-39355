This dark, wooden bar is a great place to hear the local bands of New Haven, where Joy Division still wields considerable influence. The mixed crowd of townies, old men, hipsters, and students makes this one of my favorite places to get a quick beer or shoot whiskey. Be prepared to meet people here, because you will. Don't miss the Belgian frites.
