A great surprise in the heart of Astoria, literally right off the Broadway stop. Came here for Friday breakfast/brunch and it was busy, but not packed. The service was great and the atmosphere was friendly, great for just hanging out. The french toast was awesome. Their coffee could use a bit of work, but the food is the main draw here. Very festive decor for the holiday season as well. Sort of an upscale diner vibe, and I can't wait to try their famous late-night eats as well.
