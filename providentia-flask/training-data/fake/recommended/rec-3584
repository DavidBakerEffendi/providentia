Went back again last night (this was actually my third time - went for the second time back in December and everything was just as amazing).  Food and service was as great as I the first and second time.  Last night I ordered the filet mignon and absolutely loved it.  Service was great and food fantastic.  I told my mother about it and she made me promise to take her in two weeks.  We are really looking forward to it. Thanks you guys at La Sirene.  You run a really nice establishment there.
