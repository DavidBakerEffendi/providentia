Delicious food, huge portions, cheap prices! All the guys are pretty friendly and super fast with your order- I swear it's ready in 3 mins! I'd give it 5 stars if they opened a restaurant or a little fast food take out spot in each borough, instead of me waiting on line for an hour every time I crave chicken and rice.
