For the past couple of years this was my go to spot for ramen in the city. But unfortunately I for one can't stand bad service and that's why I gave them 3 stars. I would say 2.5 is really where I would put them but we can't give half stars and 2 seemed a bit harsh. But as far as their menu, the signature ramen is pretty good. Broth isn't too watered down and is pretty flavorful. A good portion of pork belly and other amenities that are included. More than other ramen joints in the city. But unfortunately their service needs a new direction. One of the waitresses always seem to have an attitude but tries to smile it off. Sad because I believe she is the head waitress there. She'll notice that you need something and will totally pretend like she didn't see us. This happened many times. Which is why we stopped going there.
