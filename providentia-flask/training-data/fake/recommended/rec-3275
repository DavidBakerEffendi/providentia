So after much talk and hype about this establishment, my friends and I decided to give it  try during Restaurant Week! Let's just say NEVER AGAIN!! Our server was Kevin and he was the absolute worst.He seemed annoyed with our table from the very beginning. He was extremely rude and obnoxious. For  starters he got our drink order wrong and when we told him about it his response was "well I don't make the drinks". Next it took him another 20 minutes for Kevin to take our order. While my friend was eating her caesar salad, she stops and pulls a staple out of her mouth!!! We informed our server, he was just so nonchalant about it he went and got the manager. The manager came over and was very apologetic and was concern for her well being. He also offered to replaced the salad, which she declined.  The main course came out which was the teriyaki salmon and my guests had filet Mignon. The food was bland,tasteless.Not once did he come to check on us to ask was everything ok, but the manager did. He avoided our table like the plague, ok. The next time we did see our dear server he decided to bring our dessert over which we declined. He got an attitude with us. Like seriously dude!!!, if you would have came over to our table you would have know we wanted our dessert to go. Later he brought out a huge slice of chocalate cake and a scoop of ice icream as a courtesy for the mishap earlier on behalf of the manager. I have never been so happy to have the check come while out dining. The best part about Ocean Prime was leaving! I will be avoiding this place just like Kevin avoided us!
