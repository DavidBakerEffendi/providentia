All I can say is the blueberry pancakes are aaaaahhhhmazzzing! My boyfriend had the eggs benedict and left not feeling so well. The food and the service is great but the line is annoying because it's like are you so desperate for food that you line up a hour or more in advance before it opens. Â While crossing Houston this guy who is also going to the same place decided to run to get in line before us...seriously! My boyfriend lives two blocks away and while I knew there was going to be a line I was just annoyed because at least we were in walking distance and I just feel the line takes away from people that live in the neighborhood. I just know I would never wake up early get all dressed up to wait in line to eat somewhere uptown just to say I was one of the first in line to be seated when it opens up. Enough of my rant back to the food and actual restaurant.... they should take reservation... I felt the food was great and the hot chocolate and coffee was as well..my tummy felt happy. We returned a week later for dinner which was a big upset...I had the crab cakes and my boyfriend had the chicken and waffles neither of us finished our food my crab cakes was too fishy for my liking.. on a brighter note we didn't have to wait in line but i left still hungry and wanting something else to eat. I have been back one more time for breakfast which I concluded would be the last time I would return unless I have a serious craving for the blueberry pancakes.
