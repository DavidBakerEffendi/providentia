We still haven't eaten here yet but I give 3 stars because the owner reached out to us and apologized for the terrible experience we had at his restaurant. He even offered us a free meal but we didn't get a chance to return. Having gotten a sense of how serious and professional the owner is about his restaurant, I will definitely give Cafe Steinhof another chance in future.
