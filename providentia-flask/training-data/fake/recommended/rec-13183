another place where my expectations were set too high. yes it was good. Yes it was alot for the money. yes the red sauce is freakin spicy. Yes the white sauce makes this dish. For $6 this dish is worth a meal, but not worth all the hype. The rice was good, chicken was tasty, pita nice and fluffy, and the sauce really makes the plate creamy and delicious. Im glad that i went midweek during a slight drizzle, therefore there was no line. Had i waited in a really long line for this i would have been incredibly disappointed.
