I looked at Yelp.com while I was walking in the city for a place where my friend and I could have lunch. This place was great! They had a lunch menu with entrees that were close to have of the dinner cost. The place was full and the food was amazing! We enjoyed the white sangria too- but whewie- it was strong! But really good! I has the Ropa Viejio- YUMMMMYYYY! Loved the environment too- nice feel- crisp- clean and the employees are very friendly! I can't wait to go back!
