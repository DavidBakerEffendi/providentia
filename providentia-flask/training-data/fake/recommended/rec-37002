I really like Cafeteria. Great food, fun environment and fabuloso cocktails (white peach margarita = yum yum!!!) is what I am guessing made this place worthy of a feature on SATC. Went here on a rainy day for lunch so I was bummed that the roll-up window doors were down, but whatever, it was still great. Fashionably chic white interior- this ain't your schooldays cafeteria! And great eye candy servers - although .... what is with the mustache comeback some of them are trying to sport???? Stay the hottie models you are please.
