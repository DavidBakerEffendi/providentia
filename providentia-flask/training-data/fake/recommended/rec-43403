I often stopped here before doing groceries at the nearby Shop-Rite to cut back on my impulse food purchases. I enjoyed supporting an independent business. The food wasn't great, neither was the service, but the place felt very genuine, the prices were right and the portions were good. Well, I had my last experience there tonight. I have to admit, I was always a little wary about how the meat was cooked, though that wasn't what did it. When I ordered the meatloaf special, I found a few crunchy bits in one mouthful. Shards of glass. They took it back and gave me another meal, and took $5 off my meal. Well, that's a nice gesture, but little shards of glass in your food is pretty serious, easily missed, and easily could send you to hospital. They didn't assure me they were going to figure out how it happened. I just don't see how I can trust this place again.
