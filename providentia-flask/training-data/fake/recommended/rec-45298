Went for brunch here. Out $15 plus tax and tip (cool $20) for coffee and a piece of toast with one poached egg, asparagus, and bacon on top. It tasted decent, but I think I've had appetizers with more food than that. Decor & atmosphere is nice and peaceful. I would go here for just coffee if the owners were cool with it, but brunch really isn't worth it. For $20, I'll go elsewhere.
