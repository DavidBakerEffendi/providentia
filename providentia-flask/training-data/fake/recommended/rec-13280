Every girl's dream come true...Parisian macarons in New York! Laduree is an adorable French macaron shop located in NYC's upper East side. I've had many macarons in my lifetime and I must admit Laduree's macarons are probably the best I've ever had. I fell in love with the Pistachio and Marie-Antoinette macarons. Both were extremely delicious and melted in my mouth. The macarons are a bit pricey, however, we must remember that quality cost money. I'm crossing my fingers that Laduree will someday make its way to San Francisco. Fun Fact: The macarons are flown in from Paris every week.
