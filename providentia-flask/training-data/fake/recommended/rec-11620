Had a great experience here! Excellent service and great food! Three of us ordered the following to share: -Spicy duck meatballs -Calamari and watercress salad -Cerviche -Duck Breast -Hangar Steak -Lavender and cherry donuts -Chocolate cake This was definitely more than enough food for 3 people. We were all pretty stuffed by the end and we shared everything. We also got chocolate and salted caramel brownie bites at the end of the meal with our cheque and couldn't even stomach any additional food, so we (very sadly) had to abandon them. I was a little underwhelmed by the duck meatballs after reading rave reviews on yelp. They were still good but didn't blow my mind. However, the duck breast definitely exceeded my expectations and was really good. If you're not a fan of eating crispy fatty goodness, you probably should not order this dish. The steak also exceeded my expectations and was cooked perfectly medium. Very yummy. Highlights for me were the calamari and watercress salad (which was completely deep fried, even the watercress) and the cherry/lavender donuts. Donuts were sooooooooooooo goooooooooood! The restaurant is good for parties of 4-5 or less. It is fairly small (as most W village restaurants are) but does not feel cramped (as most W village restaurants do). Service was very efficient and the host, server and waiters were all very polite and helpful. We did not feel rushed even though the space was very busy and it was a very pleasant dinner.
