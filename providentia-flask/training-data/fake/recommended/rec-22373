Not the best pizza, given that it's in New Haven and it's competing with all the deliciousness that's Wooster Street. But not terrible. For terrible pizza, come to San Francisco. Really. Then you appreciate places like Yorkside. It's not terrible, just not the best. Good salads though, and sandwiches. Another one of my favorite lunch places when I worked at Yale.
