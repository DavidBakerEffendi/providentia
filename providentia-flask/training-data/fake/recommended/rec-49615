So I'm a hardcore meat-eater, and was therefore rather skeptical of this place. But my friend swore by it and so one day I went with him. I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. The sushi looks better than most modern day art, I mean really I felt bad eating it because it was just so pleasing to look at. As for the taste, I've had the spicy mang and the green machine roll; I loved spicy mang! The toasted cayenne sauce is so unbelievable and contributes to the awesome concoction. The green machine was pretty darn tasty as well. My main thing was that maybe its too greeny tasting? I should also mention that this is the first time in my life that I did not use soy sauce on my sushi. This was a small revelation; is soy sauce like the hot sauce of chinese food? Have I been using it all these years to make up for the fact that all sushi I've ever tried tasted exactly the same? As I pondered that, I slowly chewed and enjoyed every second of this unbelievable sushi, and was just so happy. I even felt good after the meal! Also, the venue, though incredibly small, was really thought out and was just very esthetically pleasing. Overall, an experience I will probably repeat tomorrow!
