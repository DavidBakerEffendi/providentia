I love coming to El Camino on a Friday after a stressful week.  As a vegetarian, it is so exciting when I can actually have vegan buffalo wings!  Their sangrias are to DIE for.  Our official work happy hours three-five times a year there are great as well.  The only annoying thing is that on the last happy hour, we were kind of boxed out before we were ready to leave!  Otherwise, great service and great food!
