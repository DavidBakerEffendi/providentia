While I take great pride in showing out of town friends around the city, I would feel very comfortable leaving them in Scott's hands.  I know that they would be entertained, they would learn things even I couldn't tell them, and they would be well fed. This native New Yorker learned a thing or two about pizza, and I got to see some things I never would have known to look for.  Locals and tourists alike will enjoy this tour. Plus, it's pizza.  What's not to like?
