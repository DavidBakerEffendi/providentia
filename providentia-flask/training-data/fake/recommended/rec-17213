I've visited New York City many times and have never bought food from a cart. After hearing how amazing the chicken and rice was from my cousin, we stopped here as part of our food trip. The chicken and rice with the white sauce was so delicious! The portions are huge for $6, and we split the platter among 4 of us. The Halal guys are super nice and we waited in line for only about 10 minutes (granted, it was a Tuesday night at about 10pm). There are about 4 carts that say they are the 'original' Halal guys on the same block, so I'm not sure which one is the real one, but I was quite satisfied!
