Absolutely incredibly delicious comfort food. The biscuits were the best biscuits I have ever had - you MUST order these biscuits. The meatloaf sandwich with spicy potato chips is so incredibly tasty. The sandwich has mashed potatoes, lettuce for crush, and a shmear of spicy mayo to keep it moist. It's a huge portion, but I am happy I have leftovers for lunch today! The Dr. Pepper grapefruit cocktail is also really good. I appreciate the interesting flavor profile/match up. Service was good and quick. It was only about 2/3 full on a Sunday night.
