The cold soba (tempura soba) was very refreshing for this hot summer night. The noodles were firm and tasty. The hot duck soba was good but less interesting. I am ambivalent about its broth: I found it somewhat tasteless at the beginning, but it got tastier. The lotus roots with pickled plums were very... plumsy. You could feel the lotus somewhat. A very nice place overall. Reasonable price too.
