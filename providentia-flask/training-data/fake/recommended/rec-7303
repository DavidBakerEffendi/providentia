I think it's safe to assume that if a business has 900+ Yelp reviews, it's worth checking out. So before I attended a fashion show in Times Square last weekend, my boyfriend and I stopped by Empanada Mama at around 5pm. The space itself is very narrow and cramped. A medium pitcher of their white sangria is very strong and sweet - enough for 8 glasses, and costs you about $30-$35. A fantastic deal, in my opinion. As for their food, both of us were impressed by the huge variety available on the menu for such a small restaurant. The plaintain and guacamole appetizer is light and fresh! I highly recommend. As for the empanadas, I prefer the wheat flour to the corn flour ones. From the 10 we ordered, my favorites were the Viagra and Raggaeton - the avocado dip that comes with them is to die for! Service was quick, and I see why people rave about it. And to think this place is open 24/7?! I'm definitely coming back. :]
