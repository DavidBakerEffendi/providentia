The people who worked there were really nice and I feel bad writing a mediocre review, but I also want to give the readers my honest opinion, so here it goes! We ordered the mean green and meatball sandwich.  The mushrooms in the mean green were undercooked (hard and crunchy), and there was nothing that held the sandwich together.  Although I liked the cheese in the meatball sandwich, it just doesn't seem very Vietnamese.  It was almost like a meatball hoagie with pickled veggies on top.   If you want a sandwich, this place is good.  If you want a Banh mi, I would recommend going to Nicky's or Banh mi Zon for something more traditional.   They also have tacos which we didn't order, but I would go back to try those.
