Don't go here for Philly Cheesesteaks. My friend had been hyping up this place for a week so I was expecting it to be amazing, but it wasn't worth its price and didn't even feel like an authentic Philly experience. It was dead on a Saturday for lunch, another sign that the place is likely to be bad. The inside was pretty dirty and all the seats were close to trash cans so we opted for a seat outside after getting our food. I ordered a classic cheesesteak with onions and cheese wiz along with fries and a drink for $10.50. The bread was pretty good, but the steak was plain and the cheese was gross. Maybe I should've ordered provolone, but it still doesn't change the fact that the meat was bad. I've had better sandwiches from malls in California! Not worth what you pay. Avoid this place if you want to enjoy your Philly experience.
