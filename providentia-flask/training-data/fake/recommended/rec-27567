We wandered into this place after a night of partying in the LES. They had the best guacamole I've ever tasted; the salsas were fantastic and the service was excellent. We ordered 6 tacos off the appetisers menu (pork and steak). The steak was perfectly prepared and the pork tacos had grilled pineapple. They were off the charts! I can only imagine how good the entrees are!
