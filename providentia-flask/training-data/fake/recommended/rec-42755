Beautiful restaurant, just trendy enough without overdoing it.  Went there for brunch, where they only accept walkins however we lucked out and there was no wait.  Had the $15 DIY mimosa garden.  Watermelon thai basil and black pepper peach were my favourite over the pineapple.  As an egg lover i had to try the Turkish Eggs which are 2 poached eggs with greek yogurt and bermizi biber butter (turkish mild pepper spice).  Sooo unique and boy was it yummy.   Creamy and tangy from the yogurt and butter ( dont worry it wasnt overwhelming) and wonderfully poached gooey unctious egg yolks.   2 thick slices of whole wheat bread to sop up the goodness.  Hearty enough to fuel my morning of soho walking And shopping! And to top it off the Lemington (australian sponge cake filled with strawberry  and cream rolled in chocolate and shredded coconut) is a must try.  Our waitress was australian and said it was the best lemington she's ever had.   Theyre pretty small and i could eaten an entire tray of those.   My friend had their buckwheat pancakes with fruit.  Sounds pretty generic and standard bfast fare however i took a bite and omg it had so much flavour i was impressed.  Left there with my belly full and very satisfied
