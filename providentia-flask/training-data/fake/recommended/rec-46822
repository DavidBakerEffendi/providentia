I've been here twice and have been impressed both times. The only thing that is missing is a crowd. The drinks are creative and an "honest pour." My favorite is the pear martini - refreshing and a hint of spring. For dinner I've had the Strip Steak which was served to perfection. I've had two side dishes and neither disappointed - the beet salad and the shaved brussel sprouts were delicious - plenty to split. There's a lot of talk about the expense - but you get what you pay for - and I'm not disappointed. This is, if you will, a slice of Montclair in Bloomfield and I'm totally fine by that. Good luck - I hope you're here for many years.
