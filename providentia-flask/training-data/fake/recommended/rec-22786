I love this place.  I come in anytime I'm in the area.  The service has always been excellent.   If you are not sure about Korean food menu, you always have the option of going japanese. I really enjoyed the Dduk bok e.  My kimchi jjige was really good.    I recommend anyone to try this place out.  I think you will enjoy it.
