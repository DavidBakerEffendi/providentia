Overhyped for sure. I was so excited to finally try this place and was so disappointed. The OJ was straight from a Tropicana carton. The waitress was a tad rude. My Huevos Rancheros were bizarre and had what seemed to be chili smeared on the tortilla and the potatoes were cold and completely undercooked. Props for the coffee and French Toast but that's about it. Never in a million years would I wait for 2 hours to eat here. Not sure how this place is the talk of the town.
