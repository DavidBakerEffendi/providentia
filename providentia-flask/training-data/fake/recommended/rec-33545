Was hungry. Been here a few times and just had pizza. Even though it is Pi Day... I wanted something more on the healthy side to go. I ordered the Grilled Chicken and Broccoli Rabe over seasoned roasted potatoes . Dinner Came with side salad with Balsamic Dressing and a fresh Roll. Mmmm!  Good choice! This meal was very tasty and well prepared!! Did not disappoint and was much better than expected. It wasn't over cooked at all. In fact, it was absolutely wonderful with the combination of tastes were bursting with flavor! There was enough meat to tame my wild beast! Broccoli and potatoes were perfectly seasoned and prepared. I'm so happy I ate here! My mouth is still dancing even after I ate it!  A must try!  Hands down this is 5 stars without effort! In the immortal words of the ex-Governator of California, "I'LL BE BACK!" Mmmm!  Don't miss this dish!
