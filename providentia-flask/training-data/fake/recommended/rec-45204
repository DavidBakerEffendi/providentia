I've been coming to Panevino for years and it's reliably consistent. I love the iced tea!They have their own special blend and once you order you can have as many refills as you like. I'm a fan of the chopped chicken salad, the pizza and the penne pasta salad. Overall nice place in the area to go for lunch or dinner
