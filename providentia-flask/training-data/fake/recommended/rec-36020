Oui!!!!! I simply adore this place! Amazing food, wine, & service! I came on a Friday evening and I was so shocked at how great the service was since it was quite bustling! They knew right away that my boyfriend was French. Hmmm maybe his accent gave it away *wink* Had the "Olivier" flight for $10. Great red wine flight. Went well with the cheese that my boyfriend chose. We also had the escargot which was perfect and not salty at all. Our main entrees were the trout and ravioli (they are the mini ones from South of France). DELICIOUS. My ravioli was comforting and cheesy. What more could you ask for? Decor is modern, nothing too special but the ambiance is interesting. You can bring a date here or come with friends. It's great! Our bill was about $95 (not including tip) for all of that food and like I mentioned before, AMAZING service. Kudos to our waiter for being awesome. I love it when I hit all three spots- food, drinks, & service. Jackpot! I know I'll be back here. This place is a keeper! Au revoir & bisous!!!
