At there last night. Very small restaurant- maybe 10 tables in a long strip. We had fish ceviche, fried calamari with dipping sauce, roasted chicken, sangria, and Malbec. Very good food. The calamari was cut in thick rings but tender. Roasted chicken was flavorful and fall off the bones. $75.00 for food and we have left over. The only thing I wish is if they could keep the music down a notch. Good salsa dancing music but still a bit loud. Highly recommend if you want good Peruvian food.
