it's summer, which means heavy foods just don't sit well in sticky hot weather. You need something light, yet filling and tasty! Enter La Tarte Flambee! I'm a sucker for great lunch deals, $12.95 for a "flammy" + salad + soda = WIN in my book. With so many chocies of savory and sweet flambees, it made the decision a little difficult but not to worry, at a mere 4 blocks away.. i will be back to continue the exploration! in short, need a light bite at a good price? this is your place!
