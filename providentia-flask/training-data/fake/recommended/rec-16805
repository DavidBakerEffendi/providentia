Definitely agree with others who have recommended the house special vermicelli!  Very tasty!  Also, they give you a pretty huge portion, which I probably shouldn't have eaten all in one sitting, but it was just too good to stop.   The service was also excellent.  My water glass was never less than half full.  All in all, it was a great dining experience.  Relaxing, clean atmosphere, a very attentive staff, and really tasty food.
