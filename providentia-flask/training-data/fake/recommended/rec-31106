This place can be hard to find but well worth the china town trip. I come here when I am sick and need a hot bowl of pho to the face. My favorite is the seafood tom yum soup. Its loaded with jumbo shrimp, mussels, fish patties, and imitation crab. First I load it up with all the fresh herbs and bean sprouts they provide you. I then put two spoons of spicy red sauce. Finally I try to eat it as hot in temperature as I can stand and like magic my sinuses and nasal passages are completely cleared. I have also tried the shrimp roll appetizer, chicken vermicelli with shrimp stick, and the classic beef pho. All of which are excellent. The time from when you place your order until your meal is ready is fast (usually within 10 minutes). The service is ok considering that only two staff members speak broken English. The rest can speak a few words. I always have to ask for extra napkins and this can be a challenge sometimes. They also have a cheap full bar menu if you want to get your drink on. Best of all are the prices and serving sizes. For 6 bucks you can have enough food to feel completely satisfied and have enough to bring home for another meal. What prevents this place from a 5 star review is some cleanliness issues (like the bathroom), the cramped feel, and the fluorescent lighting inside can be unpleasant. Overall definitely give it a try, especially during the winter or if your nasal passages are stuffed.
