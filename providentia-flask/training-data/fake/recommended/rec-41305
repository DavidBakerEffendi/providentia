What a wonderful, cozy place! Was warmly greeted by owner, Erin and scored the coveted banquet. Sunday is Pho day and we were not one bit disappointed. I gotta say, when Grindhaus claimed to have the best pho in NYC, I was a tad nervous being that this is not an Asian restaurant. WHOA! The yummy, rich broth with perfectly cooked noodles with all of the appropriate garnishing was just a delight (go for the crispy chicken thigh!). I savored my pho to the last drop. Erin and company had a great selection of delicious wines and even invented a ice tea on the spot (nice touch). I will definitely be going back to try their dinner service (Open Friday-Monday). Great music selection and well priced. Thank you Gridhaus! (Oh and the B61 bus goes right there if you don't have a car!) YAY!
