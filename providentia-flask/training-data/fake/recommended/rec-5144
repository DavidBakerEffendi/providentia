I have wanted to try this place ever since it opened but there's always a long wait every time I pass by. I finally got to try it last night and it definitely lives up to its hype! There was no wait and I'm guessing it was because we got here pretty early and it was a Tuesday night but it got packed pretty quickly after we finished our meal. Service was attentive and very friendly. I got the truffle burger and shared the sweet potato fries and cheesy tots with my friend. I sort of wish they had more choices for sides and appetizers but the sweet potato fries were pretty bomb and the dipping sauces were delicious. The wasabi ranch and garlic aioli were definitely my favorite. The cheesy tots on the other hand, were somewhat disappointing. It was not that special and considering it's on the "secret menu" I expected more. I would skip that the next time I come here. The star of the night was definitely the truffle burger. The meat was seasoned well and perfect medium rare. I loved the truffle cheese that meshed so well with the flavorful meat and it all came together like perfection. Although the burger may appear small when it is first served, it was more than enough to feel full. I would absolutely come back again and try their duck burger which smelled amazing from the next table.
