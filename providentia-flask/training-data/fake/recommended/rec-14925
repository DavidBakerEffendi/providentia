Went to Khyber Pass Pub last evening with some friends and have to say I was a little disappointed.  After reading so many awesome Yelp reviews we were very excited to try the place out.  Dinner was at 8:00 and we were lucky to get seated right away.  The place was really loud so it was hard to hear what people were saying but we were expecting this since it is a bar atmosphere.  My husband ordered the bacon popcorn and he really enjoyed it but did say it was a little spicy.  He had the burger for an entree and I have to say this was very tasty.  Now on to the problem...I ordered the fried chicken cause I heard it was awesome.  What a disappointment this was.  The pieces were small and were very dried out.  The breading on the chicken reminded me of a shake and bake type of a texture and was one of the worst fried chickens I have ever had.  It's pretty bad when you say that Popeye's chicken was better.  I had the greens as one of my sides which was very very tasty and ordered a Big Ass Biscuit which was blah.  If you are calling something a Big Ass Biscuit it should be really big and not just the size of a Grands Pillsbury Biscuit.  It was very dried out and the butter the offered with it just crumbled the biscuit as you spread it.  My friend who is a Vegan ordered the sausage and she said it was her new favorite for this place.  It's very hard to find restaurants that have so many Vegan options on the menu and this place had a bunch so if your Vegan definitely try this place out.  All in all it wasn't a horrible place and the atmosphere and staff were awesome and friendly.
