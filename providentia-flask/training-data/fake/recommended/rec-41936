We had a wonderful time here on a Tuesday night!  It was perfect for a casual night out, since it is BYOB.  We had the buratta with the brussels sprouts and two pizzas - the traditional Margherita and the Salsiccia, with sausage.  Both were fantastic!   The hostess/waitress could not have been more accommodating, she even brought us a dish of pureed butternut squash (from another type of pizza) for our 8 month old to eat.  We're so happy to find a great pizza place close to where we live!
