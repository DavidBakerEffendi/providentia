Jack the Horse is my favorite restaurant.  JTH is consistently packed with locals for a reason -- the place gets it right.  Tim and staff deliver an upscale product with a mood that feels like Cheers.  The food is unpretentious and dependably great, and the cocktails are just excellent.   Atmosphere is inviting and classy, and service is as friendly and professional as it gets.  I live around the corner, and have been a regular for years.  Some favorites are mac and cheese, smoked trout salad and the buffalo rifle, a strong bourbon drink.
