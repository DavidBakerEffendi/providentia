Re-posting since my review was deleted. My friend and I came here last week; the place was my pick after reading the numerous positive reviews. Our experience was very disappointing. The service was dreadful, everything took a long time and the server forgot one of our appetizers, when we asked for it he tried to cover it by saying he was trying to space things out, but it had been about 20min since we had finished our second appetizer. The entree took just as long. (The table next to us had to ask for their food to go because they couldn't wait any longer) But, I would overlook service if the food was delectable, this was our biggest disappointment, the food was mediocre. We ordered the slow roasted pork and from this place I was expecting a delicate and creative preparation for such a rich dish. There was nothing exceptional about this dish, it was not roasted long enough to burn the fatty parts and it seemed it was just flavored with salt and pepper. Honestly, I've had better roasted pork from the local Caribbean restaurant. We regret picking this place and needless to say we would not go back or recommend it.
