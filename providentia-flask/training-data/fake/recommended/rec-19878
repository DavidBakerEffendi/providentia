I am shocked and amazed! This place is fantastic! It's delicious! pork betty is amazingly good ( dont tell my Jewish grandparents I said so but if pork betty is wrong- I don't want to be right ) not to mention the sushi is great- I wasn't expecting much from Japanese in bushwick and I was pleasantly surprised. I don't want to strongly recommend this place because there already is a wait for a seat and I'm sure my review will send you all running down there but I got to tell you the truth, this place is good.
