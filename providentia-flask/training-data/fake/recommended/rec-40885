I had lunch at Chop Chop today , and to describe the food in one word .. Its simply "amazing ! " If you're a lover of well prepared , flavorful , damn good food , thats the spot ! Not to mention , the staff is great .. I met the owner Malcom , he's clearly passionate about what he does , sweet guy !
