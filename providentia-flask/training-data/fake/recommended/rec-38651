The first time I had a crepe was here and my friend who was with me said it was definitely THE place to get one. It did not disappoint and yes, I do not have something else to compare to it but these crepes are delicious and I keep coming back for more. The guys are very friendly and helpful. The prices are very reasonable considering the crepes are huge and fill you up in the very best way possible. I can't wait to try all the crepes...they have so much variety :)
