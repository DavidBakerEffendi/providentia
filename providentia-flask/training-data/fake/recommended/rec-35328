While in the city, my parents decided they wanted sushi, or well, my dad did. It was his birthday, so we said he could choose.  Also, we needed a quick place to eat since we had tickets to see a show.  It was an interesting experience being that my parents were two of the maybe 5 Caucasians in the restaurant. It was actually quite weird to be part of the majority. I guess I'd take that as a good sign, that people of Japanese or Asian decent had filled this restaurant.  We could only sit at the sushi bar area, that's how packed it was. My parents both got the katsu dinner, nothing was left on either plate. They loved it! My mom even mastered the art of using chopsticks! (Finally!). I of course, went with my typical mean of sashimi, plus a glass of soju. I would definitely recommend this place if you want to try authentic Japanese food. I thought it was great! It also seemed that everyone in the restaurant was extremely satisfied. Note that this restaurant had very reasonable prices. It was as if the restaurant wasn't even located in the city, that's how "normal" prices were! With that, I'd say, "college kids, take advantage of this restaurant!" Of course, don't forget to get the green tea and red bean ice cream.
