I went during happy hour. Solid margaritas and tasty tacos. In fact, the tacos were excellent. Here's the thing, though - why bother selling them for $1 each if that means there can only be a teeny tiny amount of filling? I get the value here, but honestly I would have been happier to pay $2 for 3 or something and to get more meat and less tortilla.
