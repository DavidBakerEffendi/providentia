Went to II Porto on Saturday, Jan. 28th with my daughter for brunch.  I had the Clams Orreganata  and they were a nice size, plump and fresh tasting and a good portion as well.  I then enjoyed their II Porto salad, , this dish was a large salad of chopped baby greens, steamed shrimp, lump crab meat, tomato, Bermuda  onions with a balsamic vinaigrette.  I  was totally full and it was delicious.  I will go again and next try their pastas.
