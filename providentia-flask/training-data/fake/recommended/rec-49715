Had a great birthday dinner there with boy. Opted for a la carte, as the min for pre fixe is 3 people, but all in all it probably netted out to about the same price...and we were super full. I have to preface I'm a food snob and usually look to fancypants pinky out Michelin starred restaurants for celebratory dinners, but I had been hearing a lot about Traif and figured it was as good a time as any to give it a whirl...so glad I did. I can honestly say if I had to order again I would not have passed up on anything. Heck I'd go back and order an identical meal and be just as happy. The best salt and pepper shrimp I've ever had. That's saying something. I actually can't remember dessert (did I have it? Or was it just too much birthday cocktails...?) so it might have been the lowlight, shrouded by the knockout mains. I was pleasantly surprised how casual the environment was. Amazing food + casual ambiance (read: no high heels necessary) + moderate prices = me likey.
