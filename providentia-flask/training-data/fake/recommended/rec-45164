We went here on a fairly busy Saturday night both to try the pizza and so my husband could try out the Zero Gravity brews.     We started with the salad special, which had local greens, beets and blue cheese.   It was tasty.   We ordered our flat bread with half New American Sausage and half Revolution.   Both were tasty, but I preferred the sausage side.   My husband thoroughly enjoyed the Zero Gravity brews.   Service was solid. I'd return if I were in Burlington.
