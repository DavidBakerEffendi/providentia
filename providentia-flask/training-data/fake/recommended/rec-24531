Loved everything about this adorable French Bistro in the West Village.  I was greeted immediately by the bartender and decided to take a seat at the bar, as I was just passing by.   I enjoyed some delicious charcuterie and a glass of wine while taking in the beautiful design around me.  The staff continued to be fantastically pleasant as we entered into a discussion of Bob Ross paintings!   I can't wait to go back for a meal as I am sure the experience will be matched!
