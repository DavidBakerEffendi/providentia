i sorta wish it had remained a byob like it used to be. i feel like the wine there is a bit pricey in relativity to the very affordable food menu. BUT, the fact remains - i love this place. salad, crostini, panini, cupcake... you name it, it's delicious. and it has a laid back cafe-ish atmosphere. awesome place to enjoy a quiet night in the neighborhood.
