Cafe Sabarsky was recommended to me by a classmate who said it was like stepping into a Vienesse cafe. I completely agree with him. I was satisfied with my lunch of Bratwurst mit Sauerkraut and the sachertorte for dessert. Most of all, I was very pleased to be dining with a view of Central park and to be so close to the MET. On a practical note, I suggest making a reservation for lunch. I went on a Tuesday afternoon and had to wait a half an hour for a table for two.
