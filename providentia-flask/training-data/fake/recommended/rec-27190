The hot sauce here is really spicy! Definitely go slow and steady with that one. If you're stuck between chicken and lamb, the lamb is chunky, moist and flavorful, and while the chicken also has flavor it is not as moist- the texture is also stringy. So, depends on what texture you're in the mood for.
