Decent venue, can see the stage week from most places , there is a balcony and bar upstairs to see down onto stage as well. The flow is stupid though, not much room to walk around and people are constantly pushing by to get to bar or bathrooms and spilling drinks in the process. Speaking of , I thought the price of said drinks was really high for what you get. So overall would go back but watch where I stand and maybe not visit the bar that often.
