Went to dinner with my family recently.  The menu is a bit all over the place with Italian specialties as well as Latin cuisine.  I ordered the  Spicy Batatas Bravas to be served with my entrée(Skirt Steak).  Unfortunately, they brought out the Batatas as an appetizer.  The steak, which I ordered medium-rare was a bit overcooked, but otherwise had good flavor.  My husband ordered the onion dumpling soup which was delicious.  Other dishes that were a hit included the Chilean Seabass with blue curacao and the Tuna three-way.  The owner and his wife(who was our server) were very nice.
