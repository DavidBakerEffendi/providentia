I wanted to give New Moon another chance because Â honestly, when I have eaten there I always really liked the food... and I'm glad I did, because I was not disappointed. Both times on recent visits I was greeted right away and helped quickly and pleasantly - the staff was very friendly. I got the Omega Salad the first time (which was so good... fresh spinach with chunks of artichoke and red tomatoes, walnuts, and salmon drizzled with just the right amount of sesame vinaigrette... yum) and had to go back a few days later to get it again. While I'm not vegan sometimes I like to try to not eat too much meat/dairy, so I was happy to discover that they have a new vegan menu that sounds amazing. Even vegan cupcakes! I'll be back for sure.
