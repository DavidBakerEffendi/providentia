Why is America so awesome?  Because it's a country of DIVERSITY.  Garces Trading Company is America, bread-meat-cheese-olive oil/vinegar style! Unfortunately, I did not get the opportunity to dine in the actual restaurant.  But my family and I spent our time farting around in the actual shopping portion of the GTC, the part that probably gets easily overlooked.  It's basically a very sophisticated grocery aisle: on one side, you have your meats, cheeses, and olives...but we're not talking bologna, provolone, and black olives.  We're talking Spanish, French, Italian delicacies!  By the slice!  To take home!  And that you can sample beforehand! The employees in this section were super friendly, letting us sample whatever we wanted.  At this point in time, I would be making recommendations, but I cannot possibly remember every type of meat and cheese that we bought.  Chorizo, Jamon Iberico, Jamon Embuchado, Manchego cheese, bright green olives-that-I-can't-remember..our family bought all of these and more to have our own dinner feast at home that night.  It felt like Thanksgiving in August. On the other side of this aisle are the vats of vinegar and olive oil.  There are small portions of bread so that you may sample the different flavors on something more feasible than your cupped hand.  Vinegars flavored with fruits and chocolates, oils infused with Tuscan herbs...there is something for everyone! Last but not least, do NOT neglect the pastry section, which has some of the most creative and indulgent desserts that my eyes and lips have ever encountered. I didn't know that Jose Garces is/was an Iron Chef.  But it became obvious once I experienced the outstanding tastes of diversity that was Garces Trading Co.
