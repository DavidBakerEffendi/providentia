Maybe I'm not a smoothie person. I ordered 'orange juice, pineapple, banana, non fat frozen yogurt' smoothies. Their smoothie taste the same with any other smoothies for me. But I definitely will be back to try on their coffee and sandwiches. If you're looking for a place to hang out on Saturday or Sunday noon, I recommend you to check this place out. It has outdoor and indoor seatings. Friendly baristas. Good food. And a Wi-Fi!
