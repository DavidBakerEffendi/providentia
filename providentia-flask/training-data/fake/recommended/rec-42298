Great meal at an awesome price. My waiter was dryyyyy but I still would go back. I didn't expect him to do flips for me but a nice tap dance would have gone a long way. Joking... A great place to go to with a small group. Two round of drinks, 4 app, 4 entrees $60 a person. Best thai I've had in Bk for sure!
