After visiting the Constitution Center we wanted to stop by somewhere within walking distance for some lunch. Having looked at several reviews we settled on Jones based on menu selection. While at Jones we were met with prompt seating and quality service. The waiter was comfortable making suggestions and did his best making sure that we had a good lunch. The drink selection was good and we were always taken care of with respect to that. We started our lunch with the nachos. We ordered these plain without any meat option and they were fantastic. Each chip was properly seasoned and featured a fantastic amount of beans, cheese, and additional accompanying toppings. The appetizer was good. Following the appetizer we were given bread. The bread was warm and it was crispy on the outside and soft and buttery on the inside. For our lunch we had the grilled cheese and tomato soup and a made to order market salad. The grilled cheese was toasted to perfection, wasn't too greasy, and the cheese was still very hot and stretchy. The tomato soup was very flavorful and had a great thick consistency. The taste of the soup was fantastic. The beauty of the market salad is that you can pick and choose what you want from a wide range of options to make a really hearty salad. There are roughly 15-20 different toppings that you can place on the salad with no limitations. The only suggestion that I could offer with the Market Salad is to get the dressing on the side so that you can regulate the amount of dressing put on the salad. The decor in Jones is meant to perpetuate a homey feel. The space is wide open and you can see directly into the kitchen. Overall we had a very nice lunch at Jones. We would consider going back but with the crowded food scene in Philly likely won't.
