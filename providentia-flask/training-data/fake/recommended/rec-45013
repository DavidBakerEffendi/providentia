I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. I am a "foodie" who expects a lot... and Perilla delivered! EVERYTHING at the table was amazing... I personally had the Triggerfish for dinner and it was a unique combination of flavors that somehow all worked together. It was beautiful! Portion size was great as well as service. Only suggestion---Get more Oregon Pinot Noir's on the wine list. Perilla is now one of my top NYC Picks! JUST GO!
