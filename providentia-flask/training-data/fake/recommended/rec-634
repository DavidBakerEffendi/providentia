Stumbled upon this place after catching a movie at 42nd street. The wait kinda sucked out in the cold. But my friend and I were thirsty for some sangria. The large pitcher was more than enough for 4 people to get tipsy. Plantain chips with guacamole was delicious. We tried spicy chicken, shredded beef, cheeseburger, viagra and Hawaiian empanadas. My favorite was spicy chicken, it had a great kick to it. I would probably return here again if I was in the neighborhood.
