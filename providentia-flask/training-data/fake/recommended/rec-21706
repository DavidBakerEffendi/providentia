Such a shame.  I was so excited to try Juventino but alas, the food was fine but not good enough to make up for the appalling service.  We showed up a couple of minutes early for our 7:30 reservation and were seated immediately.  Waited 15 minutes for water and menus.  Ordered a half dozen oysters, 2 appetizers, 2 main courses, 2 glasses of wine.  A server asked if we had any food allergies and I said, yes to gluten.  After 50 minutes of no food and long empty wine glasses and water glasses, I asked one of our many inept servers when we might expect oysters.  5 minutes later, our (now cold) appetizers arrived.  Still no oysters (which we then cancelled).  Another server brought wheat couscous and salami from the kitchen (thanks, love that free gluten).  When our mains finally arrived - 2 hours after sitting down - they were tasty though again, cold.  When we asked if perhaps they were short staffed that night, we were told that if we'd had reservations, we would have had better service.  So, there you have it, if you have reservations, you allegedly can expect better service than if you don't.  I can't imagine what worse service would be like.  Oh, and the toilet was filthy and not a single glass of hard-earned wine was comped.
