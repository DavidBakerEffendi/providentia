When visiting NYC recently, I looked to Yelp to find a good, classic, not too expensive Italian place in NYC. I think Pellegrino's fits that bill. It wasn't knock your socks off tasty by any means, and it seemed that there were a dozen other Italian restaurants in the neighborhood that looked like they'd taste about the same, but I wasn't disappointed. I wouldn't search it out again, but if I was in the neighborhood and craving lasagna, I'd go back.
