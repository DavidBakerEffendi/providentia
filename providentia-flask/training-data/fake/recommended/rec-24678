The service is horrible. Started out OK with knowledgeable waiter then went downhill from there. Waited over a hour for our entrees. Had to get up from the table just to find our waiter who was nowhere to be seen, Have heard the same complaint from my son and his friends who ate there recently. Will not be going back until they hire additional waitstaff!
