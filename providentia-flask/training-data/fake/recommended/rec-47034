I visited Philly recently and a friend took us here for breakfast. Loved the decor inside. The specials menu was Nickelodeon themed so that was cool! Staff was awesome! I got a simple egg, toast and homefries breakfast. My 3 other friends got the pancakes, homemade granola, and same as I did. We were all satisfied and full! Wish I lived closer, but next time I'm in town, I'd definitely go back to try the stuffed french toast. The table next to us ordered it and portions were huge!
