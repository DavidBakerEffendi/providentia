Came here with a friend for dinner a couple of weeks ago. I'm so happy that this place lived up to the hype. I'm a hugeeee lover of savory food and this place is a fave of mine. I love the two floor seating (we had to wait for dinner service but we were seated pretty quickly) and service was fine. I had mexican coke (yay!!) and the truffle burger. I'm like so greedy when it comes to food portions? ('murica) and the truffle burger was like tiny--probably because sides are separate orders. I was satisfied and full by the time I was done though... and they nailed the umami on the spot. The bun was ahmaaazingly yummy and the meat...mm. Makes my mouth water while typing this. Also the onion rings are not your typical barfood onion rings. Definitely worth getting--the crunchy batter is deliciousss.
