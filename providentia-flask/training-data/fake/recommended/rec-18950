My husband and I had our wedding reception at Jadis, and they were incredible. Such a pleasure to work with, very flexible and accommodating, and great hosts to our guests. The passed appetizers were delicious, and the wine and beer were great. Guests were able to dance in the back area (we hired a DJ), or have a more quiet conversation at the bar or just outside the entrance. We don't normally write reviews on Yelp, but we felt compelled to do so because the service and experience was so spectacular. We would highly recommend Jadis for any kind of private event!
