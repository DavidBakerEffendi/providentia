It's unfortunate that the original owners got bought out. Back in the day the sandwiches would be loaded with tender meat and sopping with cheese. I would park my butt there for a great meal. Today, however, it's still one of the best I've found, ANYWHERE. They make their sandwiches with chopped beef (not the slices like they do in S. Philly). They still make a mean gooey steak, but it's not like it once was. Still, though, good luck finding a better cheese steak!
