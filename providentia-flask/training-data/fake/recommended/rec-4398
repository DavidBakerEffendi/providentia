Johnny Brenda's has a very pleasant bar atmosphere, like a slightly-more-whimsical Standard Tap inside, with small colored lights built into the tables that twinkle slowly.  We sat beside enormous open windows on a cool summer night and all felt right with the world. The beer selection is solid, which is Northern-Liberties-standard, and while the wall-mounted chalkboard menu isn't all that descriptive, it serves its purpose, and my very friendly server was able to answer all my food questions without checking a list. We ate little, but sometimes you can tell from a few bites if a place has it or not, and Johnny Brenda's has it.  The softshell crab sandwich was big and juicy, the crab stood out very well against its accompaniments, and its soft bun was absolutely perfect (it's always wonderful when a restaurant nails just the right bread for a sandwich).  The fries were also terrific, thin and salty and not rock hard. They had three mussel dishes on the menu: red, white and green.  Our server recommended the green, which is pesto-based, and he was spot-on.  Absolutely delicious.  I would have soaked a loaf of bread in the broth and eaten the whole thing... so I'm glad I was limited to the two slices that came with it! Great atmosphere, great service, and delicious pub food.  I will be back!
