What a great find! I never thought I'd venture down to desolate Third Avenue for a post-work outing, but I would definitely do so to visit Bar Tano again. Really relaxed, chill space where you can pull up a seat right at the bar. Nice little selection of tasty Italian beers on tap (I'm a Belgian beer snob and I really liked these brews) and the bartender gives you a generous sample of whatever sparks your curiosity. But moving on to the food. I was really excited to try the pizza and ordered the Margherita pie. At just $8, I thought it would be some small thing, but it was huge--and positively delicious! The ingredients were really fresh, the crust was thin and nicely charred, and the sauce had a tartness that was really nice. I can usually polish off everything on my plate but had to bring a quarter of this sucker home. Ate it cold a day later and it tasted a-ma-zing.
