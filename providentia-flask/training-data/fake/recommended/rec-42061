3.5, really. I can tell why Pommes Frites is in such close proximity to a host of bars, because one must HAVE to be drunk to pay such astronomical prices for French fries. Don't get me wrong, they were delicious, but $4.50 and up for a side dish? The fries were good, Â crispy and hot, while the mango chutney sauce added a sweet and spicy creaminess. But... for so much money? And no cheeseburgers? Drunk yuppies must be an incredibly naive population.
