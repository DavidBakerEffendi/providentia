It was a Thursday evening and a fine Ladies Night with two of my girls over delicious food & drinks. The wait staff was attentive and our waiter was entertaining, charming, and a great bartender in one! We shared an order of the ceviche mixto, beef empanadas, and the taquitos de langosta! The ceviche was flavorful with a nice mix of calamari, shrimp, and scallops .. empanadas were mouthwatering ... and taquitos were tiny but oh so delicious with the right amount of crunch! For our mains, we ordered the Papardelle Pasta, Pollo a la Parilla, and the Sangria-Braised Short Ribs. The Papardelle was cooked al dente in a nice red wine reduction, the Chicken was served with a yummy corn arepa, and the Short Ribs were oh so tender and served with a nice cauliflower puree. We didn't opt for dessert but the drinks were great! Be sure to try the COQUITO PASSION!
