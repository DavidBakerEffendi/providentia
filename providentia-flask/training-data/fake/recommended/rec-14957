I've been to Garces Trading Company several times, and will go back.  But my last visit was a little disappointing as compared to my previous visits.  So I give it 3 stars for inconsistency. My last visit was July 4th, and was glad to see they added beer and wine to the menu as I came empty handed and forgot the state store would be closed.   I ordered a vichyssoise that would have been delicious if had not been served hot.  Maybe I'm a dolt, but I thought the difference between potato soup and vichyssoise was temperature.  I wanted a cold soup for that hot day, but it was delicious nonetheless.  A bow of that in the winter would be heaven.   My entree, however, was blah.  I had a fish so unmemorable except for it's mushyness and that thick brown connective tissue (what is that anyway?).  I found half of the fish inedible and the entire dish bland.   Service was meh.  It started out good, as our server was friendly and fast.  But as the place filled up a bit and she saw more money to be made at other tables (fair enough), we got a bit of a cold shoulder.  She was not rude, just suddenly got short with us.   I'm ok with small portion sizes and hefty prices if it's worth it, but It think Garces Trading company is a nudge too overpriced for the quality and value.  It's not absurd, but clearly you're paying for a brand here, not just a product. That said, I've had a number of excellent meals in prior visits, enough that brought me back.  The lunch specials are a good value.  The oils, vinegars, charcuterie and cheese shop give you plenty of reasons to spend money.
