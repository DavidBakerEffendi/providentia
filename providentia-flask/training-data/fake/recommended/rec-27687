Potatoes are simple yet this establishment glorifies the ordinary. I had a baked potato with butter, sour cream, chives, mozzarella and cheddar cheese and of course bacon! For what they do, Potatopia does it well. Â  The place is clean and the service is knowledgeable and dare I say it New Yorkers, friendly?
