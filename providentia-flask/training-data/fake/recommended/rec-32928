An old school in and out grease pit that delivers.  That's pretty much it, calorie counters and health conscious people steer clear.  This place is all about fat and flavor.  They have an array of various foods that are available, but their piece de resistance is their Rippers!  Deep Fried hot dogs that you can smother with cheese, gravy chilli or their famous, home-style relish.  The building is old but it's charming you stand up when you eat and that adds to the experience. I have not tried their dine in section but may in future.  It's a good spot if you want a quick tasty dog and a beer!
