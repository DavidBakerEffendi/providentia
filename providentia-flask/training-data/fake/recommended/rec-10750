My wife and I were seated as soon as we got into the dining room. Five minutes later another couple was seated at the table behind us. The other couple we're greeted by a waitress as soon as they sat down. We waited for a member of the wait staff to come and take our order. I got up, went over to the hostess who was standing at the head of the restaurant, telling her I came over to her to complain about no service. She sent another waitress over to our table to tell us that she could do us a favor and order our drinks while we waited for a waiter. At this point my wife and I decided not to spend $100 plus bucks as we did last year several times in this restaurant. Who could enjoy a meal when your stomach is twisted in a knot from this aggravation. We'll never come back to this restaurant.
