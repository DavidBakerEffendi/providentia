It sounds like it could be hit or miss here, and I think I just had a miss for food .  It was a fun place in general.  A lot of happy loud people, clean and fine in general.  We sat upstairs and no one ever came to our table so my husband stood in line to order our drinks and food.  I got a special - steak sandwich with fries.  The steak was grizzly and hard to bite through so that kind of ruined the sandwich for me.  For $14 I was hoping for something better. I would try it again if someone I was with was really into it - but there are so many great places in Manhattan I probably wouldn't try it again in my own.
