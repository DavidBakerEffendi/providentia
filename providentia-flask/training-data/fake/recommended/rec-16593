OK.. so being Vietnamese, I had to come and try the Pho Real sandwich. Finally got a chance to and, holy crap, was I pleasantly surprised at how much the sandwich tasted like Pho! There's ton of roast beef and all the vegetables are really fresh. I got the sandwich cold but you can get it warm as well. Have since taken my sister there and her response was " my head says its Pho but my eyes tell me a sandwich. Its not right!" She loved it. definitely have gone back 3x before I've finally got a chance to write this review. I do plan on going back again.
