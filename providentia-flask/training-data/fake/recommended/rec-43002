A psychic front for a beautiful, cozy bar, candlelit and dotted with warm, pretty people.  The drinks are so good- try the Amelia.  The oysters were cold and fresh and juicy and the bone marrow poppers were like beefy, flavor-packed tiny pastries.   Romantic and comfy, this is a great place for a date or heartfelt brainstorming with friends. I had my fortune read on the way out.  The first card she pulled was Death, followed by all the other bad ones.  It made for a very memorable evening.
