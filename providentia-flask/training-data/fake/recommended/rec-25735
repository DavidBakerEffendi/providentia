Yes, you will pay $12 for about 6oz. of guacamole, but the $7 sangria is well worth the cost.  This is hands down my favorite Sangria in the city.  The red is spicy with all the right fruit and finish.  The white is a little to sweet to drink for extended periods of time but good for a change now and then.  Happy hour is the best time to go, but be prepared to fight your way to the bar.
