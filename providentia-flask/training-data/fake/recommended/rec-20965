I would like to give this place 4.5 stars but am settling on 4 as 5 is a tad generous. The wine selection is great and the food, very good. Most of all, when you dine out, you are looking for the experience and ambience. This place has both and proved for a lovely meal for myself and my girlfriend. We both enjoyed our meal but more so loved the relaxed vibe of the restaurant and decor. There is a small bar at the front, a coved dining area at the back and in the main restaurant also. Unfortunately for me, it's not near my usual outing spots, else I would have been back but should make the effort to return, given the memories of a fond evening there. Recommended to all.
