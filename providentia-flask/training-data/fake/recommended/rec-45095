This restaurant is so cute cute cute.  Its only the cutest little corner and its great for people watching, yes even from inside the restaurant.  We actually stopped in at a wine store and picked out something because they let you BYOB.  I had the cavatelli and soft shell crab.  The cavatelli was amazing.  I would get it again as an entree and my friend got the chicken and the meatball sliders, not sure how he managed to eat it all.  But, he said it was too good to pass up.  The dessert was just okay, I've had better.  I can't wait to go back, maybe for brunch next time.
