Second time in Bogota and hasn't disappointed again! So here are the well deserved 5 stars. The food is excellent. We were a party of 4 and we all got different food. All of it was delicious. The service is excellent also and the ambience is great. I definitely recommend it and will surely be back to this charming spot.
