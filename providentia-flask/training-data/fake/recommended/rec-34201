So I just joined Yelp in order to write my review of Cafe Henri. My goodness is this place wonderful. Â The service is top-notch, the decor is adorable and the food is great. Suggestion: start with the goat cheese salad, move on to the smoked salmon crepe and end with the caramel/apple crepe. Darn good cup of coffee too, along with fresh-squeezed OJ. Sorry my first Yelp review isn't funny or cool, but just had to give Cafe Henri its props. Totally our go-to place in our new neighborhood.
