Came here two days ago on Sunday. The food was tasty and the drinks kept coming but they need to get their kitchen and service in order. They were out of 4 things we ordered and it took twenty minutes for two small plates to come out and another 15 for the next two. All of a sudden, almost an hour into brunch everything came at the same time and there was no room on the table. Our waiter asked us why we "sent a pizza back" and we all told him it wasn't ours and there was a mistake; we don't eat meat and the pizza had sausage. Then he said again "but you sent it back. If you didn't order it, who's is it??!?" "Um, I'm sorry. We didn't order it, no need to yell. Figure out where it belongs... we don't eat meat." He then came back and told us that the hour an a half for drinks was over and if we wanted to add an extra half an hour. We told him it was funny to come and ask that when it took almost an hour to get our food and asked if we could get topped off one last time. He tried to fight but we weren't having it, so he begrudgingly topped us off, we paid and left. Great food, beautiful space but the kitchen needs to get it together and so does the wait staff. Might go back at an earlier time with a smaller group (we were 7) and not for a special occasion (it was my birthday).
