I went here based on a ringing endorsement from from Gabrielle Hamilton in Newsweek's 101 Best Places to Eat in the World issue...so needless to say expectations were high. The restaurant itself is cute / fun, and I thought the service was casual but great.   However it was the food that really was a letdown.  I tried the beet and celery salads and found them very average and bland.  They were out of smoked trout, so I just moved on to the mixed grill plate with: Cevapi (tasty but nothing extraordinary), sausage (average), thinly sliced pork loin (way too salty), pork chop (tough and chewy), and bacon wrapped prunes and chicken liver (I just haven't developed a taste for chicken liver) . On the plus side, Kafana has some really nice Croatian wines and prices for food and drink are very reasonable.   Doubt I'll be back though.
