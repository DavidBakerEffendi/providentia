I have two words for this place LOMO SALTADO. Probably the best thing I've ever tasted in a while! I literally wanted to cry after my first bite of this delicious entree. I can't believe I lived 20+ years of my life without this amazing dish. The fries were so flavorful soaked in the sauce and the meat was cooked to absolute PERFECTION. I've never been too big on meat but this meal makes me want to eat meat all day errdayyyy! Â I'm so sad my stomach only has room for one thing because I would love to try every dish here!! The restaurant itself is also super unique! I walked in thinking it would be a small place like all other places in NY but we walked through what seemed like a secret passageway into a HUGE underground space where people were enjoying their meals in dim, mood-setting lighting. Another essential part of the dinner experience was the sangria. Four of my friends and I shared a pitcher before our meals came and of course that was not enough. After two whole pitchers we were happy as clams and along with our orgasmic meal we were pretty much all in food heaven. I literally want to fly back to NY just to experience this again!!
