Went with a group of co-workers based on internet search for Mexican food.  The location is simple a pizzeria looking joint in a strip mall, with Spanish soap opera on the tv's.  They do make pizza which looked good but we weren't here for that.  Rotisserie chickens were being perpared but weren't yet ready.  The menu is voluminous and a little tough to negotiate but everyone eventually picked something.  At first the chef started taking our orders and was friendly and helpful.  A friendly waitress then took over and got everyone's order.  Their English is a bit broken but everyone got what they wanted.  I had three tacos, 2 beef and one chicken. They came beautifully presented in an oval plate with radish and grilled scallion garnish with a lime.  The tacos were perfect, soft shell double layered with grilled meat and aselection of 3 different but equally amazing sauces. I paid $2 each for the tacos and was filled up with Mexican Peruvian goodness. The nachos they put out are hot and crispy and addictive!  Red beans and rice on the side for good measure-outstanding again.  Overall, great South of the border food in afreiendly place at a great price - highly recommend.
