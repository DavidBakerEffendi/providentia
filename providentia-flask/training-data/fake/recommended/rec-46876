Definitely one of the better brunch places. There is a bit of a wait because of this fact so get there early or prepare to do some waiting or walking around until you get a table. Pretty much every plate that goes by looks amazing. We both settled on the heuvos ranchero, which is my go-to, and it's the best I've had. I was stuffed and I'm usually more of the type to eat half and box the rest. The portions are huge, so, eating half is actually quite a lot here. When you consider how much food you get the prices are really reasonable. I think mine was only $10.99, which isn't cheap (fairly standard for breakfast), but when you consider the amount of food, it's kind of a steal. They also had an MTV menu of options. I'm not sure if this is regular on the menu or a special, but I thought it added an interesting twist than the norm. breakfast/lunch options. The coffee was good, the place is cute, and the staff was nice. And even though the place was packed with people and you don't have a lot of privacy because the tables are so close together, you can still manage to hear your tablemate well and not have everyone else's conversations bleed into yours, so, good acoustics in the place. I would definitely go back to this place again and again. I was taken to Morning Glory on my last trip to Philly and the tofu scramble was the blandest I'd ever had. I would maybe give that place another try but I was definitely not impressed, and it's more of a hole-in-the-wall and not as cute as Sabrina's.
