As a neighborhood person, I wanted to like this place, but my wife and I found it pretty lacking. The food was o.k., and the service wasn't terrible, but the overall experience left us not in a hurry to come back - especially with two other excellent Latin restaurants in the neighborhood. My wife had the guacamole appetizer that was fine except for the occasional really hot mouthful of spice that was otherwise unnoticeable in the dish. She had the Cubano salad as her main dish and that was tasty. I had the shimp and chorizo appetizer which was really forgettable and the turkey with meatballs and rice soup which was pretty bland. Neither of us felt compelled to stay for dessert. The "Cat" theme is overdone, and the waitress didn't seem to know much about the dishes, and even for a BYOB place, I was a little disappointed when service meant handing us a corkscrew so we could serve ourselves. All in all, given the many options in Fairmount, I don't feel compelled to try again any time soon.
