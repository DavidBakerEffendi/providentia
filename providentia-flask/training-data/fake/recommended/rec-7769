Eating at Bouley is like being transported to a faraway land on vacation. You open a rustic door labeled just with the restaurant's name and enter a welcoming room with apples placed on the wall as if you were in a farmhouse in Provence. The maitre'd is extremely pleasant to deal with and offers to seat you and give you a drink if you are early. The dining room itself feels like a Garden of Eden with its ample supply of flowers. Everywhere one looks, there is a motif suggesting love, making this the most romantic restaurant in the city. Highlights of our choices from tasting menu include oysters with caviar or egg with artichoke as appetizers, lamb main course, as well as the large stacked dessert plate at the end of the meal which includes macarons.
