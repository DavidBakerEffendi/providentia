I don't usually go out for hot pot because it's generally more economical to do it at home and you get more food out of it. But on rare occasion when I don't feel like cleaning up, then it's good to know there's some place local I can go to. Pros: 1)clean and new (looking) 2)nice little enclosed room area for larger groups an order of fishballs is 7, not 4. 3) Relatively fast with bringing out orders. Cons: 1) Service. Servers standing around not really refilling water and broth in a timely manner. This place is busy but the servers are not always busy. When they are not busy, they stand around. We had to ask for everything we needed. We asked for two glasses of tea, they brought over one. We asked for tea refill, they only refilled ONE cup and not the entire table. 2) Sauce choices for a hot pot place is considered limited. They had a platter of things you can add to your bowl for sauce. In actuality, it's really just Sha Cha sauce. The rest are garlic, fresh and fried, cilantro and spring onions. Â They didn't bring out sesame oil and other types of sauces you would find at other hot pot restaurants. also, they take the sauces back when you're done and if you need more, flag down a waiter and ask for it again. Not a huge problem but when I'm seeing hot pot, the last time I wanna do is flag down a server to get sauce. I much prefer to go to a sauce bar and get my own. 3) Varieties of hot pot items are considered "safe." You have the norm. Various types of balls, seafood and veggies. Nothing exotic if you're looking for authentic overseas style. In conclusion, the stuff offered here can all be done at home, minus the hassle of cleaning up.
