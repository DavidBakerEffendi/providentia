How does this place have 4 stars on Yelp? Yelpers you have failed me!  It must be drunk people coming in to enjoy the bar and the bar food.  It was empty when we got there, bad sign number one.  It did eventually get some traffic after people finally awoke from sleeping in late. Serious was horrendous.  The servers can't see the tables outside of the bar area since the restaurant is long and narrow, and appears to have a few more table in the back area.  Our server didn't quiet care enough to service us.  He forgot items off our order and sent even sent us the wrong dish.  Highly disappointed.   The Sangria was the best part.  Only one or two of the dishes stood out as being decent.  The rest were sad attempts to pass of mediocre food catered to the bar crowd.   Why is it so hard to find a decent tapas place like the boquerias in Spain?
