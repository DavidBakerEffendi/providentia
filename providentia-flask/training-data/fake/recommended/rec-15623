The review was right, their Buritos was that good. Everything is so freshly made, the sauce that they mixed with the lettuce is something I will never forget. The price is unbeatable for that great of food. It was a little confsuing at first trying to find the right truck -Nextalli. We passed by a few other trucks, they also look like they all making fresh and authentic mexican tacos and buritos. Give them a try, you will love it !
