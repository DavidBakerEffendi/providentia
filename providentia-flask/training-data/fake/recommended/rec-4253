I've eaten here 5 times over the several years I've been working nearby and its no coincidence I've had the runs all five times. The food taste great but somethings not right if it sends you to the bathroom. My stomachs far from weak and being that I work a block away my coworkers who've had same issue are proof I'm not an isolated incident. The lines for halal guys are always insane so food doesn't sit long, my guess is they must be using poor products or maybe that white sauce is a laxative I don't know. I say steer clear although even though I know plenty of people who don't mind the trade off of tasty inexpensive platters for the upset tummy that follows.
