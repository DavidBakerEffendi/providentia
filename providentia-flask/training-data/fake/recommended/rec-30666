Since I live four blocks away, I've been here probably a dozen times.  It's a very cute restaurant, great for brunch or a casual dinner.  I love the mac and cheese, the chicken and meatballs, and the chicken and artichoke sandwich.  I tend to bring out-of-town guests here since the prices are reasonable; they are usually impressed.  The service is nice and the decor reminds me of a country home and for an hour I pretend that I'm not in the crowded streets of Manhattan.   I'm never super full when I leave, but I guess that's a good thing.  The portions are definitely suited for one person.  There's also an ice cream place on 3rd Avenue between 33rd and 34th that I will swing by if I'm feeling a need to keep eating.
