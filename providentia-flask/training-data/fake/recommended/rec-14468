This place is A-OK. If I dine at a restaurant and I don't quite remember everything that we ate, then it's 3 stars at best. But that could be that my best friend and a friend ordered and I went with whatever they ordered. But even if they didn't ordered, I wouldn't have been impressed. The only thing I remembered was the special Pad Thai and that was okay. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Thai food but this just wasn't cutting it for me. BUT I must say that the drinks are delicious! I ordered the passion fruit mojito and it was reallllly good (I'm a sucker for anything passion fruit). My friends ordered a martini that was reallllly good as well. Don't quite remember what it's called so I guess I may have to go back to find out. Next time, I'll just sit at the bar and order the drinks. But yes, 3 stars for me.... mainly because of the drinks.
