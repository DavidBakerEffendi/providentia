As the great Guy Fieri would say, "Welcome to Flavor Town!".... wow, so much flavor in their dishes.  Wife and I got the Dan Dan noodles of course, double cooked Pork Belly, and Salt and Pepper Scallops.  You cannot go wrong this place if you're looking for some real Chinese/Sichuan food. Pork Belly -double cooked:  Ridiculous.  My favorite dish of the night.  The sauce it's cooked in is so good you have to say Oh My God after every bite.   Dan Dan noodles....Perfectly cooked noodles with tons of flavor.  The sauce has a nutty, garlicky flavor with the perfect amount of kick. Salt and Pepper Scallops:  Scallops melt in your mouth.  The breading perfectly compliments the scallop bc it's so light with the saltiness and spice.
