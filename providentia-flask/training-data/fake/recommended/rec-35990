Ootoya is one of those restaurants that I hesitate to review for fear it gets too popular and loses some of its original charm.  :) It is by far one of the best places I've tried in NY and one that I will definitely make a trip out to again.  Their homemade tofu and pork belly is exceptional and what really makes Ootoya unique for me is its attention to detail, the exquisite simplicity of the dishes, and how well it does non-traditional Japanese food (at least what you see in the states). Highly recommended!
