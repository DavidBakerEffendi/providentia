I ate here with my husband and another couple in December 2010.  I think this is easily one of the best meals I have ever had  (top 3, for sure).  The atmosphere is warm, cozy and romantic.  A wonderful date spot.   I had the braised short ribs with a side of polenta, and it was exquisite.  The meat was so tender, juicy and flavorful.   It is on the pricey side, but I would say well worth it.  Everyone at our table loved their food.  Can't wait to come back!
