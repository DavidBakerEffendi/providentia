We lucked out and got seats at the bar but only because we arrived before 630. When we left at 8 the place was packed, but under control. This was my second visit and this time we started off with an ethereal lamb and burrata pizza with a mint pesto.  Mixing  it up we shared some every fine salami and antipasti-- that unbeatable carrot salad again-- and we finished with the chestnut filled pasta with deep fried sage leaves that were integral to this fine dish, not just just a garnish. A perfect dessert if it weren't for the more perfect gelati-- pistachio for me.  I might move from rittenhouse square to south philly just to be closer to the kickass cuisine supported by the very professional  and knowledgeable elliotte and his colleagues at the bar. Oh and don't leave without trying the sausage stuffed long hots.
