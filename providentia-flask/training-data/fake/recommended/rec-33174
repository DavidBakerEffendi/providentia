A New York institution that puts Astoria on the national culinary map! Rocco and his team go over and above in every category. The food is delicious and beautifully prepared. The staff is genuinely friendly and works hard to deliver a memorable experience. The wine list is full of spectacular bottles at reasonable prices. Whether a special occasion or just another night out Trattoria L'Incontro promises 5 stars!
