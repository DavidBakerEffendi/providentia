First, they have a different menu for brunch. My husband and I went around three and were given the brunch menu. So we didn't get to try the Buttermilk Fried Chicken. So, instead my husband ended up ordering some fried pork dish with waffles. i don't know if it was the time and day, but they were lacking a lot of the items from the menu. We were told about the shortage as my husband's food came out. We were told they ran out of their waffle batter, so we got some pancakes instead. Again, this was told as they brought out our food. In addition, the substitution was made without our consent. I was surprised due to the fact they are known for their chicken and WAFFLES. How can they run out of the batter for what they are known? The pork dish was also lightly pink which isn't good when it comes to pork. We hoped for the best and still consumed it due to the long wait we had to endure to get our food in the first place. It was ironic how the table next to us, who had more people and ordered after we did, got their food first. We also tried ordering one of the doughnuts as dessert, but we were also told they only had one, exactly one, doughnut left. So, I got to have that one last doughnut. The service was mediocre. Our waitress seemed very miserable to be working there. She wasn't thrilled when we asked about some items on the menu nor when we tried to order dessert. Once we ordered our food our waitress was nonexistent. Also, we were told about the changes by someone else who brought our food out. The quickest service we got from her was when we asked her for the check. I really wanted to enjoy my meal at Buttermilk Channel, but it just wasn't meant to be I guess...
