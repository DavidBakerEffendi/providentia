The grilled prunes stuffed with walnuts and cheese and wrapped in bacon called Rolovane Suve Sljive i Dzigerica are AMAZING. We had the Mesano Meso ($31.50), the mixed grilled platter for 2 - with about 4 varieties of Dimljena Vesalica - pork loin, cevapi, seljacka kobasic Â - Serbian sausages, a huge pork chop called Krmenadla and my personal favorite prunes, and it is extremely filling and sumptuous. Cozy space with nice decor. Good service. Make reservations as they seems to be running full on weekends.
