Woah! The burger I had wasn't fancy, the cows that went into this burger were probably just the regular old cows that you see when in Upstate; but man oh man was this burger tasty! No frills, no fancy sauce, no cloth napkins, just a thick juicy burger with onions, lettuce, tomato, pickles, Â with some added ketchup and mustard if you know whats good for you. This will probably be the best burger you had, since your Uncle Bill's 4th of July back yard bbq in 1993
