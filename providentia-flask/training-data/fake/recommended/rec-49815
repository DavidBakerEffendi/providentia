Larb Ubol stands out in the sea of 9th Ave Thai restaurants! I had delivery on Friday night and loved it so much that I went back on Saturday for a late lunch.  Both times the food was impressive - authentic dishes, fantastic spcies, great service, and fresh ingredients.  I look forward to trying other dishes on the menu and making this my go-to favorite.
