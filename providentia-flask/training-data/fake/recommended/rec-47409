Absolutely tantalizing for your tastebuds!   Almost  everything about ilili was AMAZING from the appetizers to the dessert.   The ambiance was great for a night out on the town ~ dark and swanky.   My party was seated immediatly at the time of my reservation at a table that allowed for optimal conversation amongst all of my guests.  I orderered the chicken skewers as my main meal and as many times as I have had chicken- in many ways, this was by far the best.  The lamb dishes were spectacular.  The hummus and yogurt just added to the extravagant experience that ilili offers.   The hostesses and waitress were very friendly and helpful, the restrooms were clean and attended to.   My only caution...Steer clear of the sangria pitchers if you are used to sweet and fruity beverages, these are mixed with burbon and are neither fruity nor sweet and are $45 a piece.
