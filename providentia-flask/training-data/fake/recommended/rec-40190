I really would love to give this place five stars but I can't bring myself to do it. There are a lot of positives about this popular salad place: touch screens for ordering, friendly staff, locally grown fruits and veggies, tons of organic and vegan options. However, I have never spent under $16 for a salad (in the establishments defense, a very large salad) and a drink. Because of the prices and the recent hype about this place, I think it's more than a little overrated. If you're a vegetarian or vegan working in the rittenhouse area, this is your salad place!!!
