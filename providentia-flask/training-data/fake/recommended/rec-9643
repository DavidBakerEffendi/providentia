All my friends told me how great the ramen foodie scene is in NYC.  Having never had ramen that really surprised me, I kept my expectations low.  We arrived at Ippudo around noon, and although the place was crowded, after a concerted greeting from the entire staff, we were seated immediately.  My companions were pleasantly surprised claiming they had waited as long as two hours in previous visits. I ordered the Karaka Men in pork broth.  The broth was amazing and the noodles, which I'm told are made on-site, were absolutely different from factory made.  You can order your ramen with optional toppings such as pork belly or a boiled egg.  And halfway through the course, they give you the option for a fresh helping of noodles.  On such a cold day the ramen was as comforting as any great bowl of soup I've ever had.  For our appetizer, we ordered the pork belly bun, which was delicious.  It was tender, unctuous, and I'm not sure what the accompanying sauce was, but it was really good. The service was very attentive.  And surprisingly they were replacing the used plates after each course.  I wasn't expecting this because it's not a fine dining establishment at all. Overall experience--WOW.  I started craving my second serving as soon as my meal was over.
