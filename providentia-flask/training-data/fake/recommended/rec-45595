This restaurant is not entirely the place to be if you are a claustrophobic. All the tables and seats are crammed together, and the only comfortable spots are the booths which there are a shortage of. As for the food, I was totally excited to see what all the rave about this place was after seeing Â the photos. Presentation is definitely amazing, they get points for that. I ordered the pecan waffles with fresh strawberries on top. It was OK, but not something I would order again. Overall it was so-so. Not worth driving 20 minutes (not including the difficulty finding parking) to eat there, unless your already in the neighborhood.
