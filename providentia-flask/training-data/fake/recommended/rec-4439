I love Indian food and was looking for a good one to go to after the Embassdor of India in Glastonbury closed. So I came to Masala and was less then pleased. The place had about three couples seated and we were a party of 4 and one child and it took the staff over one hour to ask us what we wanted. In fact, we had to go get a waitress. The flat bread that they give out while waiting was good, and the food that we ordered was alright. Not the best, but alright. But then the bill came and wow, for food that was so-so, it was expensive! I know that Indian food is expensive but for the quality, we weren't so happy.
