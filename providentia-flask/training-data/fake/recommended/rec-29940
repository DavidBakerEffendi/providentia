I moved to Astoria this past June and have been enjoying trying out new bars & restaurants here. MP Taverna is without a doubt my favorite restaurant in the Ditmars area...actually scratch that, it's probably my favorite in Astoria so far. I haven't had a dish yet that hasn't been fantastic. The lemon chicken is incredible, the branzino was grilled to perfection, and the stuffed sole I had last night was just freaking amazing. Even if you're not going to eat, the bar is beautiful with friendly bartenders. There's a really nice list of craft beers that seem to change pretty often. Just go here, then go again.
