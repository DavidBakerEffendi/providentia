YUM!  YUM!  One of the best tapas places in the city.  Probably this place and Alta are my faves.  Great service, delicious menu (you really can't go wrong... I loved the lamb skewers, croquettes, the chocolate chorizos, and the patatas fritas; only thing i wasn't crazy about was their dessert menu), and awesome service.  The place is tiny but if you have a group of 6 or more, you can try to reserve the one & only big table in the back.
