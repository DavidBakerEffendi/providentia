This is my favorite sushi spot.  The spicy shrimp rolls and the boxes are my favorite!  The staff are great, and we are now on a first name basis :) They usually get a dinner rush around 7ish, it's a small place so you will wait at least 1/2hr, 45min... It's also a BYOB. If you want to try something new try this place :)
