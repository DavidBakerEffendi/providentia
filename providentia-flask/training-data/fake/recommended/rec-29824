Cafe style (self-service, BAD service, plastic utensils etc) for higher-than-restaurant prices. Save yourself the heartache. Harini around the corner serves the same stuff for half the price and is a full-service restaurant. But Mylai Masala, just down the road, and Tandoori Bite in Princeton, both have fantastic buffets and a la carte menus. And great service.
