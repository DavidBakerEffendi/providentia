The outdoor seating is probably the best thing Rouge has going for it. It's great for grabbing drinks in the summer. Food is also really good. I had the cheeseburger, which was well-worth the $16 price tag. Other entries run slightly higher, into the $20-$30 range. So the burger is a good deal if you want to eat at Rouge, but not spend too much. Wine was also very delicious, although a bit pricey. Great chic hang out right on the square.
