Wow!What a great little place!We stumbled upon it by accident, and I'm so glad we did! Very cozy atmosphere of España with the extremely friendly staff and great music. We came on the flamenco night and it was unforgettable! Tapas, little portions of seafood,potatoes or chorizo, turned out to be so much fun, you are supposed to share it with your friends.There are 2 prices for a smaller and bigger portions. For 3 people the smaller portion was enough. We ordered 6 tapas and a salad. Sangrias were delicious and the bill turned out to be so much less than we expected! I definitely will come back there again and tell all my friends about this gem! Olé!
