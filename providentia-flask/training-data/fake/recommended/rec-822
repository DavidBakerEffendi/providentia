So after living in NJ my whole life, I finally made the trip to Geno's. This place does not live up to the hype at all. The food was not cooked fresh. We ordered and were given our food like 30 seconds later. So basically they have food just hanging out waiting to be placed on a roll. That does not sound appetizing at all.  The sandwich was not horrible, but not good. There was like 2 pieces of meat on the roll, and mostly uncooked onions. Oh and I wasn't aware, but they don't cut the steak like a typical cheese steak. It's more or less like a slab of meat.  The roll itself was ok. Most of the staff appeared to be annoyed. Maybe they are tired of working for a tourist attraction. Who knows. I will probably never go back here. Oh and I almost forgot, the minute we went to sit down, some older guy who claims that he worked there was trying to bum cigarettes from people. -__-
