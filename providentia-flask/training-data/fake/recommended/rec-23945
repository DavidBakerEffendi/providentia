I just got back from seeing phenomenal British folkie Meg Baird. She played a spectacular set which was marred by what I can only describe as some kind of horrendous stage lighting malfunction. It persisted throughout her entire set and was very reminiscent of a cross between a U.S. Army psy ops experiment gone awry and the "Stormy Weather" scene (at the Zodiac Club) from Bell, Book and Candle. If this stage lighting catastrophe wasn't the result of a major technical malfunction, then whoever is in charge of the lighting needs to learn what amount of lighting changes is appropriate for each act that performs there. (Openers Watery Love were lovely and not at all watery.) (Oh, and Glenn Jones should play more banjo.)
