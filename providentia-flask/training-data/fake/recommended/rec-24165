Ok.. So if you are looking for amazing pizza, look no further. I love that they are using fresh seasonal ingredients. The crust is thin and delish and the the toppings are not your average pepperoni. This is our new go-to for any pizza crazing. Oh and If you are a meat-ball fan- you must try Birra's.
