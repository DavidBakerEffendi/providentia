Went here over the weekend and I was impressed.  We were seated at our reservation time and the service was wonderful. The escargot was delicious and the seviche was wonderful, it wasn't all sliced and diced so you could actually tell what you were eating.  I had the roasted chicken, which I enjoyed.  My friends had the duck confit and they both loved it.  Desert was perfection...but I love creme brulee.
