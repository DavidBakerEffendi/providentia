I am a fries addict. Â Actually I'm a general potato addict but french fries are my favorite form. Pomme Frites has yummy fries and a huge list of dips. My favorites are the dill mayo and the mexican ketchup. I also like some malt vinegar which you can get at the end of the line. But I hate the layout - so cramped and tiny! Also very few cramped tables in the back. That doesn't stop me from going there for my fry fix but it sucks nonetheless.
