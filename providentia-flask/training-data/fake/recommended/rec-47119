This was one of my favorite dinning experiences-EVER. The atmosphere is wonderfull. Service was attention and knowledgebale. The food was fatastic. Bring a big appetite though. There was more wonderfull food then I had room for. The set price is perfect and the salad bar was one of the best in the city.
