I love this place I wish they were participating in restaurant week this week would have saved me the horrible experience I had last night at sorella! But the service is always attentive and good even when there busy the servers seem to help one another so the balls not dropped. I'm always more then satisfied with food and the great sized portions. Would definitely recommend! I love there rose pasta and chicken and gnocchi. As well as the amazing garlic bread!
