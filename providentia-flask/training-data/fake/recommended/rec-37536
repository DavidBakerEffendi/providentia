We live around the corner and have been there 4 or 5 times, with our kids.  The place is a welcome addition, nice enough decor and ambiance.  BYO is a plus of course.  The service has generally been good and the staff has been accomodating with respect to the little ones. The food is good, very good sometimes but not spectacular.  The flattened chicken though is the best chicken dish I have ever had and I would come here just for that.  Pasta dishes are also very good, the bolognese dish is superb and filling.  The kids love the steak. It ends up being fairly expensive for what it is, tonight the check was $100 for one salad, steak, chicken, pasta dish, one side (cauliflower) and 2 sorbets. It would be nice if they added a few specials to mix things up a little for the regulars. We will keep coming because it's a nice place in the neighborhood which accomodates kids and is pretty good, oh, and the chicken is spectacular.
