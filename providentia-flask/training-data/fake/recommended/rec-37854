We love this place, everything about it is top notch. The food, the service and ambiance can't be beat. We went last night and had another great experience as they never disappoint. We were met by the cheery hostess and told we have a short wait so off to the bar we went to order some drinks and look over the menu. The wait was not long and got seated by one of the many windows and ordered a few small plates to start. Two of my favorites are the Eggplant Parmesan which is the best I've ever had, the sauce is so good and fresh you want to spoon it up and not leave any on the plate. We also order the Veal and Ricotta Meatballs they arrived hot, moist and full of flavor. We tried something new this time with the fried Risotto that was a big hit. We ordered a couple of pizzas to share with my all time favorite the Kennett. I dream of this pie with the oven roasted crimini, shiitake and oyster mushrooms mozzarella bechamel, roasted onions and rosemary. Also ordered was the Diavolo, with sopressatta, mozzarrella, cruched tomato, chili flakes, oregano and parmesan. This also was something new for us this time around and it was delicious as expected with everything at Zavino. Can't wait to go back, always a great spot for a intimate meal or a cheery place to meet up with friends.
