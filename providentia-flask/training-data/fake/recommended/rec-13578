Unfortunately I was TOO drunk to remember if I got beef, chicken or lamb. Another place my friend recommended. Everytime we went to eat I'd always say, "when are we going to get halal?" My NY friends were definitely getting annoyed. Went after the club up the one with a shorter line. My NY friends were just telling me how the 2 carts are the same but the stupid tourists always go to the one with the line cause they don't know. "the bags are the same!" that's what they say... All I remember was my friend telling me that the hot sauce and garlic sauce was all I needed. I vaguely remember him telling me how spicy it was, but I didn't remember cause I had one too many vodka on the rocks. I drenched 1/8 of my plate in the got sauce. Later my mouth was on fire. I don't know what level of scoville it is but it's def spicier than King Taco salsa roja. Less flavor but more spicy! Like I said, wish I could remember the actual taste. I just remember enjoying it at 4am!
