I ate there during restaurant week and had a total of 10 items from the various menu selections. None were standouts, the chicken was dry, the jamon was serrano not Pata Negra, and the lauded "Bomba" rice lacked salt(otherwise good). I think the place is over hyped and for the price paid, and the food does not hold up. Perhaps lack of quality control in the kitchen... On the other hand, the specialty gin and tonic was amazing.
