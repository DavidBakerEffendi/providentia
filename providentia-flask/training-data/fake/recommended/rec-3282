This place...I ate a roast pork sandwich from here. Well, I ate half of it because I thought it would be a bad idea to finish it. The pork looked like thinly sliced ham, but something didn't look or feel quite right about it. A few hours later my stomach starts to feel terrible. I drank some tea hoping it would help me feel better. It didn't and I puked up that sandwich like nobody's business. Gross, I would never eat meat from this place. The dessert list looked great though. Too bad they ran out of all of it except for the cookies.
