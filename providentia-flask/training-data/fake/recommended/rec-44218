Do you like cake?  I like cake.  Let's eat cake.  Let them eat cake...we all eat cake.  mmm. On top of the fact that they make the best cake ever...Mirabelle's has a tasty lunch and coffee if you want to take a break (or fuel up) before shopping on Church street.  The ingredients are fresh and not overdone...no preservatives here.   Back to cake.  You can't go wrong.  Almond layered cake covered in fabulous thick chocolate ganache or yellow cake with lemon curd and raspberry filling and buttercream icing.  I loved their cake so much ... they made my wedding cake.  Surprise, surprise...I now have another reason to love Mirabelle's.  Had a hard time choosing a flavor so Allison said have all three...and I did.  A picture of this fabulous work of gastric art can be found in my pictures. Excuse me...another piece of cake please!
