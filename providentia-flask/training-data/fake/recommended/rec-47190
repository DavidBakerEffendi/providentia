Umami burger probably once in a life time thing. The hype on this place is overrated. I ordered the manly burger here and it was very greasy, i felt like throwing up down to my last 3 bites. I also ordered their cheesy tater tots which supposedly is not on the menu, its on their Â secret menu (something like that), but I thought it tasted very good, but they gave too little. Overall experience I would say ehh. Would I come here again :\ ehh not really.
