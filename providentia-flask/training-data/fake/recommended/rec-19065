Jadis is a gem.  Although it's on Rivington, it's tucked away at the far east end of the block away from the madness.  The atmosphere is relaxed, unpretentious, and, dare I say, "adult." For such a cozy little place, Jadis is surprisingly great for large groups.  They accommodated my reservation for 18 people at 8pm on a Saturday night.  Marissa, our server, was SO nice, and so gracious with such a large group of people.  They seated us with only a couple people being there, and had no problem with people arriving late or leaving early.  We were seated near the back area at a large wooden table (actually two pushed together) with stools.  For groups of 10 or so, the leather couches in the back are a great option. The wines are very good and very affordable, and the quiches and paninis are spot-on.  Everyone who came loved the restaurant and said they would be back.  I also recommend going for happy hour if you can make it there between 5-7 on Tues, Weds, or Thursday.
