We met some friends here on a Friday night. The place is very attractive and the staff was warm and friendly. All the food was delicious and looked pretty to boot. I talked everyone into the fresh grilled sardines, and they Â were as good as I have had in my travels.................A great location for bar hopping either before or after dinner.
