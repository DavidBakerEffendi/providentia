We were very pleased with our first foray into Serbian cuisine. Kafana did an excellent job explaining the menu, which is meat and onion-centric. The grilled veggies were perfect. Lamb stew was super tender. They charged us $15 to cork our wine. Nothing stellar, but solid home style Serbian cooking.
