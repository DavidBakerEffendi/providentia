Amazing sushi. My favorite is the female scallop which is in season only may- October. It tastes like Uni but better. I felt like sometimes the chef put salt on the sushi when it doesn't need it. The fish is already salty so it made it even saltier. Or sometimes the sushi would have too much wasabi. The sushi is still good and fresh though.
