Mirabelle's used to be an above-average bakery with really good croissants. No more. They now have compulsory waitron service, but the service is slow and indifferent. The croissants are not flaky, but more like muffins cleverly shaped like a croissant. The tea is weak, even with a double dose of leaves. I don't go there anymore.
