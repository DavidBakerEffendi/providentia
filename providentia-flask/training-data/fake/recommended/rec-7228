Was looking for a place for dinner and came about this place. So a friend and I decided to start our barhopping night here. We came around 8:30-9pm and it was packed with people. Many people come here because it is inexpensive so I can see why it was packed. It was also extremely loud that it was hard to talk, but I guess what else can you expect. Â We were debating whether or not to stay or not, but after finally deciding to wait, one of the waiters found seats for us near the window bench. We both got beers, fires, and bistro burgers. I would say that my burger was good - wished it was a little more rare for medium rare - but nonetheless it was still good. However, the fries were just meh. They weren't hot and tasted like frozen ones you buy at the supermarket. Overall, this place is ok. It was extremely loud and the people who hang out here aren't so nice. Lots of pushing and apparently people's need to find a place to sit overtakes their ability to be polite. Anyways - our bill came and ended up paying more than expected. Note there is a $5 service fee at the benches/tables.
