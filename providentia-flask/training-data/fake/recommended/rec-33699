I've been here three times for brunch and it is always good.  The english muffins and scones to start are a must. The oyster egg benedict type dish is my favorite.  The crepe special is good, too.  French toast is perfect and the sausage is the best around.  I've also been twice for dinner and the beer list is impressive and the Aviator cocktail is delicious.  Mussels and french fries were great, smoked trout salad was delicious, hamburger was awesome and even the brussel sprouts were yummy.  Great restaurant, great atmosphere.
