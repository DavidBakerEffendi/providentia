My wife and I have often wandered past this corner location on our way to Atlantic terminal, and over the past few years it has been at least two different bars/restaurants. The other day we decided to check out the latest incarnation, Aita, for at least a drink. The space is really cozy, with a solid marble L shaped bar and laid back atmosphere. My wife had a cocktail and I had an IPA. We got there at the right time as the bar filled up soon after we took our seats. Having perused the menu over my beer, I decided to try the oxtail ravioli and my wife had a side of her favorite veggies, Brussels sprouts. My ravioli was really good and we both really liked the Brussels in a dash of balsamic. After another IPA we left and the place was really buzzing, with not a seat left at either the bar or the tables. The place was well staffed with attentive servers. We really liked Â the place and will definitely go back. It is good to see new neighborhood places taking off and I think this place will continue to do really well in the area.
