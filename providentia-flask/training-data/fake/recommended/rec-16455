Ahh soo good. Especially on a cold winter day. Here's what you do: Go during lunch, as early as you can, before it gets crowded, this way you are guaranteed super fresh broth and noodles. Walk in the cold to the restaurant. You will be craving for a even a sip of hot broth. Bring no more than 2 friends. It is extremely cramped. Don't expect good service. If you don't expect it, you won't get pissed off. They don't expect to make that much tip anyways. Get the really great dumplings! They are juicy on the inside, yet crispy on the outside. Get the Cucumber "Salad" (not sure what they officially call this). They kind of chop/smash the cucumbers and then toss it in garlic, soy sauce, vinegar, and maybe a little hot sauce. I like to eat this with the soup noodles, it kind of refreshes your mouth since it's cold. Get the Beef and Beef Tendon Soup, and choose to get it with Wide Noodles. If you come early, the tendon is SO TENDER, and the wide noodles are chewy yet soft. Let the noodles soak a little bit to get some of the flavor of the broth. Add mucho cilantro and the hot sauce (really great when its fresh, I love the sesame seeds and I especially like to add mostly the oil). Dig in! Preferred way of consuming the noodles is to use your spoon, get some broth, and then add noodles to the spoon using your chopstick- this creates less splashing opportunities...your neighbors will thank you. Don't forget to take the opportunity to bask in the enjoyment of eating authentic hand pulled noodles.
