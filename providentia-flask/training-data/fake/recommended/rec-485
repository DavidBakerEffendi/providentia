Corner Bistro's been one of my favorite joints in the city for a long time. After trying some subpar burgers around the city, I decided it was time to go back to what I knew. They've raised their prices since the last time I was there but at $8, the Bistro Burger is still one of best values around for a burger. Though I would avoid it at certain times cuz of the crowds. When I'm in the mood for a burger, I want it quick so I wouldn't go there on a Thursday or Friday night. Sunday afternoon is not a bad time to go. Â I was able to find a seat without having to wait. The burger was great as always but my McSorley's mug had lipstick marks on it. That's gross. Who knows where those lips have been besides my mug? I can overlook a lot of things for the sake of taste but not dirty plates or glasses. 4 stars for food 2 stars for cleanliness
