What a nice little find!  It is a bit out of the way (another 5+ minutes after getting off the 1 train at Christopher St.), but it's so cozy and comfortable that it's worth a trek there.   It's dark with wooden tables and chairs, and empty wine bottles adorning some of the shelves.  The waiters were straight-up authentic I-talianos.  I loved the menus - a long sheet of paper attached to a wooden panel of sorts - it almost looked hand-written with a consistent but limited number of selections that all looked appetizing.  The 1/2 carafe of wine options are great for tables that want both red and white but don't want to commit to a bottle of either. The mussels were tasty and fresh with a white wine broth.  The spinach gnocchi with gorgonzola had delicious flavors, but definitely a filling dish.  I was impressed by how good the spaghetti was - kudos to them for being able to execute such a simple dish so well.  I was too jazzed about the special I got - fusilli with shrimp, zucchini and tomatoes - I'm somewhat indifferent when it comes to pasta unless the sauce is stellar, and this was a little bland. Prices were VERY reasonable and we never felt rushed.  I'd love to come back here for another mellow evening meal; I really think the out-of-the-way location helps contribute to the relaxing atmosphere, and the food and wine seem to be consistently good based on my experience and everything I've heard about this place.  Love it!
