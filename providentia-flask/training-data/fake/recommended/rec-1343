This place has great food all around, but the portions are small and some items overpriced. Everything is fresh and well presented, but the service needs some work which is why I took away a star. I've had great experiences here whenever Ben was my server. Parking is difficult, which is why I'm asking myself why do I come back here... Overpriced, no parking, hit & miss service
