Super divey place with an unexpectedly delicious, high quality burger on a paper plate for $7. Beers are cheap and they have McSorley's ale and dark ale for just $3. A great place to eat and drink well on a budget but if you're looking for frills this place has none. If you're sitting in the back, you basically have to give a hairy eye to the server just to get his attention.
