Burnt pizza, anyone? I realize from reading other reviews, that that is actually normal for their pizza but I personally don't enjoy eating charcoal. The pizza was good, but not THE BEST that I've ever had. That's because I found the crust to be thin, bottom to be burnt, and top to be extremely oily. I did enjoy the fact that the pizza was extremely flavorful, and the sauce was fresh and delicious. I would go back to Pepe's if I don't have to wait in line. On this day, we arrived at 12:10 (on a Saturday) and got seated at the very last table. By the time we walked out at 1pm there was a line of almost 20 people. Oh, and an FYI, our waitress reccomended getting a Medium pie for 2 people. I don't know if we looked emaciated or starving, but the medium way way too much. We had 3 slices leftover. So, if you're a party of 2 and have not just gone off a hunger strike, you should see what a small is for comparison.
