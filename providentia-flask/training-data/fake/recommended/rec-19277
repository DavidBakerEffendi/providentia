Sometimes you just need a burger and hand-spun PB&J ice cream! Normally my go to after drinking would be pizza because it takes seconds to come up and it's a eat & walk back to the apt because you are going so tired that you might just fall asleep with pizza in your mouth kind of night. On that note a few months ago I went to a Phillies game and had a few- I was with an avid 5 guys fan and I just had to take him to try these burgers. I think 5 guys is overrated, greasy and bland. These burgers were anything but overrated, greasy and bland. They must use 85/15 chuck because the flavor on the meat was lean but had enough fat to keep your mouth salivating bite after bite. I am a stickler for a good bun and this was toasted and buttered to perfection. The lettuce had a crunch to it and the cheese was melted properly. After we ate the burger I couldn't really fit in the ice cream, but I forced myself to have a spoonful and it was heavenly! I had not had real ice cream in a long time. It almost tasted buttery in texture. TIP: must try and save room for the hand spun of the day.
