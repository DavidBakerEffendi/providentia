Rucola certainly has a charming interior and is located on an equally charming block of brownstones. There are ups and downs with this place for sure, but I waver more on the positive side than the negative - Probably between 3.5 and 4 stars. I think it's lovely when it's not too packed and the pastas are usually very well executed and tasty. The cocktails are also quite good, though perhaps not at the level of some of Clover Club's better mixes. The downsides probably come alongside their popularity. I appreciate that they let you leave your phone number and suggest you get a drink around the block at the Brooklyn Inn, or you can go for a stroll and know that they will indeed call you and seat you once you get there. However when it is packed (and it often is, any day of the week), service does get slow and sometimes the food suffers. I hadn't noticed it so much at dinner, but brunch was cheek to jowl and the rigatoni was overcooked. Poached eggs with tomato and parmesan and toast tasted eerily like the rigatoni, or some kind of breakfast pizza. And though we weren't chomping at the bit to eat, the wait for our food was rather larger than the portion size. We even ordered the homemade bread with butter and jam (be warned that this is actually two pieces of toast with the jam already spread - reasonably tasty, I like jam that's not too sweet), but it came at the end of our extensive wait, a split second before our food. It would've been a nice filler with our coffee. I don't harbor any bad feelings for them though because they aren't a bunch of @$$holes, and I think they're still trying to get their legs under them in the course of their surging popularity. I'll give them another couple months before I kick them off my list or move them up.
