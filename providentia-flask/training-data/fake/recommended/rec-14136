I really think this place is overrated and not worth the legendary wait for breakfast (even on a Tuesday).  It may just be my taste buds, but I could care less for the maple butter on the wild Maine blueberry pancakes.  Yes, the wild Maine blueberry pancakes were fluffy.  But I would have preferred 100% maple syrup to complement them.  I have the same problem with the sugar cured bacon.  Its just too damn sicky sweet!  How am I supposed to discern the succulence of the wild Maine blueberries while I am assaulting my tongue with refined sugars.  Of course the wait was long and I cannot justify it based on the goods finally delivered.  I agree that it is a bright, clean and nice place to eat.  And would go there again to purchase their muffins to go.  But if I want a really good pancake breakfast, I am sticking with Jackson Hole diner in Astoria where I get maple syrup with their larger and equally fluffy pancakes, where they serve you a complimentary small glass of fresh squeezed orange juice with breakfast between 6-11 AM, and where I will go home with a lot more money than at the Clinton Street Baking Co.
