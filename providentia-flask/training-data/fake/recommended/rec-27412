Oh, Buvette, how I wish I could eat your walnut cranberry bread for breakfast everyday (photo: yelp.com/biz_photos/buve…).  I like my breakfasts to be savory, but this bread has won me over with it's chewy texture and not-too-sweet honey.  I'm glad they had already run out of croissants by the time I arrived, otherwise I would have missed out on this breakfast treasure. In addition to the bread we also ordered an egg and smoked salmon plate (photo: yelp.com/biz_photos/buve…).  Served with sour cream and toast, the dish was perfect to split between two people along with the bread.  I love smoked salmon, so it was easy for me to fall in love with the plate.  Coffee here was bold and strong, with enough flavor to dismiss any ideas of adding cream or sugar. With its classy interior, delicious pastries and smoked salmon, it makes me wish there were breakfast places like this back home in Las Vegas; I still think about having breakfast here, and look forward to making a return visit.
