Every Restaurant Week I go to the city with my husband to meet up with two of my girlfriends and sample a restaurant that we would never go to if it wasn't Restaurant Week. This time we visited Tequilas. We arrived before 7:00 PM. I was surprised on how elegant the atmosphere was. The bar was quite nice - not over crowded, not too loud, and seemed pretty hip. Unfortunately after 7pm the noise increased and the bar became overcrowded. This was a little irking for us because we were seated at a table close to the bar where two of our party of four was inconvenienced by people creeping into personal space and waiters and other patrons bumping into them as we tried to dine. Overall the experience was good. Food was amazing, as was the bar options - I really liked that fact that my fancy smancy Margarita had rose petals in it.
