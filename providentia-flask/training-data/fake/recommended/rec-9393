Came here for a work lunch while meeting near by.   At 12:30pm the place was empty and we were literally served within 10 minutes of ordering.  For three of us we got the matador combo and there was plenty left over.  Everything was good - I think my favorite were the tostones and the garlic sauce.  Everything else was decent and I would recommend for a quick pretty inexpensive meal.  For Peruvian chicken Mancora on the LES blows this out of the water but if you are near pio pio in midtown don't hesitate to stop in for a meal.
