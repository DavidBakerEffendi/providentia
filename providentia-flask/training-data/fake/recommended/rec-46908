First off, thanks yelp! Yelp led me here and this place didn't disappoint. I came here for brunch on a Saturday. First off, it's BYOB! Enuff said. Secondly, both my food n my friends was a party in my mouth. The service was good. Great options for vegetarians. Loved the location but the place is pretty small. Definitely worth a trip!
