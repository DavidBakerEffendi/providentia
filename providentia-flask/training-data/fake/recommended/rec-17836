One of the best dining experiences I have had. We had a birthday party here few months ago. This is a great place for a group. The wait staff was patient with us. They were able to split the bill into and did not complain about 5 different  credit cards.. The wine list was very good, and it had a reasonable mark up.   My friends and I can't resist coming back again and again for another amazing experience. I try to get out here every few months. I can't live without a steak from Fernandes for very long.
