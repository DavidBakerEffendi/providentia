Ordered a boat load of yummy food for takeout on a Sunday night with my fiance and couldn't be more pleased! We passed Palermo's for over two years always taking a mental note to stop in but we never did. I can most certainly say that we will order from here time and time again. We had the mussels in white sauce, cavatelli with meat sauce and the vodka rigatoni and we were completely satisfied. Great, fast service and delicious food! Cannot wait to eat at Palermo's III again!
