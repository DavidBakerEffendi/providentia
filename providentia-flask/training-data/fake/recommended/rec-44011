Recommended by friends (who joined me on my trip through Philadelphia), Rangoon looks like a "typical" Asian place in Chinatown from both the outside and the inside, but the food is very good.  The staff was helpful and attentive.  I had the delicious Village Style soup and we shared a number of appetizers (the Golden Triangles are very good, and their dipping sauces are unique without being overpowering).  One companion observed that her tofu didn't look like tofu - it had an odd color and shape - but she said it tasted great, so it's just prepared in a different manner.  I am not someone who generally likes Southeast Asian cuisine - or, rather, I usually only find one or two dishes that I want to try since I don't eat seafood and avoid a lot of other common foods from this region.  But the menu at Rangoon is extensive and I could probably go back for a week and not order the same thing more than once.  The chicken mint kebab entree was solid and filling, and I also tried a bite of the pumpkin chicken - pumpkin is not really my thing, but it had a nice heartiness to it and my other friend cleaned his plate, and I was glad to try it.  There are many vegetarian/vegan options, and one friend said that they had even made her vegan 1000 layer bread on a previous visit.  I should also say that I was traveling with luggage and had to meet three different sets of friends (I am not in the city all that often), and one couple had a baby, and the staff never blinked an eye and were totally accommodating.  Parking can be tough - it's Chinatown - but it's worth the visit.  One group of friends had recently moved from Texas and they all said they loved it, it was their first time with Burmese food.
