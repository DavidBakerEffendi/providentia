I used to go to ray pizza's ever since I could remember. My grandfather would always take me there to get a slice sometimes after he picked me up from primary school. Going out of states for university, I soon found that ray's pizza closed down on me when I came back out of the blue. my favorite pizza joint was gone. Bummer. BUT a new place was opening up and I just had to see if it was just as good. Now the place isn't as great as the slice that I had before but the pizzas fresh. The place is much cleaner then the old pizzeria. I will go back as the new shop owners are really nice and the pizza is delish. Would recommend the Â Margarita thin crust. The place however needs more sitting areas. I find that the side counters are hard to accommodate when me and 2 other friends try sit together.
