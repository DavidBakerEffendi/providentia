I used to love Tuptim. Sadly the service and food have gone down in quality quite a bit over the last couple years. My wife and I went a couple of months ago, and they brought out the food, but forgot our plates. We waited about 5 minutes, couldn't flag anyone down (because no one was on the floor) and finally I went over to the serving station to get our own plates. After going there more than 6 times in the last 2 years, this was the final straw. The food is good, although not the best I've ever had, but the one thing that is absolutely fabulous is the coconut soup.
