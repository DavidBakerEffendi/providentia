Had to go and see what they fuss was about. Tried the wings, they were decent. The spicy wasn't that spicy. Also tried a whole porgy special, eggplant salad, a wingbean special, ribs and pork belly/shoulder curry. Nothing was anything beyond decent. Service was solid. We didn't wait because we went at 5 on a Saturday. I want to give it 2 1/2 stars. Â Overall it was pricy. 150 bucks for 4 without drinks. Glad I tried it once but feel no need to go back.
