Ahh McGovern's...the memories of getting nice in between class and Thursday night karaokes and body shots. Alas, we meet again. I recently enrolled back to RU for grad school and this place is just how I remember it 5 years later. The burgers are still phenomenal. the beer cold and the service great. Last time we went a couple of weeks ago, somehow games of flip cup and beer pong ensued in the back. Felt like an undergrad all over again :) The crowd is a mix of RU students, local professionals, local blue collar, and you might even spot a profesor in there once in a while. The bartenders and servers are always nice. One of my fave pubs in Jersey.
