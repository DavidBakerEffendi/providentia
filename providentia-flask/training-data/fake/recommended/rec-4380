If you care about whiskey, you have to visit here (Especially after a full-belly visit to Hill Country BBQ across the street)! Â Didn't try the food, but drinks were great! A vast offering of whiskeys I've never seen before and a smart set of bartenders willing to walk you through the choices and make cocktails exactly to your liking. Even the patrons seem to be nice, we made a few new friends! Will definitely visit again.
