AWESOME. I had a bunch of friends that suggested Tommy DiNic's for lunch. I arrived in Philadelphia at around lunchtime and decided to go and get the famous roast pork sandwich with broccoli rabe and provolone cheese. I didn't realize that there were seats around the restaurant and got in line for to-go. Regardless, it was all good. There were plenty of seats in Reading Terminal Market. The sandwich was good when I first started eating it, but after a while it got a little dry. I love provolone and it was great! I was hungry and I could really only eat 2/3 of the sandwich. Huge sandwich - great food. What more can I ask for?
