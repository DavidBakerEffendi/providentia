I've been here twice and have ordered the cheesesteaks and chicken cheese hoagie. I really enjoy the sandwiches, although they seem to lack the cheesy texture unless you order with whiz. They are generous with the mushroom and onions, and will put any other peppers or condiments you want on it. The lady who works the register is really polite and friendly even when they are packed. If you leave a tip the entire staff shouts out a thank you with your name attached. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in the area!
