Most things on the menu are inexpensive and of a wonderful quality. The sweet potato fries were good and the mayo they came with was delicious- for $3! i also recommend the summer rolls (vegetarian) for $5. My friends ordered a catfish sandwich and shrimp summer rolls. It looked like the catfish to bread ratio wasn't too fair, but they seemed to enjoy the flavors at least. I went here with two friends around 530pm on a Wednesday and it was half full, but around 615p there was a huge group waiting for a table. I suggest getting in early. I would definitely come back here.
