This place is perfect for group dining.  We went for graduation/engagement dinner as a party of 9.   First, they were great about the reservation- I called in March for the May reservation and they had no trouble doing a reservation that far in advance and they then called back the week of the reservation to confirm.  They were great about questions.  They set us up in the back room at a large table with plenty of space so we could all hear one another and we weren't rushed in the least even though people were waiting outside waiting at the end.  All the wait staff were excellent with recommendations.  Also, as the party arrived they just grabbed drinks at the bar and for such a tiny restaurant they really do have great spaces.   We ordered many courses.  The highlights were the indonesian bread appetizer, the chick pea fries, the pate, the beet salad (this was a huge hit), the calamari, the hanger steak and the skate.  We also got dessert which wasn't quite to the same level as the main menu but were still very good- we had the chocolate mint pot (very strong in flavor), the trifle (a little too much whip cream for me but others were happy to help me out) and the peanut butter bombe. Overall the best thing was the range of the menu.  Between varying plate sizes and many options everyone was able to find multiple things on the menu in which they were interested.  Which was ideal for a group dinner.  As the organizer it was great not having to worry about people finding something they liked.  Also, with two bottles of wine and the majority ordering 2-3 courses the total was around 460 which is AMAZING for a non-byob 9 person dinner. I don't think we could have found a better place for a group dinner for graduation weekend.   We ordered
