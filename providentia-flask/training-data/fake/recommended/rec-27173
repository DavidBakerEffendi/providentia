This is our absolute Favorite when we go to NYC!! During our last week in Ny this last thanksgiving holiday, we at here 3 times. I feel sorry for the other Shanghai restaurants in NYC as they will never get us as patrons as we are now lifelong Joe's fans! Their XLB, the yummiest and bestest! Slurp!! The crab ones are good too but if i had to choose, the pork ones are bombastic! Thier steamed dumplings are ono too! During our last visit we ordered the razor clams and they were so delicious, however we ran out of room from all the dumplings we had so we will have to sample them again next time we're in NY... not that we're complaining :) ! The wait is long yes, but it's worth it for perfection. Cheap and Delicious! We love you Joes!
