One of, if not THE best burger i have ever had. This is a burger mans dream! I always roll with the double patty, BBQ sauce, fried onion and bacon and an order of the fries. Dude....... It's making me hungry right now writing this review. Smashburger got nothing on this IMO. The fries are great, fresh cut, remind ya of boardwalk fries. Man, simply the best. Service is always good, place is pretty clean. No complaints from me.
