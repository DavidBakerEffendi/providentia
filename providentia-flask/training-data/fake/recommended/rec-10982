When 3 out of 4 of us arrived last night, the hostess sternly told us to not linger because their is a reservation after us in two hours and that we must order everything at once.  So that was off putting to begin.  The server never really talked to us, suggested how much to order, considering it is a tapas restaurant.  Service was unpleasant and jaded.  The only thing that saved the dining experience was some of the food.  Burruta with potatoes and onion broth was incredible with deep flavors.  Chilled shrimp with zucchini pancake was fun and the fluke crudo/ceviche was fantastic.  Goat with avocado and blackened beets were not memorable.
