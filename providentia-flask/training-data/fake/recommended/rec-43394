UPDATE: This is the lesson in which a Salt Creek Grille employee learns not to send rude messages to the customers. Interestingly, I left one of the better reviews on here. If said employee has a bone to pick, he or she might try reading the reviews to understand why people are indifferent about the restaurant. I would also recommend a trip to Google if you don't understand the content of someone's review. And remember, you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar -- or don't they know that in Salt Creek Grille's kitchen? I'll be saving my expense account dollars for Mediterra, Mezzaluna, Elements, Witherspoon Grill, Ajihei, and Blue Point.
