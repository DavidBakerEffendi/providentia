I stopped by here after work on Friday to have a quick drink and then meet my friends at another bar. the atmosphere is really great and very relaxed. I had a fantastic pino nior and was so happy there that i told my friends to come and meet me! I had the bbq pork panini and salad which was exactly what i was looking for. we had so much fun (and the wine was so good) that we stayed until closing. 100% recommend Â Figs to anyone in the Herald Square area who is looking for good wine and good food.
