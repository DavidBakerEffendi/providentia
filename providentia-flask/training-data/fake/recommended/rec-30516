Food and service were wonderful!   I would absolutely go back.  I could have easily given the restaurant 4 stars but we were seated between two other two tops and they were so loud.  Our romantic dinner turned into a therapy session for the couple to my left who had too much to drink and kept getting served.  The girl was completely obnoxious and should have been cut off. Food - excellent Service  - great Would I return?  Absolutely!
