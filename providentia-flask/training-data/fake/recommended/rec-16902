I was In town visiting from Los Angeles and stopped in for a late lunch at Matthew's. The staff was extremely friendly and my lunch was delicious. I had the Harvest salad with chicken and a mojito. The salad was fresh and crisp and was served in a huge portion, enough for two people. It was a great lunch and I will definitely be returning for a dinner soon.
