Food: I ordered Bhuna. It was pretty good. A little bit on the gingery side for me, but my taste buds adjusted perfectly fine to it.   Under the clay oven options, be aware it does not come with the rice.  You must pay an additional $5 for the rice or bread.  My friends were a little confused with that because the menu was not clear about it.  The price was on the higer end for its venue. However, you are compensated for the portion size.  I had enough leftover for lunch the next day. Service: Good.  They were very friendly.  Even after the $5 mixup over the additional rice because of the confusing menu, they were very polite in answering our questions and helping us understand.  They were attentative in asking us about our meals and so fourth, but they did forget the pitcher of water we asked for.  Its ok, we forgave them it wasnt a big deal to us.  But  they were friendly and looked happy to be there. Atmosphere: Very crowded! The eatting area is small and tables were too close to each other.  I didn't really pay attention to the others eatting around me, but Im sure if your sensitive to the noise and can't tune out your surroundings, it will get to you. Those who were waiting to be seated were standing by the door.  The restroom was located near the waiters area. As i was waiting to use it, waiters were inputting their orders and there was a curtain seperating the cooking area and waiter area.  Very busy and I was trying not to get in their way, but it was small so I obviously was. I havent really been to alot of restaurants serving Indian food so I can't be too judgemental about the food. I would definitly try the food again.  For the most part I enjoyed my meal.  However,the dining experience was ok.
