The best Vietnamese hoagie in the city. Please get it through the bakery and not the restaurant. So this place makes it's own french bread. With that in mind, I love Banh Mi- but this place is far superior to the others. To Do: BBQ Pork Banh Mi Â with hots Fried Egg Rolls Cost 5.50, but the experience is priceless. They also have like 2 large round tables if you wanted to eat in. Plus, they have parking if you don't live in the area!
