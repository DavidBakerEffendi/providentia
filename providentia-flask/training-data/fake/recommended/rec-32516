I loved the E.T.C! I will definitely be coming back here. I must say I was torn between all of their scrumptious-sounding menu options. I ended up going for the somewhat classic M7 sandwich (turkey, swiss, cranberry, arugula, dijonnaise) which was nothing short of delightful. Very fresh and tasty. Enough about me though. Not only does this place serve some of the best coffee in Brooklyn, its range of imported beers and exotic sandwiches/meals is drop-dead delicious. To top it all off, the atmosphere is laid back and the bar woman is charming. 5 stars for a 5-star establishment.
