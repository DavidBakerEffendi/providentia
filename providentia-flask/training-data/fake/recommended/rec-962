Oh my goodness this place is just delicious! We went here twice in one week when my parents came to stay. The best gluten free pasta and delicious Italian dishes. Not only was the food great, but the service knocked my socks off (so to speak). I will say, the gluten free ravioli dish is quite small, i think there was only about 8 pieces of ravioli in there so you may want a starter or a side. Leave room for dessert though because their desserts are delicious!
