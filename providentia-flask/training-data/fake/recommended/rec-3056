Landmarc is a classy restaurant. There were ten in our party. We reserved a table by the window, overlooking the city. There was plenty of sitting and eating room. No one was knocking elbows. Because the table was round in shape, it was so easy to see and talk to everyone in our group. Most importantly, great acoustics!, therefore, no yelling at each other. The service was exceptional. All entrees arrived hot and at the same time. Servers were courteous and did not rush us at any time during the evening. A lovely place to celebrate a special occasion. NYC at its finest!
