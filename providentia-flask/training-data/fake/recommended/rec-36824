I've been here quite a bit so of course my experience changes but not at all drastic. The service is good during brunch and dinner. It's always too busy for me to have dinner at the table section (without reservation) so I go to the bar section which I enjoy. It's more relaxing and less formal. Their Kafta is to die for- can't help getting it all the time. And the halumi - it used to come with more rice (which I thoroughly enjoyed) and now it's mostly veggies/squash covered in cheese. But it is good! Their brunch menu is quite delicious. Their regular coffee I could do without and the Lima bean plate too. But all in all, it's worth going over and over again. Our bill is never less than 90.00 for two people but you will leave satisfied. Oh and their dessert- the candy bar especially is really delicious. I'm sure you'll like it. Why not give a 5? I am only a fan.
