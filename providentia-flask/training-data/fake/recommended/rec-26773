This place has def lost the nostalgic ambiance it once had since moving into the new location on chapel street.  They have delirium tremens on tap which is pretty much unheard of so that's def a +. I ate the marinated chicken sandwich and it was really good with a side of the famous frites and they were just as good as I always remember them being.  I don't know if they are trying to cater more toward the "Yalie" crowd by moving onto chapel but the prices have definitely  increased substantially.
