Dinner Review - Groupon. Maybe I had a better experience because I went during the week when there was only one other table with people eating. I like the decor - reminds me of my time in morocco. The food was really good and our server actually explained everything on the menu that we couldn't pronounce which was great and really helpful. We had the appetizer platter which I loveddd. And for my entree I had the filet mignon kebab. The kebab was a little dry but the yogurt sauce was absolutely amazing. One of the best I've had for sure. I do remember it being expensive so I'm not sure that I would come here without a groupon though.
