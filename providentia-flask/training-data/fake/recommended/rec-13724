This is a GREAT falafel place. I've had middle eastern food as authentic as it gets (thanks, dad), and this place is just as good. The falafels are very well priced and come with the fixins - lettuce, tomato, tahini, etc. There is a tiny bit of seating inside and some outside, but it's more of a grab-and-go sort of place. I did try their stuffed grape leaves after having two falafel events already in a days time, and I wouldn't recommend them. They didn't have all that much flavor and I didn't really care for the texture. BUT, all you need is falafel.
