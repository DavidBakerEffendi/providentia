Great, friendly service.  Some wonderful pasta.  We had the gnocchi lasagna which was the main reason we went.  It was well worth it.  We also had the apricot spinach salad and the mac and cheese special that had broccoli and bacon in it.  A really good choice if you want great pasta and a nice owner to talk to.
