There is nothing about this meal I disliked. The ambience of the restaurant was tremendous, with lovely wooden tables, plus leather banquettes, thoughtful dim lighting and a gracious hostess. I will say our waitress was a bit of a ditz and probably is an artist this or that who is waiting to makes ends meet, but whatever. The drinks were great, I had a delish Old Fashioned with one monster ice cube. They had a very pleasant chardonnay by the glass as well. For the meal I got the mac and cheese to start which was sublime with pieces of tasty pork something or other. So rich but so good. I entreed with the Pork Duo, which was porkbellies and pork tenderloin. Both were expertly prepared. I also had a bite of the chicken entree served atop red braised cabbage; a perfect combo and as someone who never orders chicken at a restaurant, this chicken was sublime. Two thighs, expertly braised and roasted with a perfect crispy skin.
