My husband and I were visiting some friends in Burlington and they took us to San Sai.  Our experience and food was good enough to write about, even though we're not likely to visit Burlington again for a little while.  When we do, we'll definitely request a return visit to San Sai.  The owner/chef served us our sushi lunch.  He was pleasant, friendly and informative.  My husband LOVED the fact that they had root beer on offer (most sushi places, for some reason, don't).  I love that they have REAL WASABI!  My volcano sushi plate was not only spectacular to look at, but every bite was pleasurable.  The salmon skin hand roll is amazing as well.  Can't say enough good about San Sai.  It was a perfect dining experience.
