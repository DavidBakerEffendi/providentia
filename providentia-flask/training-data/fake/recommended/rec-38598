Everything was vegetarian, and the vegan items were clearly marked. I ordered the vegan duck. There was way too much duck and hardly any sides. There was sliced yam instead of mashed; it was fine but it would have been nice to know about the substitution. My friends ordered the lasagna and a dinner salad which both looked delicious and fresh. The strawberry short cake was light, creamy, fresh, and the thin layer of dark chocolate encasing the entire cake pushed the desert over the top into decadence. The staff were friendly; I would go there again for the buffet or a different dish.
