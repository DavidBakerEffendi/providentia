This place was a breath of fresh air during a recent trip. After a few days of heavy foods, the light but filling dinner here was excellent. The staff was very friendly and the whole family was able to find something they devoured (even my one and four year olds). If I lived in New York, I would be a regular. Healthy and tastes awesome. If I had any criticism, it would just be that I wish they had high chairs, but laps worked fine and it didn't make us enjoy it any less.
