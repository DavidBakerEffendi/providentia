It's very pretty, but that's about it.  Small portions with even smaller flavor.  I got the Pad See Eew w/chicken and it tasted like warm noodles.  Very bland.  It's probably a good place to take a first date, assuming they don't know anything about Thai food... but then, why even date him/her? ;)  I wanted to like you Room Service, I really did.  It wasn't me -- it was you.
