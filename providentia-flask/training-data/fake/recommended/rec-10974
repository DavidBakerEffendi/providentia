The restaurant opens at 4:00 pm, got there at 3:55 and told it will be about a 1:15 wait for a table. After waiting 2:15 we were finally seated. We ordered the Brooklyn Crab Royale for 2 and waited another hour. For the price this place charge, they should offer bread for the table and if the dish is for two people you should give two piece of corn on the cob and not one small 1/4 cob.The food was good but the price and wait was rediculous. Don't think I will be going back to this place unless they tweak the price a little. City Island is still the best place for great seafood.
