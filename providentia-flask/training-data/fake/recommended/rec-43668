I came to NYC this past weekend to attend a friend's wedding. Accustomed to SF's foggy days, I couldn't imagine eating anything greasy when the weather is muggy, hot and oh so humid. Thank goodness for Japanese. This was our last meal before returning to the Bay Area. It was a Sunday and Onya a block up was closed. We ventured out here, and overall, it was good, but nothing special. Service was okay, although a bit slower (and it wasn't even THAT busy). We had ordered deep fried oysters, appetizer kimchee, and 3 bowls of udon (1 deep fried bean curd and 2 nabeyakis). The noodle was just aiiiight, nothing too special (unlike Onya's which had an awesome consistency and texture), and compared to store-bought packages, in my opinion. Is the noodle even housemade? I don't know. If you want great udon, I would go to Onya a block up. A udon house needs an excellent signature udon, and I'm afraid to me, Udon West's noodle was not of quality, and fell short of great.
