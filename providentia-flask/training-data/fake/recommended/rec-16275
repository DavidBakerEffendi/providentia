A great new spot in Astoria for real Italian + a friendly atmosphere.  My husband + I try new places often and if we return, it's a great sign.  We've been back 4 times since they opened and each time the food, wine + service were great!  They even accommodated a 7 person party with ease and only a small wait at the bar - where a friendly bartender offered me a few tastes of red so I could decide on a favorite. The risotto (the flavors rotate) has been amazing on two occasions.  It's by far the largest portion of an entree available.  A friend did find the ravioli entree portion to be on the smaller side but that doesn't bother me at good restaurants since it's a good match when ordering both appetizers + dessert as well.   Speaking of which, Vite has made me a believer in Tiramisu - which I have never enjoyed before tasting their version!  Order it. My favorite from the start were the small glass tumblers used for wine.  It's a sweet touch and realistic one since the venue + tables are cozy.   The striped cloth napkins got me too, which all ties into an authentic Italian restaurant + a class act addition to Astoria.  Thank goodness for Vite!
