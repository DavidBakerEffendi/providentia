I've been here a few times but each time was just okay. I think this place tries to hard to be trendy and though it's got some of the look down in the interior of the restaurant, the outside could use a lot of work. Also, the vibe, lighting, and music need help. It's sort of trite and not very original to see a restaurant repeat what it's predecessors have already been doing for years. The food was really just average. I have always ordered only vegetarian dishes and have found the portions to be less than other places and not as tasty. For example, some dishes are overly spices to make up for lack of flavor otherwise. Others are salty but generally bland. I think the dessert of kulfi and ice cream inside the orange peel looks cool but tastes disgusting. All in all, this place is just average masked as being high end and amazing. The prices are also through the roof.
