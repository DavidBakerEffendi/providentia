much better this time, sorta fan fan i wish they had the chilean sea bass, but sadly they did not...and i got something "similar".......... the rock shrimp tempura app was no bueno, the grilled shrimp with lime/chile sauce or w/e....was soso at best...... sadly, another B- experience there. the service on the other hand was excelente!
