Oh this place is wonderful.  I'd never even heard of their CT Lobster Roll which is lobster meat cooked in butter and served in a delicious roll. Oh jesus, it is so good.  Their regular lobster roll is also great.  And you can buy lobster there and they steam it for you for $1 and then you can eat it there.  I mean, hello!  Amazing!  I went to college in Maine and this is best lobster I've ever had.  No joke.  Their lobster stew and lobster mac n cheese are great also but are like belly bombs.  Make sure you eat those as a rare treat, they're probably 2,000 each.  Which is also probably why they are so absolutely delicious.
