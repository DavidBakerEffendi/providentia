I was with a group of friends on a Saturday night... DJ was okay. It's pretty spacious and a cute place for happy hour. However, what really made me rate this place with 1 star was their service. It took them nearly an hour to bring the food out.. The waitress said they had a lot of orders in the back.. But UHM, we were the only people in the bar eating so what ORDERS? Worst thing about it all is that one person from our group had to tell the waitress to cancel his order because his wings (mind you, this is a bar.. wings should be flowing out of the kitchen every 2 mins) had still not been brought out even after an hour of ordering. Let me just mention, more people from our group ordered wings and their order would come out immediately (5-10 mins after they ordered). This place is just terrible service. Good thing they charged us separately and didn't add the 20% group gratuity because they did not deserve a tip after the terrible service they provided. I was highly disappointed and I will make sure to never come back to this place.
