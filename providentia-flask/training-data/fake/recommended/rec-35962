Had lunch here and got the trout served over lentil salad, it was cooked perfectly and the presentation was awesome. Service was top notch, and the drinks were also very good. Had the blueberry mojito, one of the best mojitos I've ever had. Also recommend the cheese sampler as an appetizer, you won't be disappointed. As far as the actual location, it was very comfortable, and the decor was very nice. Will definitely be back again.
