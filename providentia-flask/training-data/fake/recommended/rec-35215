I've been coming here for a while and they recently renovated the place.  The katsu pork curry is one of the best in the city.  The pork portion is decent, but they give you alot of soft japanese sticky rice and the curry sauce.  They also give you free shredded cabbage salad as an appetizer which you can keep asking for more.
