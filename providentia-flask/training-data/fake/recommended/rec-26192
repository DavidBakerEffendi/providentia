We ordered the Original and Truffle Burgers. The bun:meat:toppings ratio was perfect on both. Make sure you eat your burger fast though or else all the juices from the meat will make your bottom bun soggy. It is kind of strange to not find any crunch in the burger though. Sure, the meat has a nice sear on it, but the burger itself is missing a crisp lettuce. Overall, I didn't find the burger to be anything special, aside from the "U" printed on top (A+ for marketing!) The FRIES on the other hand, are to die for. It's very rare to find thin crispy fries at a burger joint and even rarer to find thin crispy fries that have flavor and aren't burnt to a crisp! The fries were actually perfect without any sauce. I grabbed em by the handful. JUDGEME, NYC. If you insist on a sauce though, the jalape√±o ranch is by far the best.
