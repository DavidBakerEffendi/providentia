This place is great and probably the best "true" street cart food in the city.  If there's a line, just go across the avenue to the other chicken and rice cart.  It's owned by the same people and they wear the same shirts.  However, one seems to be have been deemed the "original" which holds the long lines while the other one is much more reasonable of a wait.   Hot sauce is awesome...but beware, it's QUITE POTENT so don't use it liberally.
