We love coming to this bar!!! Great neighborhood pub! Much better prices than the Shannon rose down the street! Really cool, attentive bartenders, especially Jill. Â Fun place. Mostly dudes, though. So if you're a guy looking to pick up single ladies it might not be the scene. More of a chill w close friends or a significant other place. Not a pick up joint. Good food too and amazing specials on food and beer!! $6 pitchers. Great shot specials. Can't beat it!
