I thought the chicken here was quite yummy. I've eaten fried chicken all over the place and this stuff here was quite delicious. I got the mashed potatoes too, with some gravy on it. MMM MMMMM! Actually just typing this makes my mouth water and I'd like to go back, but the problem is they don't take reservations, so we know the chances of me going here are very slim, unless it's maybe in the summer, so I can put my name down on the list and wait around outside or something. Or maybe someone wants to wait here for me? That would be nice? Let's go...you're waiting....
