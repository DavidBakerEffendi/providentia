This place had some of the best Malaysian food I've ever had. Almost everything on their menu is good. If you don't know Malaysian food, the menu doesn't help much so you just have to pick a few things. Don't worry because its going to be good. The inside of the restaurant is really clean and nice looking. The staff were very polite, but a lot of them didn't speak English. The portions were very large and I couldn't even finish my squid in black sauce. Its a bit on the pricey side, but definitely worth it.
