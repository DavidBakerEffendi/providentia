LOVE THIS PLACE! There are soooooooo many different kinds of pancakes and breakfast dishes to pick from for a really great price. You can pick from chocolate, strawberry, blueberry, banana, cinnamon, ginger bread, pumpkin, german, buttermilk, apple.... any kind you can imagine really, and they all come with any kind of topping too! AND they are HUGE pancakes! They have any kind of side you can imagine. This place should have been called the ultimate pancake house lol I love their strawberry stuffed crepes, omelets and blueberry pancakes. Actually, I LOVE EVERYTHING I have ever eaten from this place! lol All of their plates come in huge portions and their breakfast potatoes are to die for!! This place is set like a diner and its probably as big as one too. Â  Service is always friendly and the place gets packed. So get there early to beat the rush!! Though it gets packed, I can honestly say I have never waited more than 15 minutes to be seated. Definitely try this place out!!
