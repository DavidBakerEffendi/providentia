Open Door is a much needed addition to the neighborhood. My husband and I stumbled upon this gem a few months ago - the food is fabulous and the beer/wine menu is quite extensive - plus reasonable! The atmosphere is great for drinks, date night or a group of friends. The design and decor is very cozy and embraces LIC - love the Pepsi sign replica! In addition to the bar and main dining area their is a large private room in the back where we wound up hosting our rehearsal dinner. The chef/owner, Nick, worked with us to create a custom food and drink menu. The the staff was attentive and the food was a hit! Highly recommend checking it out!
