I came in here with a buddy for the first time recently and had the pulled pork and the brisket. It wasn't bad, but being from Texas I was not impressed with it at all. I felt that is was mediocre and I know you can put your own BBQ sauce on your sandwich, but I prefer for them to have a little more than what they gave me when it comes to the table. The fries were really good, but I was not a huge fan of their beans. The beer was decently priced by the pitcher and the atmosphere is very open and nice. The waitress was really friendly and also really attentive! Would like to come back and try some of their other food and hopefully edit my review! Oh the sliders and HUGE so if you want a decent amount of food with a few different meats I would suggest these.
