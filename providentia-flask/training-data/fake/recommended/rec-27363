Excellent for the price, excellent taste, excellent New York experience for people who have not had Halal food before.  Put on some white sauce, a touch of hot sauce and there's no way you can't like it!  The hot sauce is hot, but adds so much flavor that you shouldn't not put it on.  My favorite part about this cart over any other cart is the fact you get to put on your own sauces, if more carts did that I'd be very happy!  So stand in line, or go to the south east corner (where it's the same food and less of a line) and order yourself a lamb and rice right now!
