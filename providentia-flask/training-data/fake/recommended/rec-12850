I bookmarked this place back in November, when I wasn't even in New York yet and never even heard any review of this place. Then strangely, a friend of mine came back from NY and tells me all about her time here. I was literally yelling at her to shut up because I was so jealous, hahaha. I loooove love love breakfast, she knows me so well.. Lol. Anyways, so in January after a few weeks of settling in my apartment, my Great Grandma and I finally decided to try this place out after doing some shopping. We walked from where we parked our car... realllly reallly hungry!! And oh.. realllly realllly cold! The wait wasn't sooooo bad like the reviews I've read. I actually think it was less than 45 minutes, like the lady said it would be. And you'd think it'd feel like forever because you're soo hungry right? Lmao. Done w/ the babbling now.... I ordered the banana walnut pancakes, my Great Grandma got the blueberry. If I see a breakfast dish (pancakes, preferably) with bananas, I'm bound to get it. I picked off the walnuts though and ate those afterwards, haha. These pancakes were beyond amazing though. I ordered them again the few other times I've came here with friends. And the blueberry is good as well. I like the taste of the warm maple butter with the banana better, but it still goes good with the blueberry even though it would do good without. My Great Grandma and I also ordered the sugar cured bacon. I love bacon with my pancakes, and this specific bacon was the best I've ever had. Overall, I've loved the times I've been here and when I go back to NY to visit sometime in the near future, I'll MOST LIKELY pick here to go to first. Mmmmm mmm mm!!!!!
