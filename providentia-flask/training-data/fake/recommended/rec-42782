I was excited about having dinner at Employees Only because of all of the rave reviews. If you're going for drinks, then just be warned that they are expensive but delicious and strong, so worth it. However, dinner was terrible. The only thing that was actually tasty was the arrugula salad because of the dressing. We ordered gnocchi, pork chops, and the fish...all terrible. Absolutely no flavor at all. It is amazing that something wrapped in bacon still has absolutely NO FLAVOR! Terrible food!
