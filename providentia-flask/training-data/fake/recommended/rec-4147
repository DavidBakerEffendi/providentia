Looking for a hole in a wall /hidden gem in south philly? This is your place. Mostly frequented by locals, it definitely has that charming bar dive feel. With always plenty of beer, philly sports and food to go around for anyone lucky enough to know of its existence. The food. The food... THE FOOD. ....perfection... I always get the roast pork sandwich with long hots and a side of gravy fries. Today I branched out and had the roast beef with the same configuration. Honestly I have no clue which I like more.....because both are equally appetizing and satisfying. Though parking is scarce (typical south philly). The cozy atmosphere and food make up for it. Oh and the gravy fries. .......do not....DO NOT leave Â without having an order or two...... Oh and BTW NO THEY DO NOT HAVE VEGGIE BURGERS....
