What can I say about this pace?  I've eaten here a few times and it has been consistently average to good every time.  First, the place is something of a relic, it's in a strange industrial area, but they do their best to make you feel like you are along the shore in New England.  The front outside planters are littered with props: lobster cages, oar boats, etc. Once you step inside you seemingly walk into a time machine, the place is very dated, the carpet looks old and the general decor is historic in nature, but that's part of the charm. The seafood is good, I can only speak to the basics.  I'll vouch for the lobster which you can pick out of the tank, clam chowder, lobster bisque, raw oysters, peel and eat shrimp, and the clams casino, all good. If you are looking to watch a Sox or Pats game, eat in the bar.  The bar has about 5 or 6 televisions, but no surprise, they are all old tube televisions and some don't get the best reception, again, all part of the charm.  The bar keeps are all friendly, and they have plenty of draft and bottle beer options, not to mention a full bar for mixed drinks.  Without being too rude, the bar clientele is "interesting", not a lot of people you would want to take home to mom.     If you are looking for an upscale seafood establishment, this is NOT the place, but if you are looking for traditional wannabee New England seafood joint, this will suffice.
