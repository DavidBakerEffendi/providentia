I absolutely loved this place! I am more of an observer than I am an eater so i decided to take my date out to this local restaurant. He ordered white rice, red beans and churrasco!! Yum! At first it was a little bit of a bummer that they can't serve alcohol but they have a great selection of teas which I thought  was kinda cool. Now, the churrasco was about  two feet long !! Seriously two feet! The rice was perfectly cooked, and the beans were absolutely to die for! The service was also very good. I would have totally given it 5 stars if the sangria had some liquor in it. Great Place!!
