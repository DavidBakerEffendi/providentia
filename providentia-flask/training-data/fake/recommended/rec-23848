This place is great.  Their weekend brunch special really can't be beat.  It's bottomless mimosas or unlimited access to a great bloody mary bar with a brunch entree.  When I order this special, my glass is never empty and the food is always delicious.  This place is extra fun to come kick back with friends because they have an offering of board games in the back.  I really don't see anything negative about this sweet spot.
