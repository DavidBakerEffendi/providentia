I was very pleasantly surprised with this restaurant.  It's clean, the tables are not too close together, you can actually hear the convo that is being had at the table (unlike so many other restaurants that are so loud), the food is excellent, and it's a BYOB.  I would recommend the short rib dish and the gnocchi entrees.  Oh- and I liked our waitress.  I couldn't pronounce a couple things on the menu and she helped me in a normal way.  Not like the waiters who try to correct you and give you the eye like they are so much more refined than you, and then you have to give them the all knowing eye like "you are the one waiting on me and you make like $15 an hour" look.  I was happy that it didn't have to go down because I hate showing someone their role when I'm at the dinner table!
