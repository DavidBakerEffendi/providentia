Went to this place because it's owned by Rob McElhenny, and I'm a fan of the show. It's a nice place with lots of seats at the bar, at tables and outside. The draft selection is very good with lots of different reasonably priced types of beers - both domestic and imported. I had the cheesesteak and it was delicious. It was high quality beef which really makes or breaks it. Served with a side of superb thin-cut fries it was more than enough to fill me up; and I'm 6'3'' and skipped lunch that day. Cool pictures and paintings from the show on the walls.
