Be prepared to wait... Â this place is really good! The wait time for a Thursday evening was about 45 minutes and the place is so small. Once seated, our orders were taken and we received our food within 5 minutes. This place is very efficient. I ordered the Totto Spicy Ramen with shredded pork, mushrooms, and an egg. The spicy broth is very tasty and perfect for all you spicy lovers. The egg was cooked a little harder than I would have liked but still did the trick. Ramen was reasonably priced and the portion was perfect! Everything was very tasty. I plan to come back here the next time I'm in Manhattan.
