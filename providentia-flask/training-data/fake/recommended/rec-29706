The only reason this didn't get 5 stars was because of the space. If you come here when it is crowded, get ready for the tight squeeze, especially if you are in a group of 2. Regardless of the space, this food is great! The corn is a MUST and starts off the meal with a perfect tone. In one order you get two corns so its great to share! There is no point to come here if you do not get this! The rest of the food is good, nothing to report home about.  The Cuban is as good as advertised and might be the best in NYC but maybe there isn't a tone of cuban food in NYC... The margarita was surprisingly delicious! The prices were cheap and made the experience even better! This is definitely a great place to try and you will leave satisfied with your meal.  The meal is definitely worth the trip just for the corn.  They also have a take out restaurant next door so if you are just looking for that, you can avoid the sit down meal. Just go, its something different in the city and tastes good!
