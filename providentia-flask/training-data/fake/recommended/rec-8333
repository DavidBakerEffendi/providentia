I was SO HUNGRY tonight and my food took an hour and a half. And I ordered at 5:30 so it shouldn't have been rush hour or anything! I started calling after 45 minutes and kept being told "any moment." When I called after an hour and a half they said "He's downstairs now, he's been calling you" Um...no he had not. I told them multiple times that I live on the side entrance but due to either a language barrier or someone just plain not understanding me, I had to walk two blocks to the other side of the building to get my food from the guy. Who didn't even apologize. And by the way, the food itself was just average, small portioned, and overpriced. And lukewarm. Maybe it's a different story if you eat in, but delivery? NO THANK YOU.
