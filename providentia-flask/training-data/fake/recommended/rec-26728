delivery was fabulous; salad was fine, and the chicken on it was great.  I also still want to give the famous gnocchi a shot -- and wish I had.   But we ordered the cheese ravioli.  And in a city where you can get incredible fresh or frozen ravioli for less at Talluto's...  this was the worst I've ever had.  No question.  The absolute worst.  Filling had no flavor at all, the consistency was more crumbly than creamy, and after two we seriously ate peanut butter and crackers instead.
