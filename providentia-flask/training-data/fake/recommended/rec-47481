Brought to EV earlier this month by my BFF I still can't stop thinking about the salad I ate that night. After about twenty minutes at the bar we scored a great table outside on the patio. We sat in what we thought was the most perfect summer evening in the city with just enough warmth and not too much humidity. We shared house salad and a pasta dish with mixed sauteed veggies and a few or I should say more then a few vodka drinks. The restaurant was quaint yet big enough to not make you feel claustrophobic. Staff was pleasant and was very accommodating but the my highlight was the few conversations I had with regulars having a glass of wine or simple taking a bike ride in their neighborhood.
