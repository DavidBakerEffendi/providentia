I hate to write bad reviews because I have friends in the pizzeria business and know how it can effect it.  That being said I reluctantly write this review, but the rudeness of the man who answered the phone is out of control. I would just brush it off, but I hope the owner reads this and speaks to his staff about proper etiquette when it comes to interacting with customers.  I'm sorry if you hate your job, but that's not my problem. I'm just trying to get something to eat. I asked a question and the guy answered me like I was an idiot. I didn't even finish my order and got off the phone with him and ordered from Bellanotte instead.
