This review reflects my more recent experience here. Sometimes their pizza is the best in town by far, but lately its been doughy, the oregano is spread unevenly, and I think they might have changed their cheese to something lower quality. That said, their sauce is fantastic and when they are on their game you get a great pie and great service. I'll go back soon, but hopefully they figure out how to make their product more consistent because I'd really like to be able to order the pizza I got the first few times I went!
