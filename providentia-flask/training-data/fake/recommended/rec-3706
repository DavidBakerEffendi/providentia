So good!  The pizzas are great, service is good, and they have Dogfish Head 90 Minute on draft - what else do you need? I've been here at least half a dozen times and the food is consistently great.  THe space is beautiful - the decor combines all of the Brooklyn cliches (recycled wood, exposed brick, etc.) but in a way that works.  I only wish they hadn't replaced my favorite West Indian place on Franklin Ave...
