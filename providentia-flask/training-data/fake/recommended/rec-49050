This is an excellent bar. While it certainly has, by far, the best beer selection both on tap and by the bottle in New Haven, it's not simply good for New Haven. Cask Republic could hold its own with just about any other beer bar in any major city. Even though it has an excellent selection of beers on tap--on my last visit I had Dogfish Head 120-Minute IPA and a bacon-flavored beer, it does have a couple of areas that could use improvement (and why I can't give it five stars). While a number of breweries have made it onto Cask Republic's list, most of them come from CA and the Northeast. Some greater geographic diversity would add to the variety. Adding a selection of cask-conditioned ales would fully round out the menu. While the prices are a bit high for New Haven, they're just about worth it for the great beers available. Just don't get any of the more ordinary beers that have sneaked onto the list.
