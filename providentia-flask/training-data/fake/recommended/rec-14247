I was so tired at 3am. Jian, one of my new friends who was staying with us at the hotel wanted to stay and dance. I didn't feel like joining the rest of them at Hop Kee, the Chinese Restaurant that all the Filipinos in the Tri-State area go to. I've never been, I'd love to try it someday, but Christine and Bree wanted Chicken and Rice, Chicken and Rice, they were chanting Chicken and Rice what the hell was this obsession with Chicken and Rice? We met a new friend that night, Jesse and his girlfriend and Jesse told us the best Chicken and Rice place was on 53rd and 6th. Ok first of all, I don't like eating meat unless it's organic, especially chicken, second, I don't eat street food, and third, I don't eat street food. I'm sitting there at 3am with my new Filipino peeps and I have to tell you that it was so good with that yogurt sauce and grease, and lettuce, and grease, plus grease, but it was as satisfying as Indian food,with the grease. Truthfully, I would never do Chicken and rice again, unless I was with my peeps, it's more of a fun group activity.
