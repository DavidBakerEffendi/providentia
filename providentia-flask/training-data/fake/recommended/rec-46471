Hands down the best meal I've ever had!!!! My boyfriend brought me to New York for my first time and asked me what was the one restaurant I really wanted to eat at.....Easy answer Marc Forgione!!! We started out with the Hiramasa Tartare, my mouth came alive it was that good. We also had a salad and ordered the asparagus very, very good. For our entree we both had the Rib eye paired with a red wine and we finished with the fudge brownie with coffee hazelnut ice cream, nutella and cocoa marshmallows paired with a port. Heavenly!!!! The service was fantastic, the decor perfect! The only thing that was missing was Chef, he was out of town that night. I was a bit crushed but we'll be back!!!
