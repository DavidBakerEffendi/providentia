Fries.  Wow.  ::yawn:: Seriously, what can be done to an order of fries that should make it so much better than any other order of fries?  Yes, yes, some places make fries better than others, but not this joint. This place does nothing special with their fries, per se.  They simply offer a large serving of greasy, steak-cut fries in an unusual container. Perhaps it's all in the execution here:  All they serve at Pomme Frites are fries.  One can order the big, bigger, or biggest coneful of oily, nondescript fries along with dozens of different flavored sauces (each at additional charge; all loaded with MSG).  Slathered on the fries, a hungry, oft-drunken patron might not notice the genericness of the product and actually come back for more, or at least write a favorable Yelp.  Eh. They lost me on both counts.   Anyway, the place isn't all bad, if you are totally mad - and not at all picky - about your fries, and don't give a damn about MSG, or your general health, for that matter.  Forget about seating, as there are all of 2 small benches in the back, always full, which will force you to either walk blocks to the nearest park/sitting area whilst the damned fries get cold and soggier than they originally were, or begin eating them on foot as soon as you leave the place.  Neither choice is too appealing, but eh, what are ya gonna do.   So, if you are into novelty eats and not on any sort of diet, check this place out.  Otherwise, skip it. The lousy seating, eating on-foot, commercial sauces, and ordinary fries all add up to a non-memorable eating event.
