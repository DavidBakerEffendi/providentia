OVERRATED OVERPRICED JUST NOT THAT GOOD. This place is so hyped, I was expecting something at least decent. I've eaten at Jim's (which was EXCELLENT btw) and was expecting this place to be as good, or better. Wow was I mistaking. I will be fair, the one and ONLY good thing that was worth mentioning, the steak was of good quality and fairly tender, BUT it was not cut thin enough. Cheese whiz is cheese whiz, but they did not put enough on it. The onions were diced a bit too small, and not cooked enough. The bread wasn't bad, but wasn't that good either, tasted like something you'd be in a supermarkets bread aisle (do not mistake this comment for a supermarkets fresh bakery) The cheesesteaks are $8.50, I wouldn't have said it was overpriced if it was good, but it was not! There is only outdoor seating, outdoor ordering, outdoor eating, does not have an inside! It's the type of building that should be on a boardwalk, not in the middle a northest metro area! They do not offer mayo with the condiments. The hot sauce that they offer is insanely hot, too hot for a cheesesteak IMO, and this is the only hot sauce they have.... I've made better cheesesteaks at home. Have had many many better steaks in NYC/Jersey City/Hoboken. Genos is, Nowhere, and I mean NOWHERE, near the quality of the sandwich Jim's makes. If this place is better than Pat's, I'd hate to taste Pat's! AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS. GO TO JIMS ON SOUTH STREET!!!!!!!! I don't even write reviews often, if at all, however I read so many GOOD reviews about this place, I had to write this so hopefully more people will know what it is really like.
