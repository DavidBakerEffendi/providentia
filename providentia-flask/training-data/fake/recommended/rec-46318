I would come back to NYC just to visit this restaurant. I was expecting it to be great just based on Forgione's rep and the reviews, but this completely exceeded my expectations, especially for brunch. The restaurant's rustic decor is also great and definitely added to my experience. So, for brunch we did the bottomless mimosas, awesome. For food I ordered the bacon, egg and cheese based on our awesome waiter's (think his name was Josh) recommendation...my mouth is watering right now thinking about it and I just ate a late lunch. The bacon, egg and cheese etc was inside each half of a popover and was accompanied by some delicious bacon. I have no idea what they do differently with these eggs but they were just heavenly; normally I wouldn't think twice to comment on the quality of a restaurant's eggs, but here you go. My friend ordered the brioche French toast and loved that as well. My fat ass also ordered their three sides (Forge home fries, thick cut bacon and the maple glazed pork & fennel sausage) and each of them were just delicious. Again, our service was impeccable even with a slight crowd; the guy didn't miss a thing. I cannot wait to come back and have dinner here; definitely do not pass this place up!
