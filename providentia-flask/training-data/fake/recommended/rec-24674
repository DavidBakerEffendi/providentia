I've been reading all these positive reviews and finally had a chance to try it out. Corner Bistro did not disappoint me at all. Walking in at 6pm on a Wednesday, the place was well attended, but not packed. Sat at the bar and enjoyed a delicious Stella in a nice mug served by a friendly bartender. The atmosphere was cozy and the bacon cheeseburger delicious. Great place, I can highly recommend.
