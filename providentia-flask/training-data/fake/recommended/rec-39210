The food here is absolutely disgusting. I ordered the orange chicken and it was raw and fatty in the inside, mushy on the outside. The sauce tasted like aunt jemima syrup. The garlic shrimp was OK but it was 90% broccoli. The noodles and egg rolls were just plain soggy. Try asking them for chili sauce without their sighing and complaining. It was a 40 dollar meal that went straight to the garbage.
