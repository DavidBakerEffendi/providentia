Dear friends, If you are looking for authentic Dominican/Puerto Rican food... THIS IS  NOT THE PLACE TO GO. Let me start by saying that, as soon as you arrive, you are greeted by an "Argentinian" hostess, and then by an "Argentinian" waiter with no clue of what a typical mofongo  is made of or taste like, just to give you an example. Sadly, they don't know much about what they are selling and serving. I mean... c'mon! Take a minute to study your restaurant's menu! Ask about what each item means or how it is made! Second, no one in the kitchen, as I learned later, was of Caribbean origin. The cook was Mexican and the rest of Central American and South American background. Now, you may think.. so what? As long as they cook well... thats what matters right? But when you order "bacalaitos" and you get two tiny smashed- dry bunuelos de bacalo from last Christmas, and a mofongo with chicken that tastes like an over cooked and over heated venezuelan arepa with, actually, no chicken couple with rice and beans that taste like those you get at an American dinner... you realize you are definitely in the WRONG PLACE. Trust me, I am Puerto Rican. I know how to cook a simple mofongo. It is NOT that difficult. But this place really really sucks! Oh... and dont order a "Tres Leches" for dessert. You are gonna get an hybrid between an Hindu and Amercian solid rice pudding instead. WORST PLACE TO EAT authentic Dominican/Puerto Rican food in Brooklyn. Please take my advice and go somewhere else.
