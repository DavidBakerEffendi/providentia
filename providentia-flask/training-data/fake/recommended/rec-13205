Went into the City On St. Patrick's Day (Saturday),.. went here for breakfast..before parade, and other festivities,... Judging from other reviews, ( time of day/week you go)we had an idea we would have to wait (we did ,..over an Hour),.. I had an omelete, my wife had the pancakes,..they were both VERY Good,...The Pancakes are the main event,..although everything else  is great as well...My wife got the blueberry pancakes...She said they were the best she's had,..Omelete was tops as well. Saw a TV show that did a piece on Clinton Street Bakery,..on the show  they said they made it a point to use sustainable or organic produce/ eggs/meats/food etc.  whenever possible,.. Baked goods were awesome . Will be going back soon...
