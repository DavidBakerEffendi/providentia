I found this place by accident. I was hungry around Empire State area and decided to find a place to eat. They have a good variety of homemade Korean food (buffet per pound and also pre-packaged hot or cold food) You will find some cheap tasty food there. You can try some different stuff and you will not be upset if you don't like. Prices are really inexpensive. Funny thing: some food are not refrigerated and stays there for a while. However I didn't have any spoiled food yet. --crossing fingers ;-) My only complain is the fact that the place is way too small; very crowded during lunch time. If the weather permits; buy your food and go somewhere else to eat in peace.
