Ooh Mama! Behind Maoz, I gotta admit this place probably seconds my list of best falafels in the city. I went there around 12:45pm/1pm, and the line was out the door! No problem, though, because it went super fast! They have a lot of options to choose from. I got the Eggplant sandwich, which normally comes with two huge eggplant slices and only one falafel ball. However, they let me do half and half, which I was happy with because I definitely wanted to taste more falafel as one of the reviews below mentioned how they basically melt in your mouth. Total for this was $7, which was a bit on the pricier side (especially compared to Maoz), but it DOES include tax, which does make things a bit easier. Other items didn't seem too expensive either, so I definitely would like to come back and try more! They do have a mini-"salad bar" on the side with some pickled veggies and various sauces (as my friend Aria S. said, the green sauce HITS the spot). As always, I do like to explain my justification for deduction of star(s), so here it is: -- Pricier than other falafel places in the city (albeit affordable) -- Not enough "salad bar" options (again, sorry to compare to Maoz, but some more veggies would be nice) -- Hours are pretty slim. For a place that's so good, they should definitely be open more!
