If you have the chance to get some sloppy food after a great night out with friends, this is the place to be. Do not believe the hype of a Pat's or Gino's. This is the place to be, might get busy but the servers cook good and quick to keep the lines rolling. good enough amount of steak, great amount of whiz and if you like to get a steak WIT you will be happy with what they serve. The roll might even be the best part!
