I've heard a lot about this ramen spot for years, and I finally had it last night.  Perhaps my expectations were set way too high, but it wasn't met.  I was disappointed with how hard the noodles were, and the soup was way too thick for my liking.  The only good thing about my bowl of ramen is the pork - it was delicious!  But that's not enough to get me back there.
