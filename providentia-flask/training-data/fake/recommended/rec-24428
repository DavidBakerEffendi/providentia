I live in the Bay Area and I heard through some people that NYC has this meatball craze going on.  So I was incredibly excited when I landed at JFK and received a text from my friends who were taking me out to dinner that they wanted to check out the meatball craze.  YAY!  So we all meet up and head down to the Lower East Side.  The place is pretty small so I can see why there would be long waits but we got lucky and were seated immediately.  Our waitress was extremely helpful in explaining how things worked.  I got one of the specials - buffalo wing slider - and the spicy pork with pesto sauce on polenta.  The waitress was right in that I could just eat the pesto itself.  I also tried my friends' spicy meat sauce and the risotto and mashed potatoes.  I really loved the risotto as well.  We all got their homemade ice cream for dessert and I loved the espresso one I got.  I know just wish we could have this in the Bay Area as well.  Warning - nothing on the menu is healthy :)
