The smell... once you walk in, you wont be able to walk out! I have yet to discover what eight turn means... i mean... logically, if you make 8 turns, youd surround a block twice then come to the same place.  Not enough for biblical reference, too much for repetitiveness...  What does it mean!  Must go back to find out and order that matcha green tea berry crepe again!  .....  Only because its my civic duty.... Anyways, enough brain farting... This place is novel, cute, the food is delicious and the interior smell ...  if yelp rated droolworthiness, I would give it five out of five glops;    buttery, warm and enriching.   The store is easy to pass by but you can recognize it by the amazing display of crepes covered by glass domes.. making the whole store appear somewhat like a other worldly, japanese, mystical science project.   Its fun to eat, novel (even though its just crepes) and delicious.  I dont know where exactly to fit  it into my eating schedule.  Its kind of light... so its great for lunch, or after dinner dessert!
