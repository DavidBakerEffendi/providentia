This place is among my favorite pizzerias in America.  I ate there yesterday evening with friends and family.  We started with the fresh burrata and antipasti which were delicious.  The salads were fresh and perfectly dressed, but the star of the show here are the pizzas.  We had a variety of pizzas, from simple margherita for the kids to the melanzana, mais and a special butternut squash pizza with a spicy honey drizzle.  The toppings were all excellent, but what is truly amazing is the crust.  The care that goes into the multi-day process of preparing the dough and then the 90 second cooking in the wood burning oven results in a pizza it is truly unfair to other pizzas.  On top of that, my wife is usually depressed when we go to pizzerias because she can't eat gluten.  At Pizzeria Verita, they actually prepare their own homemade gluten free crusts, so she was thrilled to get to enjoy delicious pizza along with the rest of us.  The service was friendly and prompt.  They make you feel like family.  Can't wait to come again!
