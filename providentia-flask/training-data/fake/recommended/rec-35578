Had an excellent lunch here last year and sat at Chef Yasuda's corner.  I didn't know then that he would be leaving the restaurant, I am very glad I made it here before he left.  A classic sushi experience, as good as any I have ever had.   Uni was in season then, and I had two pieces.  They were amazing!  I also enjoyed the sake list, reasonably priced with excellent selections.
