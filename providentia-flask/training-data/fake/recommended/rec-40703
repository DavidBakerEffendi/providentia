Dined here for restaurant week last evening.  Great vibe and energy....loved the decor and any restaurant that has a photo booth is ok by me.  The food had hits and misses.  Once again dessert was the best part of the meal.   My recommendations:   The blood orange margarita that is mentioned quite a bit on these reviews was not so great in my opinion it tasted very watered down but  the Grenada Margarita was delicious with pomegranate juice triple sec and silver tequila.  Delish!   The "El Vez" Guacamole was my first course and it was out of this world good so that is absolutely something one has to try when they are here. The Mexican Chopped Salad with lime ranch dressing. It was my 2nd course, very unique and quite tasty with seeds and beans and corn.  2 thumbs up. The Corn on the Cobb....which was not included with the restaurant week menu but I read a lot of good things about it so I had to give it a try and for only 4 bucks it was so worth it and it did not disappoint.  It was smothered with melted cheese and the corn was just packed with so much flavor.  This is a must. Plus its really fun to eat in public...good and messy. The Carmel Flan.  Me and my boyfriend tried both desserts offered on the menu and this was by far the best! Their entree's were just not that good.  I say come for drinks and appetizers and call it a day.
