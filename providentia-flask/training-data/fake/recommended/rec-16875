Five words: Just What The Doctor Ordered.  One of the great things about moving back to Vermont is the number of street-eat carts that have cropped up since I left, in particular those that cater to the late-night crowd.  Still, it took me a few months of being back in Burlington to finally try this place, since the post-2am line at the cart is always ridiculous.  I soon found out why. I happened to find the cart open at around 6pm on a Saturday during the summer.  Having just left work, and knowing I had an evening of adult beverages ahead of me, I had to put something in my stomach; I figured a gyro would do the trick.  I was lucky that the cart had just opened, so they were just starting to shave the lamb meat off the roast.  The meat was perfectly seasoned and tender.  Thrown on a warm pita with LTO and about a gallon of tzatziki (of which one can never have too much), and you've got one heck of a quick bite to eat.  Since that first experience, no line has discouraged me from returning after a night on the town.  This cart would be right at home on any corner in NYC; we're lucky to have one here.
