I was with a friend from work, and we thought that after work (1pm on a Friday... love me my Summer Fridays) we would grab lunch and watch a World Cup match.  We could have gone anywhere, but we decided to go to BXL East because they do flights of beer, and we thought that was awesome.   So, we quickly grab a spot at the bar and we look over their fairly extensive list of Belgian beers.  Impressive, but we have no idea what to get.  Luckily, the bartender was very helpful and suggested that if we do the beer flights, he'll choose the beer for us and in which order to drink them.  Frankly, I don't remember what he chose but we went from light to dark and each beer had it's own distinct taste and feature and it was a great way to sample a variety of beers in one afternoon.   And of course, we got lunch... everything looked good but i settled for the Croque Monsieur-- basically, a ham and cheese sandwich topped with a cheesy, creamy sauce and served with fries.  It was a good sandwich, but the fries were amazing.  I'd like to come back and try their mussels. Overall, it was a good place to grab lunch. And it's a good place for (wanna-be) beer connoisseurs.  This place knows its s**t when it comes to beer.  Not only do they clean each cup (again) immediately before pouring, but each beer on tap, at least, is served in its own distinct glass made for that specific beer.  Fancy shmancy.
