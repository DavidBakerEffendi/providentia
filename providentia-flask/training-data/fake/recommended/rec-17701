I went to SoCo thye eve of Fourth of July. I had heard a lot about it so wanted to try it out. Honestly, I would give the food a 3 and the ambiance/decor a 5. The food was just okay to me, I had the salmon and cornbread and mac and cheese, my bf got the okra as an appetizer and the lobster and shrimp grits. Everything was just okay, not spectacular, in addition, it took almost an hour for us to get our food and we did have reservations. It was very cold in there as well(the people next to us were also complaning). I would probably go in there and go to the bar and order the drinks. It really is a beautiful restaurant.
