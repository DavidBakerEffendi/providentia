I haven't even eaten here yet, and already I'm smitten. It's darling.  The guy that greeted me at the door (I walked in for a delivery menu, and it's sooooo cute! handwriiten!!) was a charmer.  He boasted their specials, such as homemade tacos that are "real Mexican food made by real Mexicans!"  I couldn't help but giggle and respond with glee.  I was ridiculously bummed to miss out on Union Picnic, but hells yeah, I love this guy already. I also spied challah french toast crusted with sweet corn flakes which brought me back to a serious obsession with these cap'n crunch crusted chicken fingers I ate as a kid.   UPDATE::  Tater tots??  Do you mean hush puppy amazing magic with spicey mustard from heaven?  God help me, I think I'm in love.
