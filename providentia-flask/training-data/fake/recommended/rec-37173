I loved this place! I only had drinks, but every drink I had was AMAZING. I am a Lychee Martini connoisseur and I must say, their lychee martinis are a close second to Sunda's in Chicago. This is the perfect place to unwind, have drinks and chat with friends. A very diverse crowd which I liked very much. Will defintely be giving them repeat business when I am back in town.
