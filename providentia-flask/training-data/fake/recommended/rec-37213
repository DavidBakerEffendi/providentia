Wife and I went here after reading in the new Hartford mag. survey it was the best Chinese restaurant. First , let's be clear, it's not a restaurant. It's a take-out place with some seating. The atmosphere is noisy and close. The food is served with plastic forks, spoons and styrofoam plates. The fact that this is the best Chinese restaurant in the Hartford area says a lot about the state of Chinese food around here. We've lived here a while now and have pretty much given up on getting good Chinese food. The food here is better than most but still pretty middling. Hot & sour soup was neither spicy nor sour. Won ton soup was bland. Our pork and beef dishes were pretty ordinary and played it safe on taste. The food was nothing memorable, especially for the best Chinese restaurant in the area. I'm not sure other than to take out whether I'd come back here. It's not worth the trip from Avon for what I consider average Chinese food. Still looking for outstanding Chinese food in the Farmington valley.
