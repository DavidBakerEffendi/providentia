Since we moved to center city, about four years ago, we've heard about Race Street cafe.  Good pub food and a beer engine.  Tonight we decided to try it, hoping for two seats at the bar.  We found those two seats and that was the last good news.  The bartender treated us as if our existence irritated him, barely acknowledging our presence.  I asked for a taste of the cask conditioned IPA and when I decided against it, he ignored us over over ten minutes.  So, twenty minutes after sitting down, I finally had a beer.  Then, we ordered a plate of nachos which, though this also took about twenty minutes to arrive, it arrived with cold, unmelted cheese....And no one seemed to care when I mentioned that the cheese hadn't been melted. Suffice it to say that this was a deeply disappointing experience and one we will never repeat.
