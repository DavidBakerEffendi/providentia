This place is sensational    We were a group of 13 people today.  My first time there. The place has no sign outside so carefully check street address or you'll never find it.  The service was wonderful - attentive, and patient.  We were there over 4 hours and nobody rushed us or tried to get us out (granted that by the time we finished the main part of our meal the restaurant had emptied out).    My meatloaf with onion rings was  delicious.  My friend had the sturgeon. Also brilliant.  The hot chocolate (with bourbon and marshmallows) makes  winter almost worthwhile.   I'm not familiar with Williamsburg and I must say I got a little confused seeing a map of Alaska in the rest room.  I started looking for Russia out the window, alas to no avail.
