We got ugly ducklings (Balut), pork buns, Laing, kalderetang kambing, Lechon kawali, bistek, sizzling sisig, and adobo ribs. They were all delicious! Service was also excellent. I asked our server if I can use my free house shot from checking in on Yelp. Â Instead of giving me only one, she gave everyone in my group one! They were apple tequila shots and, again, delicious! She said it was to make up for earlier when our table wasn't ready for our reserved time. Now, that's thoughtful! We made sure to tip extra for that sweet gesture. Unfortunately, they did not have halo-halo which everyone in our group was hoping to get, but their fried bananas in egg-roll wrap with Ube (purple yam) ice cream satisfied the sweet tooth in the group. Lastly, everyone tried Red Horse beer for the first time. It was good because everyone ordered 3 more after that.
