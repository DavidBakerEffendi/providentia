Someone recommended this place for good bread. I came here and got an olive loaf because it is my husband's favorite. I asked for half the loaf to be sliced, the other left as is. The sliced half was crooked so some of the slices were only half the size. I thought this was because it was hard to slide half a loaf, until I later went to Metropolitan Bakery and asked for the same thing on their loaf and got a perfectly sliced half loaf! So anyway, I went home with my bread and made a sandwich with it. Took a bite. SO SALTY. It was the saltiest loaf of bread I have ever eaten. I get that it's an olive loaf, and the olives have salt, but the bread itself was unedibly salty!!! I have gotten olive loafs at other places, and they are NOT like this. This bread was salty to the point that I couldn't eat it on it's own or in a sandwich. I ended up having to make bread pudding and bread salad with it (both of which I added no additional salt and it was still on the over-seasoned side...), which made it barely edible. Needless to say I never went back. I am so glad I discovered Metropolitan, otherwise I would have thought that Philly Center City had no good bakeries!
