Mmm, succulent italian food. Whenever my parents visit we come here (because I can't afford it on my own :P), it's their favorite italian in NYC. The service has always been nice, and I love the free bread you get in the beginning, especially the focaccia, mmghhh. I don't drink wine, so I can't rate them on that front, but they do constantly refill your water! And the actual food is pretty amazing. I've tried a few dishes, from the veal, to the fish, to the creamy pasta, and it's all fantastic. I've always been too stuffed for dessert, but they roll a cart around and they look delish. The atmosphere is really nice too. Very cozy and well lit, but I find the abstract "art" on the wall to be hideous. Ah well! Can't have everything. And yes, I know Little Italy is basically just a tourist trap now... but I still love it (: Sometimes it's been very crowded and we've had to wait (this was during christmas season) and other times, like weeknights in the spring, it's been pretty empty. I assume that summer nights are packed as well, so it's best to make reservations if you know its busy season.
