I love Mexican food and this place consistently delivers! Free salsa and chips are fantastic, especially since the salsa is house made with incredible smokey heat. Love the jalape√±o cucumber margarita and quesadillas. My boyfriend's enchilada platter was huge--definitely enough to feed 2-3 people, but he owned it. Great atmosphere and music.
