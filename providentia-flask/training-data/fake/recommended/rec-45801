Sally's is the best pizza in New Haven. I've tried all the rest and they are great too, but Sally's can't be beat. I grew up in the New Haven area and I've been eating pizza here for over 25 years. i don't go as much as I should since it's a hassle to wait hours in line for friggin pizza. Try going early and on Sundays to avoid the lines.
