John's simply has the juiciest, most flavorful, most perfectly prepared cheesesteaks in the known world.  The delicious meat is sliced the perfect width, the cheese distribution is even and right, and the sesame-seed bread brings it all together in a way that can make a grown man cry.  I've tasted the rest.  Nothing else comes close.  And that's probably why John's was recognized by James Beard.
