Excellent sandwiches and awesome customer service! I would recommend Paesano's to anyone. I ordered two trays of sandwiches for an event at my job (fairly priced at $50 for enough to feed 8-12 people) from the Italian Market location. Not only were the sandwiches delicious (very fresh Italian bread with unique and really tasty flavors), but the staff was very friendly and accommodating to us. We had to pick-up after their closing time (which is 3:30pm) and they happily let us do that, when my check at work got screwed up and we were unable to pay at pick-up, they let me take an invoice and pay later; and they called to ask how everything was. Definitely order from Paesano's!
