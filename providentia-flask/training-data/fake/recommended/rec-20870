Let me start this off by telling you that I'm a 100% bona fide pho connoisseur. Back when I lived in Seattle, I'd eat it at least 3x per week. Maybe more. I'd like to think I have pretty dang high standards, too. I ordered delivery from Thanh Huong, so I can't comment about the decor or whatnot, but I tend to rate restaurants mostly on the food because, well, that's why I'm there. When I called to order a large bowl of pho with flank and eye round steak, I had to actually tell them what flank and eye round steak are. No joke. I also ordered extra basil. What I got was watery pho with only eye round steak and noodles and lettuce. Lettuce! No sprouts, lime, chillis, onion, basil, etc. None of the accoutrements. Just lettuce. So strange, no? If I'd only ordered pho, this place would've gotten 1 star from me. Their saving grace? Avocado smoothie. Delicious. I've been craving another one ever since.
