I had the fried chicken- didn't really enjoy it. The chicken was pretty bland and the sauce was strange. I added a lot of hot sauce in order to finish it. The atmosphere isn't bad, but the lighting is so dim it's difficult to see the people at your table. The service isn't great- I needed to wave around for a few minutes before anyone refilled my glass.
