I really want to love this place since it is so close to work. I have tried this about four times since my first review and I felt I needed to update. Also, for the most part the staff is really friendly. I stop in for happy hour ever once in awhile on different nights, every time I go in they are out of their signature cocktails. I'm beginning to believe they don't have signature cocktails and need to update their menus. I would really be interested in someone who has actually gotten to experience their signature cocktails. At first Nix's offered happy hour food specials, now they just offer nachos and buck a shuck. The nachos reminded me of day old Chinese noodles and cheese. With everything else on their menu I was really hoping for a better form of nachos. My last happy hour there, they ran out of the house wine.... how does this happen? When the waitress informed our table I was a bit harsh because of the past experience with the signature beverages, however after a little bit she offered a Merlot that she could charge us for at happy hour price.
