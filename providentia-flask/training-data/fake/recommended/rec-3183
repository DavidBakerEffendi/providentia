4 1/2 stars for food - extra half star for fantastic prices! Also - great for those with gluten and dairy allergies (can never go wrong with roasted meat, rice, and beans). Although I hadn't been to Copacabana in some time (why? I have no idea....) I easily convinced my boyfriend to give this place a try - with promises of wonderfully delicious roasted meats. We came earlyish on a Friday night before catching a movie at the nearby Kaufman theater. Per usual, this place did not disappoint. The restaurant is buffet style (can eat in or get a container to go), with different options: the meat/salad/hot bar and meat/salad are 5.99/lb. The meat only is maybe 7.99/lb. I recommend getting the meat/salad/hot bar - just more options. The salad bar (which is cold) includes a variety of prepared salads. The hot bar includes 2 types of rice, red and black beans, fried plantains, fried yucca, french fries, and several other dishes. There is also a large variety of meats - chicken, chicken sausage, steak, pork, etc. My boyfriend got a huge plate of rice, fries, salad, and two pieces of chicken sausage. I filled my plate with roasted chicken, red beans and rice, salad, and this salad-y mix (all I could tell was that it involved a bit of lettuce, boiled eggs, and bacon - yum!). Our entire meal cost less than $11. A fantastic bargain for the amount of food we got.
