WOW.... WOW..... WOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!! This place is awesome! awesome awesome AWESOME.... hahahaha... can't help but repeat myself cuz it was so good. okay the bad first.... the major problem is that there is ALWAYS a wait.... people go home! hahahaha :P but we made up for that by going out for a couple drinks and coming back. the great thing ippudo does is that they don't automatically take you off the list if you aren't there when they call your name. they give you the next table after you come back. that is customer service for you... 2 thumbs up for that. I love the ramen here... but i have to say... i would wait any day for their pork belly buns..... SOOOOOOOO YUMMMY. so good that we ordered an extra one after the ramen for desert :P As for the ramen, I got the Spicy Miso Ramen...... to die for! LOVED it. The noodles were yummy and the broth was not too oily and heavy. simply delicious. I wish I lived closer. Â I could have this every day. :P
