I have been several times and always leave feeling satisfied.  The food quality has fluctuated over the years but it is once again top notch.  I last went for a Unibrouwe brewery tasting dinner.  The beers were very good and the food was really good.  The spring beets were especially good and I don't usually like beets.  The location is great if you like world class sculpture gardens.  Go for a nice walk and finish with an amazing meal.
