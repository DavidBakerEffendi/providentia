Decor-wise, this place is a beauty. I definitely would recommend coming here for get-togethers but with that being said, be prepared for an above average noise level. The reason why I give Buddakan three stars is because the quality of its food really did not blow me away. Many items on the menu are on the spicy side and while they are good, the speed at which food was served was a little on the slow side. Also, a lot of the dishes I tried came out much saltier than expected. Sitting in a corner, I felt like waiters often forgot about us in terms of refilling our waters and whatnot. Definitely give Buddakan a try if you enjoy high-end Asian food but I think it really is only rated so highly because it's the only high-end Asian restaurant in Philadelphia.
