I'll tell you what's good here are the vegetarian sushi rolls.  For those veggies who are sick of the standard cucumber and avocado roll while their friends chow down on exotic raw fish dishes, this place is a godsend.  Sweet potato tempura rolls, marinated tofu folls, asparagus, and spicy mixed vegetable are some of my favorite. Also... Why isn't Green Tea Ice Cream more popular?  I would totally buy that sh!t from a Mister Softee Truck.
