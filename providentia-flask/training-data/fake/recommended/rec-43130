Ahh, a TRUE Newark greasy joint...Yummmmmmm. I've been going here since I can hardley remember and it just keeps getting better. My mother comes to visit from El Paso and this is one of the first places she wants to go and eat ~ straight off the plane..Momma doesn't waste no time. *****Carry a concealed weapon, heads up, hold that wallet and look everyone in the eye..your not in Short Hills, your in Newark ******
