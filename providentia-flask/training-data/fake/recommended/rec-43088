A great "cheesy" spot in the 'hood of South Philly adjacent to a little ballpark (which would be uber sketchy if not well-lit) and near another great spot, Geno's.  However, Pat's is historic because a scene from Rocky was filmed there (look for the plaque) and they are notoriously strict on ordering etiquette.  If you don't do it smoothly, firmly & quickly, they'll send your ass all the way back to the end of the line.  This can make for one nervous-as-hell-slightly-inebriated visitor who is in dire need of midnight munchies.  So, during the long wait I struggled with "Whiz wit... or was it wit Whiz... well, that makes more sense... but wait...oh shit!" because, before I knew it,  I was at the head of the line and some big guy was yelling at me in a thick Philly accent so I blurted out the first thing I could think of... and I guess it was the right one because they served me up a pipin' hot steak'o'cheese!!  I can't really tell which one is better in PHL... Jim's was pretty damn good with a great location but a monstrosity of a line... yet Pat's is worth the trek into the 'hood just for experience's sake.
