Had lunch with my coworkers there and despite it being a small space, they managed to seat our table of 5 and provided us with a quick, tasty, and fresh lunch. I had the prosciutto panini with tomato and fresh mozzarella (#8 on the lunch menu). The bread was fresh and crisp and the side salad (mainly had mixed greens) had just enough dressing to be slightly moist but not so much dressing to be slimy. Overall a great place and I will be back for more!
