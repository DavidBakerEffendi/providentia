Very nicely done, and the price isnt too bad.  I came with a friend and shared foie gras, pork belly, carrot/root salad of sorts, and something else I cant remember with a glass of red.  All of it was impressive and creative, and Im hard to please.  Service was pretty good, nothing to complain about.
