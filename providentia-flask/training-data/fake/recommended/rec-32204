The place is under new management so the interior, staff, and food has changed. The interior is more modern than before, the open kitchen looks cleaner, but the tables and chairs stayed the same which is not a problem at all. So a big plus on the new design. The menu hasn't changed much. We ordered the soup noodle with soy chicken and roast pork and soy chicken and roast pork on rice. The entrees were a tad smaller than before but nothing to complain about as the taste was amazing and the meat was fresh. My roast pork were smaller pieces though, which was my only concern. Service was good, food came out on time, and my tea was never emptied. Overall it was a quick, cheap, and tasty lunch. I would recommend coming here for a quick meal.
