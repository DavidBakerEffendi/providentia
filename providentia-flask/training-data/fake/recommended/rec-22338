Wow.  This was the best dining experience I have had in New York and possibly anywhere.  We had a small dinner party to celebrate my sister's birthday and we chose Salinas over two other "finalists" because my husband has a sports injury and  Salinas had the most comfortable chairs.  All of the booths and chairs are heavy and thick, and covered in a deep velvet.  We ordered every rice dish on the menu as well as assorted tapas and cheeses, sangria, and the best old fashioned I've ever had.  Everything was executed perfectly.  Also, I am gluten free and I could eat everything save one small tapas dish.  Several of our friends, who are French, commented repeatedly on the perfect execution of the various dishes.  Finally, the magnificent flower and candle displays give a fairy tail ambiance that is quite memorable.
