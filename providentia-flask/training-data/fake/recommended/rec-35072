My friend from Chicago came by and wanted to try some east coast steaks. At first we went to Arthur's in Hoboken but it was closed because of the snow. I yelped around my area (Belleville) and this place came up with good ratings. Good thing Arthur's was closed because this place was a great find. I've always passed by this place but never bothered trying it and boy was I missing out! I ordered the rib- eye with garlic mashed Â potato and some fried onions on the side. Mmmm mmmm! The steak was cooked perfect and juicy. I could honestly say that it's up there in quality and even better than Gallaghers at Newark airport.
