We thought we ordered spinach and mushroom pizza and the guy at the counter didn't explain what it was.  The girl handing our pizza was really apologetic and said it was actually black bean, spinach, and caramelized onions pizza.  My boyfriend and I didn't care too much and said we would have it anyways.  It was actually pretty damn awesome.  I'm not sure how much of this had to do with hunger, but the light garlic on the pizza enhanced it.
