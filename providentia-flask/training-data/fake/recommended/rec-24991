1st time at Blue after being a fan and consistent patron of sister place Beso. Hubby had avocado carpaccio app said it was unique and good. I had spicy arugula salad with beets it was good. Wish they gave me a few more beets! Both had lamb shank for entrees. Both slightly disappointed. Flavors were good but the tenderness of an osso buco were absent. Expected fall off the bone meat and we needed a knife to get through most of it. Service was great ! Wine was good. Would try again but a diff dish
