This is one of the best pizza experiences I've ever had. New Haven style pizza seems to be in a class of its own.  I don't even know if it would make sense to compare this to the other pizza I've had as a lifelong New Yorker.  But maybe I'm just saying that to avoid perjuring myself into being called a traitor. Our half of a white clam pie is absolutely heaven.  Thin, crunchy crust along with the clams and grated cheese.  You'll leave with absolute garlic breath and love it. The other half was a specialty fresh tomato pie.  It was an amazing contrast of flavor to the white clam side and by the end of the meal, we had trouble deciding which we liked better. I can't wait to be back and hopefully the closer location in Yonkers is just as good.
