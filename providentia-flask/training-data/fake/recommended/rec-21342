Walking down the slim, minimal corridor to Bohemian is like leaving the chaos of the city into another world. It was a Friday night and rainy when I went with a couple of friends. The design is beautifully simple with a small row of bar seats and about 5 tables for couples. There are two additional "lounge" like areas for parties of more. The midcentury seating looks great, but a little uncomfortable for the extended time you're there. It's like sitting in mies barcelona chair with a coffee table as a dining table but there's no room for your feet. Other than than minor design issues, there is a big skylight and a great little garden to overlook. It's minimal without being cold. It's a quiet place... even the table of 6 guys next to us weren't loud and obnoxious. The food and drink were GREAT. Everything was delicious, well prepared and small. We ordered everything a la carte. My favorite dishes were the raw beef and the sashimi which was out of this world. It was the best I've had since being in Tokyo. I would definitely go back here...
