In Tria We Trust. I have yet to be disappointed with any dish or beverage here. Always fresh and full of flavor - highly recommend the bruschetta: Pistachio Herbed Ricotta with Lavender Honey (though may work best as a dessert rather than appetizer). Staff is extremely knowledgeable, ask any and all questions - better yet, tell them what you're looking for and take them up on their suggestions!
