FANTASTIC. Go here.  Menu offers lots of delicious and interesting items, especially among the snack offerings.  We loved the brisket tots and the shrimp toast.  We have eaten here several times and every dish has been outstanding.  Fish is superbly cooked and pastas are imaginative and delicious.  Staff is friendly and eager to please. Like their other restaurant, Recette, this is a genuinely great place to dine even if to just grab a bite at the bar.
