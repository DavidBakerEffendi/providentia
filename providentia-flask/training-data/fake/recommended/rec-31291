Excellent food! The sugarcane pork sticks are amazing,the calamari is unlike any other calamari you've ever had, the kalbi beef is phenomenal, the salt shrimp is perfect... everything here is great. I went to a media event and tried pretty much everything on the menu. The above mentioned are my favs. Also, the mixed drinks are yummy! The obao sun something or other is my favorite. There's a cucumber one that's great too! Service rocks, everything rocks..one of my favorite places now. The bathroom is too dark but who cares. How long does it take you to pee? 10 seconds? Go here!
