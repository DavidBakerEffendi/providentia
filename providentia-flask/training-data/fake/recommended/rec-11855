One of my best dining experience in New York!  I heard really great things about this establishment and had to try it.   I know everyone talks about the corn, which was AMAZING, but rest of the food we ordered were just as good.  My sister got enchillada suiza but I pretty much finished it and licked the plate off.  Very flavorful food and great ambiance.  Great music and sangria, we had so much fun here.   AND now they are open in LOS ANGELES!!!!  I cannot wait to try the one in southern cali!!!
