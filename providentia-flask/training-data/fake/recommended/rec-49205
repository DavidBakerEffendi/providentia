Really a gem - love the homemade pasta and really simple dishes with high quality ingredients.  Always great for a good time.  Just don't sit on the south side of the outdoor seating.  There are some very unattractive sights to be had.  One other thing?  They don't take reservations, and if you aren't beautiful you are going to have to wait outside (no bar) until the host deems you worthy after letting in about 15 hot 18 year olds before you and your date.  Go during slow hours (4-6) instead of hitting a hip hour like 8.  Because dishes are SUPER reasonable (which makes the cash only policy a little more bearable) a lot of students in the know find this a hot spot so immaturity fearers beware.
