Open Disclaimer:  This isn't a restaurant for idiots.   They have a tiny kitchen with 4 burners and they're killing it.  A fish and some chips?  Amazing.  If you want it better, you have to go to Tulum, sit on the beach tables, and ask for the catch of the day.   The beef is amazing.  The lamb breast is amazing. The seasonal vegetable (whatever it is) will be amazing.  The foie gras donut something you will have to eat to tell your grandkids about before ducks were outlawed as sex toys in the U.S.   The booze is a great bargain for what it is.  Also they have a great outdoor space with local art and they have brunch. I think it goes all day on Sunday, but I don't know for sure.
