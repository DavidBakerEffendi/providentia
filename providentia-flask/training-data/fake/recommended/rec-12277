For those pancake lovers, this is a great place to satisfy your cravings. Their blueberry pancake was phenomenal. Not to mention the maple syrup that comes with it. The maple syrup is like no other as its sweetness level is just enough to compliment the pancakes. Â Aside from the pancakes, I think the overall brunch menu is ok. I had the eggs Benedict and it was good, however, I've had better. Downside to this place is of course the wait. I waited 1.5 hours on a Sunday early afternoon. Despite the wait, it was only for the pancakes that was worth the wait. This is a place for those to definitely try for the first time, especially their pancakes.
