Beat the lunch rush which is great, it gets busy after 12:30p.  I got the Beef with egg and the potato w/ egg.  Both were very good, but I would favor the potato more with more flavor.  The beef was a little over cooked to my liking.  Both of these and a tea cost me about 11 bucks, which isn't too bad, usually I think of Indian food i'm thinking expensive, like spending 20 bucks.
