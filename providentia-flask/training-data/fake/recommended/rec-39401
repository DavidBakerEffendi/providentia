So good. I hate to agree to all the hype about Ippudo, but this was so good. SO GOOD. We got chicken wings, pork buns, and ramen. The chicken wings came with this sweet and salty soy-saucey concoction with cabbage. They were pretty good. The pork buns were everything everyone says. Light, fluffy, savory. The meat was thick so it didn't seem too small. The amount of lettuce seemed a bit not proportional to the bun but some bites did not have a crunch to it. It also had a bit too much mayo, in my opinion. Nonetheless, it was everyone's favorite. I ordered the akamaru modern. It was so good. It had just enough heat to get rid of feeling like the soup was too rich. Luckily, we went when it was still summer but I can't imagine having to wait so long during the winter. The prices were definitely pretty steep but it was worth every single penny.
