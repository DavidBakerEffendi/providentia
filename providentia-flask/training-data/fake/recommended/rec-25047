This place only merits a 3 star review because of the chill atmosphere of the bar. If you're looking for a good, flavorful meal, go somewhere else. I came here for Saturday lunch with some out of town friends. We actually only came here because the wait for Sabrina's was deathly long and we were in an empty-bellied hungover state. The service was SLOW. The prices are somewhat high ($10 for a grilled cheese and bowl of tomato soup?!), and the food took an hour to get to our table. I think there was one waitress for the whole dining room and bar area. While she had a friendly demeanor, there was nothing she could do to redeem the misseasoned food and tortoise-like efforts of the kitchen. The menu items were theoritically delicious, but were flawed in actuality. My friend ordered the breakfast burrito special, which was nearly ruined by the surplus of cilantro... and it was served with french fries. Really? Weird side for a breakfast burrito. I got the portabello mushroom buger which I found to be delicious. My boyfriend ordered the steak sandwich and said the seasonings were horribly off for a sandwich with so much potential, but the steak was good. Another friend got the Margherita flatbread, which was okay: the sauce was very sweet and semi tangy. The french fries, which I was looking forward to most were way too crispy and plain. All in all, the atmosphere was neat, but the food and slow service were a deal breaker.
