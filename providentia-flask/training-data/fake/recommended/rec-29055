Went here with my two best friends and it was a great time. Ordered to pizzas (meat one and plain cheese one) along with their waffle fries. The pizza was amazing as well as the fries. The fries came with some sort of chile cheesy dip that was unreal. It was honestly hard saving room for dessert, but alas that is one of the main reasons we came.. We ordered the smore dessert and a banana rice krispy chocolate thing and my GOD was it good. I rarely can eat dessert, but this time I didn't have a problem. Will be going again with my kid nephew!
