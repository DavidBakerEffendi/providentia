Went here on a recommendation today - also my birthday :) Nice ambiance.. Not too impressed by the Swiss Whipped - same as hot chocolate with whipped cream - just a typical hot chocolate, no extra choco flavor or choco chunks... presentation of dishes was good. Tip to first timers: it feels pretty cool to have hot chocolate from the hug mugs - and this you can get only if you get the regular hot chocolates, not swiss whipped :(, so order accordingly. French fries were very good, I took a lazy breakfast - good food, liked the square cut potatoes after dipping in chocolate sauce - quite an experience. But the omelette itself was not too great - ihop makes better omelettes. My friend requested a no-meat omelette, which came with topped sausages.. lol! It got swapped for the requested order, no issues there.. Margherita panini and veggie burger were good. For dessert, we took 'The Melting Chocolate Truffle Heart Cake & Shake' - excellent cake with dense hot chocolate on the side and strawberry pieces. Didn't like the shake much. Overall nice presentation, ambiance and unique experience being to a chocolate bar. Parking: Street parking or you can avail a parking lot right next door to this place. We parked a block away and noticed the next door parking when we reached the place. Enjoy yourselves! Cheers!
