After having graduated recently, my mother knew instantly to come here for a celebratory dinner after a recommendation from a coworker of her's - and I've never been more glad because of it. We went with my grandmother, mother, and father and Quan (spelling?), the owner, gave us the royal treatment through and through. We ordered four apps, the Prince Edward Mussels, Crispy Sweebtreads, Seared Scallop and the Foi Gras and everything was delicious. The Consistency of the Foi Gras was particularly good, sweet, buttery, and it melted in my mouth. I've not had Sweetbreads before but I'm sure to get it again when I come next. On top of that, Quan served us the escargot on the house which, although lacking their shells, were extremely fresh. The For our main courses, we ordered the Pan Seared Duck Breast, Steak Frites, and the Roasted Cornish Hen. The duck's port demi sauce was sweet and tangy, loved it and the almond wild rice was a great mix of flavor. In addition, Quan brought out a serving of crab cakes on the house again which were extremely fresh and crisp. Although being extremely full, the waitress humored us by giving us the dessert menu. I was leaning towards the almond creme bruele, my mother wanted the flan, and my father the bread pudding. Before letting us order, he came over and politely took the menus from us and served us the three desserts we were going to get anyways! The bread pudding was exceptionally good. Quan was extremely accommodating for the entire meal and made it a point to come out to us at each course to make sure everything was to our liking (which it was). He walked us out of the restaurant as we were leaving and I told him I myself at least would be back with a date to which he replied to "remind him" with a wink. I will definitely be back. The owner is great, the food better, and the experience one of the best I've ever had.
