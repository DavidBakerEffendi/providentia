Extremely flavorful food, despite its simplicity. I highly recommend the half chicken- which is quite literally the most delicious rotisserie chicken I've ever had (don't tell my mom!). I agree with the other postings that the wait can be a little long and the service can be a little slow, but it's well worth it. Even if I didn't live around the corner, I would make the effort whenever I was in the mood for a filling, inexpensive, Puerto Rican meal.
