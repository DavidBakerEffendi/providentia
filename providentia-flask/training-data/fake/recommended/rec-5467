Reminds me of my mom's cooking--and that pretty much says it all. Yes, it's a tiny little hole in the wall, and there isn't much in terms of decor or service. But the food more than makes up for it. For around $6 (fair warning: it's cash-only, but they have an ATM in the vestibule), you get a giant steaming bowl of hand-drawn or shaved noodles. I'm a huge fan of the beef brisket, which tastes exactly like what my mom used to make at home. I have to echo what the other reviewers are saying--this isn't some noodle joint serving ounces upon ounces of MSG. It's authentic, and my goodness is it delicious. I come here whenever a craving hits me (and strong-arm friends into accompanying me) and I always leave satisfied with impressed friends. They have a pretty extensive menu that isn't limited to noodles; try the roast marinated duck and jellyfish.
