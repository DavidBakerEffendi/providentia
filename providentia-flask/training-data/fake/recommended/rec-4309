I have seen this place on tv a few times. At lunch today at the market - it had the longest line, so I figured it has to be good right? I don't eat pork, so my options were only the roast beef or brisket. This place is known for its roast pork with broccoli rabe - that seems to be what most people were having. I opted for a roast beef with provolone and sweet pepper. It was good. I liked it. Wish it had more of the drippings on the sandwich - maybe I just didn't order correctly. The bread was excellent. All in all it was a good meal.
