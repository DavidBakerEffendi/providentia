I came here because of the great yelp ratings, and the only reason I'm giving 2 out of 5 is because the waitress was nice. I came with 5 guests and our meal came in 5 parts, one at a time, with each dish coming out 15-20 minutes apart. The last friend to eat his dish got his meal an hour and 15 minutes after the first friend finished his meal. I felt the pasta was subpar and I had one of the worst dining experiences of my life.
