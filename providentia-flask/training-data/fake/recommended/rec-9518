Ippudo's ramen is overpriced and overhyped, though it doesn't taste "bad" by any means. Their popular ones are okay, though the broths are too salty. If you want something lighter, get the Tori ramen. Toppings are not generous. Extra toppings, extra money. The thing to get here is actually the steamed pork buns. They are pricey at $9 for two, but worth it. They are saucy, flavorful, melt-in-your-mouth good. MMM. I can wolf down four of them easily... For a ramen place, the restaurant space is surprisingly big and spacious with the bathrooms awkwardly located down a steep flight of steps by the entrance. If you want to avoid potentially long wait times, come around the time they open!
