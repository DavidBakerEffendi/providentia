It was an OK dining experience. Someone told me Osteria had amazing pizza, so I instantly went over, but much to my dismay I was letdown. I ordered a margherita. The Crust was was way to wet, sauce not sweet enough, but worse of all the basil on top of the pizza was not chiffonaded. 1 large piece of basil was actually cooked on the pizza, so when it was served to me the basil was hot. I'm sure it wasn't a pleasant site watching me slurp up a wet hot huge basil leaf. What about my other slices? They looked so lonely without basil.
