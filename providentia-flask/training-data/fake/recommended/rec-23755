Cav's Headhouse is your run-of-the-mill sports bar. It's a good place to catch a game; plenty of TVs and never an overwhelmingly large crowd. The proximity to South Street helps keep the touristy crowd away, and you're more than likely to be surrounded by people that are there for the same reason. The dimly lit bar upstairs creates a fitting atmosphere to relax with friends while enjoying a few drinks. I haven't gotten the chance to try any of the food there, but Cav's does have a pretty decent drink selection, all for a reasonable price. The establishment has a few different bars, or rooms, throughout the building with a different theme. It's not a place I make a habit of going to often, but I've always liked the laid back nature of Society Hill. For the proverbial weekend warrior, I would aim somewhere closer to South St for bigger crowds and a more active nightlife. Otherwise, I think Cav's Headhouse is great for someone looking for a bit of midweek relaxation.
