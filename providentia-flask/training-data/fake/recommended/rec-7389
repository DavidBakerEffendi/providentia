What everyone says about the chicken is true, but what that means is really good take-out food. The experience of sitting there isn't worth it. The food It's good. We had the chicken, the fried calamari, the three milk dessert -- All good, even great. But some appetizer that sounded like  a corn tamale -- disgusting, wretched. I would have returned it if a waiter came when we asked for one. The timing The sequence of visitors isn't paid attn to -- imagine sitting there and 3 tables are seated and finishing appetizers before yours arrives? Take out would have been faster. The Waitstaff The waitstaff make you like you are a burden on them. They don't look at you as they take your order, never ask how your food is, never check in with you at all.  It was early Sat evening and they weren't very busy with customers, so there really is no excuse. They don't even stop when customers flag them -- they pass by and nod if you ask for a napkin, water, etc. The waiters and busboys spend a lot of time talking to one another. Our primary waiter stood out as the worst -- Jorge (it says so on the check). The others were somewhat helpful, but forgetful. Imagine waiting 10 mins for a napkin. Try asking for a manager and they won't ask what's wrong, they'll just flag Jorge (I tried twice). Again, barely a full stop as he asks what's wrong, if I need something. They must have no manager on-site? The food was so good ... I'll go to another Pio Pio. There's too many great Peruvian restaurants in NYC, too many great restaurants in the area, to feel like you are an unwelcome guest.
