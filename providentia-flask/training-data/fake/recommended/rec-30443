This is my favorite place in all of Brooklyn any day of the week for any meal. The owner is amazing and does what it takes to make this feel like a home-cooked meal. Â The prices are wonderful, the wine is terrific, the staff is like family and the view out the huge window while you're eating is breathtaking. This is a perfect five-star restaurant!
