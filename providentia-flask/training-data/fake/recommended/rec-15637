...an interesting place that teases 20-30 somethings by hinting that it's some sort of trendy pick-up spot.  Ummmm, not so much.  Inside is nice - brick walls and rustic country tables.   There is room to dine al fresco, which we did.   Service is decent, and the wine list will offer enough to satisfy you regardless of your food choices.  Now the food which I can only give 3 stars - maybe 3.5.   We stopped because of all the truffle possibilities, and I ordered the Polenta Tartufata without thinking.  If I had stopped there, I think everything would have been fine.  The polenta was decent, and the sauce had plenty of truffle flavor but there was so much oil and cream in the sauce, my appetite was pretty much shot by the time the appetizer was finished. Instead of stopping there I went to the gnocchi (also prepared with a cream/truffle sauce), and I may as well have eaten a 1/4 lb. of butter.  By the time this entrée was half eaten the sauce had separated into pools of fat.  It was all the extra fat that took two full stars away from my rating; too much fat says a lot about a chef not being able to balance a sauce correctly. My wife had a good salad, and an entrée with pasta, basil and fresh tomatoes that I would recommend, and probably order (if I ever return).  With all the offerings for Italian food in NYC, go find a place with homemade pasta.  Three stars for decent street view, good wines, and acceptable food.
