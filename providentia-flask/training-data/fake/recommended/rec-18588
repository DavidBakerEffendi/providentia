Not quite sure what the big deal is about Pok Pok. The ambience is fun. Service was friendly. The menu had such promise and I had heard such good things but the food was not particularly spicy or flavorful, the signature wings were kind of dry, the desserts were so-so - all around, a kind of disappointing meal and on par with the quality of most of the average, neighborhood Thai places I have tried. Not quite the special meal with family I was hoping for.
