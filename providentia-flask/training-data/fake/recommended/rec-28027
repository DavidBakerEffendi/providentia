No Crap on Tap! With over 40 beers to choose from, I would highly recommend this pub to my beer enthusiasts. I had the Mad River Bourbon, Green Flash Road Warrior and Mad River Jamaican ale. Â All were really good. I also had the California wrap which was really good. The place is very spacious. I got there around 4 and it started to fill up around 6 for the ranger game. Bartenders were very attentive.
