A fun place to hang out on a weekend or weeknight downstairs at the bar or at a table, but a GREAT place to see a band perform. From the outside of this place, you wouldn't guess the gem that it is inside. The downstairs has a nice long bar with a few booths Â adorned with cool table lights that change colors every few seconds. The back has a bunch of tables where you can linger over drinks or have a meal. The menu changes, but all my friends rave about the raw bar, which is 1/2 off during happy hour. The best way to experience JB's is to see a show upstairs. They get a lot of good indie bands and the upstairs is very interesting looking. There is a decent sized bar in one room and then standing room by the small stage. But the best part by far is the balcony a level above. It affords great views of the show and if you're lucky you can stake out a spot here or if the stars align you can even get one of a handful of seats and plant yourself in front of the balcony. If you've never hung out in Fishtown, head over to JB's early on a Friday after work and sit back and enjoy or check out one of the bands playing here on a weeknight. It's hipster and non-hipster heaven.
