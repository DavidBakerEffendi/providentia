Fresh local ingredients, great beer list, and friendly staff.  What more could you ask for?  The salads are fresh and quite unique.  The pizzas are amazing.  I suggest trying whatever pizza is on special.  When we were there it was an unusual mix with beef and squash but it was to die for.  The service is REALLY fast and the servers are quite pleasant considering how busy they are.  The bartenders and servers know a lot about both the beer and the food menu.  We went on a Sunday and this place was SLAMMED.  The only downfall is it felt a bit like a pizza factory... like they couldn't push people through fast enough, but this is not at the fault of the restaurant... it's apparently just that popular!
