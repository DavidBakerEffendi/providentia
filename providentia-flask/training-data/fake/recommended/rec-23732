I don't eat steak unless I'm here, that's how good this place is.  I'm not a fan of most meats, but somehow, Fogo makes everything so delicious, I can't resist! I don't know how anyone can say anything bad about this restaurant.  The only complaint I can imagine would be that it's pricey, but in my opinion, you certainly get your money's worth.  I agree with Alexandra in that the key is to go when you're hungry, it's the only way.  I don't agree that the coaster turning is tacky, it's a very efficient way of getting the waiter's attention.  Of course, you can also flag one of the skewer holders down if you see something you like, or ask a waiter to direct a specific type of meat your way.  You are very well taken care of here, drinks are refilled before they are completely empty, dirty plates are swapped out  as soon as you've set them aside.  I will say that as soon as you've flipped your coaster to signify that you're ready for the meat, the skewers come, and they come FAST.  It can get a little overwhelming at first, because they can fill up your plate in 15 minutes.  One last thing, the little appetizer breads are SO GOOD!!!
