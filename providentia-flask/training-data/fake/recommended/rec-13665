In an uncharacteristic move, I averted the famous wild maine blueberry pancakes (mistake..), and opted instead for the Brioche French Toast this morning-- guess it was the unusual toppings of carmelized bananas, pecans, and warm maple butter that lured me... French Toast was just average. Nothing spectacular, but not thaat bad to say it was disappointing. Just two thick slices of soft brioche, chunks of goooey banana, and plain pecans. (Points off-- I like my nuts served toasted or candied!) Â Also, the coffee is kinda bland. :( The good news is is that I did manage to sneak bites off my friends' plates. Hellooo, sugar-coated bacon! Mmm. And yes, the blueberry pancakes. Double mmm!! Fluffy and lightly sweet, with a fresh spongy texture. So. Next time, I'll just order the Blueberry Pancakes.
