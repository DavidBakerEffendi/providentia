A small menu is the mark of a good restaurant. Only about 5 or 6 entrees, I got the rib eye but I'd recommend the fish they have. Excellent. Every dish is made artfully with care, and is delicious. I had the pleasure of trying multiple small plate dishes and each one was better than the next. A must try is the calamari. Not fried. Cooked with some greens and a light summery sauce with a slight earthy flavor and no overpowering fishy taste from the squid. You wouldn't expect it. Wait service was very attentive, affable, and fairly knowledgeable. Wine selection is good. Atmosphere is modern, sleek, upscale (but not haughty) and comfortable. Great place for a date. My beautiful date treated me :) Also you could watch the game if you're inclined but its nowhere near a sports bar atmosphere. Show up if you're looking for a stimulating and sophisticated culinary experience, setting aside plenty of time for a good conversation and enjoyment of your food. Its that kind of place. A+ Edit: came back recently (before I published this review, which had 5 stars) and deducted one. It was a fairly busy night but my girlfriend and I were completely ignored by the host and all bartenders, who served other patrons around us who came to the bar after us. We walked out.
