What's important about America's cities are its neighborhoods.  Folks everywhere constantly gripe that the cities are too crowded, too dense, too costly. Not here. We know that Brooklyn is all about neighborhoods and Cheryl's is just the kind of place that makes this Prospect Height's neighborhood stand out. On our last visit, we ordered two very American hamburgers, cooked just like we like them, charbroiled; my spouse likes them medium juicy throughout. Make mine medium rare, with all the trimmings.  Cheryl and her staff already know that I also prefer her signature home made hot sauce to drape over the layer of already rich tasting beef. The fries are shoestring, and piled high. But if it's your first time there, you need to start with the mussels in white wine sauce. Plenty of local crusty bread accompanies this fine and delicately herbal broth.  Better yet, try the jerk chicken wings. Or just have both.  Then graduate to the Sea Bass Escaveche (if available). It's a whopping whole fish that's fried and served on the plate posing for what it was made to do--provide a sumptuous feast for Cheryl's neighbors. The drinks at Cheryl's are always generous. It's just Brooklyn hospitality. The restaurant is usually full, so if you are from Manhattan, just relax and enjoy.  This neighborhood knows how to live.
