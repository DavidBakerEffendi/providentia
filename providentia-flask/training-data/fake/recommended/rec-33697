Joya is one of my favorite Thai restaurants of all time.  I love the mussels and spicy noodles.  Although they may not use the highest quality ingredients, the dishes are full of flavor and extremely affordable.  Expect to wait for a table but the lively atmosphere and people watching will make the wait go by fast.  I wish we had a Joya on the West Coast.
