I absolutely love this place. 1. you get to try a lot of different dishes. 2. they were all really good. 3. the price is very reasonable for the quality of food 4. their menus rotate so you can go back and try a different menu. I tried their scallop menu which was amazing, but the menu has since changed. A friend of mine did try their farmer's market menu and the seafood menu and said both were amazing. Hoping the lamb menu will come back, I definitely wanted to try that one. I recommend this restaurant to all my friends and family.
