One thing I appreciate about restaurants is consistency.  I enjoy knowing what to expect each time I visit, and unfortunately, I can't say that Salt Creek Grille provides me with this.  I've come for both lunch and dinner, and the service and food has ranged anywhere from 2 stars to 4 stars, with my most recent being a 2-star lunch. As a carnivore, I can always go for a nice petit filet for lunch...nothing hits the spot more than a medium rare piece.  I've noticed that most restaurants will undercook your meat so that if it is not to your satisfaction, they can always heat it up.  However, when I get a well-done steak when I ask for a medium rare piece, the carnivore in me gets upset and cannot enjoy the wonderful meal taking place.  To their credit, we had a large group in their banquet room, so there were another 10 steaks they needed to cook, but I typically expect quality food the way I ask for it when I come to Salt Creek. I will note that their all-inclusive prix fixe dinners ($20) have never disappointed (especially for the price) and their calamari ($14) is always a nice way to appetize (is that a word?) with their happy hour drink specials between 4 and 6:30pm.
