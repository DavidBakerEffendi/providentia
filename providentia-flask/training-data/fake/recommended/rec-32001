I have nothing to complain about for this place, I love it! The food is great, the service is great. Gotta love a byo. Great prices and quantity, great place to go with a group. I recommend ordering your appetizers and then ordering your dinner once you have finished the apps because they are so fast with the food. Be prepared, this place is usually busy and they do pack you in, but it isn't meant to be a romantic one-on-one dinning experience.
