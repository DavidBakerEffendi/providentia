DELICIOUS! I was looking for wings in the Williamsburg area, and this place came up on Yelp. We ordered food to go (they don't deliver, unlike what it may say on Yelp), and we were sooo pleasantly surprised! I was really just looking for some greasy wings to satisfy my craving, but I got so much more! We ordered two orders of their hot wings, mac and cheese and the sweet potato fries. All of it was amazing! The wings were so juicy, and the mac and cheese was just perfect. It had a bite to it and a breadcrumb crumble on top. The sweet potato fries were out of this world I usually prefer regular fries, but, I have to say, these have converted me! Also, We showed up to pick up our order about 10 minutes early in hopes it would be ready. They threw in a slice of chocolate mousse cake because we had to wait! (extra points for that!) I cannot wait to go back and sit down to eat.
