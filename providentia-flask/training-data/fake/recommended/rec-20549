Grew up in this town. Used to eat here fairly often. Beats friendlies in my opinion. Pros: *burgers are decent *ice cream is pretty good! *Chocolate is good *Staff are nice (not the boss) *this place smells like a freezer/grill from heaven (makes sense when you walk in) Cons: *Since the sopranos everything has been over priced. It used to be a pretty cheap place. *Small *People seem to like that everything is sticky-i don't *they charge you for sprinkles. *skimpy on pickles Biased cons: *Owner is a dick (friends employed there) *They charge you for sprinkles. *Over priced as fuck
