As others have mentioned, this is a "traditional American Italian" restaurant. Good food, pretty good prices, but nothing wildly gourmet or innovative. That said, it is great for families -- parents who want nice service and a place they can take their kids. Staff is very nice. We've also ordered take-out/delivery. Delivery can be a little long depending on how busy they are. They are always accommodating for special requests -- i.e. "no garlic"
