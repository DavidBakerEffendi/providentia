I love this place. The staff are warm and welcoming and if you need or want suggestions they are quick to point out dishes you might enjoy. We come here fairly regularly and have enjoyed many different dishes and love the fact that it is Chinese Chinese food. The only disappointment I have had here is the soup which is overly salty but then again I just don't order soup anymore. There are so many dishes to try and the kitchen and staff are very accommodating
