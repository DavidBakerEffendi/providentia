I got a groupon for this place and finally decided to use it yesterday.  My boyfriend and I both got the vegetarian combo platter and it filled us up so much we couldn't order the soup.  The platter came with a delicious tabouli salad, two falafel, hummus, baba ganoush, pickled turnip strips, and pita.  Very delicious! The only thing was the disinterest flowing from the staff.  Not rude, they just didn't seem to care that I was in there.  It kept me from wanting to stay and try more things.  Next time, I'll get takeout.
