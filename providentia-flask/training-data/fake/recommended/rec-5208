For what this place is (a bodega with no seating and buffet-style menu options) it's great. $6.50 gets you three vegetable dishes over rice. The portions are pretty big, and the flavors are tremendous. Luckily I was here with my girlfriend so we were able to sample almost everything. I am really not sure on the proper name for each dish, but I can give you the rundown on the major ingredients in each: Black Bean Spinach Lentil Okra Cauliflower Potato Chick Peas IMO, the best tasting was the Chick Peas and Lentil, but honestly you can't go wrong. Also, AMAZING Chai Tea. Finally, no longer Cash Only, credit is accepted.
