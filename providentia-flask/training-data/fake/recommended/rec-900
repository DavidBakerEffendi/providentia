Came here on the way back from Atlantic City in April.  I got a pizza steak with provolone, mushrooms, and sweet peppers.  Added the smoked (whole) hot peppers.  VERY JUICY.  The provolone was sharper than I expected (a good thing), and the roll was on-point.  Did the Pat's vs. Geno's challenge and it wasn't even close.  I ate 1/2 a Geno's and TWO from Pat's (all in one sitting). Only criticisms:  mushrooms were chincy canned shrooms (booooo!!!) and when I order a pizza steak, I just assume it's gonna be green bell peppers...mine came with jarred sweet peppers (not cool, Pat's, not cool).  The second one I ordered was pizza steak (just adds some marinara) but i didn't get the shrooms and sweet peppers. It was still the best cheesesteak (cheese, bread, steak - really never had the steak be juicy before!) I've ever had.
