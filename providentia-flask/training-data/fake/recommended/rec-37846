Best Cajun food I've had outside New Orleans! Gumbo is just right with good flavor and spice.  A lot of people told me to try the trainwreck po boy, and the Muffalatta looked great. Simple, quick service. Beignets only available select days...Sunday being one of them, but they were all gone by the time we got there at 2pm. Next time we'll have to come for breakfast.  Very curious to see if they're even close to Cafe du Monde.
