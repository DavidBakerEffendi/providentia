This place is great for breakfast. We found it on Yelp after spending the night nearby in Vermont. It was late Sunday morning and there was about a 15 minute wait for a table. We were glad we waited it out since the food was definitely worth it. If I'm ever back in the area I would definitely return for breakfast or lunch.
