Went for the 5:30 PM Sunday Night Chef's tasting menu for $33. It was unbelievable worth it! In a 20 seat restaurant, we were seated immediately at a cozy table by the window. The 5 plates were: A Salad with heirloom carrots, radishes, chopped olives, and romaine lettuce Mussels in a Garlic Sauce with celery and peppers Kampachi, Raw, with rhubarb and foie gras Cobie, Grilled with edamamae Coconut Grits with Banana icecream, pan fried pineapple and cashews. Each dish was a work of art too, incredibly beautiful! There were two waitresses working, (Laura and an affable woman with curly brown hair who's name I didn't catch). Both were friendly and Laura was particularly matronly, keeping us hydrated after a "debaucherous" St. Patrick's Day. Thanks Laura! You da best! Watching each dish get plated for the small crowd was a delight and the two chefs (brothers?) were at ease in the simple, open kitchen. It was really cool to watch them work. I would go back Â to this place every Sunday, and certainly during the week. Full marks!
