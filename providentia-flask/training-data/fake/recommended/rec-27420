Love, Love, LOVE this place! Hands down my fav Mexican spot in the city.  Only reason it doesn't get a perfect 5 stars is the long wait (expect and hour wait when you go.  if it's less, bonus, but always go expecting a wait). That being said, the wait is WELL worth it.  There's plenty of local spots to chill and grab drinks nearby and the host will give you a ring once a spot has freed up for your party. Guac and chips are always a must for me.  And I'd love to say that everything on the menu is phenomenal, but truth be told, I've been too OBSESSED with their delicious chicken and fish tacos to ever try anything else.  The chicken is so perfectly seasoned (and overflowing) on their chicken tacos and the fish tacos are a delectably delicate alternative for when you're in the mood for lighter fare. Another must for those with an appreciation for spice would be the Habienero Infused Grapefruit Margaritas.  Be warned that they mean HOT with this drink, but it burns oh so good all the way down.  The waiter/waitress usually asks if you've ordered the drink before when you ask for it.     Fair warning, the spot is quite small and rustic (wooden benches, folding chairs, drink menu scrawled on a piece of cardboard), and the noise level can get rather loud, but when you're amongst friends, you'll love the cozy/rowdy atmosphere. All in all, this place is great and will surely be a staple in your arsenal of fav NYC restos.
