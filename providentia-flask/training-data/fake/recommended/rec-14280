Bo Ky is the perfect hole in the wall. A group of us used to come here on a weekly basis to basically catch up and eat comfort food. The duck here is awesome and we really enjoy the variety of intestines and cambodia noodles. There is no pretense of ambience. We are here for the quick service and cheap food. If my butt was not stuck out in SF, I would be parked here stuffing myself silly with noodles.
