Although I'm not sure it's worth $8, the bacon, egg and cheese biscuit is just so good.  Everything about it is satisfying.  The biscuit itself is delectable, the eggs are fluffy, and the bacon is perfectly cooked and substantive.  The frittata was the best I've ever had and has me believing in frittatas again.  If you're looking for simple and delicious, look no further.  Is it overpriced?  Of course.  But come on... you don't even know how to open the Pillsbury Grands biscuit tube.  Be prepared to pay a premium for familiar food you actually like, because it's not like you're going to make it yourself.
