The donkatsu ramen with kurai soup base(spicy miso) was pretty good...a nice little ramen house and the only one in center city that I'm aware of(there's a ramen bar in upenn area, haven't gone to that one yet)...service was fast but I went there at night so I'm not sure how it is when it's actually busy...we received our ramen within 5min of ordering and the menu is pretty much with meat(donkatsu)or without, short and to the point. The price is affordable considering its a big bowl of deliciousness! I recommend getting the large bowl if you're really hungry, it will definitely fill you up...price difference between reg. and large is a few bucks(large bowel was about $10)...the atmosphere was relaxed and they played j-pop type music in the background but it wasn't a distraction from having a conversation. Great spot to go with a small group of friends and if you have a craving for good ramen. Also it's cash only here so don't forget to hit the ATM.
