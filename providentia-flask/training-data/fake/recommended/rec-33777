Come here often, and the servers will be sure to remember you. The service is a little eh, (sometimes you have to flag them over to tell them you're ready to order) but they really are sweet! Â Pho here is delish along with the summer rolls and the tea they serve you is just as good. Mekong River is very clean and visually appealing unlike a lot of the other pho places I have been to. Their bar is also really appealing too! In the mood for dessert here..order the flan!
