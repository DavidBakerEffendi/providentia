Live close to this place, and since I'm tired of Eli's on Whitney, I thought I'd try another local joint. Was crowded on a Friday night - especially the bar area. Our original plan was to eat at the bar or one of the lounge tables and nosh on some apps and drinks. However, we sat at a table since the area was full. Since we weren't able to eat at the bar, we were hoping for their bar menu, since the portions are a bit smaller and we can share. The waitress was very accommodating and let us order off the bar menu, which they don't normally do. We had the meatballs, spicy calamari, a flat bread pizza with onions, mushrooms, and goat cheese, and their special Jerusalem artichoke soup. My favorite was the soup, with a nice, creamy texture and lots of flavor. The meatballs were the least impressive. I could have taken them off our order and wouldn't have missed them. The lava cake dessert was delicious. A soft, warm cake with gooey chocolate running down the plate. The berry gelato does not compliment the dessert. Something like this always goes with a classic vanilla. Only downside was being seated right in front of the kitchen doors and having waiters rushing in and out with dish orders. I will ask to be seated somewhere else next time. Overall, it's a dependable, inexpensive, and centrally located restaurant. When you don't want to drive far but don't want to cook, it's the place for you. There are far better restaurants around, but you'll always be leaving satisfied from Mickeys.
