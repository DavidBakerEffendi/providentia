The service is so attentive and nice. The Rodizio is amazing everything they bring to you is fresh and amazing in flavor! The best ever. The garlic steak, pork and cheese or steak and cheese is just out of this world! I've been here plenty of times and never did the Rodizio but it's a must, at this place! You will not be disappointed? I promise!
