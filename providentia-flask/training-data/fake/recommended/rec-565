The price is the saving grace for this place. After the long wait (I expected it, but still wasnt happy about it) and after sitting down I waited another 15 mins just to get water (honestly?), I was just happy to get my check and see that its was a cheap, good, hearty meal. My friend and I had the classic meatballs w/ classic sauce and polenta under. Ordered myself a glass of wine to relax after the wait. It was all good, definitely much needed heavy food after all that wait. This would be perfect winter food. If you're in the area and have time to kill, I'd recommend it. Its cheap and it will fill you up. Don't expect amazing service on a busy night. We literally heard 3 wait staff come around asking who ordered the sangria. Yup, 3 of them. Just a bit unorganized. And its SO loud in here. If you're not ready to shout to get your friend to hear you, look elsewhere.
