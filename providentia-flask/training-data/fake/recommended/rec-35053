The best bar b q ever!  We each had the sampler:  brisket, pulled pork, sausage, baby back ribs & St. Louis ribs.  They have 4 delicious bar-b-q sauces, but none were needed--the meat was done perfectly.  Whatever is used to barbecue the meat was fabulous. The mac and cheese is to die for--absolutely fantastic!   The cole slaw is vinegar based--no mayo.  Also fabulous.  Very good homemade potato salad.  And, again, excellent corn bread.   Matt answered any questions we had regarding food and preparation. Full bar, wines, beers on tap and sangria.   So much food, we did not even think of dessert. Next time we will get the mac & cheese and ribs and share! Worth the trip from Bergen County.
