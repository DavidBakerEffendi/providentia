Excellent date night spot! My husband and I had such a lovely evening here. While other reviewers noted slow service, we appreciated not feeling rushed or interrupted constantly throughout dinner. We get enough of that home with the kids lol. Nora was lovely and seemed to take pride in every plate she brought to the table. We really felt like we were invited into someone's (beautifully decorated) home for dinner. The food was awesome and the plating was done with so much care and attention to detail. I am normally sheepish about pulling out my phone to take pics, but I couldnt resist. I got the Chicken Shish which was well above expecations. The chicken was moist and perfectly seasoned. My husband had the Branzini and even though I dont like fish I wanted to take a bite so badly! This is a "dont miss" in the area, we will definitely Â be going back.
