I've been to Pio Pio 8 twice now and both experiences were great.  I always get the whole chicken ($16) and a side ($5).  Not only is the value great, but the chicken is always seasoned well and moist.  I bought two friends with me this time and both are now fans. I would also recommend the Matador combo meal, which is HUGE and only $34.  You get a whole chicken, sausage/fries plate, rice & beans, and a avocado salad.  It's plenty of food for two people and you'll still probably have leftovers.
