Nice place when you come in, clean as far as I can see with my eyes. The chicken is hot and tender though a little bland, I'm thinking just salt pepper and flour. Wings are very good, no feather pieces like in some other fry joints. The biscuits were terrible. Flavorless and looked and tasted from a microwave. I would like to get here when they first open in the day to see them prepping. Until then, chicken yes. Other items I don't know just yet.
