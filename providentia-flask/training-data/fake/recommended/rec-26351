Best lunch in NYC. Hard not to try Bouley when they offer an exquisite five course lunch for $55.   We were greeted with smiles and service throughout was impeccable. The restaurant looks the part, with its high ceilings and upscale elegant European feel. The cooking is classical French with a modern flair. The black cod was superb, the meats big on flavors and all accompanied by beautifully prepared vegetables, herbs and spices. The textures and flavors throughout were spot on and I simply adored the combination of oyster and kiwi that brought out the smells and flavors of the sea. We ended our amazing lunch with bread and cheese from the carts, followed by two desserts, including a moist and succulent chocolate soufflé. A special mention for what may be the most delicate white chocolate mousse I've ever tasted. A square inch of this fluffy delight dissolves in the mouth leaving just a sprinkle of chocolate dust on the tongue. Overall excellent value for money and a great experience that one should not miss out on. American Chef David Bouley is no stranger to restaurant stardom, so no surprise that this Michelin restaurant sets such high standards. Note: obviously, early booking and jacket required here
