Our first visit was much more successful than this weekends.  There is a "grazing menu". Which is a tasting of various dishes.  You can choose 3, 4 or 5 (including a sweet course).  Prices ranging from $70-$120 per person.  The waiter informed us they were bigger than appetizer portions but smaller than dinner portions. We had a 7PM seating and they had already run out of 2 of the main protein options which were  closer to main dishes and we were left able to select smaller options, which were considered more as appetizers.  The waitron forgot to mention that those plates would be smaller and not as filling.  We ended up spending over $200 per couple and my wife and all guests were still quite hungry after the meal ended.  We did tell the manager and he did say that the waiter should have told us and should have known to recommend the larger 4 course tasting.... It's a relatively small restaurant with limited seating, so I am not sure how they ran out that quickly.  Poor planning on their part.  Also, the flavors of the dishes were not as good as I did recall. We were also quite disappointed that no one informed us of the closing if the wine store....  Luckily other couples brought wine but half the fun used to be having the ability to go into the wine store, tasting and selecting a new bottle to try with your meal. It could have been an off night because we did enjoy it so much the first time but the second visit was such a disappointment , especially for the price point.  I am not opposed to spending the money but this visit was way off of expectations. I believe this will be our last visit here.
