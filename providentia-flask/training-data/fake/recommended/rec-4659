I had a great meal here this past Saturday. I ordered the fried mozzarella (which was wrapped in prosciutto and then fried, YUMM!), Nini's house salad, grilled shrimp with corn polenta and an apple dumpling for dessert. Everything was well prepared and delicious. It is a small restaurant but it has real charm. The other 3 in my party all equally enjoyed their food. The menu changes monthly so that's nice because it gives you even more incentive to return. The BYOB is nice too because it helps keep the cost down. The service was personal and non intrusive which i kind of liked. I will definitely be back and I am actually surprised there aren't more reviews for this place.
