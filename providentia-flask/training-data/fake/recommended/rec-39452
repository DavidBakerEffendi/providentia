I can't get enough of this place. FABULOUS thai food... and it's relatively cheap. The lemongrass chicken is something to sing about, seriously. Oh and the best part - if you're there waiting for a takeout order, they treat you to complimentary jasmine tea. How nice is that?! Service is quick and they never are full - so my friends and I always easily snag a table. Definitely try this with your pals if you're in the area. It's a cute spot and affordable.
