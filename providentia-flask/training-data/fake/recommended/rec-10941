Maybe they are working out their kinks! We arrived at 7:45 or so, were told it was a 30-minute wait, had a lovely beer at the bar and watched the sun start to set. After about 25 minutes, we were seated on the beachy deck, and our food came about 10-15 minutes after we ordered. Delicious, nice portions and a gorgeous sunset. We will be back!
