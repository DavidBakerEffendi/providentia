Any restaurant that prides itself on cheese, meat, and bread is a winner in my book. Enter Emporio. I had the prosciutto and arugula pizza and it was divine. The crust was the right amount of fluffy and crispy, the meat salty, the cheese tart, and the arugula deliciously peppery. And the size of the pizza was quite generous, especially for the price ($18). I would have been able to describe the burrata appetizer had the waitress remembered to bring it out, but the meal and general ambience made up for it (think: sexy candlelight). I would definitely eat here again.
