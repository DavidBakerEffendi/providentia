I had one of the worst dining experience in my 8 years in the city at Kefi on New Years Eve. They advertised a Fixed Price menu for a very reasonable $39.95 plus $15 wine pairing. Several of my friends were interested, so we made a reservation for 7. We sat down to eat and they brought us bread. When we went to order... 4 of us requested the Fixed Price and 3 decided to order a la carte. The waitress ducked away and came back to tell us that all 7 had to order the fixed price. No explanation and nowhere on any of the advertisements -- online or when I made the reservation-- did it mention that the entire table had to order the menu... We asked to see a manager, saying we wouldn't have made the reservation if we knew this information. He refused to give us a reason, quoting "policy" and then when we said 4 of us wanted it and the other 3 didn't, he said... "well maybe if 5 of you wanted to order it I could compromise." At one point the manager even said, "There is no good reason that all of you had to order it.... It's just policy..." There was never any apology or even suggestion of accommodating us. Earlier, when we were at the bar, the service was also painfully slow -- it took roughly 15 minutes just to close my tab. I ended up ordering just an entree -- the rabbit and flat pasta. The food was good, the service continued to be poor. The waitresses steered clear of our table, we very rarely had water at the table. Despite the fact that the food was good, it didn't make up for the horrible service.
