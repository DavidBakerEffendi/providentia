A good restaurant in which I will gladly return during my next trip to NY. Let's get started with the only negative point: it's quite noisy, probably because the restaurant is not that big. I ordered a pork hock and I was prepared to a tasty but super greasy dinner. To my surprise, it was incredibly delicious and not greasy at all! The service was remarkably good, and the waiters very kind and helpful.
