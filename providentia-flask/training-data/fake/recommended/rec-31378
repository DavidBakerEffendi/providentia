Went with 3 friends a few weeks ago. The staff was really friendly. They were a bit short-handed so the owners were waiting tables. They seemed a bit overwhelmed by it but it was charming. Great location and excellent food. Not fussy at all. Great option for brunch in New Haven when you're not in the mood to wait in line at the Pantry or the like.
