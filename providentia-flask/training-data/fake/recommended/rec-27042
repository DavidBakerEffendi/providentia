My family and I have dined here many times.  Most recently we dined last night.  We started off two orders of the Appetizer Special (shrimp, grilled zucchini, and grilled eggplant over marinara sauce).  It was delicious, but each order only contained three servings, which is a bit disappointing for the price $10.95.  For our entrees, my husband and I were both planning on ordering the salmon, but the waitress informed us that they ran out of salmon.  Really, at 7 pm on a Sunday night, you're out of salmon.  Really disappointed there.  I later heard her tell a child at the next table that they ran out of coke.  I'm not even sure how such a thing happens.  But back to the entrees.  I decided to try the Zuppa Di Pesce (mixed seafood, tilapia, and tomato sauce over linguine).  It was a generous portion and was delicious.  I even have dinner for tonight!  My husband ordered the Salmone Morechiara (with clams and shrimp in tomato sauce) with tilapia instead of salmon since they were out.  He enjoyed it.  My parents ordered the Veal Parmigiana and 16oz NY Strip Steak.  Mom loved the veal, I did too, as I had a few bites of her food.  I will be ordering this next time.  Dad greatly disliked the steak, and we were hearing about it all night.  Very fatty and chewy. The restaurant has two parts, a casual part and a fine dining part, but the same menu is available in both parts with the exception that you cannot order pizza in the fine dining section.  I'll have to try their pizza one of these days since I've heard good things.  The Pollo Della Casa is quite tasty too, as I've ordered that on previous visits. The servers are mostly quite friendly, but the service is a bit on the slow side, so leave yourself plenty of time for dinner. Whoops, almost forgot to mention that it's BYOB!  That's a great perk if you ask me.
