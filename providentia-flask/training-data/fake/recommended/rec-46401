Incredible food.  Hands down best steak ever. I had proposed to my fiance this weekend and had sent an email with my reservation requesting, "nothing more than a quiet place to dine."   They gave us a corner booth with plenty of room and a fantastic view of the place.   Server: Charming, very casual but respectful.  He was very knowledgable and did not push anything.  When i had left the table to wash my hands in the restroom he approached me and leaned in saying, "so did you ask her yet?!"  i quickly responded she said yes, and I was so pleased to see that not only was he made aware of the situation, but was genuinely interested!   Food:  Steak was unreal.  appetizers complimented the food nicely.  Dessert was perfect.  ( I typically don't eat sweets, but couldn't stay away from the chocolate cookie with toasted marshmallow). Drinks:  We went to Milk and Honey after dinner for a night cap, and they didn't come close to quality, taste and craftsmanship of the drinks at Marc Forgione.  She had the summer sangria which was nice, and I had their version of a  Sazerac and a banana infused jameson for dessert.  I was skeptical about banana and jameson, but server reassured and rightfully so. Unreal. Note: Milk and Honey, though very good, their Sazerac did not even come close. Best meal I've had.
