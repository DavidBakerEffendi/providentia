As my search for amazing nyc Thai food approached the 10 year mark, I was SO pleased and grateful to have found Bodhi Tree after reading the amazing yelp reviews. i have never been disappointed by a meal here, and after trying numerous items on the menu, I'm always torn between reordering a loved dish or being adventurous and trying something new (which of course is delicious).   Order the drunken noodles, basil shrimp, PAD THAI is a must!!    The pumpkin curry is so tasty, but definitely has spice to it.   Try not to go on a weekend night as the place is packed but its never too long of a wait.  The staff is super friendly but can get flustered with large crowds.   Is it bad that I eat here once a week?
