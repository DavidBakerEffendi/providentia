Really good! We stopped by on a Wednesday night because we saw they had $1 oysters at the bar. $1 oysters win for me any night of the week :) The bartender was great. Really attentive, offered suggestions. We had oysters (delish and fresh), the cauliflower toast (really good! definitely try), the egg and caviar toast....this one I did not love but I think it was just my personal opinion. I am not a huge caviar fan and the fishiness of it ruined the taste for me. If you like caviar, you will probably love it! And then the grand finale...the Hamachi...holy crap this was good! I am going back for that alone. Fresh raw hamachi with an avocado sauce...DO IT. I really enjoyed the ambiance, and the food. I am only giving it 4 stars because the prices are a bit high for what you get. Especially the drinks. My boyfriend got a draft beer, it came in a highball glass and it was $10. For draft! Also, I think $13 is a lot for all of the specialty cocktails since the pour was not exactly heavy.
