When did this place get listed?  I tried to write a review for it a few months ago, but couldn't find it!  Weird, cuz some of the reviews are dated from a while back...Anyway, here goes: For all the travel that I do and my love of Italian places, this place is very good.  I've had the eggplant parm and also the PENNE ALLA VODKA CON GAMBERONI - which is penne with pink vodka sauce & shrimp, and they had a salmon penne one day that was awesome also.  3 times in, 3 times completely satisfied.  They serve their breadsticks with their own garlic basil olive oil dip, which is very good also and the portions aren't ridiculously large, but very filling.  Great lunch specials. Parking - probably only downside, it's all street parking or neighborhood, but it wasn't that crowded around lunch, so I was fine the days I went. Service was nothing to complain about, but nothing to write home about either.  That's not a bad thing for me though, they were friendly and I got exactly what I was expecting :)  Thumbs up to the waitstaff. One thing that's awesome about a lot of NJ restaurants is that you can bring your own wine and have them cork it for you.  I love that.  Can't wait to be out in the east coast for work again!
