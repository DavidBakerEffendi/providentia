After reading the review from yelp, I had the pleasure of visiting the restaurant last night with my husband.   Unlike other Japanese sake bars they had a regular bar area.  So you wouldn't see them cooking behind the bar area.  Whole place was pretty packed.  Fortunately  we were lucky to be seated right away.  We set by the bar at our request.  Customer service starting from entering the restaurant to leaving the restaurant was very friendly and attentive. We ordered chazuke, beef tongue, skewers , croquette, tuna collar(duck, chicken liver, chicken meat ball, ..) For drinks I had the Onigoroshi and my husband had the  coors light beer.  All the skewers were very tasty.  Especially the duck skewer.  That was juicy and tasted very mild.  I was bit surprised since I don't eat duck.  I loved it.  Only thing I would not get again was the chazuke.  I had this dish at every Japanese restaurant I have been to.  Chazuke had a really strong taste that I was not into.  I usually finish and want more but this time I couldn't even eat it after few spoonful of tasting it.  But the rest was great.  I loved the casual friendly atmosphere.  By the way if you love sake, they will pour to the brim.  No joke!!!  :). I will definitely return and recommend to my friends.  ^.^
