Let me preface this by saying that, as someone who has worked in the food industry, I tend to give restaurants the benefit of the doubt and I like to support local businesses. I've been to Our House twice before this and neither time was I impressed with the service or the food, but last weekend one of our buddies called to make a reservation for eight of us and two small children at Our House.  There was their first mistake: if you do not have enough staff to take a large party, don't do it.   When we arrived on time, there was another large party already seated and they did not have our table set up with the right number of chairs.  We waited about ten minutes before all the adults had their seats and longer before the kids had their high chairs.  This was annoying, but I would have been ready to let it go. We waited an HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTES before any food appeared at our table. No bread, no anything.  By that time, the kids were getting antsy and the salads and fried pickles that we ordered as apps were no longer going to cut it.  I ended up having to take my kid home for bedtime before the entrees came out.  My husband called me at 9pm (our reservation was at 6:30) to tell me that they just left the restaurant after waiting 30 minutes for the waitresses to run their cards. At no point did any one apologize.  At no point were we comped anything.  It was as if they had no idea how ridiculous the wait had been.  Despite how tasty the fried pickles were, I won't be coming back here.
