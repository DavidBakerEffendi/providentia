Amazing time at Basso 56! From the second we walked in we knew we were going to love it. You step down four steps into a cozy basement that is well lit, intimate, and fresh. There is coat check which is a nice touch since it is so small and you wouldn't want to have to mess with your coat at the table. My friend and I both had excellent meals! The gratis bruschetta was wonderful to start with and was a great lead in to both of our dishes. I had the bucattini and she had the pea fettuccine. Both were wonderful and ample portion sizes. We finished our meal with the tiramisu which was yummy! It had chunks of melty chocolate in it and was garnished with strawberries and apple. Beautiful presentation. My only (very slight) compliant would be the weak pour in our liquor drinks. Wasn't bad though... just could have been stronger! Finally - Alexsander. Oh sweet Alexsander. I believe he's a manager but he was a waiter for the evening which was a treat!
