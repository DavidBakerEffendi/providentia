I have never liked Ethiopian food until I ate at Almaz...now I can't stop eating there! For those who are vegetarian - go to Almaz & get the vegetarian combination today...you will not regret it. Doro tibs (chicken) is also delicious. It's BYOB, so bring a few beers to wash down the spicy food. If you have room, the Ethiopian coffee is a great way to end the meal.
