Yeah, it's worth the trip.  I haven't had a problem with rude service, but I'd still probably put up with it if I did.  I really detest the sugary curries and sauces that plague a lot of the Thai restaurants in the city, and this place is a refuge from that.  And there is a vegetarian menu...you just have to ask for it; they won't offer it up front.
