There isn't much praise I can't heap upon Sophies. They get everything right. The food is amazing and there's too many different things on a single visit to really capture the breath of this place. The highlights: 1. Cuban sandwiches 2. Arroz con pollo 3. Empanadas 4. Green Sauce 5. Green Sauce (not a typo the hype is real). The staff here has service down to a science. I literally dream of sophies every week even though I know my heart can't take it
