My bf and I were dying to try this place because of the rave reviews on Yelp.. Fish is in a picturesque location the small streets give this restaurant a vintage feel. The appearance was beautiful; from the benches outside the restaurant to the d√©cor..As far as the food overall CRAP! It all tasted like greasy bar food. We started off with the "Red White and Blue" appetizers which is actually 6 oysters/ clams a PBR which is one of the cheapest beers it might as well have been a Naughty Ice, or house wine which tasted like cheap supermarket wine. The oysters were the smallest ones we had ever seen in our entire lives the oyster meat was literally the size of a nickel. I guess that's why it only cost $8.00. The calamari we ordered tasted like cheap bar food we could not taste calamari all we tasted was greasy deep fried batter. Its like they haven't changed their oil in months cost was $14.00. The $18.00 Lobster roll tasted like a spoonfull of seafood salad from Western beef on a slice of Wonder bread, there were even pieces of Lobster shell inside! However they did decorate the plate nicely with one slice of tomato and lettuce. We used the salad as a degreaser to offset the oily calamari. After dropping $60.00 we both decided that we were happy to have tried this place out but we will never recommend it nor eat here ever again. We left the place feeling GROSS!
