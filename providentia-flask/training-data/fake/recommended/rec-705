Picture this: 9am on a Saturday morning, zero line and a fresh delivery of bread arriving at the exact moment I pull up a stool at the counter. It's as if all the stars alligned at that exact moment. It's plain and simple; roast pork served warm on a fresh roll with broccoli rabe and provolone. You've read it on a thousand reviews and I'm here to sum it up. The pork is tender and sweet, the broccoli rabe is cooked well and it all lays on top of hand sliced provolone served inside a hero roll. Is it delcious? Incredibly so. Had there been a long wait would it have been worth it? Maybe not. The service was prompt and friendly and I'd be sure to visit again. Time it right, order early and enjoy your sandwich!
