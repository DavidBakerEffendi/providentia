I've had a lot of halal food from vendors and this is definitely the best spot with only 1 other vendor by 120 Broadway being any competition. So after finally finding this spot with only a few people in line, I got to taste the greatness that my nose was smelling earlier. I got a mix of chicken and lamb with everything on it, and they gave me some small containers with extra white sauce and hot sauce. Extra white sauce is an necessity. Â  The chicken was good but it tastes much better with a good amount of white sauce. The lamb on the other hand just tastes good regardless. Unlike most other vendors, you also get pita bread here and you get a large portion of food. I shared some of mine and I still didn't finish it all in one sitting. This is definitely a great place to get lunch or some dinner since you get a lot of bang for your buck.
