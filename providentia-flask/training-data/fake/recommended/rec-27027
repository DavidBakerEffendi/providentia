Think of what you'd expect from a typical breakfast diner....this is it. Fairly priced, fast, pleasant and attentive service that serves good and properly cooked portions.Typical food options with a few original creations that are creatively named and prepared. Overall my experience was good and rewarding. I'll definitely return. Orange juice is more like orange creamsicle.
