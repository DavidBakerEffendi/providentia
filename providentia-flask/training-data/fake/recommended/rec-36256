Okay, the place is pricey and hyped, but ya know what, they do great food with class.   I've only ever been for lunch which is a mix of the suits and ladies who lunch, but that's to be expected at a place like this. I always stick with what a restaurant is known for so we did classic bistro fare.  The escargot, steak frites, and steak tartar were all spot on.  Nothing about them was original, but they were all executed flawlessly and the service was impeccable despite the restaurant being a zoo. I will definitely be back.
