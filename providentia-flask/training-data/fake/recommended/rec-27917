The ambiance (small, crowded, and noisy) is not much to write home about but I loved the food, and I'm not even especially crazy about meatballs.   4 meatballs & sauce are $7 and then you can have them over a side for $5 (options include pastas, mashed potatoes, polenta, risotto, and various veggies).  For this option, all the meatballs have to be the same variety.  This is a pretty filling meal and reasonably priced at $12.   They also offer various hero sandwiches, meatball sliders (you can mix and match these) and salads.   My husband and I each had meatballs over rigatoni pasta with parmesan cream sauce; he had classic beef, I had chicken (yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…).   Other options are spicy pork and vegetarian.   I wish they had some more creative options like salmon or lamb.  They do have a daily special. I really enjoyed my dish.  Even without the meatballs, it was a great pasta dish.  The rigatoni were cooked perfectly al dente and the parmesan cream sauce was rich and absolutely delicious.  The meatballs were very tasty too and made it a much heartier and more filling dish. We also shared an ice cream sandwich for dessert ($5) (yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…).  You choose a cookie flavor (you can have different ones for the top and bottom cookies) and an ice cream flavor.  We had chocolate chip cookies with brown sugar ice cream.  The ice cream:cookie ratio was a little too high but other than that it was fantastic.  The cookies were soft and perfectly chewy with lots of chocolate and I absolutely loved the brown sugar ice cream, which is a unique flavor. This is on my short list of places to return to on future trips to NY.
