One of the best sundubu I had! I got the mixed seafood and beef sundubu in regular spiciness. The waitresses were pretty attentive. I had dropped my napkin on the floor and they had given me a new one before I could ask for a new one. However minus one star for the side fish dish which wasn't crunchy (but it usually is whenever I come here)!
