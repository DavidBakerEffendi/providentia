Stopped-in to eat here with a friend who got off of work.  One word sums this up: DELICIOUS! We ordered the chicken lunch special for $9.  This came with a bunch of sides - tostones, platanos maduros, rice and beans, and a couple of others.  I opted for the rice and beans along with a side of maduros.  We also received a pretty hefty salad.  You will leave FULL for $9.  And the food tastes great here. One thing to note:  Ask for a side of the salsa verde!  It's a blend of jalepeno and spices...it's FREE.  What a great kick this gave to the already delicious-tasting chicken!
