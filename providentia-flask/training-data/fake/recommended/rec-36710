Adorable, cramped, perfectly located far into the neighborhood enough that you can sit on the sidewalk and not be consumed with exhaust fumes. I had the beet salad and was impressed by how large it was by NYC restaurant standards. Major points for having a sink outside the bathroom so you don't have to wait to wash your hands.
