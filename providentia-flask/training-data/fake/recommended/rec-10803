Had a nice group dinner at this restaurant. I went with the namesake of the Peking Duck, and it was cooked just right and very flavorful. I was also very happy with the larger amount of meat to vegetable ratio. The ambience is nice, the service was good, and the one fault I found was in their fortune cookies. They were more philosphical wisdom cookies than fortune cookies, and that just annoyed me enough that the restaurant lost a star. Looking at the reviews on Yelp I can't help but notice that people are complaining about the prices there. Considering that the eat in plates are served family style, I considered the pricing very very reasonable. Overall, a great experience.
