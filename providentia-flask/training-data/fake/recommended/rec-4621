Been here for lunch twice and dinner once, eager to return soon for an omakase   Food (4/5) A deep respect for Nature's zairyou is embedded in the use of noto sea salt, in kamado rice cooking and their culinary art, whether robata-yaki or not. Star dishes: a. Robata-yaki: cod fillet in saikyo miso, kamo skewer, kobe beef, shishito, nagaimo and onigiri b. salmon kamameshi: soft rice topped with creamy steamed salmon and juicy roe   c. others: chawan mushi, tsukune, yuba gyoza (somewhat greasy, not recommended as a last course), not the largest selection of sake but fair d. Lunch sets: grilled cod, sukiyaki, a mini katsu don (berkshire!) is always a crispy-soft addition   Ambience (4.5/5) a homey feeling in general, beautifully decorated, particularly cute around Tanabata time, the corner for free tsukemono ( though I'm not a fan of hard boiled eggs ) is thoughtful, make sure to sit by the robata counter at dinner without which the robata-ya experience is hardly complete Service (5/5) sweet and exceptionally attentive servers who hung up our tanzaku with great patience
