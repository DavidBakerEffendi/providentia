Dear Cheesesteak Lovers: I won't say which $9 cheesesteak I liked better. Stop being a wuss, and reading endless reviews about whether Pat's or "the other place" is better.  Order one from each.  You know you want to.  Eat both cheesesteaks back-to-back, and decide for yourself.  MAN UP. Sincerely, K. W.
