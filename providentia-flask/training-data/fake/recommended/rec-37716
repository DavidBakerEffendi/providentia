Having eaten here 3xs now everything has been remarkable so far. Fresh, earthy flavors. It takes dishes you think you know but elevates them; falafel, hummus, homefries all sound so basic but here they are phenomenal. Start with complimentary grilled pita and tahini. Zizi takes hummus to another level: creamy and luscious. Their true flavor lingers on your palate. I think they've forever ruined me for Sabra. Homefries Armada with spanish smoked paprika were perfect both eat-in and delivery. The 5 Hour Bureka was absolutely delicious: crispy phyllo dough stuffed wrapped around slow-cooked oxtail. The phyllo even held up during delivery. Everybody is super friendly and they are hitting the right tone for a new establishment finding its voice in a crowded neighborhood of eateries. These guys will surely be around for the long haul with their delicious food.
