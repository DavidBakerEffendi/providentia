After using the handiest, dandiest tool for searching and finding the best local hot-spots, Yelp, I landed on Malatesta - a quaint, charming, and cozy little spot in the West Village (I think) area. With no surprising shock that the wait would be a solid hour, we had some drinks to warm us before. Although our table wasn't ready yet when we first arrived, the hostess was more than accommodating and friendly. The not-so-terrible ten minutes of waiting paid off, as we were given the bad-ass, VIPesque table suited for large groups. There was about 10 of us and it couldn't have gone smoother. The thought a large group on a Friday night in NYC for dinner just screams chaotic, but the service was fast and diligent. Wine was served and bruschetta was delish. I couldn't pass up the gnocchi, which usually isn't my style. Though rich and decadent, I enjoyed every bite that I could physically finish without feeling like a big beluga whale. Their menu denotes a very basic, but solid Italian feel. Nothing too fancy or over-ambitious - just your basic pastas. But from the table chatter, everyone loved their pasta dish. All in all, this restaurant catered to a somewhat difficult, last minute request and was responsible for creating a wonderful, lovely evening for me and my friends. When back in the NY, I will certainly revisit Malatesta!
