Found my gem in Williamsburg! Food, drinks, service were all great. Arrived around 8pm on a Friday night with a friend and didn't have to wait for a table. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the specials. Portions were just perfect - not too big and not too small. The atmosphere is hipster but not pretentious. Dark wood inside, warm romantic lighting, noise level perfect for conversation. They seem to be known for their meatloaf which really did live up to it's expectations. Just the right sweetness and was perfectly moist and not dry at all. The fried brussel sprouts are the best I ever had, tossed in a delicious caper vinaigrette, bacon and parmesan cheese and all balanced each other perfectly. The warm chocolate cake was the best I ever had. The center was not only warm moist and gooey running of dark deep chocolate but the cake itself was light and airy. On top was a small puddle of a little bit salty caramel sauce. Incredible! I will be back more than once.
