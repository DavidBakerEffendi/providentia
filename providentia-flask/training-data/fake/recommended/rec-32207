Any place that serves a truffle butter burger is A-OK in my book.  The service was friendly and I love all the sketches along the wall.  I have tried three different burgers so far (this place remains my monthly cheat day) and I have not be disappointed.  I took my boyfriend here and he can't stop talking about it, I found out that he often brings co-workers here for lunch.  This place is amazing and I really hope they never change.
