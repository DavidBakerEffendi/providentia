Miso Glazed Salmon is amazing.  I order it pick-up or delivery on a monthly basis.  Also really good is the wonton soup.  Comes in a huge container-- can be two meals.  Their food is fresh, healthy and delicious.  They are cash only if you walk in, so I use seamlessweb to order if I want to use a credit card.  Service can be slow if you are dining there in person.
