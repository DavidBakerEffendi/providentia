What the hell happened? Bf and I were excited to come back, had a GREAT brunch here months back, but today: I was served undercooked eggs on a stale English muffin and the amount of food on the plate was half that from my last experience. I'm not a big eater and I left hungry. And they were turning people away at 20 til 3. Had it taken any longer--or had we wanted to spend more time there over another drink or more food--it was obvious we would have been booted out. So sad. Bf just looked at me shocked, remarked "that was awful" as soon as we got out the door. New owner? Summer slump? So bad and far from last experience that I wouldn't try again any time soon.
