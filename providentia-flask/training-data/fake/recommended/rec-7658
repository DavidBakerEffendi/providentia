During a stay in New York in December, I was looking forward to a meal at Café Sabarsky after several New York friends had recommended it. But unfortunately, the  breakfast I had there turned out to be a big disappointment and put a damper on the start of our first day of holiday vacation. Food was not prepared properly (for example, the eggs were not cooked as described on the menu) and some things did not come out at all (we were told they were out of some things that were listed on the menu--but told this after our food arrived and we inquired about it). It took about 30 minutes for us to get coffee after we ordered, despite the fact that the café was not that crowded; when it did arrive, it was underwhelming, a big surprise for a Viennese cafe.   As others mentioned, the service was also problematic. We had a hard time getting help when we needed it and some of the servers didn't communicate very well. That's forgivable, but what's not is the sarcastic attitude of one female server when we inquired about a food item that did not come out of the kitchen. The café itself is gorgeous and the Neue Galerie itself is worth a visit. For the menu prices, however, Café Sabarsky can do better and my experience there does make me inclined to visit Gutenbrunner's other restaurants.
