This is the only place I've gone back and forth on in such a wild way.  I recently went to Nauna's with my kids and my parents.  We purposely went early (because of both kids and parents), and we were the only people there - soon to be followed by many more.   My parents both ordered dinners (veal and chicken) and it was a split vote.  My dad loved the veal.  My mom is convinced that the chicken was cooked in a microwave.  I doubt that's the case, but maybe it was reheated in one?  She said it was really tough, and she expected it to be poached to a melty tenderness (not that it stopped her from taking the two left-over cutlets home to use in a pasta salad the next day).  Anyway, a split vote.   We ordered a  slice each for the kids.  Should be safe, right?   We all got our dinners, but no slices.  It took almost 15 more minutes for the slices to get there.  Why?  Why?  The waitress apologized, but what the heck?  When they got to us they weren't even hot, so don't go telling me it takes time to bake a pie.   Anyway, bad - I was calling a server over to tell them to forget the slices when they arrived.   I decided to try the puttanesca again for two reasons: 1) I love savory and 2) I figured maybe it had been a bad night when I first ordered it.  It was definitely less SALTY this time.   It was the pasta that was disappointing.  Totally overcooked, and it was bland, tasteless.  Honestly, it was the kind of pasta I remember being served in school.   Totally disappointing experience.  I guess delivery is the safer way to go.  At least all the food gets there at once.
