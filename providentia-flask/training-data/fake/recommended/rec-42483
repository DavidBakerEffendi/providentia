I can only comment on the falafel pita sandwich and baklava, which is completely out of this world. Once you taste this dessert, all others will be judged by it.  Sweet, flaky and delicious, you will be transported to another planet, and then you'd better head to the gym.  Seriously, it's a big indulgence, but you only need to eat a small bit of baklava to be satisfied, and the ingredients are fresh and very succulent. The falafel is fresh and delicious and the service is reserved but friendly.  I almost never drive through Montclair without considering a lunch consisting of a falafel to eat on the run, and the baklava to bring home to my family.  I always get a BIG reception when I announce the arrival of Falafel Hut's baklava when I arrive home. Enjoy!
