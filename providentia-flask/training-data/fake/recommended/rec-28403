i actually love this place. i went with a friend for brunch. i had the bullalo hash (beef hash with eggs on top and pan de sal and a big bone marrow on the side, with a bone marrow soup) and my friend had the chorizo burger with camote fries. we also had garlic fried rice. all in all it was absolutely amazing. it was very delectable. the camote fries i tried were great. the prices are not as cheap as the filipino restaurants in woodside that i have tried, but its definitely worth it. can't really compare apples with oranges. Â  our server, dave was amazing in describing the sauces (fish sauce and aioli) and some of the ingredients and how the flavorful the viands are. the decor is quite cute. the tin wall covered in decals of filipino tradition. very nice and unique. there's a lot of the items in the menu that i would like to try. i would definitely come back and bring my friends here.. i love this place!!!
