We couldn't find a reservation on-line, so my friend & I just walked in. Since we were just 2 people, they were able to accommodate us within 20-30minutes :) Service=Great & helpful Food: Brandade de morue=Absolutely delicious. The cream sauce they whipped it with was heavenly Duck Confit=It was good BUT it could have been crispier & I didn't get enough greens for some reason, so I had a duck leg with a bunch of mushrooms and literally 3 bites of greens. Steak & fries=excellent. The fries are amazing. For dessert we shared the apple tart which was very delicious. **If you check out the bakery, it has amazing things. The almond crusted croissant is delicious & unique with its crispy meringue topping.
