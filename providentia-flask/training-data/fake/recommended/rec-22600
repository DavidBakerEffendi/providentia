I just went here last night and we had an excellent time.  The air conditioning was off inside (not good, but hey, it's the Paris Bistro and that is how they would do it in Paris, so fair enough) so we sat outside, which was lovely.  The service was excellent, cheerful, professional, and very attentive.  We stayed a long time and never felt rushed. The food was delicious and the wine selections were good (and they were knowledgeable and able to answer our questions about the wine).  We especially liked the goat cheese and vegetable dish, flank steak, seafood pasta, mushroom risotto, and mussels. Everything was reasonably priced, and they even brought us complimentary sangria at the end of the meal. I was just in Paris and I WISH the restaurants we visited had food, prices, and service this excellent.  I am definitely going back and bringing people.
