This rating must be read with a grain of salt because when I went the restaurant was newly opened (1.5 months), it was our server's first day, and we ate at a strange time (4:30PM on a Sunday). The Ahi tuna salad was delicious and the rolls (with some sort of honey butter) were divine. I liked the overall decor, though I'm not the biggest fan of high-top seating for non-bar dining (there are normal tables, we just didn't ask to change). The wait-staff (and the manager) seemed well-mannered and timely.
