One of the best, if not the best halal cart I've ever had. Of course being so amazingly delicious comes with a price and in this case, it's a heart stopping, artery clogging, half a day's caloric intake per platter and that's not including the white sauce I usually drown it in! Now knowing that, you can't be eating it too often, maybe once every half a year haha. I love lamb so I usually go for that. I can't handle spicy so I don't put any on but as I said before, that white sauce is doused all over the platter! Because they have such high volumes of customers, they can't take time to put the exact amount of sauce (red or white) you want so they have a little station after you get your platter to put as little or as much of each condiment your soon to be hating you heart desires!
