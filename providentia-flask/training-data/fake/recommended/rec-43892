This is probably my favorite place right now. 5 stars is a little high but I think it deserves more than a four. The food - generally - is very good moving towards absolutely delicious. This is not the case 100% of the time and they have some weird curveballs like the cowboy fries which are almost inedible because they are so salty. However, their veggies are cooked to perfection, lightly flavored or seasoned. The half-chicken is a chilly night's best friend - the polenta is creamy with the nutty, nuanced flavor it is supposed to have. The hangar steak is also pretty good and my absolute favorites are the octopus salad and the kale salad (with a light vinaigrette, pine nuts, pomegranate, and shaved Romano. Excellent). The service is hit or miss. Especially during brunch when it's busy. The ambience is totally chill. It is laid-back and kinda family style but don't feel like you can't go here with your best homeslice or a hot date and get kind blotto on a bottle of AMAZING white Gavi. They close kinda early that's annoying. Try this place it's great.
