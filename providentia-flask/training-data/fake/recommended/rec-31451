Giving this place a solid three stars.  For starters, it's nice to have a new addition to the Westville dining scene.  The feel of the place is modern and clean with spacious tables and booths for dining.  Great ambiance if you ask me.  I've been here twice so far and the food is healthy with nice-sized portions.  The first time around I ordered the swordfish special which was served with saffron risotto and on a bed of spinach/greens.  It was delicious.  Second go-round I ordered the chicken, pesto pizza.  It was OK, but nothing I think I'd order again. Cocktails were quite tasty.  I recommend the Westville Punch and Side of Peaches.  Overall great new restaurant.  Definitely worth checking out.
