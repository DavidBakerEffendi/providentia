To echo what some of these reviewers stated the food here was fantastic. I came here for the first time with my dad years ago and loved it. Came back here on July 20th with my gf and we both instantly fell in love with the place. The food was great but I would like to say that it was their servers that really helped pushed me to review. They were kind and professional, in fact they were kind of busy that night but we never felt forgotten. I highly suggest this place for first dates. Also go for the Passion Fruit Sangeria!
