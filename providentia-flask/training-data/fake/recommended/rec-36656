Perfectly poached eggs - runny yolks as it should be! (Believe me, I've been to several where they just mess this up). The food was just right and it is definitely a happening place for a twofer brunch. Good cup of joe - had the cappuccino. Good prices. Cozy and warm atmosphere. Perfect for talking with friends, hanging out, or even studying. Outdoor patio, check. Friendly service, check. Laid-back and woodsy ambience, check. I'm not so sure what else we could ask for. I'd definitely return!
