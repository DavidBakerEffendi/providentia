Don't waste your time. Don't bother to go here if you're hungry. The 'dinners' are tapas size. Overly pretentious 'place-to-be-scene' totally misses the mark... Trying to hard to be upper-class. The approach of our server (Alex) was cold & unfriendly. She took the drink order from my date and wanted to walk away without asking me what I wanted, She did the same thing when we ordered dinner. Neither myself nor my date never felt 'welcomed'... we didn't even get a 'goodbye' or 'thank you' at the very least. The hostess was more cordial and polite. A separate server brought out 'something from the kitchen' - a half of a cracker with creme cheese on it. Really? Don't insult my intelligence. Appetizer - beet salad - interesting at best but there were too many flavors competing for my pallet that didn't blend well at all. Main course - duck fra diavlo. This is the smallest portion of food I've ever gotten for dinner at any restaurant - ever. The duck portion was somewhere between 1 and 2 ounces of meat. Are you serious with this????? I don't think there was more that 200 calories total on my plate combined. The decor was nice I suppose except for the 'vintage' looking tile floor which was falling apart. The worst part of this experience was that bill - $100 for two people (2 dinners, 2 drinks, and an appetizer). Completely outrageous for what you're getting. The service was very slow waiting 15-20 minutes to get our drinks and 30-40 minutes for dinner. You're much better off going to Zinc or Pacifico if you want a really well-done meal and excellent service.
