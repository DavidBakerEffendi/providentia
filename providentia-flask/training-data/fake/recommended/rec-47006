Vic has a good selection of sushi rolls. So if you are craving rolls, go to Vic's. The three roll special ($10.95) is a good bet. As other reviewers have noted, the size of Vic is very small but if you are lucky to get a seat at the counter, it is awesome. You get to see the three chef make the rolls after you place your order. If not, order take-out! A definite must try is the tuna dumplings (2 for $10) and they are big- avocado bursts in your mouth when you take a bite! Another must try is the Naruto roll as rice and seaweed is swapped with cucumber which allows you to ask the freshness of the fishes.
