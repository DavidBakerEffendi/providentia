So glad I finally made it to Chuko after having it on my list for a while.  This is a great edition to the neighborhood. The ramen is delish, the sides are great (the kale salad is my new favorite dish in NY - rivaled by Alta's brussels sprouts) and the service is great.  The space is zen bordering on non-descript but for these prices, that's fine. Would love to see more sides and some cocktails added.
