A few friends and I ate dinner here the other night and had a horrible experience. First, I was about 10 minutes late and they wouldn't sit the remainder of our party, even though we were going to sit in a booth/bench style table and one member was 6 months pregnant. They made them stand literally next to the table until I arrived, when we were then "allowed" to sit down. If this is restaurant policy, the host can still use their brain when enforcing rules. Secondly, the food was only average and over-priced. We had two orders of kale salad (very salty), shrimp salad (shrimp was completely raw inside), and two fish entrees, one being a special, which were both ok. The two white wines I had were both cheap tasting and sweet (and I ordered the dry options). Lastly, the service was terrible. One server was completely robotic, whereas the other server forgot our sides and then actually argued with us when we asked about them, saying that we ordered them with the robot waitress. Only when he flipped back through his pad and saw that he had written down the sides did he relent. DO NOT GO HERE!! I literally do not have one good thing to say about this restaurant, and with other great farm fresh type cuisine, this one is definitely not worth the cost.
