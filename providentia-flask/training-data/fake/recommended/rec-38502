Every time I go I get the coconut club! Its the best sandwich ever and consistently good. The suicide rings are the best! Spicy! The fried avocado tacos were very yummy too. I've never had a bad meal. I'm a vegetarian and my boyfriend is not so this is the perfect place for us. Was our first date. They are always changing their menu which makes it interesting. New foods,beers, and wines. Just don't complain if something is on the menu but not there. I might be giving you a dirty look! :)~
