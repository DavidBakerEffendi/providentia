Pretty standard place - it was recommended to me, so I made a reservation for 3 people on a Friday night at 10pm. We turned up dot at 10 and saw the hostess was trying to give our table away. Once we turned up, she glanced at her watch and told them "actually guys, it'll be a longer wait for you, but go to our sister restaurant down the road where you won't need a reservation" She turned to me and told us to wait for our table. We waited 20 minutes just inside the door, for a table we had reserved which I wasn't happy with. Also, 3 people turned up after us and the hostess told them it would be a 20 minute wait and they could wait by the bar and get drinks. They went straight in!! The hostess didn't even say to us that we could wait by the bar, completely unfair! I really liked the atmosphere inside - would be great for a date. Food was nothing special, I had the spinach gnocchi but it was fairly bland. The waiters that served us were very smiley, I seriously thought they were high. Overall I probably wouldn't go back - Italian places come a dime a dozen in W. Village!
