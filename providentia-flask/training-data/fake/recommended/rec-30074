A friend had recommended this place as one of the best in the area for breakfast. Within a week, Groupon offered a deal, so we decided to give it a try.  The Challah French toast was good (an A-), but overpriced  at $9.95. The omelet at $13.95 was a C-. The roasted potatoes were good. The service was absolutely awful! No silverware/napkin on the table, so we asked the busboy to set us up as well as to refill the coffee. The waitress took the order and disappeared until we were pretty much done with our breakfast. I was planning to leave her a 10% tip- I usually tip 18-%20%-, but she added a 20% tip to the total, because we were using Groupon. When I asked the waitress if they were shorthanded, she said yes. I guess the owner wasn't counting on a busy Friday (the day after the July 4 holiday).  I think the least she could have said was to apologize that it took an hour and 15 minute for our visit. She didn't bother. To summarize, there are other places in the area such as Paul's in Cheshire that offer you a good breakfast, comfortable seats and great service. This place is uncomfortable (too small for the number of tables), overpriced and offers terrible service.
