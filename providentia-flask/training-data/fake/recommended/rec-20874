I stopped by this place after work because I was around the area and so totally hungry. I like the ribs and chicken along with the yellow rice. The ribs were a little try but tasty. The chicken was juicy. The yellow rice was soft and good! Also, the french fries were salty enough. There's no place to eat so if you are looking for a place to just order and take out, then this is the place to go. Good customer service as the staff were so helpful with helping with the order. I would go back!
