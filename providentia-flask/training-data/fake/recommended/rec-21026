Only one word - LOVE Ocabanon. I have been watching construction evolve over the months and was so pleased to see it open just before Christmas. Finally going inside proved to be even better. What can I say, the aesthetic is distinctively French and cool. The stainless steel bar could be hopelessly hipster, but it takes it a step further, in that way the French have of making everything into art: the decor isn't just NYC cool, it's warm and refined. With the stainless steel bar also comes original wood salvaged during construction, a smaller copper bar overlooking the grandmother's kitchen, comfortable sofas, an enticing private room for wine tastings, enormous flat screen tv showing film classics, and the nicest staff I've met in a bar/restaurant in the city. Friends and I have tried the beef stew, the salmon, the brie, and the macaroons. All delicious and an amazing selection of wines to accompany. Ocabanon is the best thing to happen to my neighborhood in a loooooonnnnnng time. I can't wait to bring everyone I know to check it out. Saving the best for last - you don't have to scream above loud music to be heard by the friend seated across from you. Bravo Ocabanon for bringing humanity back to going out!
