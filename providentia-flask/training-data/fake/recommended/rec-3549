Amazing service and the best lemon ricotta pancakes I've ever had in my life (hint: order them with blueberries). There's usually a wait out the door, but they folks at Tom's are so nice, they'll sometimes hand out free mugs of coffee and pancakes to waiting customers. The place is an institution, and they service is always beyond friendly. Just go.
