After reading a review that went on an on about the gobi manchurian..i finally ordered a plate yesterday! must say, I Was Impressed...it was just that taste of Mumbai street food I was craving for! That  mild crunch, and the sweet/spicy taste...total goodness. But 6.50 for JUST EIGHT  little pieces of cauliflower...definitely Over priced!....for an appetizer of that sort, 8 or 9 pieces is just the right quantity  3.50$ to 4$ would be a fair rate. That's all for Now! Do try Gobi Manchurian at least once Nonetheless. They taste Awesome
