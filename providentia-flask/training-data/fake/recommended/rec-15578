I had an excellent experience here last Saturday night.  My date and I went around 830, 9 without a reservation.  They were busy and we were told the wait would be 25 minutes - but like 7 minutes later we were seated!  I'll take it.  The food was freaking delicious - I had the gnocchi di ricotta and my date had the duck.  So good.  I had a great glass of wine and he enjoyed a couple of old fashioneds.  Sadly, we were too full for dessert but we've already decided to come back because there are so many other dishes we want to try!  The only negative was our waitress - less than shining service, simply passable.  Still, looking forward to going back.
