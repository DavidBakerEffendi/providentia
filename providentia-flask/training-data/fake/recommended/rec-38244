The Brooklyn Star has a special place in my heart, as does most of Brooklyn, because it reminds me of Boulder, with its hipsters, hippies, health-nuts, and everyone in-between. Unsurprisingly, many of the patrons of The Brooklyn Star veered towards the plaid + black-rimmed glasses. We stopped in for a quick mid-afternoon snack: ox-tails marinated buffalo wing style, bone marrow, and chilled beers. It was a great pick-me-up. There isn't too much to eat, in terms of quantity, of the ox-tails, but what little meat there was was quite good. And the marrow on perfectly toasted bread - fantastic. I love the southern feel and I'd definitely return to try some of their dinner entrees.
