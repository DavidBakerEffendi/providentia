We went there during the week and it was so crowded . The bar and seating were full. A bit noisy . We had a reservation, but we were early and the seated us. The tables were close and not too roomy. Those are the negatives. But the food was off the hook. I had lobster chilequiles . Delicious . Lots of lobster and the sauce was intoxicating. My husband had the boulliabase . It was filled with fish and the broth was so flavorful. My daughter had the lobster tacos, all she kept saying was yum ! Service was very good . I would definitely go back but for my age group I'll stick to during the week , I think the weekends might be too loud. They need to stretch the walls.
