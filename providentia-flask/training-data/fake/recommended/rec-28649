First off, I love the concept of  a Paleo diet restaurant. I love organic food, and believe the Paleo diet is very healthy, and if the food could be prepared to restaurant standards and served restaurant style this would be a winner. Alas, Hu is far from this concept. Instead, Hu is Boston Market meets Paleo, meets rush hour. Hu is actually a cafeteria, not a sit down restaurant.  There was a lack of plates, sitting area, menus,and service of any kind. Plus, the place was extremely crowded and the  waiting lines were constantly being crashed into by bus staff. In a nutshell, the place was a friggin mad house. If you have social anxiety  disorder, avoid. If you don't, avoid, so this remains the case. The food itself was passable, but hardly gourmet -- basically average Paleo food served from hotplates. If high priced cafeteria food is what you are seeking, this is the food may be for you, but I found it to be extremely disappointing. I so miss Curley's!!!
