my office is 3 blocks away and this place is always a solid back up plan if i need a quick cheap bite.  i've never had to wait in the crazy lines (i guess cuz i'm not going during the evening or late night rush hours). i like the white sauce (i don't do the hot sauce) and yellow rice and they always throw in a sliced pita bread and lettuce as well.  although it's a toss up between this and sammy's halal by my house in woodside, queens (also in west village).  sammy's uses a lighter brown rice so it makes it seem a little healthier...
