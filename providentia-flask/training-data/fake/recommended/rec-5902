The best part of this place is its chic decor. Very Sex and the City, I think. The booths are cute, with seats that look like they come out of a car, and there are some great round tables in the middle for larger parties. The second floor boasts swinging chairs that hang from the ceiling, which I think is a great novel idea. There's also wonderful rooftop seating and a bar. The food was ok. Perhaps it was because I chose the cheesesteak eggrolls that I wasn't glowing about the food, but the shoestring fries were fun. I've never tried the pricier items like the lobster mac and cheese, so I can't comment as to how those taste. I did have a side of sesame spinach, which was good. This is definitely a "happening" spot; lots of people (esp. females) dressed up....definitely not "romantic" in the sense of quiet; it's kind of hard to carry on a conversation with the music playing pretty loudly. All in all, though, I'd definitely recommend checking this place out for the experience. Go there for the trendy ambience.
