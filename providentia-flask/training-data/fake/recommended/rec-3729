My first time here and before I came here I knew what I wanted to try. The popular red velvet waffles and fried chicken and I was not disappointed. The was about not long at all and their mac and cheese is (insert f-word profanity) delicious. I will definitely be a regular here and their portions are huge. I couldn't finish my meal. My only.complaint is that it is kinda cramped.
