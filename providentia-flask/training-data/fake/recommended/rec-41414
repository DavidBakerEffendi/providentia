Almaz Cafe is my favorite neighborhood standby. My partner and I eat here frequently, particularly in the winter (we crave this food more when its cold out). The flavors are wonderful, and the food is cheap, since one dish is more than enough for two of us. We usually get the Dorowat, although we also love the lamb tibs. It's not on the menu, but they offered it once as a special and we tried it and loved it. We haven't seen it listed since, but we've asked for it, and they usually have it. Sometimes I order the vegetarian combo to go and eat it over the course of 2-3 meals. It's truly excellent. The owners are the nicest people you will meet in Philadelphia.
