Freaking great Ramen and let's not forget the pork buns! So awesome! Every slurp of the Ramen noodles carries with it little beads of soup, that awesome combo is like getting a "finish him" combo in Mortal Kombat, that's how good this stuff is! However, the unfortunate thing about being this good is fact that EVERYONE and their Grand parents wants to have a taste of this awesomesauce restaurant and the way Manhattan is packed like sardines makes it worst. It feels like you'd get 1.8 million people at the doorsteps of Ippudo and you wait at least THREE (3) hours for a seat. If you're one of those wise guys who think "oh well I'm pretty sure if I go solo the line would be much shorter," think again buddy. Takes at least 2 hours to get a single seater on the bar.... Well while you wait you can help Ippudo increase their coffers while grabbing a drink at their tiny drink bar. That's how they trap you, cause you'd be mesmerized by all the interesting people you meet there and before you know it you have spend at least $100 on the whole meal + experience. I suggest going to Wafle and Dinges down the street by Astor Pl instead, while you wait, saves you $50 bucks. Be expect to pay at least $30-35 bucks for your meal, without appetizers. Let's not forget opportunity cost, and assume your value is $15 bucks an hour, so that's a total of $100 bucks without tossing money in the bar! But still TOTALLY WORTH it try it once and forget about going back!!
