im a fan!!! this is relatively comparable to my other favorite hotpot spot, Little Sheep (in Flushing). Quality is there. Nice presentation for a Chinese place! Restaurant is small. Make reservations!!!! I was warned to, and glad I did, because it was busy, even on a Monday night. My only dislike/confusion of the place was the music. Not sure if I'm feelin the trance/deep house music while having hotpot. That doesn't defer my review, but it just felt like I should be sitting in the corner, drunk dancing and/or getting rowdy. Other than that, this will def be my new hotpot spot when I'm lazy to drive to queens. Oh, and price -- $110 between 4 people (we ordered a good amount, enough to leave extremely full). Price + quality is above par and my expectations :)
