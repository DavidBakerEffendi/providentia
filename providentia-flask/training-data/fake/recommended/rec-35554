I returned from 10 days in Spain and was craving all of the delightful food I had experienced there. I am also a long time fan of Amada, and when we didn't make our reservation on time Saturday evening, we decided to try Tinto since there were reservations still available. Now I know why... I was disappointed with this restaurant and with the reviews I am seeing. The hostess was pleasant but when we seated our waitress had a bit of an attitude. I asked about patatas bravas and if the potatoes on the menu were similar and she said she never heard of patatas bravas. That is like working at an American bar in Spain and saying you have never heard of French fries. Not a good start. Half of the food was good and the other half, sadly, not at all. The figs wrapped in hamon were dried figs. I would expect fresh. The crab had so much mayo mixed in, you could barely taste the crab much less any other seasoning. The pulpo was cooked well and good flavor, but at little too salty. I would order it again. The patatas were good, but after looking at other review pics and comments, I think we got shorted. We didn't have any of the delicious cream sauce that others speak of. The short rib sandwich was by far the best thing we got. Overall, I was disappointed given that it's a Jose Garces restaurant and the price of the food. Spanish food is incredibly fresh and this was far from it.
