I'm so glad I found out about a gem like this near work.  If you work in FiDi and need a crepe to hold you over until 5PM strikes, this is definitely worth making it outside to get.  Even after walking in the rain to bring this crepe back, I thought it would've been soggy by the time I got back to the office, but it was still crispy!! I got the Nutella & Bailey's crepe which did not fail to satisfy my craving for sweets.
