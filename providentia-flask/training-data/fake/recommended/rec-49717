The food here is really very good.  For the price point, easily five stars.  The decor isn't great, but who cares when the food is amazing and fresh and the service is good?  I had the Duck Larb which had a mix of tender and crispy duck.  The Pad Ped Moo Krob was recommended to me as their best dish, and it did not disappoint.  Crispy pork in a flavorful and spicy sauce.  I'll be back!
