4 years later and Tia Pol is still going strong.  We went there when it first opened.  It was a cute neighborhood restaurant and now it's even better (except the wait is longer).  There are lots of tapas places in Manhattan, but this place is in a league of its own.  The chefs are simply amazing!  You can tell some of the dishes really took a lot time and a lot of care to make.  The cockles and razor clams come in a sauce that's so delicious I ask for extra bread every time to soak up the sauce.  Where else can you find periwinkle Chinatown style on a menu? Try it if you haven't already.  The suckling pig and duck breast specials are to die for.  I also love the orange flan (or was it pudding) desert.  Wine selection is great and very reasonable.
