Heck yea, Mood!! Bringing the heat... And accompanying that heat with yogurt if you are like me and can't handle the heat. The owner is super nice, the chaat is ON POINT! I had no idea what chaat even was, and this was a perfect introduction. I tried ordering one of the crazy named chaats, and he suggested that he just make me an introduction chaat and when I become a regular I will try them all! I've had lassi in New York and haven't liked it, here at Mood I have already drank two on my first visit. I will most definitely be back. Tips: Cucumber mint lassi Rose lassi And let the chaat chef work his magic!!!
