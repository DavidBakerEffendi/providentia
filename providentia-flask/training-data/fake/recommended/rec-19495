OMG this place is fantastic.  I brought my wife and her parents here, and everybody thoroughly enjoyed their meal.  The decorations, atmosphere, and service are wonderful - very warm and welcoming.  The food is phenomenal.  I had the lamb shank, which was superb - so tender it fell of the bone, and it was seasoned perfectly. I also tried their sheep's milk dumplings which were amazing, and the grilled banzino, which was absolutely perfect.  The price was reasonable as well.  Overall, a wonderful dinner experience!
