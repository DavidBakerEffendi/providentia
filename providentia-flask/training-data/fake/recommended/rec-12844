I don't know if they are the best dumplings in NYC, because frankly, in the past 4 years for 2 visits to NYC a year, I haven't gone anywhere else. This time, their prices have changed a bit.  I used to be able to get 6 fried pork dumplings for a couple bucks, but now it's only 4.  Still, times are tough.  I was still able to get 4 fried pork dumplings and 10 steamed dumplings for like $7. They are awesome.  Delicious.  Service isn't too friendly, but this is Chinatown and friendly service is hard to come by.  And NO, that is not racist.  The owners and operators and employees of Chinatown restaurants that I've been to are all business.  Nothing wrong with that.  They want to serve you and move on to the next person.  It's efficient, even if a smile is hard to come by. But who cares, because the dumplings are fantastic.  Sometimes, depending on how busy they are, you may find yourself waiting a while, but they usually have a bunch of each popular type (shrimp & pork) ready to go.   They barely give any soy sauce though, so you'll have to ask for more. It's not the easiest place to get to, but it's worth the trip.  Check it out.  Also, while they have some counter top space you can eat at, and maybe a table or two, this place is tiny.  You walk up to the counter, order, and wait.  You're best bet is to leave with your food and find a park or a stoop to sit and enjoy.
