Two of us ordered a large tossed salad, which had only two cherry tomatoes, 4 olives, a little onion, and was swimming in way too much dressing. After we ate the salad, there was maybe another 1/4 cup of dressing left in the bowl. We also had the margherita pizza. I've had my fair share of cheap $1 pizza, frozen pizza, and some amazing pizza. This was one of the worst. While it was thin crust, it was not crispy. In fact it was completely soggy from the large, tasteless beefsteak tomatoes; and hardly any basil. I thought it was supposed to be brick oven baked, but I wouldn't be surprised if I was told it had been boiled. I felt embarrassed even suggesting this place and will never return.
