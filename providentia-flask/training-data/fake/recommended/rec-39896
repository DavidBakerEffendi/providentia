Overrated. PJ Clarke's has a better burger. I think the atmosphere and vibe of Corner Bistro is cool, I appreciate the fact that they are a NYC landmark, and that they dont add a lot of seasonings to the meat, etc.. but baby, condiments rock my world and this burger was too plain for me. You gotta go at least once, kinda like Magnolia, just to say you did, but this is a burger that didn't live up to my high expectations.
