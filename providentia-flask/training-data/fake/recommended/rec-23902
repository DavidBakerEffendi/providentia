This was everything I wanted from my first trip to Brooklyn: hipsters, trendy decor, creative cocktails and incredible food for reasonable prices. Dinner for three was about $80 including tip, and the food was amazing. Only downside was the slow service, but the waitress made up for it with a round on the house :)
