My fiancee and I went there after we got engaged.  The food was fantastic as well as the service.  Reservations are tough to get but if you call early enough you can get one.   Its a fairly small place, but is very cozy and comfortable.  Everything was perfect at The Little Owl and I would highly recommend this restaurant.  Try the sliders.
