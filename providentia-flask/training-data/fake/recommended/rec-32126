This place is terrific. First of all, the service is great. Everyone there was very friendly, and sincerely treated us like they wanted us to relax and enjoy ourselves. Even the cook asked us how things were, which brings us to the next part: The. Food. My colleague and I both had the chicken biscuit, and it is nothing short of legendary. It was authentic, fresh, and insanely delicious. They even gave us beignets on the house since it was our first time there. Of course those were delicious as well. The place is small, but neat and novel. It was a comfortable place to be, but granted it was not super busy when we were there. I can imagine if it was busy it'd be more difficult to place an order, but it'd be worth the wait considering how good the food is. Would definitely recommend to anyone in the area. I'll be going back.
