A group of work-friends and I went here for my and a friend's birthday dinner on a Thursday in January . I would definitely come back to this place. The restaurant had a great vibe and atmosphere, and an earthy feel to it with all the brown wood and tree decor. The lighting was nicely dim with candlelights on the tables. The wait service was good. Our waiter gave us great recommendations for sharing based on what our preferences were. The food came out spaced out enough so we didn't feel rushed to finish one item before the next came out. Some of the tapas we shared that I really liked include the crispy artichokes, foie gras, pork belly apricots, trio charcutero and paella. They were nice enough to split the paella into two separate serving trays because having one big tray would take up all of our table space. We also ordered the porcella entree to share but it was a bit pricey for its serving size. In general, everything was really good and easy to share. For dessert, we ordered the bread pudding (and something else i can't recall). I am not a big bread pudding fan but I liked the one here. For drinks, I had a few Nuestra Pasion cocktails. It was good but a little on the sweet side. The only "annoyance" was that they wouldn't seat us without having our full party there, even when there were already 4 out of the 5 of us present with a reservation. We even said the 4 of us would get started with drinks at our table but it didn't matter to them. We ended up with a small round table too so what's the difference between a party of 4 versus 5? None. It was a weeknight and we don't have regular 9 to 5's so things come up.
