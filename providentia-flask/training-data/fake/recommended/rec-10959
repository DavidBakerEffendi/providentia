Is this the best date restaurant in Brooklyn? I think it might be. It might be too awesome for a first date, though. It's small, but the crowd ebbs and flows throughout the night. It's on a side street, and you'd definitely miss it if you weren't looking for it. The burgers are awesome, the wings are awesome, and everything is priced fairly. Â There's a real fireplace; none of this lit fake wood stuff with a little flamerdoodle popping up in the middle...and you can sit a foot away from it without being burned alive. Great drink list, solid list of beers, and interesting layout for such a tiny place. Lots of tables, and even an elevated space for a group of 4-5. Coming To America was on TV without sound when I walked in. That movie is so awesome, it doesn't even need sound and people will still want to watch. Bijan's kind of like that.
