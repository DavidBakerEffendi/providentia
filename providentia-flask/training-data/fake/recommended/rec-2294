I ventured to philly specifically for the cheesesteaks. I know, how very foodie of me. But I digress. So I ordered a cheesesteak from Pat's and one from Geno's.  Seriously, one was equally as mediocre are the other. Ive had better cheesesteaks in Los Angeles, Miami, hell, even Georgia!  This city has a serious love affair with cheezewhiz.... only the good Lord knows why.
