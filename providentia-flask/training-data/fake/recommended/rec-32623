Ippudo does have the best ramen. I got the Shiromaru Hakata Classic. The noodles were perfect and it wasn't too oily. I also got the pork buns here and I have to say that I actually prefer Momofuku's pork buns over Ippudo's. Ippudo puts some kind of mayonnaise in their pork buns that I just didn't like. Who puts mayonnaise in pork buns? Seriously! They still get 5 stars for their ramen though. It is definitely tops.
