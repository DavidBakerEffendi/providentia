personally don't like the food i got. ordered, hummus, some fried cheese, the eggplant, lentil, the rice, 10 oz steak rib eye, sausage, meatball, and some other thins. it was bland. drinks were good. the service was horrible.  i went at 5pm, an early dinner, and there was 5 in our party we ordered maybe 9 or 10 items and requested a larger table so we could have it all at once.  they said we couldn't have a larger table, when there was only one other table in the ENTIRE restaurant. we left before 6, and only one other table had entered. no one ask how we were doing. trust me, i would give a place another try, but, with service like that. no thank you
