Came here on a date on a Friday night. Chose to sit at the bar for both dinner and drinks. Bar is comfortable and honestly where all the fun is at. I had the "Diablos Elbow" cocktail which was perfectly spicy. Tried a rice-ball for the first time and they were out of this world. Carbonara with shrimp was spot on. Perfect food, great music, fun energetic staff - can't really ask for anything else!
