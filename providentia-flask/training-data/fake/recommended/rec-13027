Woorijip is perfect for the famished and tired New Yorker who wants a warm meal to bring home after work without stooping to Domino's, greasy Chinese takeout, or Lean Pockets. In "Our House," the motherly managers have thoughtfully created individual lunch/dinner boxes of a wide variety (as well as soups, appetizers, maki rolls, fried rice, and assorted meats and vegetables) that have a homemade quality. Because of their vast selection, I can mix and match packaged ready-to-eat meats and vegetables for a quick and simple meal at home. And it's always too easy to grab an Asian yogurt drink or tea from their drink aisle. The space is very small for dining in, but the only reason I come here is to get things to-go anyways. What can I say, Woorijip, you had me at "Hello!" (or "Ahnyong!")
