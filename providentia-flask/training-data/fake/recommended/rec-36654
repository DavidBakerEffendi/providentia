They have got it down to a science. I walked in on a Sunday evening and the place was packed. The hostess gave me a table right away and everything went perfect. When I was ready to order, the server was there. I had the Balthazar House Salad with Truffle Vin - killer. Also the Goat Cheese tartemmmmmmmmmm. I added a side of frites because I am a fry fan - even better that I thought. No dessert for me since I had some to go from the bakery - but the server was nice enough to leave me with a glass of champagne to finish it off - Can't wait to go back!
