My family swears by this restaurant because of the steak on a stone.  Being a semi-vegetarian, I have no such fondness, but I do like this restaurant for some other reasons - it's pretty and has a nice ambiance, the sangria is tremendous and the little Spanish chips/potato things are great.  Wonderful bread as well.  Good for groups.
