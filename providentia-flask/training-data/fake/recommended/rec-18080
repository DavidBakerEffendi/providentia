After seeing the MvF episode I knew I had to try this place - the first few times I went the line dissuaded me, but when I was in Philly recently with friends they convinced me to wait it out and the line actually moved pretty quick. We decided to get two different ones so we could try them both - the roast pork with broccoli rabe and the beef with provolone. They were both awesome - although not the best sandwich I've ever eaten (but then again that's a REALLY high and subjective bar right?) I'd definitely recommend this place and don't get scared away by the line, it moves quick.
