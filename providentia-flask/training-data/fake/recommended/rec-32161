The sushi is above average, the hibachi is above average, the service for large groups is below average. If you go in a smaller party 2-4 you will be fine.  Otherwise you should read about our experience. We arrived on time, even with the constant parking hassle of Eric town square.   We were met by a gracious waitress who was good and attentive.   We ordered drinks, they came at a good pace.  We ordered dinner and things went down hill from here. Two of six meals showed up late, one 10 minutes after the other four and one 20 minutes after the others.   This was unfortunate but we took it in stride and did not complain.    No manager came to apologize.   We finished our meals, were not offered, and, did not have dessert, paid the bill and talked for maybe 5 minutes after paying the bill.   The waitress came and asked us to leave the table and move to sit at the sushi bar.   This was uncomfortable enough, I was insulted and really just wanted to leave, but we moved.   Not two minutes pass but now a hostess comes and asks us to move to the bar.   We were quiet, it was after 8pm and not at all busy.  We were not drinking, nor did we want anymore to drink, why move us to the bar? Now we are insulted, and embarrassed.    I will not ever take a group there again.   Sakura in Glastonbury will be the last on my list when I visit the town square.   Is too bad, I like the sushi, but I don't need to be embarrassed when out with family.
