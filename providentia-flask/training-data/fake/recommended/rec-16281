My husband and I. Live in Long Island, we went there last Sunday for brunch with my son and his girl friend.  Loved it!  Food was fantastic , atmosphere - Fantastic, owner Carmelo was very welcoming!  Have already recommended it to all  my friends.  Can't  wait to go back for dinner.  Born and bred in Astoria, I am so happy to finally have a great Italian place to go!
