my vegetarian friends ordered the Vegan BBQ boneless pork ribs(char siew) when we took our food to go, and they both ate it and had a puzzled look on their face.  They then asked me to try it and tell them if it was meat.  I had to do a double take, because at first the texture and taste were perfect replica's of meat.  Then i realized that the texture and shape was too uniform, and that there was no fat in the pieces i tried. z0mg!!!! these are even better than the real boneless bbq pork ribs that are already super legit!!! i'm not sure how that's possible, or what they are using, but they are VERY tasty!  i've been ordering the vegan ones over the real ones just because they taste so good! consider me sold! i LOVE Black Bamboo vegan char siew!
