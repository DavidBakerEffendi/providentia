I made a reservation for half-8 on a Saturday. There were still quite a few empty tables when i arrived - so if you are coming here with a small party without a reservation, the wait should not be too horrible. Its braised lamb shank was divine - the lamb was so tender!!!!!!!!! the tomato gravy was so awesome! I was so contented eating it! You have to try its chocolate mousse + sesame ice cream dessert course - perfect ending to the meal! Extremely sweet service too! There was a slight hiccup with the payment (we were expecting to get some change ...) - and we notified our server who looked into the issue promptly!
