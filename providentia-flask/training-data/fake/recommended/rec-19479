Four words: stuffed challah french toast.  Delicious!  I've had their regular one and two specials and have loved all three.  I've also sampled a few of their other things and have never been disappointed.  The only downside is the incredibly long wait on the weekend.  It is usually not as long of a wait as they say, but it is usually at least half an hour or so.  And it's worth the drive and the wait. Only complaint: Once my boyfriend said he wanted the stuffed french toast and they gave him the regular french toast, but it was his fault for not speaking up afterwards.  Plus he didn't even figure it out until I said something, so obviously it was still quite yummy.
