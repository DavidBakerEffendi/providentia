I had been seriously craving some mexican food, so I basically forced my boyfriend to try Mezcal with me last Monday. SO glad I did. Great margarita, great sangria, endless homemade tortilla chips and salsa are always a win in my book. I had this great spicy shrimp dish that I can;t remember the name of, but would get again in heartbeat. My boyfriend had carnitas (which I tried, obviously), and they were tender, flavorful and delicious. The decor was authentic and the staff was fast and friendly. Will definitely be coming back.
