Have been going here for years and the other night was just as perfect as every single time i've been here. It was around 1130pm on a Tuesday night. What's open that has good food? Cafe Orlin! Service was a little slower than Â usual but that's only because all the outdoor tables were packed! Chardonnay, bottled Stella, Hummus plate, Salad, and Mashed Potatos = $33 Soooo cheap! Crowd is always chill as well as the atmosphere. One thing that was amazing - the food came out crazy fast. Not just for my table but i noticed everyone else that sat down and ordered, got their food within 10 mins! Even if it was A LOT of food. I LOVE CAFE ORLIN... *i've tried almost everything on the menu. loved everything!!!! EXCEPT the huevos rancheros. they sucked ass..dont get em.
