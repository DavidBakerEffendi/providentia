Kefi is delicious..tons of fresh seafood. You must try the grilled squid, it's shockingly tender! The only downer about this place? You are practically sitting on someone else's lap, making the overall experience somewhat uncomfortable. I Â would never come here on a date. Though the food was amazing, I think I would only come back once the buzz has died down.
