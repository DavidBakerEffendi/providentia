Umm...I guess I'm not hipster enough to like this place. The food ranged from mediocre (mussels, meh, go to any bar) to terrible (margherita pizza). The other pizzas we got were somewhere in between. But at $12-16 each, no thanks. I'll stick to Papa Johns. Broken glass everywhere on the street doesn't help either.
