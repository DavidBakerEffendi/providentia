so we ended our trip out to nyc with a nice late night dinner here...apparently this is a place where chefs come to eat after their late night...so there was a group of 7 and we went to town on the mofo...lets get down to business...i think we ordered escargot, good...beef marrow and oxtail marmelade, ( i am not sophisticated enough to eat this so it was whatever to me)..sauteed calamair, good.....pallela basquez, good....salmon, good...ok im looking up their menu since im doing a piss poor job of explaining this place...and from looking at it i dont remember shiet...all i remember is everything went down and out just fine...i left there very full, content, happy and buzzed
