What the hell is up with the prices at this place? The sandwiches are amazing, sure, but freaking 7.75 for a small roll with some greasy pork slathered between two slices of french bread? I wanna love this place because the food is good, but these prices and portions are killing me. Come on, New York, why do you always do this? Is this some sort of trend to measure your food by cubic decimeters and then sell it for a dollar for each decimeter or something? Â Especially you, Union Square. If this is the only choice you're going to give me between 17 blocks of chains linked up together one by one then I'm disowning you.
