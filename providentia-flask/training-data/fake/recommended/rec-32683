Bartaco is a super trendy restaurant! The tacos are delicious and not expensive and the selection of drinks is great! I had the pork belly, portobello mushrooms and spicy chorizo tacos and they were really good! The sauces they give are great add-on to the tacos; my favorite was the roja one. This place has an awesome vibe with plenty of young people even on a Tuesday night. The waiters were also very attentive and very nice. I can't wait to go back and try more tacos!
