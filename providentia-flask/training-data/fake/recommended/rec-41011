This might be my first ever review on Yelp after a long time of utilizing the App but I felt compelled to add a review of Silver Rice. Amazing, fresh, tasty, great quality, wait...did I say amazing? I am so happy we (finally) have an EXCELLENT sushi choice in our neighborhood. Having gone in there within the first two weeks of its opening means meeting the owner, talking about the menu, and future plans. Can't wait to go back!
