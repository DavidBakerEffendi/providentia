I've been disappointed with much of the Thai food I've had in Philly so I decided to give this place a try for takeout one night. I ordered the tofu veggie soup, tempura vegetables and veggie drunken noodles. The soup was light and flavorful and helped soothe my cold. The tempura veggies were a bit soggy but this was likely due to the fact that I had them as a takeout option rather than right in the restaurant. The drunken noodles were well-spiced though lacking in tofu. All in all, this was a satisfying meal and better than the last few Thai meals I've had so I'll definitely return to try other menu items.
