So I would have given this place 5 stars because every time I come here I enjoy it very much. It is actually my favorite place to go and tonight I decided to go there for my birthday dinner. I'm so disappointed I probably will not be going back. My favorite dish is the fernandes and getting the stone to cook it yourself (I get it every time) I come here at least once a month. Tonight the waiter brought me the wrong dish and refused to fix it so I spoke to manager who was also rude and told me "he'll do me the favor" and to top it of the waiter came asking us why did we tell his manager on him . I'm in shock still and did not even get desert for my birthday!!!!! Totally ruined my night !!!!! I will be calling tomorrow to talk to the owner I am so upset
