Shanola Hampton from Shotime's Shameless was standing RIGHT BEHIND ME in line on Saturday afternoon, which basically made my year. Speaking of lines...there was one and it was long, but it moved quickly.  Almost impossible to get a seat to eat when they're busy, and Reading Terminal Market is extremely packed on the weekends.  I had the pulled pork with sharp provolone, roasted peppers, and broccoli rabe.  Definitely a good sandwich, but I still think Tony Luke's does the best porkette in Philadelphia. Keep your eye on the stupid meters outside, I was 15 mins late and had a $36 parking ticket waiting for me when I got back. :/
