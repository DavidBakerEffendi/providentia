Late night, If your drunk, Go here and not Kountry Kart. It is a better spot. Better service and cooler place, and you can sit in there. Kountry Kart has the rep but this place got the food. I have never ate this food sober but thats where I stand. Good chicken and steak wraps and also i have heard good falafel.
