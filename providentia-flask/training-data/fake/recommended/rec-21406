Our $100 lunch was muy expensivo but amazing.  If you got $ to burn, check this place out.  Chef Eli Kulp just got F&W's best new chef and James Beard Award semi finalist.  Very lovely ambiance, kind of upscale dining so please, no jeans.  Staff are very professional and courteous.   If you're going for lunch, TRY THEIR CHICKEN NUGGETS!!!!!! Oh man, probably the best fried dark meat I've ever had in my life.  The spicy mustard and agrodulce is out of this world!!!!!  Too bad this item is only on their lunch menu!!!!!!!  Sorry my picture is terrible, I was busy stuffing my face, my phone just couldn't hold still.   We had the $25 prefix and dessert is not included.  But you get a small cider glazed donut with your check, which makes your belly expand to the point where you wanna take a nice afternoon nap.  The root beer "float" was o-kay, not what I expected but just the name sold me to it.  But beware, it was completely different than what I had imagined. Their cooking technique and flavors are spot on.  Just lovely!
