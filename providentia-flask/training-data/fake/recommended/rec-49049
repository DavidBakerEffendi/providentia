I'm not a big fan of Thai food.  I do not care for peanuts, coconut or mint in my dinner.  I had Duck Choo Chee the lunch special, a very reasonable $7.95, including a fresh, hot, crispy spring roll and a cup of soup.  The soup and spring roll came out almost as soon as we finished ordering.  The spring roll was very good, nice and crispy without being greasy.  The hot and sour soup was not very spicy, but was redolent of lemon grass.  Very nice.  The duck was pleasantly spicy, but there was no warning of spicy on the menu.  There was a nice portion of jasmine rice on the side, which was just enough to soak up all the extra yummy sauce left.
