This is a gem in west philly so shhh. Not inexpensive but oh, it's well worth it. The food is always delicious and interesting. We've walked in when it was just for two and managed to get a table but more than that, you want to make a reservation. It's BYOB. I haven't had anything there I didn't like. I just read Jen C's review that Erin O'Shea is leaving. I hope that means she moving on to brighter things but that Marigold will remain. I've been there when it was owned/operated by previous owners and I prefer this current incarnation.
