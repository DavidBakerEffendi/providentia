This was a bit of a toss-up for me. While the food is very good, it lacks in other areas.  I have yet to try the wings, but I have heard they are fantastic...and you don't hear many people rave about wings.  I don't like the setup of this place. Basically it is like one open room. The bar and seated tables have no seperation between them.  The bar is a decent size, but if you have to stand you always feel like you are in the way.  It's just a very impractical layout for a place that can get pretty busy. Between bar patrons, and waitresses going back and forth...it can be a pain.  They also have put in quite a few TV's, so I guess they want to be more of a sports destination. However, when I asked that they put one TV that was off to the side to an NBA game...the bartender didn't appear to like it. He told me that "they dont watch that s*** here".  Got the feeling he was only half joking.  Now no one was watching this TV anyway...but I think it had more to do with the sport than the request.  Note to bar...if you want to be more of a sports bar, you can't pick and choose which sports you're going to show. You may not like the NBA or the "crowd" you think watches it, but a lot of people enjoy these games. Also, this is a huge cop hangout...so if that is not your cup of tea, better to avoid. Also, very much an older crowd in there.
