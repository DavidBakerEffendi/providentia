Came here with two girlfriends for a fun night out and had a really wonderful time.  Loved the cocktails, enjoyed the cozy ambiance, and had really great service! I highly recommend the mac and cheese....which was arguably the best I've ever had.  Chris, our server, was attentive, helpful and made our evening feel as special as we wanted!
