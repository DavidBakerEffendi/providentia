I have been looking forward to coming to this place for a long time.  I went today at lunch.  To be fair, I am not talking about the Japanese side of the menu... I went for some delicious Korean food.  I was really hoping they would deliver a great meal!  I have to say... I was not impressed.  The bibimbap was just not very flavorful.  In fact, I was horribly disappointed.  I don't really know what else to say about the experience.  The rice was perfect, the beef was tender, the veggies were there... and it all just laid there... nothing special and bland.  I even added soy sauce to it hoping to help it that way.  Nothing worked.  Don't get me wrong... it wasn't bad food... it just had no kick... no umph... no personality!  The waiter brought out some very interesting side dishes that were very good.  The salad was actually outstanding.  I loved their ginger dressing. On a bright note... the place was crowded and the service was great.
