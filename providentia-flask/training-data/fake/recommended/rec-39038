Lunch at the Odeon hit the spot after 2 hours of stressful arguments before a federal judge. As an out-of-towner, I will not even try to pretend I am cool and hip into what makes a NYC restaurant the place to be. I'll just hit hard on the food. STARTER: Homemade lentil soup that hit the spot. Think it's hard to mess up lentil soup? Come to Tennessee! We can REALLY mess up any type of food! So thumbs up on the soup. MEAL: While a reuben sandwich and fries may seem plain jane and vanilla to some of you, you are missing out if you don't order this special when it's next on the menu. Came out with hot, cheese still melting over the freshly sliced corned beef. Don't even get me started on the fries. Out of this world! To top it off, I hear it's a wonderful spot to grab a drink after work, and while the service wasn't outstanding, it was fine. Would definitely return.
