This place had an interesting decor, the chandelier in the center of the room at an unusually low hanging and mirrored walls added a nice accent to the restaurant.  Besides that, the drinks were excellent, tons of variety in the mixed drinks and specialty cocktails.  For starters we had the chicken satay which was served cold with a peanut sauce, it was quite different than the norm but tasty none the less.  Another starter we had was the tofu tod which was ok.  For meals our party all had a variety, I had the chicken massaman curry which I though was excellent.  All in all I give this place 4 stars.  They had low prices for which I would have paid more for the food, they had great service, great scene for dinner, and amazing food.  I highly recommend and would go back personally.
