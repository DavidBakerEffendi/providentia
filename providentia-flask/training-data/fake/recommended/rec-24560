Don't think twice before going here. Every tapas ordered was out of this world in both visits. Our waitress was extremely helpful and circled all of her recommendations to please our group (1 vegetarian, 3 meat eaters), so definitely ask for some help because there's Â a lot to choose from. Romantic, dim-lit, rustic atmosphere that feels like you're in Spain. Get the sangria. YUM!
