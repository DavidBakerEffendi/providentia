Important to note, I'm not a big fan of Mediterranean food. With an exception of the halal cart on 56th street. The spices are good, but it just doesn't quite do it for me. Despite my lack of enthusiasm for Lebanese dishes, Ilili went beyond my expectations and unraveled a happily happy Thursday night for my party and I. The prices are very reasonable. For $42/person Prix Fixe dinner, we were offered choices of two appetizers, one main dish and one dessert.  Not bad. We ordered the following: Appetizer Falafel: fava bean dumpling / tahini Warm Eggplant: tomato / tamarind molasses / scallions Mekanek: lamb sausage / lemon butter Marinated Octopus & Calamari Salad: carrot tahini / sweet pickled cucumber nigella Main dish Chicken Shish Taouk: chicken breast / garlic / lemon Daily special Dessert Homemade Lebanese Ice Cream: milk  and chocolate Everything was delicious. I especially enjoyed the Warm Eggplant appetizer dish and Chicken Shish Taouk. The Lebanese cocktails were also amazing. I'm so glad to have found this place on Yelp!
