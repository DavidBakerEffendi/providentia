Service is great and friendly, food is pretty good, and the atmosphere is perfect. The cheese platter as an appetizer is amazing, and every time I am in Princeton I consider going if close by enough. If you have never been, it is definitely worth a try, you won't be disappointed. Also, I saw Brooke Shields here and apparently she loves it also, as she is a semi-frequent diner. Great minds think alike!
