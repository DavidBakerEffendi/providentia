I love the food and venue at Cafeteria. The place is trendy, great location and 24hours!! I tried the Mac n Cheese based on other reviews, and it was all that they say it is. *smile* . You might have a short wait but nothing major. All in all, this is my goto breakfast, lunch, and dinner place. Try it, let me know what you think...
