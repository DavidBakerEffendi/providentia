I'm of the mind that brunch is never worth a two hour wait, and Clinton St. is no exception. I went anyway to support the SO, and walking around LES is always fun. The French Toast was amazingly light and airy, though the maple butter could have used a higher maple:butter ratio. My eggs were good but not impressive; I had wild mushrooms and farm eggs in the fridge at home and could have thrown it together myself. On the positive side, they came with multigrain toast. Our server was cheerful despite the weekend rush. Please, if you're not going to take credit cards, make it very clear before you seat your patrons. I'd rather not receive a "cash discount" than get smacked with ATM fees.
