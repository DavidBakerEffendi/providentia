I LOVE the atmosphere of the place.  Whether you're outside on a beautiful day or inside on a shitty one, you're in a spacious and unique area.   There's lots of great German beers that you can get at a half a liter, or a full one.  They also have more standard mixed drinks as well as Yuengling etc, but I would recommend to steer away from those.  They're overpriced for what they are.  German is the way to go. There's a decent amount of food options, surprising since it's  counter service.  I love the Bavarian pretzels.  Although I'm not one, I can assume any sausage lovers would be in heaven.  All this plus ping-pong!  I can't wait for the warmer weather.
