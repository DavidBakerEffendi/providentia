It's just the perfect fit, every time, all the time.  A great stand-by for all occasions.  I was most recently here on Christmas eve and was so pleased to come inside and be enveloped by the warmth and cheer.  Cocktails are always stellar, oysters are always fresh.  My dining partners and I shared the whole red snapper special, which was a 2 lb fish stuffed with chilies and scallions and ginger and was absolutely phenomenal.  You cannot go wrong here, so stay safe with the fried chicken and iceberg salad or take a risk like we did, throw in some pumpkin fries and brussel sprouts, and you're sure to be impressed.
