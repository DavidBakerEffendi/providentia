Time Arrived: 11:45am Sunday Time Wait: No Reservations, No wait Party: 2 People Atmosphere: Cozy, classy (Love the floor to ceiling windows), Natural light Food/Drink: Ordered the Poached Salmon Salad for brunch, which was good. Nothing too spectacular. Definitely tasted fresh, but not sure if it was worth $21. As a side, me and my friend shared a side of "fruit" to add some healthiness to our meal. This was a little disappointing because it was more like sweet caramelized apples, not really what we were expecting. Service: Good Overall: Loved the atmosphere. Came here because we couldn't get into the Little Owl. The food was just average, a bit overpriced for its quality...but cute spot in a great area!
