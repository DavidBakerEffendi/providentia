Awesome Place!!!!!! Food is really great. It is just the most satisfying place for sure! You step in this place and you see a small bar, then a few more steps further and there is a dining room with a man rotating about 50 chickens over a fire, yea pretty wild. Ya have a seat, have a look at the menu, order up. everything is is really good. The half chicken is full of flavor. The ribs are great too. The sausage app is very tasty too. The prices are fantastic. This place just pounds out the food orders which probably keeps the prices where they are at. Take out orders are flying out non-stop! A few Devils fans know of this little gem! Oh and by the way, they don't advertise that it is a byob place.. BUT.. it certainly isn't frowned upon. Great bonus!
