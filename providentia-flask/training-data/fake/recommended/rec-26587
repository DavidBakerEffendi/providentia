Everytime we have ordered food from here we loved the food. They offer big portions and reasonable prices. The chicken wrap has got to be, hands down *the* best chicken wrap I have ever tasted, though a bit salty. The french fries are also delicious. Though we live quite close to the restaurant, the delivery time is incredibly long and takes about 1 1/2 hours to arrive. The driver is quite friendly though and the food arrived warm which is really what counts. I would definitely recommend this kind of food for late-night chowing and hangover Â recovery. The food here is anything but light, so come hungry and expect to leave absolutely stuffed. If it's not because of the piles of meat it's because the food is so damn delicious.
