After reading reviews of fellow yelpers, convinced to come here to try Sunday brunch.  Was extremely impressed! Big selling point at this joint is that drinks are included with brunch entrees on SUNDAYS.  The Bloody Mary was SUPERB! Perfect amount of horseradish, JUST LOVELY! My party ordered lobster Benny and Benedict Janes.  They were equally tasty. I myself had French toast, the BEST French toast I have ever had. Lovely atmosphere, thank god I made reservation, otherwise expect to wait a great deal of time to taste the wonderful food. I will definitely return!
