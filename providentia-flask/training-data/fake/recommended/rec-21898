I always passed this spot and wondered if this was an offshoot of Mr.Bruno's in Lyndhurst or some place using the name "Bruno's" to gain recognition. This place is the real deal! When I came in and saw them selling that sauce I knew they were legit! Plus I recognized the guy from the Lyndhurst Bruno's. You're going to want to get the Sicilian for sure! It's what the chain is known for. No place does Sicilian like Bruno's! Sauce on top with the cheese on the bottom. Actually I say with confidence they got the best sauce around. I'm a sucker for good sauce on a pizza. I think it's safe to say, if you order a dish and it has sauce on it, it's going to be great. Picking up a jar wouldn't be a bad idea. The interior is big and spacious. Not nearly as fancy as the Lyndhurst location but still nice. Lots of other slices to chose from as well. Bruno's pizza always keeps a lot of slices handy so you don't have to pick and choose which one you want. Regular pies are good too but not as notable as the Sicilian. Â  Oh and they are B.Y.O.B.! Always a plus! Needless to say I'm glad there is a Bruno's pizza so close to me. I would go out of my way to get their Sicilian Lyndhurst but now I don't have to! Not that I am going to stop going to the one in Lyndhurst because they offer an great dine in experience. This spot is great as well! Gotta love Bruno's!
