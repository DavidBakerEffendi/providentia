So many whiskeys...so little time. I've been here many many times.  I've never had a bad meal, be it a late-night snack, weekend brunch, or a full dinner.  And many more times I just stopped in for cocktails - still never disappointed. The brunch is great and not the same old fare you see at so many spots on Smith.  In general their food is great - upscale Southern cookin'.  Their shrip and grits are great.  The pulled pork is delish.  The smoked pork nuggets are a MUST.  And their green tomatoes are great as well.  As I said, I haven't had a meal here I didn't like. The staff is 95% awesome.  There are a couple of outliers, but generally speaking, the service is spot on.  The bartenders are smart and know how to mix a great Manhattan.  If you want to drop some cash on whiskey tasting, this is definitely the spot.  You'll be able to get the run-of-the-mill stuff for almost-run-of-the-mill prices, but then you can work up to the $100-a-shot Japanese import whiskeys.  And everything in between.  I especially appreciate their beer-and-shot combos.  Their barrel-aged cocktails (pre-mixed from a short list) don't do it as much for me.  But ask for anything, they'll whip it up.  Delicious. Cool atmosphere, too, I love the hanging lights over the bar area.  I feel like it tends to be a LITTLE louder than expected, given the size and the style, but I think that's a function of architecture.  Or I'm just sensitive.
