Reminded me a lot of Justine's back in Austin. Great atmosphere; dim with small wood tables, the kind you would imagine in an old world French or European place. Perfect for date night or dinner and cocktails with friends. Â  The menu has something for everyone. Crab croquettes (mini crab cakes on the menu) were perfect and clearly made with fresh crab. Also loved the artichoke dip and the roasted brussel sprouts. We will definitely be back.
