Celebrated our first wedding anniversary at Zahav, and it was perfect in every way.  Ambiance was intimate and comfortable, service was friendly and relaxed, tasting menu was perfect for a carnivore/vegetarian couple.  It felt special occasion-y without being stuffy.  I don't even particularly like hummus, but theirs just killed it.  Prices were totally reasonable given the quality of the food and the experience.
