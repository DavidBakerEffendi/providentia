In an area notorious for crappy and overpriced tourist eateries, this hidden underground gem is outstanding.  It's completely unknown to the masses.  It's not easy to get in due to its popularity of those who love the place.  Table waits can easily be 1+ hours.  There's a reason why the clientele is predominately Japanese.  They know damn good izakaya.  They don't take reservations per se, but they will call your cell phone when your table is ready, so don't walk too far away.
