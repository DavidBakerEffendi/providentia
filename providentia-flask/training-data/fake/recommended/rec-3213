Service was refreshingly efficient.  Hot dogs are fried and about 6" in length. There's no place to sit down in the shop, and none outside, unless you eat in your car. Looks like the counters date back to 1945 and the overall vibe is grimy, shopworn and maybe a bit creepy.   Hot dogs were okay, although on the smallish side,  but they're nothing I'd ever feel the need to go back for.  For my money, Callahan's of Ft. Lee had a larger and better fried pork dog, and you could actually sit down while eating. Fries were fresh and two adults had lunch for under $15.   This place serves as a good reminder that what you see on "Diners, Drive-ins and Dives" may not be as wonderful as imagined. I suspect many of the reviews here are tainted by the nostalgia effect, but honestly, this place falls somewhere on the 2.25 star scale when viewed objectively.
