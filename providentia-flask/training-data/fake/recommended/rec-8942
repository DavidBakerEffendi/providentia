Avoid:  - Calamari and watercress salad.  Everything was fried like tempura and it was very greasy albeit crispy.  Every bite oozed oil.   Not refreshing nor flavorful.   -  hangar steak.   Some pieces were very tough and chewy.  My jaw got tired from chewing.  I ordered medium, perhaps medium rare would have been better but I don't like my meat bloody.  Everything else on the dish beside the meat was good but tough meat was a huge turn-off. I give it 3 stars for the good service and for their halibut dish, which is  a daily  special.  That dish is stellar.
