I have been going to the Americana for many years. The last few times we have been there we left saying we won't return. This time we really won't.  The portions have continued to get smaller. Entrees come with vegetables but no starch. For $18-$28 entrees you expect much more. The quality has decreased along with the portions. My wife had overcooked bland salmon. I had a vegetarian pasta dish that was tasteless and severely overpriced for what it was. Even the kid's meals have gotten smaller. The salad with entree is a long ago thing of the past. The $4 side salad is an overdressed bowl of iceberg lettuce. They have a decent craft beer list, but it is a list only. They did not have the first 3 beers I tried to order so I gave up and tried a glass of wine.  Wines by the glass are $7-$9 for wines that cost that by the bottle at bottle king next door. Atrocious.  Service is attentive, but at times unprofessional. This is no longer a diner and no longer a decent restaurant.
