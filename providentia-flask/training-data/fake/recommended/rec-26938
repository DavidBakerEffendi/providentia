Did you know that lobster was once considered "poor man's food?" Well, it's true, back in the day, like way back when the first European settlers settled in North America, lobsters just washes up along the shore like leaves grow on trees. Okay, maybe that's a bit exaggerated, but the source of lobster was so abundant that anyone can get their hands on one. Overtime, lobsters gotten harder to get, I guess all the poor settlers ate them up in no time. Any way, Lobster Pound is like in the middle of nowhere. I would not know how to get here on my own if I did not get a ride from my friend. So we stepped into the left side of the place, where they will catch the lobster in those huge wooden looking tanks and then prep your lobster rolls for you. Not that I've seen them crack open a lobster in front of me or anything, but you can just tell they are fresh. So I've ordered a Connecticut Roll - a roll with just lobster, butter, lettuce and celery. Took my order to the other part of the restaurant, where it looks like an indoor picnic area. The lobster roll was fresh and it was pretty yummy, especially with the butter. The roll came with a bag of Cape Cod chips. Overall, I like the lobster roll, but not enough that I will trek all the way here by public transportation. However, if I get driven here, of course I'll come back for more =)
