Was blessed to find this place with a very small line.  After eating halal cart food, I now know what all the hype is about. This stuff is life changing.  Shredded pieces of meat and fresh lettuce and seasoned rice all topped with this amazing white and red sauce.  It's so basic, but it is just so damn satisfying.  The flavors and the textures combined seem to satisfy every nook and cranny of my tastebuds.  Revolutionary!
