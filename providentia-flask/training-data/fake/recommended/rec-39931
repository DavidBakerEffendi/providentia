Crab bisque was good but I'm from MD so a bit snobby in regards to crab soup. Ginger salad dressing was good and they make all their own dressings weekly. Citrus saut√©ed lobster, scallops, shrimp and scrod -- amazing!! Very tasty A++. So much food and this was the half plate. Kaelin was excellent and I highly recommend this place. I'll be back next time I'm in the area !!
