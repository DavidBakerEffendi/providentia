Dinner time on a Saturday?  No problem!  Our party of 3 walked right in and were quickly seated at a booth.  The service and friendly and quick.  The sushi that we ordered as appetizers were delicious, my husband's teriyaki steak was food as well.  My chicken teriyaki was not.  It was tasteless and subpar.  I was very disappointed.  The chicken had no flavor, and the teriyaki had even less.  Boo!  We will eat there again, but just for sushi (which honestly, we've had much better).
