Love it here...the Brussels sprouts are amazing, love the pizza. Love that its byob and prohibition is next door. I live in the neighborhood so I'm pretty stoked to have this place in walking distance. Not too expensive, quick and convenient. Only downside is that it's small and you may get sat next to people you don't know, but who cares? Make new friends:)
