We visited Leonardo's last night for the 1st time.  I have to say we have never had a more friendly staff then we had here.  Also, the food was delicious.  We will absolutely be going back here. I had the pomodoro sauce with meatballs and it was delicious.  A lot of the Italian restaurants serve frozen meatballs and you can tell.  Not here, there were homemade and delicious.  My husband had the veal and eggplant dish, our friends had chicken parm and a pasta dish with eggplant and artichokes.  They all enjoyed their meals also.
