I don't know why I like this place so much since it doesn't have green sauce, doesn't sear the gyro and serves soggy pitas.  All I can say is that something magical happens when you combine all the ingredients and sauces and it just works.  Don't be fooled by the imitators, go for the guys with the distinctive logo (not just similar color) on their plastic bags. Gyro: Ground meat pebbles that are so juicy (i.e. fatty) and oh so tasty.  Not seared like the competitors, but so soft it's like it's been steamed.  Not a fan of this naked, but loves it with the white and red sauce. Chicken: Big chunks of firm dark meat.  Light on the spices allowing the inner moisture to excel.  Once again, a perfect match for the sauces. Pita: Steamy and soggy.  Pretty nasty way to have a pita, but works strangely well in the plate.  Kind of like how you never thought dipping a hamburger in a milk shake would be tasty. Rice: Yellow, fluffy, not clumpy, firm and tender.  The way a proper pulao should be.
