I've had the chicken bowl, veggie bowl and veggie quesadilla.  Everything was fine, but it was nothing special.  They give generous portions and everything tastes very fresh, but there is just something missing, flavor wise.  In my chicken bowl, everything tasted good except for the chicken, which was seriously lacking in flavor (Chipotle's chicken is much better).   What brought this up to three stars were the margaritas.  The fruity margaritas are great and it's a treat to find a casual place (counter service) that serves good drinks.   I love the large, open windows at the Chestnut street location - all the benefits of sitting outside without having to actually sit on the sidewalk and deal with all the people walking by.  The Walnut Street location is too dark for my tastes.
