Really interesting little spot.. I'm not even sure how to describe the decor: lots of mirrors, chandeliers, and black&white. Definitely not typical Thai decor. It was surprising large inside, its narrow, and relatively unadorned in the front, so I expected it to be more comparable to Q or Wondee right down the street, but it extended very far back into the building, making it quite large for its location. I was getting my meal to go, but I was so amused by the decor, and even more so the waiters attire, that I decided to enjoy a Thai tea there, Â having them serve me while I waited. They wear what would be typical semi-casual grey long sleeve button down shirt, except they have ruffles up the middle around the buttons AND have a little black band in the back that sinches the shirt tight at the waist!! hahaha.. seriously maybe I'm a little bit immature but I was giggling to myself the whole time! The Thai iced tea was super yummy & in a nice tall glass. Lunch special was $7 for an appetizer and entree. Plenty of vegetarian options. The portions aren't skimpy either which was nice. My appetizer came with 3-4 vegetarian spring rolls & I got the tofu Pad Thai. Pad Thai has definitely been a hit or miss in my experience, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one! I would've preferred a little more sauce, peanut sauce would've been great., but still wasn't bad. I had gotten it to go, but I'm sure they would supply extra sauce in restaurant if asked. For $10 it was quite the tasty meal! I definitely recommend this spot for a nice lunch date! :) * I just looked at some of the other reviews which say the service was slow, it was dark & it blasted loud club music!? haha.. this was NOT my experience AT ALL. It was quiet, plenty of light, not too busy and the service was quick! Maybe they shift the atmosphere fordinner or late night, but for lunch it was a very nice relaxing ambiance.
