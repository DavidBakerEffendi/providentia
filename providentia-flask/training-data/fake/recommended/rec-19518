Best Damn sandwich I had in 2010. Easy. Roast pork sandwich with sharp provolone and tender Broccoli Rabe in soft delicious bread that perfectly captures all the juices whilst not getting too soggy. I know there are other things on the menu, and I don't know that I will ever be able to try them as I will always be pulled by the savory gravity of this wonderful sandwich.
