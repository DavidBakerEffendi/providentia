We waited about 40 minutes to be seated.  We ordered drinks and appetizers as we'll as dinner.  The drinks came right away and the appetizers came in a reasonable amount of time.  After we finished the appetizers were waiting about 35 minutes for our dinners when I asked the waiter when our dinners would come and he said he would check on them.  He came back and said shortly.  Then a manager came over to our table 10 minutes later and Gave some lame excuse that the kitchen was backed up.  Then another manager came over and said they would be up shortly.  Neither manager offered an apology.  We finally got our food after waiting almost an hour.  The food was ok.  Neither the two managers or waiters apologized or offered us anything to make up for their mistakes.  I would not Mmo back with this horrible service and mediocre food
