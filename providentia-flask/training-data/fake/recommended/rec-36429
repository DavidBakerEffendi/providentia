I loved the noodle. A lot of staff are no Japanese but they speak Japanese such as hello, thank you and to pass the order to the chef. It has nice authentic Ramen atmosphere. The noodle and soup was perfect and it was similar to what I used to have in Japan. One thing, it's little pricy for a bowl of noodle. I paid $15 + tip.
