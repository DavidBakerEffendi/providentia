I know I'm about to pick a fight with all the screamers in NY who just can't bear to be second to NJ in anything, but here goes anyway.  (But don't worry Chicago kids, I don't consider deep dish real pizza anyway) Star Tavern is without a doubt the best pizza I've ever had.  There, I've said it.  In fact, in all the people I've ever brought there in the last 15 years, no one has disagreed (at least to my face, but let's face it, I'm not friends with tactful people). There's no atmosphere.  It's bar pizza.  We have that in jersey. (side-note:  love the bars in jersey that serve free bar pies at happy hour - can we get some of that imported into ny?) A super-thin crust that's crispy at the edges, but soft everywhere else.  Thin like paper.  So thin, it's a normal sized pie, but you order a pie for each person at the table cause you're going to stuff yourself till you can't stuff yourself anymore because you can't believe you're eating something so good. I once ate 14 slices.  Damn that was a good night.
