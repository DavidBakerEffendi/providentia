Stopped in here while waiting on a load from William Sonoma. The atmosphere was great. Ordered the Italian Stromboli and garlic twists. The food was ready in minutes and was excellent. Â I would recommend this place to anyone and would love to bring my kids sometime if I'm ever in the area on personal time and not working.
