Hard to get something here that isn't delicious. Reasonably priced, friendly service, pretty much flawless. Try the Big Louie chx cutlet sandwich, the gobbler with smoked turkey, bacon, and swiss, or the humongous 1 lb. Superman burger. And Â finish off your lunch with a black and white cookie, texture of that bad boy puts most Jewish delis to shame
