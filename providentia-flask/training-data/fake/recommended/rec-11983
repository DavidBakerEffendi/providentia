Went here this week and absolutely loved it! The food and drinks were exactly how food should be - simple ingredients, immaculately prepared! We can't wait to return for brunch. The kale salad is incredible and so the butternut squash risotto was a rich and delicious. We had the apple pie for dessert, and it was by far the best pie I have ever eaten at a restaurant. Great decor and music too. Definitely a new local favorite.
