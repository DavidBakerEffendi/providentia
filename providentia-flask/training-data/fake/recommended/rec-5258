Can't recommend Molly's anymore, even for family meals. The food has been really bad lately -- negligently prepared, ingredients themselves seem cheap and bad. Ambience is dirtier and less friendly. Last family outing, the restaurant was dirty and cold, and some waitstaff seemed overworked and frustrated. The grandparents were freezing, and the employee we asked was openly resentful and put-upon at our request to turn up the thermostat. The little kids ordered what they always get at restaurants -- plain pasta with butter -- and even that was nasty. These are not gourmets, they're just little kids. If they won't eat plain noodles, then that's a bad sign. Our regular grown-up food was bad too. Our table waiter was a seemingly-teenage kid who was nice as could be, and great with the little kids. But that just couldn't make up for the bad food, bad ambience, and generally bad service.
