overall what a dining experience should be. dimly lit, great exposed brick walls with uniquely shaped clocks all over and cushions and pillows on the opposing wall for seating. My friend is a mixologist conisseur and he was impressed by the drinks which focused on darker liquers.  The octopus salad is a must and was the most flavorful thing we ate. The trout salad was also good and seemed smoky giving off some sort of a sausage flavor (none was to be found though) topped with apples and slices of boiled potatoes and grapes. The scallops were good though they were overpowering the rest of the dish (cherry tomatoes, baby spinach, and an overstarched pasta with ricotta cheese).  The halibut was the better of the two served with plantains (very sweet) and quite spicy with red peppers and some sort of a red sauce. Our waiter added to the experience as well with his easy going, nonchalance.
