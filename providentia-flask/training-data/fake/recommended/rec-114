We stopped in here for dinner on a whim after the line at Modern was too long.  It was a good find!  I know there are a lot of negative reviews on here, but really, 1/2 price sushi that was fresh and tasty deserves at least 3 stars, no?  The boy had hibachi, which was good, except his lobster was overdone (I'm not sure lobster was the right choice at a New Haven hibachi bar, but alas, that's what he wanted with his steak).  At any rate, the 1/2 price sushi is great, cheap, and I'll definitely be back!
