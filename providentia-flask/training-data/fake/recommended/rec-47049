My sisters and myself went to Sabrina's Cafe a few months ago when we were in Philadelphia. I love breakfast and this place did not dissapoint. It was so cute and laid back. Their coffee was really good. They had great prices. I had the french toast ! it was great ! :) if I ever went back to Philly I would deff come back here !
