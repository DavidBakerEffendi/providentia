This place is good for scratching that experimental itch. I went here with a friend and we were oohing and ahhing about the menu, just about wanting to try everything on it. We decided to get a bunch of things and share them. We got the steak tartare and not only was it beautiful, it was delicious! The nippon nachos were pretty bland, I wouldn't recommend them and the fried deviled eggs were nothing special either. However, I had heard about this foie gras donut and I had to try it. They get the donuts from DOUGH (which you should definitely check out another time) and they put it in the frier to make it hot and then they inject it with foie gras. They serve it with jam on the side for a little sweet to cut the savory. Delicious! And Adventurous! The ambience was great. We sat outside in the fun graffiti-walled backyard and it was perfection. The server was really cute, too. She recommended good drinks and was super cool. If you like adventure, then Do or Dine.
