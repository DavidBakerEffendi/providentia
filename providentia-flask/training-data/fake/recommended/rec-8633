I had this image that restaurant was a little stuffy. However, I found the reception and waiter to be friendly. The food was okay. I had the duck had good flavoring, but I wish that the skin was crispy. DC had lamb and said it was good but has had better. The trio of sorbet was good but a little expensive at $10. Portion for both entrees and dessert are on the smaller side. Waiter seem a little inexperienced and not very knowledgeable. Service was attentive with water glass filled promptly. The back portion is quieter. However, I think that I would have preferred to sit in the front for a better experience. I made a reservation through opentable so also got a call back asking for feedback. After I finished, I was told that they would mail something as appreciation. It has been more than a couple of months and have not received anything. Â I sent a follow-up e-mail and never heard back from them.
