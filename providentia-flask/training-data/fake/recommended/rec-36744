The first time we at here, I thought the pizza was just okay.  Then when we were back in Oregon, I tried to come up w/a pizza I liked better....  No dice. Then we came back this September and had it again, and I can definitely say that this is my favorite pizza of all pizzas.  I started craving it around June.  The crust is a great consistency:  thin, crispy and tasty.  The sauce was simple and tasted fresh.  The mozzarella is sliced, not shredded, so it melts in this weird awesome way to make the texture unique. We had a party of ten this last time and had to have 5 pizzas and no leftovers (We had some big eaters).  If you're wanting alcohol, I recommend against the beer.  It's never very cold.  They have a pretty big wine selection, though, and even the house red is pretty good at $4.
