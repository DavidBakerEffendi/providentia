This place SUX big time!! So we enter a basically empty INATTESO on a Saturday night (and you may wonder why) with a party of 4... Â Seated and with menus on a Saturday night about 10pm. Here we are, gracious and easy going, ordered, drinking then eating and suddenly being RUSHED the PHUCK OUT! "No rush", the lovely waitress said, but not even a minute later the PROUD ITALIAN waiter (who by the way, studied Spanish in Spain, as he proudly mentioned, because he was not understanding "our" Spanish... pointed out) dropped the check. I won't deny that they DID say kitchen was closing, however... having been a LONG time restaurant goer, they could've brought over a dessert menu to close things out in a professional manner. Forget it!! Our waitress was putting on her coat as we were trying to negotiate a dessert that never happened... This is NOT a restaurant for the financial area in its true sense; this is just a supplier of so-so Italian food for the area in the hours it wishes to "entertain". Food: C- Service: Pleasant but in the end an F for FAILURE Decor: B+ Prices: MEH... for what it is... Shameful. Proud Italian hospitality, rushing patrons out with a smile at 11:15pm on a Saturday night in NYC. Hilarious!! Never EVER again. To management - that is 4 people who live IN THE AREA - who will definitely tell at least 2 people each; and so on and so on and so on... Awful and shame on your staff.
