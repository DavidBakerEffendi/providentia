While the waiter was friendly and efficient, something has gone wrong with this restaurant since we first started coming here.   We ordered deviled eggs, and shrimp cocktail for appetizers.  The deviled eggs had no seasoning; it was as if someone had just put the plain yolk back in the egg without any vinegar, salt pepper, mayo.  The shrimp looked great, but were tasteless as well.   My husband ordered a burger with a fried egg and cheese.  Egg was missing.   My flatbread pizza.  Where do I begin.  I ordered the one with frisee lettuce and poached egg.  The expectation was a crispy flatbread with fluffy lettuce, cheese and bacon and egg on top.  Clearly my order waited under a heat lamp for a long time since a) the lettuce was wilted, (in fact it looked spoiled), b) the flatbread was so "old," it was flabby, limp and flacid.  Worse, it was stuck to the plate.   Will not go here again.  Take a pass and head toward New Haven.
