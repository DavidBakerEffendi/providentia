The pizza was great. The staff was very nice but not super attentive. In all fairness I Â came here with a large group on a busy night. Everything was great except we did have to keep stopping the waiter to ask for things. They could have definitely benefited from having another waiter working. They forgot to bring us the second to bottle of wine we ordered. It wasn't a big issue just something to note. I had a great meal and enjoyable evening otherwise. If you aren't going to be a high maintenance group I think you wouldn't have any problems.
