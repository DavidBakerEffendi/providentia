dark and cozy, yet inviting and warm decor. had dinner reservations, but there was a solid after-work crowd grabbing cocktails at the bar. while waiting for the rest of our party, we spotted a mouth-watering chicken dish coming to a table around us...and i was already won over. settling in, it reminded me of a couple great spots in chicago (girl & the goat) - small plates, simple decor, phenomenal food. it's definitely a sharing restaurant. there's too many delicious things, and with small and regular dishes, it's the way to go. so bring your best foodie friends and hunker down. we started with sheeps milk ricotta (so fresh, so light and tasty) and the fried artichokes (okay, but i wouldn't tell you to order it). between five of us, we split three larger plates and boy were they large: their steak special (omg, perfect.), garlic chicken (delicious.), and their seafood special (again, amaze.) with a parpardelle pasta with lamb bolognese (perfection, again). dessert was tiramisu and carrot cake. it was a lot of food - but hey, we're big eaters. a pricey bill, but well worth it.
