First timer for brunch at Brooklyn Star and I will return. Seating is communal style and the ambiance is like a family gathered all in the kitchen for dinner. Their country biscuits are just like the ones MY mom bakes, and is good with butter drizzled in honey. My brunch selection was their chicken and waffle. The portion size was decent (1/4 breast w/ wing and leg) but another piece of friend chicken would've been perfect. Will come back again to further explore the brunch and dinner menus.
