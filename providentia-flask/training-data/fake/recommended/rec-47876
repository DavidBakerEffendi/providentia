What to do when living in Hartford on a snowy Saturday. 1) Get in the car 2) Drive to BruRm @ BAR in New Haven 3) Consume many great beers brewed on the premises 4) Eat lots of excellent pizza (sorry Pepe's... you may have met your match - these pies can't be beat!) 5) Decide to get another couple of pizzas for tomorrow 6) Kill some time until you're legal to drive back to Hartford Yep, that was our regular routine for three years. I still miss those pizzas and their outstanding beer.
