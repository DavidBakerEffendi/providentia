Moving to Westchester has not helped my Yelping. So I've never been to Spain, but this place makes make me think "I think I'll go to Spain just to eat" (Forget the beautiful architecture or the rich history... just the food). Here's what we had: grilled octopus, fried garbanzo beans, a plate of assorted cured pork, grilled peppers w/ sea salt, artichokes and manchengeo cheese wrapped in ham, chorizos sauteed in sherry dressing and a pitcher of the most delicious sangria i've had in a long while. Now, I recently been to Boqueria, which was just as excellent... but, we had the Valentine's Day special... which were 6 plates (included steak) and a glass of champange. We ordered a pitcher of sangria on the side as well. The bill there came up to $180 (including tip) At Tia Pol, we paid about $100 for dinner and came out stuffed... no chocolate dipped churros here tho... So it's your call... but remember, it was this place that made me consider Spain as an eating destination.
