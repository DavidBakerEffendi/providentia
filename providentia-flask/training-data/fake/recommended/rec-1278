Ishkabibble's! I simply like the name! I tried the cheesesteak with whiz (for the first time) and it just was not my fav.  But it may just be because I'm not a huge fan of whiz.  The rest of it was delicious though.  I also tried the Ishka Cheesesteak (it has pizza sauce - Mmmm!) and it was incredible!   I love the decor and the staff was very friendly.  I would definitely go back the next time I'm in town.
