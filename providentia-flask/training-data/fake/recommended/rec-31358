Stopped here for drinks on a Saturday evening before dinner.  It's located mid-block on 52nd Street, between 10th and 11th Ave, adjacent to a big Archstone rental complex which seems to provide a lot of its clientele. It was a nice day so we sat outside, but the interior looked very inviting as well.  They have a small but nice menu of wines by the glass as well as a few beers to choose from.  The food selection is small but what they have is good.  The servers were very friendly, and overall we had a nice experience.  Would definitely return here.
