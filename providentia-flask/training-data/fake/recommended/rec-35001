I came here for dinner and decided to ordered tapas to start off the meal. It took 25 to 30 minutes before they were served. I'm not sure how you feel, but I tend to think that is on the  long side for just a few appetizers ....  When the tapas finally arrived, I thought it was just ok ... not good, but not bad. Actually I thought one dishes ( the braised pork belly ), was way too salty. The tapas alone weren't too filling. I wanted to order more food ( like the skirt steak ) , but I was afraid they were going to take another 30 minutes before anything came back so I just ate the tapas with bread. I basically proceeded to make mini sandwiches with everything - from chicken, to chorizo, to pork belly, and fried cheese. My sandwiches turned out to be pretty good!!  It's too bad service was too slow because I would have definitely ordered more... Granted it was Friday and we had our 2 year old with us, but still. I'm not sure we'll be back.
