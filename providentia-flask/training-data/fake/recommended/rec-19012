I've been to a few terriors and I've really no complaints. Â This is a great place for a casual date, or for catching up with a friend over some tasty snack plates and a glass of wine or three! It can be a smidge loud but it is a wine bar after all. You can expect a truly wonderful wine listing and servers who will (given a few pointers about your likes and dislikes) surprise you with some interesting selections, if you give them a chance!
