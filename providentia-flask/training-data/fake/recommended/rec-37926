Chop Shop is way better than a lot of Thai restaurants in Chelsea and Hell's Kitchen. I've had the misfortune of trying other Thai restaurants primarily for convenience sake- friends from out-of-town staying in Times Square, and will definitely stick with Chop Shop and one other Thai place, which I won't name located in the 400 block of Avenue of the Americas. I've worked my way through the menu and the food is always fresh and well prepared - the flan is delicious and the service is excellent!
