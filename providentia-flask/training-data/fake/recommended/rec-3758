Wow, this might be the best burger in the city.  Its really amazing.   Plus the place is very cool, and the owners are nice and the service is great.  Also its in a fun neighborhood, but tucked away on a not crowded street.  What could be better? Looks like bad reviews have come from non-bell curve rating distribution reviewers, and those people are the scum of the earth.  Do yourself a favor and pay Juniper a visit.
