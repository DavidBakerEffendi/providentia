Lam Zhou is amazing. The dumplings are delicious. You can bring your own beer, and some of the tables are communal. The whacking of the noodles during the hand-making process can be a bit LOUD, but - it's all worth it. It's a small place and a New York City staple. Keep it real and get some dumplings.
