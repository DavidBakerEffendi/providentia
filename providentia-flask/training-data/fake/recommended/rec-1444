Taste the pork sandwich, and I swear to god youll want to go get a room with it !... DELICIOUS.   I dont even know if they even have any other stuff on the menu.. to me DiNics, is just PORK SANDWICHES...., once you eat the pork I just kind of zone out and wonder if pigs know how friggin delicious they are Its got a hold on me, every time I go to center city .. Its like, Pats what??? Genos who???Dont know what DiNics does, or what the hell they put in their roast, but its like an alien abduction.. i lose time and just find myself there (wondering if pigs know how delicious they are etc..) . Not just one of the best PORK sandwiches, there is, but one of the best sandwiches, there is PERIOD! Their fried long hots are the best, and they pack some punch boy, you remember you were at DiNics, the day after ...trust me.   IMO the best sandwich in Philly... and according to the food network...the US !
