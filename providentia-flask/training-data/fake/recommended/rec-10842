This is my favorite burger in NYC (it's tied with the prime meats burger). I don't understand why more people don't talk about it bc it is truly a gem of brooklyn. I recommend the regular 282 burger but they also have other great french fries, turkey burgers and lamb burgers. I crave this burger sometimes and just go and get it alone at the bar. Any friend I've ever taken here loves it too. It's never crowded and it's always pleasant and quick! Run, don't walk, to this burger!
