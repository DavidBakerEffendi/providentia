What to order: Lemon Chicken over Rice What not to order: Lamb Sausage Beef Kosfta Overall: It took 30 minutes for the food; 10minutes to order and 20 minutes for it to be made. I was excited about this truck, so I tried the Royale to try a little bit of everything. The spices and flavors are very bold but not overpowering. And yes, Samir is just as friendly as everyone described. But the lamb was dry, the kosfta was burnt and the beef was under seasoned. The chicken, and caramelized onions however was juicy and had great flavors. Come for the lemon chicken over rice, but only if the line is short.
