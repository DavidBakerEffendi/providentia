We celebrated my birthday there last night. While having all my loved ones with me was the best part of the evening, the food was superb. We ordered so many dishes but our few favorites were the short rib, Brussels sprouts, the PA truffle, pork belly and the sea bass. The paella and agave chicken didn't quite live up to our expectation. The decor is quaint. It does get really crowded and noisy, so definitely not a place for a quiet date! Overall a great evening.... Amex n cash only...make a reservation....
