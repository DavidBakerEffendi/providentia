To begin, the food here is absolutely delicious. I have been here twice, the first time being on my birthday for dinner and I ordered the tofu and cold noodle dish. It's absolutely delicious and unique. I grew up vegetarian and am an absolute vegetarian food snob. It was delightful. Second, I got the banana French toast which was equally unique and delectable. I want to say that Sabrina's got three stars because of their poor hostesses. I went to the restaurant last Sunday, called ahead and was told to arrive around 11:30 in order to get a table. Once we arrived we were told it'd be another thirty minutes and that there were 9 tables ahead of me. Â My family and I walked around the Italian market for a half hour and returned to be told that there were still 6 tables waiting ahead of us and it'd be another hour and a half. I think this is a despicable way to treat your brunch customers and I had to share my story on here. Delicious food, terrible costumer service.
