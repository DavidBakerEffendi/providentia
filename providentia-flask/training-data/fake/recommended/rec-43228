Great UWS spot for a hearty heaping plate of brunch.  Known for the their pickles, biscuits and jam of which i only has the biscuits -  with poached eggs and sausage gravy - kind of heavy but yum (usually comes with the mushroom gravy, but I opted for the sausage).  The real star was the chicken and pancakes plate, for the win!  very generous serving.  Good coffee.  Liked the long  tables and "country style" seating in the back.  Very cute bar and counter in the front.
