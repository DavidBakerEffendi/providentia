My girlfriend still talks about this place. Can't say she's wrong either. Upon our arrival our table wasn't quite ready, so the hostess (I forget her name, she was awesome, though) advised we cruise elsewhere for a cocktail. She texted and called right when our table was ready. The spot is incredibly quaint. Tight, but comfy. Very warm. We shared the sunflower salad and clams to start, which were both very nice. Loved the wine recommendations from our waitress. Didn't even have the sliders which is why we need to go back. She ordered the halibut, I had the porkchop. No lie, the best porkchop I've ever had, and one of the best meals I've enjoyed in New York City.
