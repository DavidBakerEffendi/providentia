After reading the reviews here, I went to Landmarc when I needed a place to meet in the area for a business lunch. Landmarc did not disappoint. My lamb sandwich was outstanding -- whatever sauce was on that thing was entirely fierce. My counterpart's salmon salad received high marks as well. I would love to go back. My only qualm was with their lame menus -- nothing cool about a beat-up piece of folded paper containing poorly organized listings. Otherwise, though, it was taaaasty.
