From all the great yelp  reviews i decided to take my gf. I went there craving lobster but was disappointed cause the waiter had no clue if the lobster was maine or not ...... How can you run a seafood resturant without knowing your food!!! Nobody in the resturant knew what kind of lobster it was. Unbelievable The waiter was a real ba boooo ,,,,,,, So i had to order salmon it was ok ,,,,,,, nothing to brag about very disappointed in the place...To small and the menu being on the wall not really convient to look  at had to stand up to see the menu,,,,, Its just ok .......WE WERE THE ONLY  CUSTOMERS AND THE SERVICE WAS POOR ,,,,,
