If you're looking for a cosy restaurant out of the usual 7th Av strip, in a quiet corner, with great food, nice atmosphere & excellent service, you got it. I eat here quite often and love that they experiment a bit beyond the traditional Italian. A big "wow" for the duck, the steak with chimichurri & the shrimp pasta. Ingredients are fresh & the price is more than fair ( the portions are actually human & not oversized). Try also the soup of the day, they are all awesome!
