This place is hopelessly overpriced and does not offer the quality you would expect for that kind of money. You can get the same exact quality of sushi, if not better, at all you can eat bars in the area (where unlimited Sushi costs as much as one roll here). As far as the non-Sushi food items are concerned, I was not impressed, my husband ordered the cowboy steak and it was chewy and not seasoned well. Their 'CRAB CAKES' are made from IMITATION CRAB MEAT but priced like a real crab cake ($30!!!!) - I am so glad I asked before I ordered. I ended up getting the 'crispy' duck, which was mostly fatty on the outside and dry on the inside. The rice on the side was overcooked. The atmosphere is strange, with red lighting, it is kind of dingy and has the strangest mix of styles. It seems like it is attempting to be Asian with lots of Asian artwork and red and black walls but then they put a huge wall mural of Michelangelo's Creation of Adam in the middle of the room. Oh, and it seems to be seat yourself because there was no hostess to be seen anywhere. The drinks are too sweet and the bartender appeared to be drunk. He consistently tried to pressure our table into ordering shots, etc. And when we did would always drink one too. It seemed like he just didn't want to drink alone. We went to this restaurant on a Groupon deal which includes a 20% tip. While the service was not bad, if it had been up to me, I would not have left that much. I don't think we'll be back anytime soon.
