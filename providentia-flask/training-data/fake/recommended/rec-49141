I appreciate Chef Garces' restaurants, but this is a definite flop on multiple levels. I think this was a poor copy of Eatly in NYC. The market it too small to really find anything interesting or to be used as a marketing pull. Menu list is not impressive and I can't even say the dishes tasted very good. Service was horrendous. Perhaps understaffed or just really bad serving staff. Late to take orders, no water refills, and rarely checks up on us. I would save your money and try one of Chef Garces' other restaurants like Amada or Tinto. What a big disappointment. Muy mal.
