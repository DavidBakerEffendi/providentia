Japanese Tapas for those seeking food other than sushi. Came in on a Wednesday evening and got seated for 2 at the bar. :: Food :: chicken breast w/salt chicken meat ball w/terriyaki beef fillet beef skewers fried tofu agedashi tofu cod fish filet kamameshi daily special fish long island duck Before our order came, they served us a small clump of rice seasoned with the salt. it was really good. As time passed, each plate came and they were pretty small- smaller than expected. Shareable between 2, but no more. The fried tofu was an accidental order as my friend was thinking agedashi (ate it anyways and ordered the agedashi late). Both chicken plates were really good. Each paired well with the seasoning it came with. the plain fried tofu we dipped in leftover terriyaki sauce. the fish fillet was really good and flakey. The kamameshi was tasty though a bit salty. The duck was dry, not the best. :: Service :: Service was pretty good, especially because it was packed and busy. They even cleaned up quickly when I accidentally knocked my glass of water over. :: Ambiance :: Very dark lighting, not too loud- romantic? Very comfortable except that it was too hot in there. Midway through dinner, I was sweating and felt short relief when people would come and leave the restaurant. Overall, it was a great meal. There was still a lot of things to try on the menu. Service is good, ambiance is great. It was nice sitting at the bar and watching them prepare the plates as well as the fresh ingredients lined against the bar. Hopefully its not too hot next time. Definitely recommend ordering the kamameshi as soon as you sit down. It is a bit on the pricey side, but its nice to splurge once in a while for a good meal.
