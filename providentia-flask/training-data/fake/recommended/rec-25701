The service was great.  The ambiance pleasant for an after-work experience...but... Sometimes smart people do stupid things...like misread the prices on the menu.  And sometimes menus deceive people who maybe aren't used to things like "tastes" of wine (what the heck is that? aren't samples free?) prices being on the right while normal glass prices are nestled between the description and taste price.   Like a dummy I ordered wine by the glass thinking it would be the taste price and honestly, maybe wine drinking should be done economically, but I was trying to pinch a few pennies.  The Godello.  The friggin' Godello.  It wasn't even all the great, but heck, it was cheap (insert banging head on wall here). We order the meatball sandwich my friend has been raving about and the beets and cheese risotto balls.  The meatball sandwich was nice.  Was it out-of-this-world-I'm-becoming-a-meatball-­sandwich-addict good?  Not really.  And where was the cheese in the beet and gorgonzola risotto balls?  Terroir needs to get crazy with the cheese in these things.  There just isn't enough to give the balls a balanced flavor. Sigh.  Then comes the bill and I realize the stupid error of my attempt-at- fancy-wine-drinking ways.  So what turned out to be a nice enough meal turned into a disappointment because I didn't feel I my money's worth.  Maybe it's my fault for misreading the menu...either way I may not be back.  There are plenty more wine bars in NYC with easy-to-read menus for dummies like me.
