Ladies night/ Family time @UpThai! First time and I must say we are All VERY impressed! You have to really look for this place but when you find it what a gem! Such a surprise! If you're looking to have a great time at a calm but lively little place with nice music, great chatter around cool ppl and great Thai food come here! Wonderful intimate ambiance with dimmed lights, amazing food (good portions for the price), kind service, and Enjoying a great time with family we haven't seen in a long time.. I will definitely be back to try more dishes! Nice little ending to long day's work! :)   P.S. Had the Kea Mao... It was quite wonderful! Then had dessert - the Mhor-Gang brûlée.. A little bit of sweet heaven on earth! If there was nothing else I swear I'd come back just for that! ^_^
