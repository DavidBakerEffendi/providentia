Heed the warnings herein about the cramped quarters;  they're not exaggerations.  The place is so cramped if I wanted to change my mind, I had to go outside. We wanted to go to The Spotted Pig but it was between Xmas and New Year and they had an abbreviated menu of only a few unremarkable things.  I asked a person working in an art gallery nearby where she goes for lunch and she recommended Tartine.  It was just the thing for a cold, gray, day! I had the croque monsieur (yeah, yeah, borrriiing).  Man, that was good! The hash, with tomatoes and scallions, was AMAZING!!!  Others in our group had the Egg Benedict, Salmon Benedict, and pastry.  By all reports, the food was great. Note that this was breakfast/brunch stuff.  I don't know anything about their dinner entrees.
