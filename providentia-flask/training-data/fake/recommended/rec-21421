Up to date my convenient place to get my fresh made juices! Im a big fan of juicing and on the go lazy juicing at home days, they meet my needs since They are nearby. Only problem is they only accept cash. I guess they are like my breakfast spot. I also grab my veggie sour cream onion bagel here too. Yummy! My favorite juice here so far is the cucumber spinach apple. But I have a lot I haven't tried so it isn't final yet. ;-) Im still on the hunt for other juice places because their juicing ingredients are still limited at B2.
