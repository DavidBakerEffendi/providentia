Went to Northern Spy with two other couples and have been dying to go back. Everything I tasted was absolutely delicious. You can taste the freshness in the dishes, I love that. I believe the menu changes almost daily depending on the ingredients they have. There was a slight wait because we were a group of 6 and it's very small (and they don't take ressies). But totally worth the wait. I can't wait to go back and take newbies there. I'm on a mission to make everyone a fan of Northern Spy! You can go there for groups, but expect the wait to be longer.
