Small joint which can get and stay crowded even into the late hours of the night, usually once everyone wants their late night burger fix. Bar seating and small 2 person tables available at the front, several larger tables at the back. Expect to wait a bit for tables to free up. Don't let that 2nd Yelp picture of the Corner Bistro's menu fool you. Those prices have certainly increased since the first time I discovered this place several years ago. The Bistro Burger is still the same delicious hockey puck thick patty with cheese and bacon. Not the absolute best burger ever in NYC, but definitely way up there which warrants a visit here. Only gripe is that the price is definitely closer to $10 now when it used to be such a steal back then. Not too much of a beer person, but cheap light/dark McSorley Ales on tap too. When the place is packed, service is mediocre and slightly rude at times depending on the person. And wow just found out they have a LIC location too. Perhaps I wont have to trek so far to this location if it's as good. Mind blown.
