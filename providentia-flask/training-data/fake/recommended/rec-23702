IT's OKAY. Not exactly appetizing but nothing out of the ordinary. Maybe i'm a little stuck up about mexican food because I grew up with authentic mexican food, but this just doesn't cut it all for me. It's a good meal to have when you're strepped for cash and time and want something filling.... aand I guess it's a little healthier than the other fast food chains such as mcdonalds, but why bother? Oh, but the ingredients DID taste fresh for the record. Nothing to rave about here, and it tastes a little shallow. Â I have only had the chicken burrito there though.
