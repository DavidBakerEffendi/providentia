"Market fresh vegetables" do not = onions (so many onions!!!) and shredded carrots. Grandmaster Vege looks like a delicious grain free lasagna, but it tastes like jarred marinara and ONIONS. An onion is not a vegetable, in my book. Hu, you're not getting 1 star only because I'm intrigued to try your soup, sides and desserts (which aren't as much as the rest of your food, which seems really overpriced), but $9 for that hunk of condiment is retarded. I am bummed.
