I came here today on my birthday as usual, I'm pleased with the service and the food. The waitresses were attentive and pay attention if we ask for something and get it right away. My company and I ordered Soondubus and Bimbimbop, and they tasted delicious. We got the danger for the Soondubu and there was a nice spice and flavor to the stew. Our side dishes were plentiful and are a great compliment to the main dishes. We were given fried fish, kimchi, pickled cucumbers, etc. All tasted great and I could have them as a meal itself, lol. BCD is one of my favorite Korean restaurants and I highly recommend going there. Especially during the winter time because the Soondubu makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside, lol.
