I have a Thai-addiction, and so I begged my friends to go out for Thai one night. This place is AWESOME and looks so fancy. I was really surprised that the prices were moderate compared to the look and feel of the restaurant. I got the chicken Pad See Ew and it was so good. My friend got the special Pad Thai, and it looked delicious as well. Would definitely recommend it!
