We ate here on an August evening and came away feeling rooked. The food was utterly ordinary but the prices were not.  They actually had the nerve to charge us $16 for our son's plate of pasta-out-of-a-box with butter and a little grated cheese! The gentle flavor of Chilean sea bass was utterly overwhelmed by the intense fishiness of the shrimp placed on top; yet when my husband mentioned his lack of enjoyment to the chef/owner, he thanked him for the comment but made no adjustment to the bill, didn't even offer us a dessert or a drink to make up for it. A pasta dish with a medley of summer vegetables could not have been more ho-hum; it tasted exactly like something I throw together at home out of the fridge vegetable bin and a box of DiCecco. The ambiance was pleasant enough, but the ordinariness and poor judgment in the food preparation detracted greatly from our enjoyment, and the shock of the bill  - $100 without wine (it's a BYO) - was really the kicker. You can get Italian food that is ten times better at a third of the price. Skip it.
