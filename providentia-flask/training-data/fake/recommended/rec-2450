While in Philadelphia for New Year's my boyfriend and I decided to do the taste test.  We began at Geno's and ended at Pat's.  Overall, I was not impressed with Pat's.   I ordered a "Whiz Wit".  They give you more "whiz" than Geno's but the bun wasn't that impressive, the meat was rubbery and a bit tasteless to me, and the onions tasted and felt very strange.  I couldn't finish my sandwich, which is a first because I'm definitely an eater but I couldn't stomach or bring myself to swallow anything so bland with such a strange aftertaste.  I definitely did not think it was worth the $7.50 paid. The atmosphere was friendly and amusing and they were definitely quick with the order but I know when I return I'll just stick with Geno's.
