I've been to Kati about three times and each time has been different.  The first time I came weekday lunch (I do not recommend) and it was seriously crowded.  Their was a line out the door and only two cashiers.  I'm sure all the midtown workers flock over for lunch to take out even though all the tables were full pretty much.  We ended up taking our food to go and ate in Bryant Park. Kati co has a really long layout with tables in the front and back and cashier in the middle.  I'd say the prices are a little high but the food is good. I tried the paneer roll and the chicken tikka roll. The paneer was fantastic-- it had a great taste and texture with large cubes of cheese and spices.  The chicken tikka roll was not what I was expecting. I don't think I will order that one again.  It bore little resemblance in flavor profile to my favorite chicken tikka dishes.  The roll was pretty dry and didnm't have as much flavor as I wanted. Also the size of the rolls is a bit small.  I have a healthy appetite and to be truly full I think I would need 3-4 rolls to satisfy my hunger (which would run you about $20).  But 2 rolls would be a nice snack in between meals. The service isn't super fast so you will probably have to wait awhile for your order but they have good bottled soft drink options. The second time I went they were switching registers and/or training a new register employee and I had to literally wait for them to finish talking for 10 min before they would acknowledge me or anything like that.  Even then they almost took another customer before me except that person asked if I had been first. Super rude and unnecessary not to just explain to me or offer something other than a sad apology after the fact.  FYI this was not during the rush so not sure why it was still chaotic in there. Left feeling unsure about how I feel about their service while I still like the food.
