Looked at the menu on yelp and was excited to get a whole chicken for $9 and empanadas for $1.25 as I'm on a budget. Got there and looked at the menu and it was different. Whole chicken for $16 and 2 empanadas for $8 (the whole menu was different). Was told by our really nice waitress that the menu changed 2 months ago and they didn't change it online. I wasn't expecting this but we were hungry so we stayed. Ordered maduros but the server said they weren't coming out very good today which was dissapointing but nice that she told us. The whole chicken was good but I wouldn't go again for the price.
