My boyfriend and I stumbled here when we were craving burgers in the area and we'd heard a friend loves it. We arrived around 1 30 on a Saturday and only had to wait 20 minutes.  Yes it is a small place but that's really all you need for a place like this.  Saw people with everything on the menu and it looked delicious but we both ordered burgers and were not disappointed in the least, it's one of the best I've had.  The spices they add to the meat really make it.  They don't ask how you'd like it cooked or what kind of cheese (though Swiss mozzarella and goat are choices) but there's no need for it on these burgers, one of those places where they know how it should taste.  Cheap meal as well at just over $20 with a beer.  Also they accepted credit cards when we went.  I'll definitely be back.
