It's now a beautiful expanded establishment that you can now enjoy delicious eatery without feeling claustrophobic! Food is still the same but they've added new items! Can't wait to try them all. My only tip is that if you come here on a weekend, prepare for a wait of some sort ( 20 minutes and up) , especially if your party is 3 or more.
