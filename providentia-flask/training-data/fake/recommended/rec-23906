I'm a huge fan of Cantina's Northern Liberties location so I never made my way to Los Caballitos but I'm really glad I finally did.   Heading to a popular Philly restaurant on a Sunday at 1:30 is always risky but luckily it wasn't crazy crowded and we were seated right away and brought their chips and 2 salsas - which I could just have that for lunch and be very happy.  We ordered drinks and I tried a special with Bluecoat gin, cucumber purée and sangrita.  It was similar to a bloody mary but cucumber always makes things way more refreshing.  They took about ten minutes to come which wasn't a big deal to us, but our server apologized and bought us that round and that made him awesome in my eyes. The food was as delicious as I expected. I recommend the Eggs Benedict with green chile cornbread and bacon.  I'll absolutely be back again the food and drinks are great and the servers were all very friendly and happy to help anyone which for me turns a place from good to a favorite.
