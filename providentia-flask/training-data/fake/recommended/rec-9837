You want a Chinatown dining experience where you actually feel like you're walking into a restaurant in China? Here it is. I was one of three white people in this restaurant of about fifty. Everyone was speaking Chinese voraciously and everyone looked angry, it was great. I ordered wonton soup with egg noodles, it was $4. I said I'd like to eat here, but she said (and by said, I mean used hand motions coupled with very bad English) I had to take it to-go because there was no space. I waited for a few minutes, and I saw a spot open up. I tried hard to explain to them that I'd like to eat inside, and eventually they sat me at a small table already occupied by a young woman. They poured my soup from the to-go cup into a real bowl and brought it to the table. Then, the waitress fills up a 4-inch tall styrofoam cup with water and brings it to me, along with a real Chinese soup spoon and chopsticks. I felt very authentic! The soup was excellent. The noodles were just right, and there were a lot of them. The wontons were very good; I think they had both pork and shrimp. The vegetables in the soup were tasty and tender, and the broth was delicious and not too salty. Real Chinese food for real Chinese prices, and a very authentic Chinatown experience I'll remember forever.
