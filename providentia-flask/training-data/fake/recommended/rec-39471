I believe in quality over quantity.  I believe that if a person puts their thought and creativity into something, it is glutenous to ask for too much of it and actually detracts from the beauty of the finite experience. I've been to Upstate  several times for happy hour and for dinner. For happy hour it's a great deal. Cheap beer. Cheap oysters. The cool part is that there are oysters from both coasts, you mark down your choice of six out of 12 or 18 choices and the staff lines them up in the order you chose them.  This allows you to learn the ins and outs of each oyster as you "suck it down".  Learning the individual flavors and textures that nature has so eloquently bestowed upon us. This one is nutty, that one is salty, this one is rich, and that one is creamy.   When it comes to eating mollusks, I consider myself to be an expert.  I take my time with each oyster to stimulate a bond between the taste buds and the mind. Upstate helps foster this relationship between mouth and shell and I appreciate them for it.
