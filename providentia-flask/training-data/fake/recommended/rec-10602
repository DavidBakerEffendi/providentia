Got here around 6pm and got a seat at the bar immediately despite the place being very busy.  By the time we left there was a pretty decent wait for tables.   I'm not gonna jump on the bandwagon and say this is the best burger I've ever had, but I will definitely be back to try some others.  The burgers absolutely have that umami going on which you can't find many other place.    I had the Manly Burger which was delicious but also incredible salty.  The lady had the Truffle Burger which was better than mine.  I want to try all of the burgers on the menu and most likely will within the next year or two.  Also, their truffle fries were undeniably amazing.  Bonus points for having Bronx Black Pale Ale on tap.  Definitely recommend.
