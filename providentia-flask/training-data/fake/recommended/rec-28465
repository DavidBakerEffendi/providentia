So here's the deal. I called twice and visited once prior to my birthday. I told them the date and how many people were showing (around 15). They told me they don't take reservations, and that's cool--it's a bar, and it's a popular one. I show up, though, and lo and behold there's a party of people in the back, sitting at a big 9-seater with a fat reserved sign. I asked them what they did to get a reservation, and they told me that the birthday girl's boyfriend used to live above the bar. And that's fine. But I wouldn't have come to Sweet Afton with 15+ people if I didn't know that they would be crammed into a teensy booth. I had three other places in mind that unfortunately now were not really options. So I complained to the bartender/owner because I felt like they hadn't been totally honest or clear with me, and he said we'd get a free round. Awesome! But it turns out he didn't want to cover 15 peoples' drinks. Which--again--totally understandable, but why promise something you can't deliver? It left me pretty pissed off so I gathered my group and we took off for a different bar that was more than happy to give us special attention--and a round of my favorite shot for free. Great food, fantastic beer selection, but it's all for naught in my opinion if you can't get your customer service side together.
