A monthly regular at Corner Bistro. This place is a no frills bar serving some damn good burgers. On a paper plate, your choices are limited with a hamburger, cheeseburger (add cheese) or bistroburger (add bacon + cheese) or a chicken sandwich. All are really good and well done. Also they have McSorleys on tap, so it's a winner either way given the price vs quality. Would highly recommend, even though Regis doesn't (HIMYM).
