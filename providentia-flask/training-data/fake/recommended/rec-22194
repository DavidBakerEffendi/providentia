I had a GREAT glass of wine here - a Xarel-lo on the menu, served icy cold...I've been on a quest to find a bottle ever since! Food was great, we did tapas family-style with 5 people and shared everything. The most outstanding thing we had were the crispy hen-of-the-woods mushrooms. They literally melt in your mouth. Also worthy of mention was the chorizio & figs dish, and the hangar steak was ridiculously good too. Fun atmosphere, young crowd, informative waiter. They had 2 waiters working our table, one to refill drinks - he forgot to get my dad his beer and we ended up getting it for free, which was a nice touch. Will definitely be returning!
