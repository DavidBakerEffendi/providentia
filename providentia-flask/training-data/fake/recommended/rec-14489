Cute place, nice decor and pretty clean and fresh, with several interesting atmospheric touches. Attentive service, although the food took a little while to come out. I appreciated the chilled tap water in lovely thin glasses (sounds particular, but if you go I think you'll see what I mean!). The food was fantastic; I got the bibimbap, which was delicious and well made with good quality ingredients. The tacos, that my friend ordered, also looked wonderful. It's a two-$ place, but reasonable price for the quality and the atmosphere. Misses out on the fifth star because I'd have liked slightly larger portions. I'll be going back!
