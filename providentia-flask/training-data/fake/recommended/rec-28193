Preface : 1) I was SO excited about this place. 2) I didn't have a reservation and came in around 9:30pm on a Wednesday night in the dead of January. The Good : The hot pot was really scrumptious.  YUM. The Bad : It was really an awkward experience.  What was advertised as a "10 minute" wait turned into "45 minute" shuffle around the tiny restaurant in our big winter coats.  The waitstaff moved us to a different table 2 times.  Eventually we wound up right next the window and had to make a coat fortress to block the frigid air from coming in.   We were in the restaurant for close to an hour before they took our drink order.    What's a girl got to do to get a Sapporo?! The Ugly : The expense and weird experience left a bad taste in my mouth.  BUMMER.
