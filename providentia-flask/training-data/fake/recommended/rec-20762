The bottom line: trendy joint, good food, multiple vegetarian options, but pricey. The pros: multiple options for people who don't want to eat meat. We had a whitefish bagel, a smoked fish plate, excellent toast, and French toast. All were quite good. The cons: the place is a bit pricey. It is also bit small, making seating at popular hours a potential problem.
