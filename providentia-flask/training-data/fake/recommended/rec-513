After asking a friend for some good brunch spots on the LES I finally decided to try Freemans Restaurant. It is a bit hidden as you have to walk through an alley but it makes it enticing and quaint, set back from the main street. The place has a really cool ambience even when I was there for brunch...it feels like you're in the countryside but still hip and urban..if that makes any sense? The food was great, really fresh...can't wait to go back for dinner. Â Oh, and lastly the staff was all very nice and attentive :)
