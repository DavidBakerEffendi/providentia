My favorite Thai place in NYC. Pokpok used to be packed and it is still is, but it's not a two hour wait like it used to be. I come on weekdays and I wait for 10 min max. I kind of like the old space better but the food is as consistent. Spicy wings a must!!! Also the sticky rice, Minced duck spicy but so good, the pork neck has been change to wild boar and it's the same preparation and even better. The eggplant dish is Devine. For dessert if your mouth is burned and need a little cooling take the affogato. Will always go back there sometimes I just crave some pokpok
