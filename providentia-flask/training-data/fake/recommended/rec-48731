The wait was and hour and 20 min, which i have no problem with as I just wandered union square in the meantime. After being seated and ordering, it took them over half an hour to get our appetizer on the table. They served many people who came after us. Regardless, the yellowtail was the highlight of our meal, it wasn't completely raw, it wasn't cooked, it was delicious with a drizzle of lemon and wasabi. Then came the ramen, I got the karaka miso which came with grated ginger on top (i think, the spicy one) and my friend got the special with a black pepper base or something. I tried a bit of both, both had good but not spectacular broths. The noodles were good, the toppings were sparse but good. Overall worth the experience, I suppose, but felt pretty underwhelmed, I mean they seated us in communal seating so I couldn't even face my dining partner in conversation!
