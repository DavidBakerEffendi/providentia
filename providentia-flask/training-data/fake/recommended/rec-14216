So, I finally had a chance to go here.  The system of ordering is all out of wack.  Either that or customers don't know how to form a line and then move to the side. The head dude was really mean to the cashier (whoa buddy), so be prepared to speak up, get up in their face and tell them what you want. Oh, you want to know how the pizza is?  Pretty good.  I enjoyed it.  And a good price.
