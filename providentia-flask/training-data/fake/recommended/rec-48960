I came here for my first burger ever and got the avocado club (avocado, applewood smoked bacon, ranch, lettuce, tomato) & smash fries. It was all so delicious and a great choice! Everything was fresh and rich in flavor and I'm salivating just thinking about it. Can't wait till it opens in Menlo mall!
