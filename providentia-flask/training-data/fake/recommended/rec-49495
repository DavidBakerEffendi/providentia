Came here with a group of 5 and although it was a little confusing at first (order in the line and then find a seat) it was actually pretty efficient.  Not a long wait on Saturday at 12:30.  The menu is pretty extensive so you can take a few minutes to look it over while you are in line but then you need to be ready with a decision as soon as you hit the front. The sandwiches are pretty good, different types of bread and combinations for everyone, including vegetarians.  Some of the dishes were hit or miss, but on the whole very good.
