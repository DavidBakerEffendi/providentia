This place embodies my favorite things about Philadelphia dining. A home-y ambiance, BYOB, delicious and creative dishes: these are the reasons Philly stands apart from other foodie cities.   After spending a Saturday hanging in NoLibs, it was such a treat to end at the Pickled Heron. We split a simple salad, which the waiter brought out on two plates for us. I got the crispy duck with spaeztle, and my date got the steak with an apple fritter and celery root purée. I like to be impressed when I eat out by creative dishes and this did exactly that. The spaetzle had grainy mustard and was a great match to the perfectly cooked duck. The apple fritter was light and unlike anything I had ever tried. The best was the apple tart with almond mousse - the best French dessert I've had outside of France. Highly recommend!
