I did not have high expectations but the shrimp avocado crepe surprised me! Batter - light, fluffy and was able to hold the savory Â  toppings very well. Filling - very fresh! From the shrimp to the sauce. Small detail - the to go bag. The crepe perfectly fit in the bag and was able to hold the crepe in place until I got to my destination. Overall, good place!
