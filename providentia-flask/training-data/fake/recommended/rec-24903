I can't wait to have a real Lunch here. I stopped in yesterday after shopping at Termini's across the street. Did not have lunch yet, but just wanted a little something. Last time I was here, It was just a little cafe, small bites. The place was packed. Everyone had Â gorgeous plates of Italian Food, wine glasses in hand. I said I was one, the owner took me to the counter. I told him I just wanted a little something, did not know it grew into a full fledged restaurant. He told me to sit down, take my coat off and have a bowl of soup. So sweet! A treasure. Only in S Philly!
