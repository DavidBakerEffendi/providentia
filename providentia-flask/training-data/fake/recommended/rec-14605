So I never heard of this before, but my friend I was with told me I was lucky to see him on the weekend working right outside of the park.   His food cart/stand is right outside one of the entrances to the park and he's such a cheery happy man!  The cart was covered with new paper articles in English, Japanese, Chinese, etc, and they were all raving about the food.  It's one thing if a single article wrote about him, but there were several in different languages.  That alone has to say something!!! We spilt the Pondicherry Special, and oh man, it was amazing.  It was a crepe with potatos, spices, and veggies.  The sauce that came with it was a coconut based sauce (I think!).  I usually hate coconut when it's served, beside in its milk form, but it was so good!  He even gave us two soups that my friend and I splited.   The prices are very affordable and the portions are very large!   He is sooooo nice and sweet.  Next time I'm in NYC, I hope I can catch him again!
