For the times I have been here, the food has been consistently good. The servers are attentive and they have a tablet for their menu! Â There is an express lunch special that is reasonably priced. Today was my birthday and the server brought me chocolate and poured liquid nitrogen into a bowl for some cool effect. It was nice they would do this for someone's special day!
