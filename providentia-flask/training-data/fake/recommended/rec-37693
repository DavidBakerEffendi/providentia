We were walk-ins at Zizi Limona because the wait at another nearby restaurant was outrageous. ZIzi Limona was crowded. Upon walking in, I saw that people were staying long past their meal to enjoy wine, their company, and the ambience. The nice hostess quoted us a 30-45 minute wait, and wait we did--for an hour. But we eventually got a good table and ordered the house red (bleh) and a few appetizers. For entrees, we ordered the Middle Eastern Chick and the Cowshuka. The pita was the best part of the meal (it was actually really quite good). After the meal, we both decided that the meal and experience were ok, but not worth the wait.
