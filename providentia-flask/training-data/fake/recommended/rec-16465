Stumbled on Kobeyake last night and was really blown away. Had the Udon soup and the spicy tuna role along with a cold beer. I got to talking to the manager to see if there were any other locations and was surprised to discover that this was the first! This place was like a Shake Shack for Asian food. Everything was slick, yummy and friendly. Â I love it. Just wish there were more of them!
