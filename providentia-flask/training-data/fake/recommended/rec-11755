We went for brunch this morning and were very happy that we picked Northern Spy Co! There was no wait for a party of two when we showed up at eleven, though the place was bustling. We decided to split their Chicken & Egg Sandwich, a mixed green salad and the special donut of the day, which was fresh strawberry jam filled. Everything was awesome, the coffee was pretty good and the service was very friendly and attentive. The Chicken and Egg Sandwich was really great- crispy, not greasy, perfectly poached egg, just delicious. I generally hate jelly-filled donuts but this one was absolutely perfect!
