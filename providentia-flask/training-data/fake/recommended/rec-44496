I'll make this short.  I guess you have to rate this on to levels 1. price 2.taste 1.  Ok it is a little expensive, but your getting a hand tossed pie with the best of everything on it.  Ohh and watching the old man puts a smile on my face 2. This is one of the best pizzas in NYC period.  When you come here you shouldn't get a slice order your own pie just the way you like it, and if you don't care about taste goto pizza hut you can get a large for $10. when you get be ready for a long wait, and don't bother calling head.  that's why i knocked of one star
