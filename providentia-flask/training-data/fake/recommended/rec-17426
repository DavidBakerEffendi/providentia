You have to try the garlic shrimp!!!! :D Now with that said.. Â This is a cute place to dine in, I must admit, I was a little uncomfortable eating there. Im not sure if it was the way the tables were arranged or the decor but i felt uneasy. The food was great!!! My bf and I get take out from here quite often. This is the best Portuguese food in Elizabeth BY FAR!!!! Dont forget the garlic shrimp!! :D
