Seriously disappointed with this place. Although this place is awesome for having such late happy hours, the food was not that great, at least for someone with food allergies. The waitress would walk away from us while we were talking to her, she then would just put a plate of food down and walk away. We waited to ask her what it was. After 10 minutes of waiting, we find out that i would've needed my epipen for the night if i ate my fiance's dish. THEN, when the waitress did bring out my food, she said there was a mix up in the kitchen and brought something else out. I told her i would wait for my order, 15 seconds later (LITERALLY 15 seconds) she came out with my food and it looked like they just took the Soy from the plate she originally brought out and threw it over rice because it had the same hot sauce and Mayonnaise, and what i ordered was supposed to be sesame seeds and vegetarian seasoning. Because she was such a horrible waitress we didn't give that great of a tip, and she counted the money right in front of us several times, bill by bill and asked with an attitude "any change with this?!" So sorry, I'm an awesome tipper, but when its crap service you get what you give.
