I've been here probably four times since the place opened, wow that was almost a decade ago... I'm glad to know that Barbuto has stood the test of time.   Most recently we shared a rather large dinner of 14 at the chef's table, we took the 9pm reservation although we were able to sit earlier around 8:15.  This is the second time we've done the chef's table and it's an awesome experience, just be aware that the heat from the kitchen can be pretty intense and I wouldn't exactly call it a private room, just a separate space.  Regardless, we shut the place down at 12:30am when the staff subtly switched on the house lights. The food is northern Italian, hearty and soulful.  I'd skip lunch and leave room for this dinner because you don't want to find yourself full when they finally serve the steak.  I enjoyed the pasta the most but nothing missed the mark.  Paired with a bold Italian red, I'd call the whole evening an indulgent affair.   My only slight issue with the restaurant itself is that, at the risk of sounding like my grandmother, it's seriously really loud.  Not sure what they can do here, maybe it goes with the Italian theme.   The real reason for 4 stars instead of 5, though, is that for some reason everyone here was quite old.  I've been living outside New York for four years now and I heard that everyone under 35 is now in Brooklyn, so I guess it's a sign of the times. This is an old favorite that I hope sticks around for years to come.
