Food: OUTTA THIS HEART ATTACK, ARTERY CLOGGING WORLD! **recommend Sanchez, Phat Lady, and Heart Attack--got some mozzarella sticks, got some meat, got some cheese, got some french fries...all sorts of goodness. And Don't forget to try their tangy spicy sauce, goes awesome on almost everything! First off, I hail from out of state and have eaten a few sandwiches in my life time, and this one is pretty up there on my fatty-delicious list. I try to convince my friend to drive me there every time I visit Jersey. Second, best tip I got for the folks that are looking to score grub--come at odd hours! There's a line during all major eating times and since the place is so small, it becomes an awkward snaking maneuver game with other hungry, sweaty beasts--better not tempt them. Where Hoagie Haven loses points is in the small cramped space that offers no friendly place to sit and enjoy the goods. There's NO seating at all except for a bench outside (which is nice for people watching), but there's only a tiny bar table with no chairs so you must stand to eat. If you're coming from afar, most of their signature hoagies run $5 for half and $10ish for the full thing. You can get it cut in quarters to share or just down the whole thing yourself. If you live near Princeton, it's a short stroll through to the place so I'd definitely take it home to enjoy with a beer and something on TV.
