This cart is the best in the city because they give you more for the money, and it's fresh... very fresh.  All the people standing in line can't be wrong. There's no point in writing a descriptive review because it's all been said already. When I go here I buy 2 lamb over rices... one for myself, and one for myself.  I may not eat both then and there, but I get more of my time and moneys worth!  It's soooooooo goooooood... This is the best in NYC, (and yes, there are a lot of halal carts), and therefore deserves a coveted 5 star rating. P.S.  The cart on the east side of 6th is the same as the west, and it usually has a shorter line.  Go there instead!
