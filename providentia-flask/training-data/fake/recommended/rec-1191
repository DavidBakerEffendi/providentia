Had a cheesesteak and a chicken cheesesteak split them with my friend. Both were really good. Â The grill guy was so friendly. I didn't think I would eat all of my food and i did. It's connected to a bar. Mad that we went early and i didn't want to drink yet. Would i go back hell yeah. Do i love it more than ishkabibbles? No but it was good.
