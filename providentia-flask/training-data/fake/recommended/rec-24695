I often come here late at night from partying and often ask myself why did I have to spend $$$$ for dinner a few hours earlier when this is $ and yummier. Okay, maybe this deli is just perfect for that kind of situation. I couldn't care less and am not the right purist to judge the authenticity of Punjabi food. I just love it.
