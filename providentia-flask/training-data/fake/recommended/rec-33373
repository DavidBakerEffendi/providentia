Stumbled upon this place by accident going to the Forte Green Flea market on Saturday.  I can't tell you how much I enjoyed thier brunch.  My bloody mary was perfect (filled with spices and seasoning but not over-powering spicy).  My salmon plate was the best I've ever had in my life.  The greens were fesh and crisp, the goat cheese was soft and pletiful and they didn't scrimp on the fish or capers.  The salmon itself was melt in you mouth fresh.   My wife got the Turkish breakfast.  She's usualy not a fan of eggplant if its not fried but even she thought it was to die for.  The herbed yogurt was thick and creamy and I wish I could have taken a bucket of it home with me. The plate also comes with eggs and Fattoush.  Mind you, I don't think either of us have ever had Fattoush before but we both thought it was delish. Oh and her Harvey Wallbanger was brilliant not to mention, both of our drinks were strong.
