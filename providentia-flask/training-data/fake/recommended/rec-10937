Unlike most of the other reviewers, had I read the previous reviews, I STILL WOULD HAVE GONE! Christ people. Resturants are not perfect day one. From what I understand, Brooklyn Crab was not perfect on their first week. This is normal. Their only real crime is not ironing out all the bugs, for what would be a HUGE opening no matter who opened in that spot, doubly so for a Crab Shack. I am sure those first two weeks was madness. New staff, new place, getting the methods and services worked out, etc..etc..etc.. I charge all of you who lambasted them on Yelp, go back now. Go with an empty mind, and no pre-conceptions, and try them again. You'll find a totally different place. So, for my review, I present crayons. No, just kidding, no crayons...GIMME THOSE BACK! Anyhow, we went on a Friday afternoon, July 6, and the management obviously took to heart the staffing issues. Service was amazingly fast, brisk, polite and down right friendly. The food was what it should have been from a Crab Shack. The raw clams were tasty and salty and just how they should be, although I'm a snob and missed not having horseradish with them. The shrimp cocktail was mad yummy, with giant shrimp in a cute little paint can, and just perfect, and the crab legs were amazingly tasty, didn't even need butter, they were cooked perfectly. We went and sat there for 4 hours, drinking and eating, and every time we ordered food, it came incredibly quick, and our drinks were never empty. I have to parrot, GET THE PINA COLADA!! Oh my god...soooo good. Anyhow, if you haven't been here, go! Give it a try, just go early, it gets very busy and you will have to wait if you're there during prime time dinner hours. Great place!
