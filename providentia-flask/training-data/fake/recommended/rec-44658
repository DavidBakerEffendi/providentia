Note: this review is only based on drinking here. Stopped here for a drink on an early Sunday afternoon, before heading to the airport. They have great brunch drink specials, including mimosas and salty dogs. I got a salty dog with Hendricks gin, and I wasn't charged an up charge for not getting the house gin. The drink was great and the bartender was so nice. The bar was beautiful and they have a super cool old register. I snuck a quick peek in the dining room and it was so gorgeous! I'm really glad we stopped here and I'll definitely go for actual brunch yet next time I'm in the city.
