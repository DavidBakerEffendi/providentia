Good things really can come in small packages. I first came across this cute little bistro looking place a couple of months back.  As a long time Windsor Terrace resident, I'm always excited to try the cool new restaurants and shops that have been sprouting up in our neighborhood over the past couple of years. It was late on a Sunday evening, and I was walking towards Prospect Park West trying to decide what to eat, when I first saw Brooklyn Proper open.  With a couple of tables already full, I took a seat at the bar and inquired as to whether dinner was still being served.  Luckily for me, it was, and a little tasting menu to boot.  I don't recall everything I ate that night, but I do remember the main dish had a side of corn that was smoked and salted, giving it almost a bacon flavor -- outstanding, I still think about that corn. That corn alone was enough to bring me back to try more new dishes several time over the past few months.  However, a tart little wine based cocktail called the Proper Sour, has also definitely contributed to bringing me back to the bar.   During the week I'm usually working late in the city or traveling for work, and even when at home, frankly I can't really cook worth a damn, so constantly eating restaurant food.  Walking up the street for a well prepared meal, chock full of fresh vegetables and proteins, full of innovative flavors and served with a friendly smile comes pretty close to home cooking for me. Consistently playing good tunes definitely helps too..
