Decent pizza at a good price. Overall I liked the pizza but it didn't have much sauce. I ordered a pie with pepperoni, mushrooms and onions and was disappointed that the mushrooms were of the canned variety. The crust, cheese, pepperoni and onions were all great. The pizza was delivered in a reasonable amount of time. A little more sauce and better mushrooms would bring this to 4 or 5 stars.
