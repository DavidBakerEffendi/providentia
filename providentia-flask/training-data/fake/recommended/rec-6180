Just had dinner there tonight for my first time with my 13 yr old daughter. We were promtly greated at the door and seated at the communal table in the rear of the restaurant, ( actually the best seat for the experience ). To me it was fantastic, from decor, food and service. I work at a pretty exclusive place in midtown...but this place...has it going on! I will be back! Thank you !
