I'm just passing through here with a quick review, mainly because the other reviews have really covered it well. Basically: I can't remember the name, but the portabella & eggplant pannini is phenomenal. I had it on multigrain toast, and it made my day. Ate it out on their beautiful patio, which has plenty of shade for my ginger ass. The next day I went with my bf, and he loved his chicken salad (he's also very picky about a good chicken salad). I had a slice of their homemade almond pound cake, which was perfectly moist, buttery, sweet, and with a nice hint of almond flavor that is making me crave a slice right now. Basically, the food is high quality, including Le Bus breads, the price isn't too steep, and the outdoor seating make for a great lunch place that Fairmount has needed for awhile.
