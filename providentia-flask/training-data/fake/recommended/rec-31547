The best Italian food in New Jersey. the stuffed artichoke is to die for.  The calamari was so good  Love that it is a byob. My fish was grilled to perfection. My husband had osso bucco and it was outrageous delish. Top notch restaurant . Been going for years. Food is always fantastic. Service is superb.
