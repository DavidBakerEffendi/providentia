I .... I Â just don't get the allure of this place. The price is good (a buck a slice), but the sauce is salty, the crust is lacking in the flavor department and it's just too thin for the amount of sauce and cheese they put on top. Don't get me wrong: I love thin crust and I love a cheesy pizza, but there's a point where the bulk atop the pizza overwhelms the crust.
