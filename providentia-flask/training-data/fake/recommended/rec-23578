Oh lord, the attitude and the hipsters, it's exhausting! Please, free me from the tyranny of The Farmhouse! Mediocre food at best; bored, too cool for me servers. Not good, don't waste your time. Go to Bluebird just around the corner for great service, awesome food and no hipster bullcrap from your servers!
