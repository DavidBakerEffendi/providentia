Ummmmm...WOW. Strawberry bruschetta that melted in my mouth. Fried chicken with mashed potatoes, white gravy, and collard greens which made the beau say, "...I think this is some of the best fried chicken I've EVER had." Apple crisp with caramel rum sauce and cinnamon ice cream. The Deep South, rich with rooibos-infused vodka with a tea flavor that really shone through. "Dr. Strangelove" playing silently on a wall above the bar. That dark, sexy ambiance I crave, complete with exposed brick walls and textile-upholstered table tops. A sweet waitress who just made all of the right suggestions. I want to say more, but...my words are failing me. I have so much I want to say, but I can't quite get it from my brain to my keyboard via my fingers. So, I feel this is sufficient enough: GO HERE. This establishment made for a memorable birthday meal, and I'd definitely go back on a future trip to Philly. SO pleased!
