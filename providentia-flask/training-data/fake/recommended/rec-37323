The truffle burger wasn't that insanely good as people made it out to be but the burgers here are definitely better than most places. sweet potatoe fries were good. felt a little pricey as I didn't get full from the meal and I don't normally eat big meals. Did not have to wait as I came in between meal times but heard the wait could become 30 minutes plus. Not worth it if that becomes the case.
