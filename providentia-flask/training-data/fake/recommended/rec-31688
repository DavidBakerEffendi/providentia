One of the best expressos I've had in a while! Excellent service... Can't wait to sample the food!! My boyfriend and I went back for brunch one day, must try the red velvel pancakes... they were drizzled with chocolate sauce, were incredibly fluffy... heave on a plate! Do not get fooled if your significant other says "let's share" trust me, one mouthful of these and you'll need your own order!
