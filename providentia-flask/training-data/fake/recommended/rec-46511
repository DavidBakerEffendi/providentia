Visited for the first time this sunday . We were sat at a table in an area of the restaurant that was freezing next to the salumi slicer and had to move. Braised beef ravioli, very good. Tagliatelle with ragu antica, again, delicious. Not much meat but what was there was very flavorful. Decent portion. Petrioniana - Crispy Veal cutlet entree was a great dish. The tragic flaw came with the dessert. Decided to split the Torta -- a chocolate peanut butter dish with a scoop of gelato. For $12, we were expecting enough for two people, but what we got was an insult. It was the size of a finger. It was barely three spoonfuls. Overall, the food was good but not great or memorable. And that dessert was enough to make me never go back. Too many better places in NY.
