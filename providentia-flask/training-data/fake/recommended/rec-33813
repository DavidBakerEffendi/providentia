This place is over priced, and the wait for food can be a bit long. But, I love their sweet potato fries and fresh OJ. Those are the reasons I keep coming back. One time when the fresh OJ was a little bitter, they even remade another OJ for us. What nice service. Everything else is fine but nothing special.
