6th in our PIZZA SEARCH I get it people, I get it. Anorexic pizza clearly is in for some of the previous yelpers.  Good for them. BUT my premium crackers are bigger.   Do we really have to be seated to get a pizza?  Oh I guess so...ok sit, wait, given some water and cutlery (for pizza???) We ordered the personal pan plain, which constituted 6 micro slices.  Don't get me wrong, it was tasty.  DID YOU READ THAT??? IT WAS TASTY.   But the total was $7.62 with tax, then add tip...seriously $10???? For a personal pan that was a filing as one regular slice?
