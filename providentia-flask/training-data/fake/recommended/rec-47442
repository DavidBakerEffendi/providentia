I would give this place 5 stars just for the pure comical effect of their wait staff uniform.  With a cliche name like Wonton Garden, and a hole in the wall kind of setting, all their waitors (they're all Cantonese men, btw) wear *drum roll please* Hawaiian shirts all year round!!  I'm curious what would happen, if someone starts spinning reggae inside, lol. The food is super cheap, and tasty.  $5.70 (including tax) will get you a bowl of beef stew noodles with large chunks of beef.  Or if you go with their delux options with wonton toppings, expect to see a large bowl filled with noodles, meat toppings of your choice, and wontons with plenty of shrimps & veggies.  What you get for the price you pay, is simply unbeatable.
