I've been here two times with a friend, who paid for snacks and drinks for me, it's very nice here! The atmosphere is New York like, artsy, dim, cool and trendy. The drink menu is nicely put together and the staff is somewhat friendly & welcoming; as well as seemingly interesting to look at (I.e hipstery, pink hair, tattoos, body piercings, lumber jack shirts, bed hair, etc.). They put "edible" flowers in some of the drinks, which looks pretty, but I don't typically eat flowers lol. Nor do I know if these were sprayed with pesticides or if bugs crawled on them, or how if properly washed before being put in my drink. When asked them these questions, I didn't get a clear answer, just that they're edible. I happened to also previously work in a flower shop so it was a bit unsettling. I don't believe that the menu suggests flowers being put in drink, I could be wrong. They also didn't tell me either, but if that's their signature drink theme, then I shouldn't assume they would or should and should've done some research beforehand. We also had oysters and French fries, which was pretty good. Then I went a third time by myself, and paid for myself, which came out to 25$ for just two classic margaritas bc I didn't want anything from the menu, plus tip, so $28. I told bartender how it felt, he suggested happy hour. So maybe next time I'll go during those times if my schedule can allow. I usually go at 9-10ish. Def great for a date or for someone with a lot of $, but not really for a recent college grad who has lots of bills and responsibilities. I'm more into 4-8$ drinks and maybe they won't be as well shaken and made as at 116, but it'll still serve it's purpose to get me "spirited" lol.
