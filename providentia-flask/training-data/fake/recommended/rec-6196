I would give this place 3 1/2 if I could but there're no options for it. Beware- we came in on a Saturday late afternoon- staff was eating- bartender was eating on side bar and servers we eating near the open kitchen. Lost a point. Lost another point because it's a Cash Only establishment. Server was nice Pad thai with shrimp was good- a bit oily but good and steamed veggie dumplings were good. Spicy noodles were kind of bland. But- Generous portions at inexpensive prices.
