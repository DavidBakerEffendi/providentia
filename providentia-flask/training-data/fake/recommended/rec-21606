One of the best drunken bargains in NYC, but be ready to stand on a half block line in the cold for 30 mins. 6 bucks gets you a huge platter of food and they have smaller options for 5 and 4 bucks. I think these guys need to six sigma their process or something because there is no reason it should take that long to slap meat into an aluminum pan. Add your white sauce and BBQ and taste a little piece of 3am heaven. WARNING: GO EASY ON THE HOT SAUCE. Also, don't trust the labels because there is no way to distinguish hot sauce from BBQ and that's a bad thing. Hot sauce is straight FIYAH, no joke, jet fuel.
