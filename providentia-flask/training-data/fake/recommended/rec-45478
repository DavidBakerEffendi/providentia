What a magnificent dinner experience!  My co-worker and I were in town for one night, and found this gem on Yelp.  As soon as we saw bread pudding and creme brûlée on the menu, we were in... And so glad we went!  Our server, Michael, was a veritable encyclopedia of wine and food, and offered us some of the most attentive and conscientious service we have ever received.  The  decor was modern and warm, and the food was spectacular.  Each dish, from the escargot app to the duck confit entree to the bread pudding dessert was a blend of imaginative reconsideration and dedication to the core value of the familiar dish.  We will be back not just next time, but if it is always this good, we will be back every time we are in Princeton and surrounding.
