Trios is good. Their aesthetic is strangely contradictory, but charming nonetheless. For one, their pizza is delicious. You can tell that a lot of love goes into it. I could stare at their myriad of piping hot Rusticas near the cash register for hours. As goodness is far from under-appreciated in this town, the prices reflect said pizzal (sic) artisanship, and that's fine. But if you pull your greasy nose back from the pane of glass separating the dining area from the kitchen, you'll notice that the place is essentially a re-appropriated fast food restaurant; for all of its culinary artistry, don't expect a lick of  ambiance if you choose to eat in-house! For god's sake, they don't even have a soda fountain! If I'm going to spend $15 on a calzone, I'd prefer to eat it as a "sit-down" meal--no worries if that'd mean dropping a tip at the end. Maybe it's just  me, but choosing a bottled Coca Cola product from a fridge and eating on a bunch of paper plates kind of numbs the beauty of the product that I'm supposed to be enjoying. Beyond these qualms, the food is good and the feel isn't *too* strange. In fact, they actually have some super quirky paintings on the windows that really enhance interior environment. It just seems a little caddywhompus at times. Oh, and the register guy gave us free sausage in our vegetarian calzone, which was super sweet of him. Kindness like that shouldn't be overlooked.
