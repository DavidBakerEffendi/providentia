BK Proper is awesome. Small but airy, what struck me the most was the phenomenal food. It is outstanding. I have been twice since it opened just a week or 2 ago and I look forward to going back again and again. Do yourself a favor and get the carpaccio- it's phenomenal. Normally a threatening dish, the chef (somehow) marrys a minimal braise with fennel, potatoes, and a seasoned dressing that is light and simply delicious. I was very very impressed. The gems salad was really really good. Also, the duck was incredible and the house made pâté accoutrement was the perfect unexpected compliment.  What a great addition to Windsor Terrace! Oh and the cocktails are amazing and professionally concocted by a talented mixologist that obviously knows what she's doing.  On top of that as I write this Im reminiscing on the prices - incredibly good value and dare I say underpriced even? Brooklynites rejoice, finally a new spot without the wanna be Manhattany pretentiousness. Great Job.
