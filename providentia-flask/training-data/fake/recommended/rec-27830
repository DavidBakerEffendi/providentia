Very good restaurant, nice ambiance, customer service is great. Awesome Gem in Manhattan which contains a  sea of the same standard cuisine of restaurants, I'm not hating just saying, this is NY, we need variety.  I had the Dibi lamb, with sauteed onion, salad , plantains and the truffle mac and cheese.  Wow. I was satisfied portion and taste wise after a long day and trek back from BK.  i plan to be back to try the Yassa fish, sorrel and hopefully desert.
