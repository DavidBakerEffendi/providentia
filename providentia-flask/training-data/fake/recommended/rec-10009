Awesomely great for brunch. Went here with some friends and ended up ogling each others meals. Poached eggs on veggie hash, flaky fish sandwiches, bacon frittata and a french toast for a table share. The french toast... My taste buds still have dreams about it. Thick yet moist with a sweet creamy sauce poured over. Warm and filling. Also a full line of draft beers to quench your thirst. Hurrahs all around.
