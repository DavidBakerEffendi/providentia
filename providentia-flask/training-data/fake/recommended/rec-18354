ventured way out of my normal eateries in center city to this little gem on frankford avenue with a couple of friends on a sunday evening. unfortunately, they only had one foie gras left and one other of something else, so we couldnt order as much foie gras as we would have ordinarily, considering we are all closet foie gras gluttons, but the order that we managed to secure was very well executed (I wasn't so much a fan of the dry-ish weird textured biscuit it was resting on). The salad had delicious fried beets and pickled carrots, the moules frites were great, very fresh, even while the aioli wasnt anything special. the house-made charcuterie was done very nicely as well, with duck liver pate and some other salami-ish looking stuff that was just a little gamey-as it should be. gamey is good. 2 people had the scallops, which I thought were way over-salted, I had the sea bream with a magnificent watermelon radish salad on the side, over lentils. the side salad was probably my favorite thing about the whole meal-clean, tart meyer lemon peel, cilantro, and thin, cool, and visually pleasing watermelon radish, which I've never even encountered before. someone else had the beouf bourguignon and he loved it, and he is a very picky eater. it was also nice to see interesting desserts on the menu since philly is generally a really boring dessert town, although the menu did have the stand-by creme brulee. At least this was a duck egg creme brulee, and it was very rich and tasty. Â and we also got the brandied cherry cake with pistachio ice cream, which was greedily consumed by everyone. great dessert. the service is very understated and casually polite. the kitchen is totally open and they are they quietest chefs ever. normal and fair prices.
