My boyfriend took me here to celebrate New Years and he knows I love trying something new. This place was really huge plus beautiful. The service for me was really fast so fast I was wondering how! The inside is something I've never seen before. I really liked our seats. The place is huge and it was crowded but the fact that's it's so big it doesn't feel crowded. That's what I liked. The food was a little over the average dollar. I think he paid about 90$ for entrees and appetizer & drinks. Make sure to get water cuz there food is spicy I like spicy but this type of spice was so hot I felt like I was dying lol . Which was the appetizer the pastels with chicken was good but it was too spicy. The plate I ordered was the Cuzco which is shrimp and rice and onions. I liked it and the food is served on playas that looks like eggs. I recommend this place for it's epic atmosphere and unique foods. I'll let the pictures do the talking as pictures speak for themselves :)
