Rock shrimp tacos ok. Peppers were blah but a veggie, and I was looking for one. French onion soup wontons Are very rich but the taste is good. Exactly what it sounds like: reduced French onion soup in a wonton wrapper. Tuna tartare with crackers was good, but that's hard to mess up. Nothing was wrong with anything, but it was overrated. Â The quinoa salad looked good and I wish we had room for it. Husband says meh overall to the whole place.
