I used to live in Connecticut and Mozzicato is one of the two favorite bakeries we like to go to.  I now live 2000 miles away and thought I would order some Christmas cookies from home.  In reviewing the Mozzicato FAQ page, it showed there were 20-25 cookies per pound.  I ordered 3 pounds of the assorted cookies.  Was I ever disapointed when I received the cookies at the size of the package.  Not only did they send me the cookie tray instead of the assorted mix, but there was clearly not 60-75 cookies in the tray.  There were only about 5 types of cookies and maybe 50 cookies.  BIG disapointment!  Not as big as the phone call to Mozzicato after the delivery.  Young girl answered and said no, there is only 15-20 cookies per pound.  I mentioned the website count and she was silent.  I played silent too for a minute waiting to see if she would add some customer service to our call but nothing from her.  Not a care.  I'm really disapointed in the delivery and the customer service.  I will try Modern Bakery next time.
