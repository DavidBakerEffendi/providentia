I have been here twice and both times were really good! My Bf and I got the chicken tacos and shrimp tacos as appetizers, I have never had anything that good. I had the cactus fries and they were just ok, I wouldn't order it again. The traditional Guac and chips are really good definitely worth it. I love mojitos and I had the best coconut mojito ever. The grilled skirt steak was delicious, I definitely recommend it. I didn't like one item on the plate, I really didn't like the cheese enchilada that came with it, The sauce just tasted terrible. I requested not to have it on the plate the second time I had it. Over all drinks and service was great and always treat us well when we go.
