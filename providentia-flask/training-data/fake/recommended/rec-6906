My overall experience at The Pines was wonderful. We arrived as walk ins while it was already quite busy. We grabbed drinks from the bar and headed out to the courtyard. While waiting we enjoyed sitting beside a campfire. The owner of the restaurant was outside and offered us S'mores. We passed on them, but enjoyed them after dinner. Our first course was the Testa, a dish that we had no idea what to expect. It was quite good. The mix of head cheese, huckleberries and celery was a great combination. Next we had the Jicama salad.The combination and textures of the jicama, coconut and sea urchin were unique and interesting. I was not crazy about the salad, but I did find it to be very fun and inventive compared to my average salad. Next came the Bone Marrow. Having never had marrow before I was nervous and excited at what the experience would be like. I must say I loved it. The presentation was excellent. A large, natural dish with heaping portions of bread beside it. Next arrived the Monk Fish. I enjoyed this plate very much, especially the broth it came in.. Our final dish was what knocked my socks off. The Ox Tail Cappelacci with shaved black truffle on top. These flavorful little envelopes possessed the stinky truffle aroma; and a flavor that was incredible. I think I could eat these every day. The environment was very warm, conversations sparked with tables beside us about the food and wine. It was very fun to interact with the other diners, which I find doesnt happen all that frequently. The service was great. My glass was always full with the cucumber infused water, and my wine was always filled without me even noticing. The servers were also knowledgable about the food and the wine offerings. After the meal we returned outside and enjoyed the fire and friendly conversations with patrons and staff members. An excellent evening!
