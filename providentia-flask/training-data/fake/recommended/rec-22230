We were in the neighborhood and decided to try it since we had been here years before when it was Rocco's . The room is warm and inviting. The roast chicken was wonderful and my husband ordered the lamb short rib but unfortunate steely, it had fennel and it wasn't noted on the menu so they kindly whisked it away and got him another dinner quickly. Why is it fennel is used so much? I don't know about you but I don't like my food tasting of licorice. Dessert was nice too..the blueberry tart and what Â wow chocolate ice cream. Really a little gem of a find.
