Morning Glory is worth the wait...oh, and you will wait. Regardless of the weather, there is always a line for breakfast/brunch. I like to sit at the counter, even when I go with a few people, because the cooks are entertaining to watch and always friendly. The food is fantastic, although, NO substitutions to the menu on the weekends. I had the best tuna melt of my life there last spring (a special) and the frittatas will blow your mind. Leave room for a biscuit, even if it doesn't come with your meal, you won't regret it.
