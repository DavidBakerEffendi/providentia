As The Smith and Jane are sister restaurants and I love Jane, I was confident in my choice to go to The Smith... and they did not disappoint. I would love to go back for more! Sunday Brunch was busy (make a reservation!) and loud- but a very vibrant environment. I like any brunch place that I can wear Chucks and a flannel and feel ok and that I don't need to. I had a yummy dish with corn tortillas, eggs, avocado and a spicy salsa. De-lisssh! You get one free beverage with your brunch.
