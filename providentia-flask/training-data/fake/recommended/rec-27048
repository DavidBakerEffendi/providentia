We went on Wednesday, July 27, 2011 at 6:00 P.M. The waiter was very pleasant and provided us with clear descriptions and answered all of our questions. We never waited for anything. Nor did we feel rushed. We shared the zucchini flowers appetizer, which was AMAZING! They were light-almost melting in my mouth. Definitely not greasy-at all. My sister had a fish special (I can't remember the name-corvina?) and she liked it very much. It was boneless and came with mustard greens and beans. I had the chicken arrabiata and it was very tasty. Now, we don't usually get dessert but the waiter's descriptions were so enticing and the rest of the meal had been so outstanding, that we went for it. We had the Italian sundae and the apple almond torte. OH MY GOODNESS! The Italian sundae was hazelnut gelato with chocolate-infused whipped cream and topped with crushed chocolate chip bisciotti. The apple almond torte came warm from the oven, nestled on caramel sauce and with vanilla gelato. The torte was so light it almost had the texture of an angel food cake. Â  This was our first visit to this restaurant. We had heard all good reviews of the food. Many people commented on the noise level. I didn't find at this time of the evening that it was noisy. By the time we were leaving (7:30 P.M.-8:00 P.M.) it was getting a little louder but it was not intrusive. Overall I would rate this restaurant as an A+!
