Well in Seattle we have a Pike Place Public Market - which is comparable in size and scope.  However we have hippies selling tyedye clothes and really crappy"hipster" art.  OMG, not another Beaded POS. Reading TM, has Pennsylvania Dutch (PD) who seem polite, and while plain, they seem to have a knack for good food to eat.  I haven't tried the Scapple though.  This sounds gross yet so tempting!   I know that i kept slamming Philly for not having a good coffee - but honestly, i go to starbucks in seattle more than anything, so what should i expect??  I should have just gone to starbucks in philly too.  Old Town coffee, nothing special. Anyways, go to Reading TM, it's nice, there's places to sit and eat your "whatever"  Not horribly crowded.
