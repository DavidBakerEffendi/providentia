I'm excited this place delivers. Regardless, I've eaten in countless times. You must try the lobster bucatini, four cheese flat bread, chicken entree and kale/apple salad. A little on the pricey side but the food is consistently good. I might stay away from pork slides. I thought it was a bit tough to bite into.
