Well here we are in trendy Williamsburg. We had reservations, so we only had to wait while they prepared our table. The staff is super friendly and very patient. No hassles here. we opted for the chefs tasting menu. The menu was varied and delicious. Deserts were unique and scrumptious. Yummy! One quick note. The prices I quoted were for the chef's tasting. The regular items on the menu where priced from $10-$25. Very reasonable.
