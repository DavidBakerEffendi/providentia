I visited this place based on the yelp reviews, since it seems to be very difficult to find a good breakfast place near Hamilton.  I was afraid from the outside appearance that we had made a mistake and was going to be hung by my accompanying family members, since I was the one "savy" enough to pick the place.  Once inside my fears were appeased since it was very welcoming and the staff was very friendly.  We all had a variety of meals, from pumpkin pancakes, to tiramisu french toast, to a simple bacon and eggs.  Everyone enjoyed their meals,  which is always a hard thing to accomplish.  We will come back and explore the menu further and hope that this place can remain consistent.
