When I walked in to order take out tonight I was greeted by a very friendly man who i presume is the owner based on the conversation he was having with another customer. My dinner, a catfish po boy with sides of mac and cheese and greens, was ready fast, but not too fest, so i knew it was fresh. The catfish was flaky and hot and the breading was crispy. I think I would prefer a crunchier lettuce than the spring greens on the salad, or maybe a crunchier roll, but that's just my personal preference and certainly wouldn't stop me from coming back here again. What will keep me from coming back again was the weird, slightly sticky, sweetness that blanketed the otherwise decent sides. It's too bad, because Cast Iron Soul having an actual full service dining room provides something the rest of New Haven's soul food restaurants are sadly lacking. If you've got a sweet tooth, like the cooks here apparently do, I would recommend checking this place out. You'll get friendly service and food that's otherwise well prepared, but just a little too saccharine for my taste buds.
