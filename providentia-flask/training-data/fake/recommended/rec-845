Don't be misled - this place is not a diner. It is not a drive-in. It is not a dive. It is, however, one of the best restaurants in the city. All of you LaBan-iacs out there eating at $200 per-head restaurants are missing out. Go to Percy. Have a great time. Leave some money for your kids to inherit. Don't be selfish.
