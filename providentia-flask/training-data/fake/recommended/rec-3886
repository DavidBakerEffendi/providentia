after how many years, it's still as much fun as the first time i went. its definitely a lot more crowded and popular, so if you're going- be ready for a wait...for everything. to order food, to get food, to go into the bathroom, and to get a seat....and that last one may be a no go. thats neither here nor there, the place is great, the drinks are amazing (and i dont even drink!) and the people and crowd are friendly. fun times all around.
