The quality of food makes up for the lack of choices. The service was average, table layout decent we happened to get a good table but only after a 20 minute. It's obvious to me that they were a 3 star restaurant trying so desperately to be a 5, but I guess that Williamsburg for you. Oh, too many gays for me to rush back...
