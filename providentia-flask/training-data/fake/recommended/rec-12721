Best meatballs evaaarrr! Came here late night before heading back to our room. Sat at the bar just the two of us and we both ordered three sliders each mixed of the Classic, chicken, spicy, and special. So great that you are able to mix and match sauces. The pesto with chicken was my favorite :] We also ordered Togo which turned out confusing. Turned out they don't do the mini sliders as Togo so we changed that order to come with noodles instead. Got home and there were no meatballs :( Just the noodles! Do not worry I was gracious enough to share my pesto chicken meatballs with my bf and the world was at peace again.
