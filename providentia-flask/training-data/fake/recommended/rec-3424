How do I love thee? Let me count the ways....... I've been a steadfast chavela's disciple since their days on classon ave. Catch me during a busy work week and you'll also catch me getting take out every night. Nothing is bad. In fact, nothing is even just OK. It's always double yum, and fresh. Portions are big, prices are not. They say 30 minutes for delivery but it never takes even half that long, and eating in is a pleasure too. Great decor, very diverse and funky crowd, and friendly service runs like a well oiled machine. Two thumbs up and a high five to chavela's.
