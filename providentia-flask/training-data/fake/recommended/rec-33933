My husband and I just went there for our wedding anniversary.  We have been several times but it says a lot that we chose to go there for our anniversary.   The outside rustic and the inside is charming.  I usually hate restaurant musicians but I love the ones there.  The atmosphere and walking downstairs to the bathroom reminds me of Eastern Europe in a good way.   The food is delicious.  I recommend the artichoke and the chicken.  Last time I was there I had a salmon special that was a bit heavy on the butter but typically everything is wonderful.  I love their arugula salads. The staff are a bit self prioritized or possibly just pretentious.  That being said, I have had good service there before.  Also the limited seating is a bit of a challenge.  But the food is worth it..
