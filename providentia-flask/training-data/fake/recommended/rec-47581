Went here on the day after Christmas for a mid-afternoon snack. In terms of aesthetic this place is top notch...service is SERIOUSLY lacking though. We ordered 18 oysters since they have such a wide selection and there are taste profiles for each oyster on a card on the table. Excited to try a variety we told the waiter to make a selection for us. We also ordered cocktails and a pretzel. It took a bit to get drinks and a bit longer to get the oysters. Our waiter came back with a ticket listing the pairs of oysters we had on the platter and we dug in. Oysters were great, shucked perfectly with good sauces. Unfortunately, there were only 14 of them...we had ordered 18. We actually didn't notice until the bill came and a variety we hadn't had was listed and then we recounted the ticket that came with the platter and there were only 14 on that. So ordered 18, served 14 and charged for 16. It was tough to get a hold of our waiter so we flagged down a manager who pushed back on us that we had eaten 16 but eventually they took it off the bill. We also never received the pretzel that was ordered at the same time as the oysters. We asked about it after a half hour and was told it was coming but it never materialized after an hour so we cut our losses and had them cancel it. I'll give this place another go after they've been open a little longer but whatever system they use to fire orders is having a communication breakdown. One really important thing to note is that there are only 4 stalls in the ladies room. Even on a light afternoon there was a line, I fear what the line will be like if this place is ever at capacity.
