Seriously, how have I never reviewed Carmine's? I have been eating Family Style at Carmine's in Time Square for almost 20 years and I just can't get enough of that place. Don't think you can stroll by and just walk in - if you come at lunch time (before a Broadway show) or dinner time (before the evening show) don't think you're getting in. You absolutely need a reservation if you want to come here, we always made ours days in advance. Carmine's is great for two people but better for parties. Meals are served family style (menu's are hung on the wall around the restaraunt), huge portions! Think two pounds of pasta (at least) in a huge mound on a platter (my mouth is watering). We typically order the Rigatoni with Pomodoro - oh my word - big chunks of tomato, cloves of garlic...ahhh so tasty. With that, typically the Lemon Chicken and if we're feel like taking a walk on the wild side, Caesar Salad with Anchovies on the side. This is plenty of food for three and definitely good for 4-5 (medium eaters). This won't feed 5 lunks from the gym. This weekend was a little different. It was two of us and we decided to come in, kind of "off-peak" time around 3pm and sat at the bar. This was totally new for Mom and I. At the bar, you can eat off the normal menu, but they also have a "bar menu" which consists of Hero's, all different kinds. They have Chicken and Veal Cutlets, Eggplant, Italian, Portobello, Meatball...which are 12" and come with a side tossed salad or Caesar for $11.95! We ended up splitting the Chicken Cutlet, had Caesar and a side of Meatballs ($3.95/ball). Some of the best I've ever had. The bartender was great. Mom's Mojito was amazing and I just had a beer - can't screw that up. I Could rave about the food, but really everything is awesome, the waiters are ALL so kind and really funny. It's just a great atmosphere!
