This place is probably the best you will get on BBQ in Philly along w/Famous Dave's on their best days because many BBQ places I've eaten at I haven't enjoyed.  Though Percy's brisket is waay better than Famous Dave's boiled then microwaved brisket.   The BBQ here is pretty tasty, but way too expensive.   I pay $17 for a couple of oz's of brisket with two sides which I usually pick the baked beans and then supplement the coleslaw with another baked beans because they are really good and smokey flavored.   They put alot of leftover brisket in their beans, and I could just eat it all night long.   The brisket is good as stated but you don't get near enough for what you pay.   The other sides that I've tried like mac n cheese and potato salad were nothing special.   It is on South Street.  Good luck finding parking even when doing like I do which is go really late so your car won't get towed.  Luckily, you'll find a space not more than 5 minute walk.
