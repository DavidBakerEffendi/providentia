The staff greets you warmly as soon as you walk in and the food is as good as the welcome. We had the empanadas and pork appetizers (Spanish isn't a language I am good at - sorry!) and they were excellent. For dinner we had the chicken and steak and they were excellent as well. The foods presentation was attractive and all the wait staff asked us if we needed our drinks refreshed when passing by and we were low. I highly recommend trying this surprising gem in Hamilton!
