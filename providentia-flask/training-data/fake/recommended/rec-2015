First of All, $8.50 for a crappy cheese steak is a bad idea. They are cash only, and for all the hype that's with this place, I really wonder if people have lost their minds. If I wanted cheap Italian bread made with STEAKUM meat from a hairy guy who doesn't like to prepare food with gloves, I would've...well...actually who WOULD want that? Outdoor seating only, so it is not cold weather friendly. Also apart from the overpriced dog meat, I felt like the size of the sandwich was just downright offensive. When we asked locals about Geno's the next day, they said it was an overpriced joke too. If you want a REAL cheese steak, go to Jim's Steaks on South. Don't wast your time at Geno's. It's not even worth saying you've been there.
