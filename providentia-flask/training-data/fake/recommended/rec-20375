Fantastic food and great service. Bar steak comes with a pile of lettuce and fries. I'm just telling you because it doesn't mention the lettuce on the menu - it's a steak salad. This is my dish! Paired with a bitter margarita and it's pure heaven. Burgers are great, too, so is brunch. Absolutely no complaints.
