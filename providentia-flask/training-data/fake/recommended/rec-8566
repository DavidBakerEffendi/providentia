The bagels are honestly delicious! I personally think Long Island bagels are the best, and these are a close second. However, everything is WAY overpriced. For a BEC and a drink it comes to over $8. There is always a crowd on the weekends so expect to wait a while. Also, after you put in your order expect to wait at least 10 minutes to get your food (even if there is no one there). I only come here once in a while if I am not in a rush. I now just get a bagel and use my own cream cheese at home.
