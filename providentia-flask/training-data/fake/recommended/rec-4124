Ate here once & the food was honestly great & delicious. However we placed an order for home delivery & the 45 minute wait that we were told on the phone, turned out to be an hour & 20 minutes! AND, the food wasn't even hot!!!!!! You want food from here, just go get it yourself because their delivery SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
