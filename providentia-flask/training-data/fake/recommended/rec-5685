Bouley has an aura and an ambience of a secret society meeting place.  You keep expecting a wall to move and show you where the riff-raff eats and why they don't know that Bouley exists. Service here is top flight from the person who checks you in, takes your coat and offers you a beverage.  It is lavishly decorated and comfortably tabled with plenty of room.  The menu requires a long read and possibly a United Nations headset since they offer choices that would take hours to contemplate. Do not come to Bouley if you need to get somewhere!  Service takes an eternity and costs your children a college education.  The nice thing is that they take care of you and even bring you things to try if you're game. FYI it may not be as hard to get into as in the old days too.
