I can only give this three stars since I did not have any food.  Spent a Sunday here watching the olympic hockey game.  Our group pretty much had the back room to ourselves.  The waitress was very attentive and quick to bring all requests.   Even bought the table a round of shots after some spirited yelling on our part for the USA ( well actually sprited expletives against Canada! )  Very nice change of pace from the bigger sports bars like Fox and Hound.  Would absolutely return for another big game.  Up next baseball!
