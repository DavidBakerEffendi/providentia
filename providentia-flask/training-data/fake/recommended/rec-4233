I have been here a couple times the service was never great but the last it was terrible and insulting! I'm giving them 1 star because no stars isn't an option!  I went there with my family on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and these fools had us sitting there for 20 mins with water without taking our order.  Finally the waitress came to the table with no remorse and a my sh@t don't stick attitude.  There was no way, I was staying there.  We walked out.  The reviews indicating that the service here is terrible is no exaggeration! I would rather give my $6 at a pizza shop!
