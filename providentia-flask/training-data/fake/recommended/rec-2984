How does this place get more than a couple of stars for its average? It's overpriced and feels dirty. I went on a Saturday late night in the winter and it was nearly empty, yet my friend and I were ignored by the bartender for over 5 minutes before we finally got to order our $5 lagers. There food was not appealing. No ambience at all; it's not a dive, yet doesn't have any other personality either.
