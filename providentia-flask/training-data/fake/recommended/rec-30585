Went to dinner here last week, and, given how much good food exists in NYC, Cookshop was a disappointment. We were seated near the bar but took nearly 20 minutes for us to get our drinks (iced tea & a glass of wine - not hard). Appetizers took another 30 minutes and the main course took almost an hour after the appetizers. The restaurant was busy but not slammed. It just seemed like they'd forgotten about us. Worse yet, when we asked about our food, you would have thought we'd ask for several bars of gold. The waiter didn't even bring it out for us - looked like the manager. When I mentioned, politely, that the food seemed to take a while, he just shrugged, put down our food and left. The food itself was fine, nothing extraordinary. It was an unfortunate dining experience only made better by the fact that I was having dinner with an old friend who I hadn't seen in a while.
