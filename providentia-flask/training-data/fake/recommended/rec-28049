Rosemary Chicken Wings. Calamari with the San Marzano sauce. Ooooh baby! And that was just the beginning of a fun, cozy night at Carroll Place. This place was packed, not surprising for a Saturday night, so it was a good thing we had reservations. The location is right in the heart of the Village which worked out perfectly for us since we were headed to a comedy show at the Cellar around the corner. The vibe? Casual and warm. The staff? Friendly and helpful. The food? WOW! We started with a few appetizers and since I'd read on Yelp about the wings, it was a must try. So glad we did. Crispy and flavorful and sooooo delish!! The calamari was very good but the marinara sauce was the hero of this dish. The menu consists of "small plates" and main dishes, so you can busy your tastebuds with cheese boards and marinated olives or sliders and various meats. The main dishes of the night for us consisted of the Margherita pizza, the Homemade Pappardelle with braised Pork ragu, the Linguini Vongole and the Homemade Lasagna. Everything was delicious for the most part, but I did feel the pizza was pretty uneventful. Maybe it was because we had the basic pizza as opposed to exploring some of the more interesting ones. But the show stoppers of our meal were the desserts. The warm chocolate cake was gone in an instant. Holy crap it was good. And the Nutella chocolate Calzone was unreal. For the love of all that is holy, GET DESSERT!! I love places like this. Gastro pub atmosphere with amazing food. Carroll Place is a cozy fun restaurant/bar in the heart of the Village with all the right moves. Great food, great ambiance and excellent service.
