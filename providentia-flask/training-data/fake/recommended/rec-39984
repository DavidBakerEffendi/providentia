I don't understand  the negative reviews for this place. Each time I have been here, it is always a good time. The staff is always friendly as are the patrons. The food is decent and meets expectations for a bar called Wrap Shack. I have to call out the outstanding customer service and the overall welcoming feeling I get each time I am here. Great neighborhood bar Hats off to the crew   They're all good people. I will be back again for sure
