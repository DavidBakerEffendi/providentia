This is all a diner should be.  You've got the ambiance of a real historic diner ( a Worcester), coupled with some Elvis memorabilia and some local character.  That alone would get a 3 on my scale.  But when you add good food and good service, it's a 5.  I think of diners as an American institution, celebrating small towns, local people, and if you are lucky, good food.  I have parents who came from a time when all restaurants were local, and they gave me a distrust of fast food chains.  Good food is local, and regional, and as good as the cook who makes it.   It is not golden arches and billions sold. This is a one of a kind experience, and I'll be back to try their eggs benny.
