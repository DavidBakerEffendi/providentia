A business trip allowed me to enjoy a few restaurants in Philly and this was one of them.  With planes not serving food anymore unless you fork over some money in addition to a three hour time difference, I was ready to eat an early dinner once we checked into our hotel. A co-worker found this place via Zagat.  The overall experience was good.  The servers were very friendly, attentive, and answered all our questions.   The entree I ordered was the roasted scallops with summer giambotta which was 24 bucks.  The scallops were cooked to perfection.  They were a good size, slightly seared, and had a fresh taste to them.  Giambotta is basically a vegetable stew and paired well with the scallops. To end the meal, my co-workers ordered the Belgian style waffles with Nutella.  After about 5 minutes, the waiter informed us that they were having issues with the waffle maker and gave us some complimentary desserts which was very nice of them.  When the waffles finally made their way out, all of my co-workers immediately took a bite and were extremely pleased.  One even devoured it in less than 2 minutes.  Must've been good. Nothing to complain about here.  A solid 4 stars.
