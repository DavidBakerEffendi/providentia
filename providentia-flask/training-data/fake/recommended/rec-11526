This review is only for their take-out service and so far, I'm loving their pizza! It's not the typical New York Style pizza. It's the genuine thin-sliced Italian style pizza where you don't feel guilty about eating the whole pie. My default is usually the margherita pizza and Venturo's was absolutely delicious. It was a nice balance of tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese. Oh man, I can already smell it as I'm writing this. Maybe I'll order one tonight.
