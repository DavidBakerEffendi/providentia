Im going to start this review with by saying Carline the manager is AMAZING! Every time me and my wife come in she goes out of her way to make our experience great. The food is always fantastic and different. I love love love the beets sauce they serve with pita I believe it is as a app. We will be coming back many more time. Thanks Caroline
