If you like pancakes like I do, you will love Clinton Street. These guys easily have the best pancakes in the world, let alone NYC. They have a few different types but what I always go for are the blueberry pancakes. They are about $13 dollars for a plate of 3, (pricey pancakes!) and you will probably have to wait in line for an hour to get seated if you go during the weekend, but to me they are SO worth it. The ultimate fluffy and not-too-sweet and delectable pancakes are served with maple-butter, Clinton Streets own creation. Its so much better than the traditional maple syrup you may never want to use maple syrup ever again. Definitely amazing pancakes, the only downside is its pricey and there is always a wait. Also your party of 3 will probably end up being crammed at a 2-person table.
