If you can't make it to Morocco for authentic Moroccan food then go to Casablanca. After taking many trips to Morocco, I was very disappointed by Moroccan restaurants in the US so I just started cooking Moroccan food for myself. I decided to give Casablanca a try on a whim and I was pleasantly surprised. Everything we ordered was delicious and tasted just like it would in Morocco. I highly recommend the chicken m'rouzia. My only complaint would be that they had no Moroccan khobz (flat bread) but  that's forgivable because that bread isn't easy to come by. The mere fact that they've mastered the complicated chicken bastilla speaks volumes. The owners were a delight, very friendly and accommodating.  Their daughter, the waitress, was also very friendly and attentive. It's a shame that I finally found a good Moroccan restaurant when I no longer live in NYC.
