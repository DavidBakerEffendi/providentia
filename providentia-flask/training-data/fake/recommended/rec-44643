The best thing this restaurant has going for it is that it uses quality, local ingredients.  Of course, one never knows if the ingredients are actually local, organic, etc. but from my first visit, I could say that they were certainly of high quality. When you are a New Yorker you become accustomed to a certain level of quality at a certain price point.  This is not to say that New Yorkers are snobs, it is just that the competition for restaurants in New York is so high.  So when you travel, you often have meals that make you think a) at that price point, you could have had much better food or b) for the quality of food you got, you could have spent a lot less. Heirloom is just this kind of restaurant, but not by far.  It has a decent wine list at decent prices, but the kitchen doesn't quite hold up to one's expectations. I had the hanger steak at $28.  It quality meat, cooked well, but very sweet. At first it reminded me of bulgogi seasoning, but by the time I finished it, it tasted much sweeter than bulgogi.  I had paired it with a merlot, thinking that the sweetness of the wine would balance my savory steak, but I had another thing coming.   That said, the service was great, ambience was fine, everything on the menu looked good... but then again so did the steak.  Just a tip to the kitchen: keep it simple. That steak could have been so good if there was no sugar, no cashew butter, just quality meat, cooked well (and by that I mean medium-rare), with a decent side.
