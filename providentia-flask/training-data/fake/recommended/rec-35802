Massive sandwiches. A very unique West Philly deli with a lot of character. Â Just ordering your food is an experience in itself. I've gotten full off of the free samples before getting my sandwich. Overall very satisfied with this place. One down side is the prices can be a bit steep for sandwiches (around $10), but you definitely get what you pay for in terms of portions.
