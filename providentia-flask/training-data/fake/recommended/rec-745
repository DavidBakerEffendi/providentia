Here we go with the big cheese steak debate. I did take the Philly cheese steak challenge and I have picked my favorite out of the bunch. For me Pat's was just OK compared to some of the others. The meat just seemed bland and a little on the dry side to me compared to others. You won't be dissappointed with a "Whiz Wit" but there are betters. However I did think their frie's were better then thier neighbors.
