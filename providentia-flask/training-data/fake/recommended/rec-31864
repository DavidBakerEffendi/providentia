I have been trying to go to a reputable ramen place for a while and the wait time is usually inhumane and not worth my time.  Fortunately it was late Saturday night during Memorial Day weekend AND they text you when ur table is almost ready so u can walk around instead of going stir crazy waiting inside the restaurant.   We had the pork buns, the modern ramen and spicy ramen with the added pork belly.  It is A LOT of food.   My bf was going to go for the option where u get an extra ball of noodles, but changed his mind once he dug in, and he eats A LOT.  One downside is that they don't let u take your leftovers.  They said its bc the noodles get soggy and gross the next day.  I'll be the judge of that!  But whatever, it prob saves a lot of wasted plastic containers.  So I manned up and finished my food to the best of ability.  My spicy ramen was spicy, but not so bad that u would sprout hairs on your chest or not enjoy your food.  But my bf said it was too spicy for him (after having three ladleful sand saying the broth was tastier than his).  He has no hair on his chest.  Go.  It's good.  Just don't be a putz and wait an hour or longer to eat here.  Love yourself ppl
