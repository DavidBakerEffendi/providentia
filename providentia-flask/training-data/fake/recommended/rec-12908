I was really excited to finally eat at The Meatball Shop. I had heard so much about their ice cream and, well... meatballs. Somehow we got seated right away while others stood outside and had to wait. I though the ordering procedure was cute yet unnecessary with the whole writing on the menu with sharpies idea. The meatballs I thought were OK and same goes for the ice cream. I think this is a nice restaurant with OK food and is mostly fueled by "East Village Hype" which seems to carry many OK establishments, e.g Clinton St. Baking. I would eat here again, but wouldn't wait in line for it.
