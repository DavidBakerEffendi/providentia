*CASH ONLY* Decor: 3/5 -Decent amount of seating and a large bar. -Lighting is somewhat dim -Dress is casual Service: 2.5/5 -fast food type service, average at best. Food: 3/5 -I ordered the Bistro Burger with cheese and bacon ($8). The meat portion was fairly large at one inch thick. There's also lettuce, pickles and onions included. -The burger is too greasy with barely any flavor. Best burger in NYC? I think not. Korzo Haus still ranks top burger for me. -The fries were quite good, similar to Mickie D's. A small is $2.75 and trust me, it'll disappear fast.
