If you're from LA, you're not missing anything - IMHO, Daikokuya is way better than Ippudo. That being said, Ippudo is probably the second best ramen place I've been to in the US. What makes Daikokuya better, you may ask? Well, it's really everything - the broth, the noodles, the melt-in-your-mouth pork, the egg.... I will give points to Ippudo for space and atmosphere - like most places in New York, it's very trendy and can accommodate large groups, whereas Daikokuya has all the atmosphere of a dive and can handle groups of 4-6 at the largest (and that's a stretch). I was able to sample three of the ramen dishes, thanks to my generous in-laws. Here's the run-down: Akamaru Modern: They do this really well, and if you can only order one dish, this should be it. The broth has a nice fullness to it. I was a bit disappointed with the noodles in all the ramen soups - they were more like somen noodles (thin, straight, white, not holding the taste of the soup very much) than the ramen noodles I'm accustomed to (thicker, yellower, chewier, retaining the broth). Karaka Miso Ramen: This is the spicy version, and it's pretty good, though I think Santouka's is better. Shiromaru Hakata Classic: Good broth, but the Modern is better. The Hirata Pork Buns were also quite good - more flavorful than spicy. The bun is similar to the bun you would get if you ordered Peking duck at a Chinese restaurant. Hamachi Carpaccio: Yeah, this is definitely not a sushi restaurant - don't order this. It wasn't spicy, and the yellowtail tasted fishy - never a good thing. Consider yourself warned. Service was excellent. We had 8 adults and 6 children under the age of 6 in our party, so you can imagine the amount of chaos and special orders involved. For example: Could we get another order of the buns? No pork, just the buns. For the kids. FYI, it's $2/bun. They also cut the pork buns into multiple pieces and brought out extra bowls so everyone could share.
