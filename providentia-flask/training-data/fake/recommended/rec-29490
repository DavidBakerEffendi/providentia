The best Philly cheesesteak in Philadelphia, which makes this the best Philly cheesesteak in the... um... universe. Dalessandro's is off the main drag, so if you're visiting Philadelphia as a tourist (hahahahahahaha), or you're vegan, then you're unlikely to ever go there. But know this: You would be passing up a chance to eat the best cheesesteak in the universe. It's a typical neighborhood spot, which means it's dirty and worn, and the stools around the counter are always filled with regular guys who look like Rocky Balboa and shout f-bombs at the cook and each other. It also means they pile a lot more meat on your steak for less money than the places you might read about in some in-flight magazine or travel book. And Dalessandro's melts the cheese with the meat - on the grill - so the (American) cheese is smooth and gooey. Unlike Pat's where they just lay a couple slices of cheese on the bun so they can move more units per minute. This place is the bomb-diggity.
