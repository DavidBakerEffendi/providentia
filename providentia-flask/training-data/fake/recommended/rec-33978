The madness that makes a Michelin star. Between the Food Network stardom, the skull & crossbones tiles, the foie gras doughnut, the Wu Tang Clan playing on the stereo as the disco ball twinkled above, the wordplay + foodplay combo, the nachos, the lamb breast, the Rolling Rock for 3 bucks, and Justin Warner pouring our water & getting our check, I was... ...satisfied. Satisfied like as if I'd heard Ol' Dirty Bastard whispering instructions in a window in my head to go to the deli at 2 am to prepare a food sacrifice of gummy worms, Velveeta, Milanos, Nesquik, catfood, Chips Ahoy, Munchies, and SlimJim. For just like a deli, Do or Dine's menu is a bombardment of ingredients that make sense only in how they baffle you because they don't, and can't match. (But yes, I liked the foie gras doughnut. And will be trying it again.)
