wasn't expecting much with the burger on panini like bread...but it was GREAT. bronte burger. GET IT. TRY IT. hard to get a burger like this anywhere else. The meat was cooked well..not dry. chili sauce compliments it well. bread was light. The salads are good too. Filling and full of flavor. I like the avocado chicken salad a lot. The white wine...eh. bland. The red wine was better. Gets crowded so get there early.
