Pylos wasn't our first choice but the other restaurant we wanted to go to was super packed so we yelped the closest place near st marks for lunch. We saw that it was Greek and decided why not? i've never tried greek before so this was those let's do it moments the outside of the restaurant looked pretty decent and modern. the decor inside of the restaurant was super interesting. they have clay pots all over the ceiling. it was hung all over the ceiling in one part of the restaurant. the restaurant wasn't too big but it was comfortable with couches and pillows for you to lean on. the food was pretty good. i'm disappointed i didnt get to try anything in their appetizer menu because the table next to me had some bread and a dipping that looked quite scrumtious. i ordered from the grill  the -  paidakia galaktos stin schara which is marinated grilled baby lamb chops. the flavor was really really good. it was nice and juicy. my side was the fried potatoes. it was nothing too special but decent enough with some cheese sprinkled on top. my other friend also ordered from the grill the salmon which was cooked nicely as well, juicy. for dessert we got napoleon me mousse apo vissino kai yiaourti crisp phyllo napoleon layered with greek yogurt and sour-cherry mousse this was my best part. i am a sweets person and this is really good. the crispy sweet layer blended really well with the greek yogurt making it not too sweet and not too sour. the perfect way to end a scrumtious meal :D i would definitely recommend. the waiter was really nice, and offered us different options of wine to try and drink. the food came at a decent pace. would DEFINITELY go back! enjoy!
