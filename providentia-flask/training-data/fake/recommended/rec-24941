Amazing farm to table style place. Communal tables which I'm not a fan of but the food is so incredible that I would sit in anything to eat here. I don't know how there isn't a line out the door for this place. We got the beet salad (literally the best salad I've even eaten in my life) and the beet veggie burger (I forgot what it was called), absolutely amazing! The fried red bliss chips dipped in their homemade spicy mustard and beet ketchup were also incredible. And it wasn't expensive at all.
