I loved that the big bowl of Saigon pho and some spring rolls were sufficient for me and my boyfriend - who were both starving at that time. There's nothing better than some good pho on a nippy February night! Anyway, I also ordered Grilled Pork Chops, Shrimps with spring rolls and rice to go. Very flavorful and satisfying. The only downside was when my boyfriend went out to withdraw some cash, the waiter kept staring at me like, "Come on, order something already!!!!" He kept glancing at me, approaching me and asking if I wanted anything even though I told him I'll just wait for my boyfriend cause I'm not sure what he wants. So meh, I just ordered the things I usually eat so he could stop bugging me. I know you want my butt out of there so you could seat more customers but chill out, it's not as if we were going to sit there for an hour. But whatever, I'm still a fan!
