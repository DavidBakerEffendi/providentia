Ordered a rack of ribs and 4 wings as I was seriously craving BBQ... Craving BBQ! If I wanted cold salty jerky, I could have just went to 7-11. Maybe I should if have as it would have been ten times cheaper. Instead I got cold, burned, dry ribs, greasy tasteless.chicken wings, and a couple of containers of mayo that contained a few potatoes and cabbage. After choking down a few of the ribs, it was at least it was a nice treat to finish the meal off with even drier cornbread. Ended up dumping most of the dinner in the trash,.where it should of been delivered in the first place. Never ordering from this dump again. Can't believe these idiots have the nerve to deliver food if this quality.
