My family and I are HUGE foodies.  We go everywhere and anywhere to try the latest and greatest, and Cucina Forte, by far, exceeded our expectations.   The ambiance was lovely with a very warm, cozy, intimate setting.  As soon as we sat down, Gloria tended to our drinks and gave us insight to the menu.  She was extremely helpful and very friendly. We began with a bunch of appetizers - antipasto, broccoli rabe with shrimp, fried calamari, and gnocchi (one marinara and one gorgonzola cream) - and they were ALL delicious.  The gnocchi (just like most of the reviewers will agree) were amazing!  I would HIGHLY recommend the gnocchi with gorgonzola cream.  For dinner, I got a tuna special.  That's usually my "go to" entree when I want to compare restaurants.  Well, Cucina Forte cooked up one of the most flavorful tuna dishes I've ever had.   We went there to celebrate my birthday, and at the end of the evening, I was greeted (by Gloria AND the oh-so-adorable owner, Maria) with a slice of HEAVENLY cake...that honestly tasted like a chocolate marshmallow.  We got to chatting with Gloria and Maria, and it was like being with family.  We spent the last half hour of our visit just being in the company of great people. I would go back to Cucina Forte over and over...and over and over again!  It's DEFINITELY on our list of restaurants to revisit.  Hands down!
