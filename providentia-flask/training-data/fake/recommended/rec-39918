A trip to Philly is never complete without having a cheese steak.  While people will argue who has the better cheese steak Pat's or Geno's I'm going to have to go with Pat for the simple reason that this is where my friend took me and this is where I go when I'm in Philly.  I would also like to add this is the only time where I believe adding Cheeze Whiz is acceptable.
