For months I have been dying to know what the fuss about "chicken and rice" is all about. And now, I understand. The line can get ridiculously long, but it goes pretty fast and is definitely worth the wait. The chicken is very flavorful and tender, really good rice, and an amazing white sauce that hits the spot. The hot sauce is delicious, but is super hot, so try a little first before dumping it onto the plate like I did. I love hot food and I was able to handle the heat until the very end..maybe 3 more bites left. And the whole experience of obtaining the food was just fun. It's the sort of place you have to go to every time you go to NYC.
