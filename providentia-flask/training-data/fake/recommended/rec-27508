I love irene, the greek dancing barkeep, but then again I have loved so many of the staff that have passed through over the years.What a comfortable feeling it is to order refried anything at the bar and partake in an afternoon tequilla mix.Over the years the changing stores that transmogrify outside the window on broome street, make barriochino feel like you are sitting in HG wells' time machine, a fully paid up broome street staple.Here's to barriochino hundreds of years into the future,..... I shall miss you irene.
