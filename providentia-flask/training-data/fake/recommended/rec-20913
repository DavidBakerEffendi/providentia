Great beer but the food is sub-par; my boyfriend ordered the shephard's pie and I ordered the portabello bird's nest (or something along those lines).  As one user also mentioned, these meals did remind me of cafeteria food. It's probably a great hangout for college kids/those on a budget, as the prices are extremely reasonable.  The outside deck is also very nice, and the "forbidden fruit" beer is soooo tasty and refreshing. I will probably return to this establishment, but maybe I will stick to appetizers or sandwiches next time.
