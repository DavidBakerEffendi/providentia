The drinks are watered down, the prices are now crazy high, and all the food is frozen - not fresh! On the menu, they have a Philly CHEESE steak sandwich for $8 and "extras" $1. So here's how it broke down on the bill for a NORMAL sandwich: Philly cheese steak $8 CHEESE $1 (mind you, not for extra cheese and on the menu it says CHEESE steak?!? Onions $1 Mushrooms $1 Green peppers $1 Red peppers $1 The waitress was asked about the fact that it is a CHEESE steak sandwich, so why is that considered an extra, but she said it is and that the bill was correct!
