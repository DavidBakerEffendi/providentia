Went there with another couple last night for the first time.  Service was really good - our waitress helped us pick about 10 items from the menu for the 4 of us to share and the amount was perfect.  If you took a sip of water it seemed like they were right there to refill you. Our favorites on the menu were probably the parsnip and potato cannelloni with short rib ragu, poutine and the kielbasa.  However, everything was soooo salty.  Way over salted.  Now I know why they kept the water flowing!  The pork belly was good, but probably the saltiest and borderline inedible (luckily it was one bite for each of us - if I had to eat the whole piece solo it would have been just too much salt).  If this were Chopped the four judges would definitely take points off for over salting.
