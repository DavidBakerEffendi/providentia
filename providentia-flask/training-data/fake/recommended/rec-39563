Def have to eat a burger when you come here.  The simple/classic burger has girth and is juicy.  The menu is small but done well.  $3 mcsorleys which is a pull but they do not take credit cards. Service was a little slow and I was there on a Sunday at noon with my bud to watch the Jets game.  They did not have sound for game which was a negative. I will definitely try the chili when I come back here.
