ok, i feel totally nasty after i eat a stash of fries but i can't help myself. besides very little self-control, they're french fries. who can resist?! i've been back a few times and nothing says "warm and fuzzy brain chemicals" like a cone of salty fried goodness with honey mustard dipping sauce. i will not wait when the line is out the door -- i wait for nothing that long, but pack me in there like a sardine and i'm ready to roll! drunk, stoned or sober...i have no shame -- it doesn't matter!!!
