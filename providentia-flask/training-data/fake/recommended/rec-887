This cart ROCKS. It's where the after party is, after all. The line is usually really long and there's a wait, but it's worth it once you're near the front placing your order. I once saw friend A drop off friend B there just so friend B could wait in line while friend A parked the car. By the time he parked, the line had grown like another half mile. Good call, buddy. First time my friend told me about this cart, my thought was, "Yea ok, it's chicken. And rice. How hard is it to make that? I can make it. It can't be that good. It's made on a cart." Well, I ate my words that night. I always get the lamb and rice; I just prefer it over the chicken or the combo. They all come with hot sauce and white sauce, and there are bottles of both sauces at the end of the cart for the people who like extra. *raises hand to both* Just to let you know, I smother mine in a LOT of white sauce and hot sauce. What can I say? I love the heat and the calories.
