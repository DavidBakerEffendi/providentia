Amazing sushi and very affordable. Everything was top notch here. We got 4 or 5 special rolls to split between 4 people and were very full. We were late for our reservations due to having a hard time finding parking (which might happen depending on when you come there). However, they were very nice and we got a table within 10 minutes of waiting there. The presentation of our sushi was very nicely done and everything was excellent. Do not remember the names of the rolls but from my experience all of the rolls are good and can't say a bad thing about any of them.
