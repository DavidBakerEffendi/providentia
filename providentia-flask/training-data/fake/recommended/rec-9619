Do yourself a favor and order the filet mignon benedict when you go! We went just before noon on a Sunday. Perhaps the snow made the wait manageable, as we waited for no more than 10 or 15 minutes even with the huge crowd by the door. It was a busy day but we were very happy with the service. The staff were obviously very efficient, and when we clumsily spilt something on our table and asked for napkins, the waiter gently wiped down the mess for us. The filet mignon benedict was the best eggs benedict I've ever had. It was pretty mind blowing. The sauce, the meat, and the onion rings around the eggs made such a perfect combination in terms of taste and texture. We also ordered caramelized apple waffle, latte, and earl grey tea, and we liked the bread that they served, but the filet mignon benedict was obviously the star of the meal.
