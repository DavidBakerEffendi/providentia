I'll give them cred for having moderately adequate food, but undoubtedly, their service was sub-par, and I received a spiced herring crepe WITHOUT THE HERRING. ..... So chefs make mistakes, and that's fine, but when I informed the waitress her attitude was apathetic and inexperienced. She talked to the chef came back and said something along the lines of "yeah, he forgot cause he had too many crepes to handle. how about i give you the herring on the side." ARE YOU SERIOUS. Kinda not appetizing when she came back with random pieces of herring on a huge white plate. When I asked for the restaurant to comp the meal, she seemed so unsure...to be honest, I don't think she knows what she's doing. In the end when she handed the cheque to us she told me it wasn't her fault. Â  Sweet. Love waitresses like that. Guess I won't be hanging around there again.
