Look, this is a fantastic food court. The food is always fresh and such variety! I have always thought that food court were kind of gross, and I think in theory they can be funky. But me and all my co workers love this place, and it is always busy which is a good sign. Â I also love that they weight the food so I can tell when I am binge eating. I especially love the rib tips with white rice.
