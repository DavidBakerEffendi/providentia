I had a sneak peak at the friends and family, and this place is killer. The space is bigger than the old space, and absolutely beautiful, dark wood everywhere, a solid bar space up front, large tables and booths in back. THE FOOD. Jalepeno bacon cornbread is so good it's stupid. Â Very fresh oysters with an awesome horseradish cocktail sauce. Very juicy chicken, amazing mashed potatoes. Dr. Pepper Ribs stole my heart. They didn't have their liquor license yet, but I had some prosecco, cava, and a glass of rioja, which were all palatable. You won't be disappointed.
