OMG, best cheesesteak EVER!!!! The meat is perfectly shaved and extremely flavorful, the onions are perfectly sweet and carmalized and the bun is high quality and soft. I am ecstatic to have found this place and it's only minutes from where I live!  Forget about Pat's & Gino's, they suck in comparison.  Jim's Steaks are better than those two in my opinion, but this place.... WOW!  Never again will I fight center city traffic and the barking rude employees of those previously named establishments.  This place can get crowded in the evening or on weekends, but if you go early enough on the weekdays there's only a few people there.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
