My sister turned me on to this place, and I'm SO glad she did!  Great variety, delicious food that you can IDENTIFY just what you're eating, friendly owner and staff.  I love the selection of international items and I am TOTALLY hooked on the bibimbap.  I'm excited just thinking about the fact i'm having that for dinner tonight!  Great little establishment.  I'm from the neighborhood (Yorktown) and it's nice to see something different on CBM (Columbia Ave for nostalgia's sake:).
