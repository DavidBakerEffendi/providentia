ambiance/design: 5 service: 2 food: 4 value: 2.5 Total: 3.375 the inside is very sexy, great low lighting.  I'm pretty sure the waitress hated us, but not sure why...or hated being a waitress.... The food was good, but a $9 salad had 1oz of cheese, 1/2 tomato, and 1 oz watermelon with balsamic....tasty but why $9? i ordered 2 desserts to go, but got a wrong one.  the candy bar was not so good.  the cake was moist and good. wanted the chocolate cream pie because i heard great things about it (except some at the table ordered it and said it was just alot of pudding....?) good for dates
