Shh! Did you hear that? It's the sound of appreciative foodies all over Brooklyn whispering the incantation "Applewood" under their collective breaths.   Of course that's probably overstating the case just a bit; gauging by the restaurant's popularity and their "don't you dare show up without a reservation" rep, the secret is obviously out.   But they earn their kudos, to be sure.  The menu at Applewood is a marvel of organic, sustainable, eco-friendly precision and goodness (some might argue "greatness") that was clearly put together by a culinary team that has a masterful understanding of food and flavor.  The wine list is equally magnificent, rivaling the best small lists in Manhattan.  It's a pleasure to both read and to sample from, and contains a large number of rarefied wines from top of the line purveyors--the kind who can pick and choose which establishments their products are sold in.  There are treasures by the glass and bottle, and their remarkably well chosen stable of desert wines is almost a work of art.  And the service, despite the predilection for serving men first on a recent visit, is eminently polished and professional.   My only gripe is that the even though the room is in keeping with the homey, gentle "country meets Park Slope" vibe, there's just something a bit stiff and staid about the atmosphere; I could have sworn I've seen the same exact chairs at a Pennsylvania Dutch buffet in Lancaster County.   Then again, this minor frustration will hardly get in the way of your enjoyment of what just might be the best food in the borough of Brooklyn.  And while it might be expensive, at Applewood you most certainly get what you pay for.
