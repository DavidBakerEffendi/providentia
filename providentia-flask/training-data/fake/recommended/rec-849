We did the Pat's vs. Geno's challenge and my mom chose Pat's! I chose Geno's, but overall, Pat's Cheesesteaks are very good! I got a cheesesteak with mushrooms, onions and wiz. It was flavorful, the onions definitely added to that. I'm not a big fan of their bread, that's why I chose Geno's. I will definitely be making another trip up to Philly to re-do this challenge! Haha!
