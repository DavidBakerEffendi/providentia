For all of the raves that David Chang gets, I am super disappointed with the flavors and his dishes. I tried the noodle bar and thought that it was ok and didn't really get what everyone was ga-ga over. But, I still wanted to give it a chance and tried Ssam. Sure, quality ingredients are used. But you still have to take those ingredients and make great dishes. The portions just leave you with only a taste of the dish. And I felt the dishes fell short on flavor...it's as if they made a good effort but just couldn't quite pull it off. If it was just on food alone, I would probably say it's okay. But, the prices are just ridiculous for what you are getting, despite quality ingredients. And for that, you feel ripped off and unsatisfied. As an example, our waiter was totally selling the Poussin and how phenomenal it is because it's a young chicken and delicious. I'm really not a fan of ordering chicken when I eat out, but decided to give it a try. Sure enough, I should have known better. First, the portion was ridiculously small with a tiny leg an maybe a thigh? "Okay, but it probably tastes fantastic" I said to myself. Wrong...for a young chicken, the meat was overcooked, dry and tough. And forget about the seasoning and flavor. So to charge $26 is a joke. This wasn't just one dish either. The others we had left us feeling hungry. The best part of the meal was the steamed pork buns, but not good enough to make me go back.
