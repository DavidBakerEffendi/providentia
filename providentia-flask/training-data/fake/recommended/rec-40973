Having eaten here my fair share, I think it's time to give it the credit it deserves. Barboncino is consistently one of my favorite places to eat in the neighborhood. Decor is beautiful, and ambience is great. Let's start with the service. Hostesses and bartenders have always been really nice while I've waited to sit. They've always accommodated my party, whether it's 2 people or 10. Drinks, including wine beer and cocktails, are yummy and fairly priced. The pizzas are nothing short of delicious. I've tried almost every one on the menu and been impressed every time. Personal favorite is the arugula with pancetta. If you're feelin indulgent try the desert calzone. You'll never forget it.
