Chef Mehta is amazing. A genius, really. This was one of the most special meals I've had in my lifetime. And I am definitely a foodie who has eaten at some of the world's "best" restaurants (per Michelin, anyway) so I promise this is not faint praise. We had the prosecco lychee martinis (like an adult slushee - incredible), the mango paneer (I dislike both mangos and paneer and was scraping the bottom of this dish) the dumplings (just one of the savoriest treats I've ever eaten) and the most amazing part - the strawberries. Don't overlook this dessert. It is out of this world. You have never tasted a flavor like this. Do not leave this restaurant without ordering this dessert! The service is spectacular at this tiny restaurant. I will come back here every time I am in New York. This is a very special place.
