Delicious special deli sandwiches 24 hours a day 7 days a week in LES! In the day time buy the sandwich and walk over to Thompson Square part for a more comfortable meal. After mid-night you'll just have to hang out with all the other drunks on the sidewalk and eat from a bag. We had the PHO #1 (PHO-Real) mild-heat $6.99/change to hero (add $1.50)- spicy, delicious, fresh, and satisfying. Rated: messy goodness, 4/5.
