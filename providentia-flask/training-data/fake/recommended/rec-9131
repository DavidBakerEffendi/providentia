I was very surprised to see that the whole menu was reasonably priced considering where it's located! And the taste wasn't bad either, I got the Room Service pad thai (seafood), it was goood. Had the most plumpest biggest shrimp in it and all other seafood goodness. Def thinking of visiting back when in the area!
