Two words: Calamari. Tacos. Seriously, it's a fucking revelation.  Grilled calamari, chopped up and served in a warm soft tortilla, topped with onions, cilantro and delicious pickled red onions - a quad of salsas on the side. If there's one area that makes me think NYC, it is the Lower East Side, and nothing captures the LES quite as perfectly as Barrio Chino.  It's a joint you could easily miss walking by since Broome is a tiny little street.  If you happen to walk in, though, time starts to stand still.  Which is a good thing if you are spending a lazy afternoon just drinking and eating your way through the LES.  Not such a good thing if you are famished and are coming here just to grub.  As others have mentioned, the kitchen is slower than Sarah Palin trying to get through "War and Peace." You have to come here with the right mindset.  On a warm day, you sit down and let the breeze cool you as it meanders in through the windowless storefront.  Start by ordering some guac and a michelada or one of their signature margaritas (the habanero is my favorite, but skip the sugar on the rim; it makes it too sweet).  Then you can gnosh a bit, enjoy your drink and figure out what you want from the kitchen. Really, the food is good, not remarkable, save for the aforementioned calamari tacos which really are mini-orgasms wrapped in tortillas.  However, it's the whole laid back atmosphere and vibe at Chino that makes it a can't miss for me.  The music makes me think they secretly stole my MP3 playlists: everything from Sublime to Michael Jackson to Tribe Called Quest to Marley to The Shins to Dylan to Pete Rock and CL Smooth. If the food is just the destination, then at Barrio Chino you really want the journey to be leisurely because it will be filled with great drinks, music and atmosphere.
