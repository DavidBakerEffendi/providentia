Amazing breakfast. Took my out of town-ers here Â the morning after a long night on the town and it hit the spot for everyone no matter what was ordered. Their real deal is the eggs Benedict - I ordered the California Eggs Benedict with alvacado....awesome. Great/unique ambiance too, take a look at the post cards sent from all over the world writing to the Pantry. To avoid the lines, or most of them I recommend going early afternoon, brunch really & cash only folks!
