We had to wait 40 minutes for a table with a reservation.  Food and service were very good but the sound level is unbearable.  You have to yell to be heard across the table.  Granted it has a low ceiling but they do nothing to lower the decibel level.  Even our waitperson said when they get home it takes hours for the sound to get out of their ears.  The sound level will keep  us from coming back.
