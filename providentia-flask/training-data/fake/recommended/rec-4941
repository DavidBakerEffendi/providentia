One of the better Thai restaurants in the area.  Decor is lovely, and the service was attentive and friendly. The vegetarian duck jay curry was delicious, as was the pad thai.  The Tom Yum Khoong soup had the perfect combination of salty sour and spicy.  While the prices are maybe a dollar or two per item more expensive than other area restaurants,  the servings are large enough to share.  The sticky rice with mango was some of the best I've had.  This place is comparable to Aroma Thai and is a welcome addition to the area!  Looking forward to going back to try more dishes.
