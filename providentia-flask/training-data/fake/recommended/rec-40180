So very disappointed in this restaurant.. After seeing that it made Philly Mag's top 50 restaurant, we were excited to try this restaurant for my girlfriend's birthday dinner. But the excitement ended very quickly. Love it: ricotta ravioli - I'll give them this much, the ravioli was wonderfully fluffy and was dressed well with pickled red onions. Leave it: the service! Â It was horrendous, get ready for this rant. After we were offered 3 measly pieces of bread, I asked for more bread and the waiter said she had to check in back to see if they had enough to spare for the rest of the night. She didn't even come back with an answer! Really? you may not have enough bread?? Although the idea of an BYOB is appealing, how about the waiters offer to open the wine? or after opening the wine, offer to pour some for your guests? It took her 30 min to return with champagne flutes. As dessert was being brought out, I had to ask the waitress (from across the room) for some coffee. As I asked for my coffee, my other friend had to ask for one too. How about you walk back to the table and ask if anyone would care for some coffee? For those who did not get a cup of coffee, consider yourself lucky - instant at its finest. Overall, the atmosphere is sweet and cozy. The bathroom was disgusting and the service even worse. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. The 2nd star was only given for the wonderful ravioli appetitzer and apple tart dessert. I am officially calling in a formal complaint today. They need to work on their hospitality.
