Excellent! Food was so yummy and tasted fresh. Everything we had tasted as if it were a home cooked meal from mom's kitchen. The owners  are also really sweet and made sure we were satisfied with our meal. I usually don't like it when people keep checking up on you and asking if you need this and that every 5 minutes but it wasn't like that at Juniper. They would nonchalantly pass by look over and refill our drinks, napkins, bring over more gravy (which was a plus!) I just hope this spot doesn't become so popular and over crowded  becoming like all the other overfilled hipsterlicious dining establishments in the hood. Almost makes me want to erase my review.........
