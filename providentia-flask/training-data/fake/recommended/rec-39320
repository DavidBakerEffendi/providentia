We are huge fans of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern and are really getting into Turkish cuisine.   The restaurant looks great inside and the staff was extremely friendly, even when they were swamped at peak dinner time Friday night.   Everything we tried was fantastic.   I won't try to remember how to spell everything.  But we will be back as there was a lot we didn't get to try.
