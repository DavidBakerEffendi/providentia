Sushi was good and the service was good. Mellow atmosphere. I didn't expect this, but the Philly roll stood out for me. They also gave us a plate of complimentary sweet shrimp sushi after our appetizer which was nice! For dessert, we had the chocolate cake and the banana w/ green tea, and both were DELICIOUS.
