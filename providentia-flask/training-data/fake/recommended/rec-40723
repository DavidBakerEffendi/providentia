JB's always has never been a bad choice for any meal. The ever-changing menu always has several things that strike my fancy and I love their brunch. They are great as a live venue too, even though I hate going to shows, all the shows I've been to hear have been enjoyable, solid sound, nice space with the balcony - though as a photog, the lighting errs on the side of nearly non-existent. The coffee is pretty decent (but not in my top three!), and the servers keep the cup full. Always a good few vegetarian options. The prices are always good but I have noticed substantial portion shrinkage on some dishes in the last year. The only experience I had that left me a bit bewildered was once when the waiter was clearing my bf's french toast remains he knocked the cup of maple syrup into my lap, dousing my skirt and rather than get a fresh cloth, he started in on me with a grubby looking wet table rag with chunks of food clinging to it.Too much for me to handle before coffee had fully set it. Other than that I've not had any bad service experiences here. Always a table, never a wait. Just wish they opened a pinch earlier for weekend brunch and made the menu a little easier to read instead of having to get up and walk to it (I'm a bit near-sighted and when I'm seated, I like to stay there instead of lurking behind other diners).
