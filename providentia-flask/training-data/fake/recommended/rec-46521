Lot's of windows makes for a very comfortable space. Lot's of dark woods in the decor, so it's good to have a lot of natural light. Went with a group of 5 at lunch. Tried the Ginger Collins off of the drink menu. Very good. They were out of one beer and another keg blew on us, so that kind of sucked. We tried a few apps. None were extremely memorable except for the filet sliders, which I remember because they were very disappointing. White truffles were in season so we order 2 truffle burgers ($45 each), the Pueblo burger, the Sloppy John and the Fried chicken (cornish hen). Truffle burgers, while tasty, were disappointing at $45. The Pueblo burger was average, the Sloppy John was good, and the fried chicken was probably the best thing we ordered, but doesn't make any top 10 lists. Each came with delicious fries and some truffled mayonnaise - yum! We order a bourbon-spiked milkshake and a couple of deserts - all were pretty good. We also tried the barrel wine of the day and it was quite nice. Burger & Barrel is pretty good overall. I think my expectations were very high going in, so I'm only giving this a 6.5 out of 10. Good news is there is room for improvement....
