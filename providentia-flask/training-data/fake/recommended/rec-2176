My fiance and I went to Philly for a weekend get away. It was a MUST to try to find a good cheesesteak. The line was long (to be expected) but, the cheesesteak was amazing! Bread was great, steak was GREAT and the fries were good too. We tried Geno's as well but, it did not compare :) It was worth the wait and we will come back and have Pat's again!!!
