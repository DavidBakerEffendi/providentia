Really Yelpers? I came here expecting a bit more after seeing these reviews. $5 happy hour has a red, a white and a not-so-great sparkling wine on the list, plus 2 cocktails and beer. Had 2 appetizers. One was the seared tuna with plantain chips which was very dry. The plantain chip was thick and flavorless and did nothing for this dish. It was topped with small mango pieces which was pretty much all the flavor I'd be getting from this dish. 5 bites way overpriced for $16. Also had the grilled pizza which actually did live up to the hype. Cooked exactly right - cheese neither slightly burnt nor slightly undercooked but just right where u bite into it and it stretches forever. Mushrooms and asparagus also perfect on it. Â  Polite service.
