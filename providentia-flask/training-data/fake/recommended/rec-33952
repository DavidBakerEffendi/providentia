Drinks where excellent. Food was good Roie gras  doughnuts - different(i thought it was good, wife was not a fan). George's Steak Tartare -  the portion is generous  and flavors are very good "New Zealand" Duck Breast - very flavorful, but a bit to fatty. Service was good, waitress are very polite and helpful. The only downside it took a bit to long get food. Overall we liked the place a lot, plus the price was very decent.
