Love, love Scratch.  Another great addition to the BedStuy neighborhood... along with 'Do or Dine' and 'SUD', it's so great to finally be able to walk outside to fantastic food choices right next door. Brilliant food.  I'm always amazed at what he can do with an egg!  Perfectly prepared at a walk-up window... more sophisticated fare in a paper cup than you can get at most sit-down restaurants for 3x the price.  I do agree that sometimes there is some inconsistency in the amount you get... I think this is because the food is spooned into a crafty paper package vs. plated traditionally.  But this never really bothers me because 1.) it's very occasional, 2.) we're talking a very insignificant difference in the amount you may get one day vs. the next and  3.) the quality is always more important to me than the quantity. Hot chocolate is so sinful it will send you back to church. Best tomato soup I HAVE EVER EATEN. Every bread is fantastic... and the scones are deelish (okay, could be bigger). I go here now instead of Choice... food is fresher, more interesting, and the staff is really cheerful and happy to see you. I could go on and on... this place really rocks it. Rumors they might expand soon... I hope it's true!
