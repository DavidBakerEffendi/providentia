Frankford Hall is such a great space to just chill and enjoy a glass of beer. Well, who are we kidding, you'll probably enjoy more than just a glass. The place has a foozball table, fire pit, ping pong table, more Jenga than you've ever seen in your life. Yeah, it's probably hard to access the ping pong table and foozball since there's only one of each, but it's nice that they have it. I'm not a beer expert so I won't get into the specifics about what they have and how great it is (or not). But this place is certainly deserving of 5 stars for the awesome space. P.S. Their fries are really good!
