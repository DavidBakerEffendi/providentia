Corner Bistro has long been by many the sure-fire, knee-jerk answer to the age-old question - "What is the best burger in the city?" As with all things of opinion, this too is debatable. What's not up for debate is its status as a New York City Institution. It's old-school charm is apparent from the first moment you step inside. Corner Bistro doesn't mess around - it's essentially a dive bar with no more than a handful of options on the menu, cooked to order, priced to afford, no frills, done and done. The scene may be a little intimidating to tourists, but it shouldn't be, and honestly, I'm not too concerned about this anyway. If you just want to check out the most talked-about burger in the city, my advice would be to go during lunch. The booths in the back can be hard to come by later in the day, so you may need to play the waiting game. Now, as for the burger... my first bite immediately transported me to my parents' backyard, my father grilling perfectly juicy patties on the patio. To me, this burger tastes of nostalgia - and anything that feels homemade is certainly a positive thing. But, ironically so, I think New York has messed with my tastebuds since said barbecues, because, and I hate to say it, but I think I prefer fancier fare. While its certainly well above average, I can't confidently say this is the best burger in town. It's greasy, meaty, juicy, and altogether satisfying, but just as I can justify that, yes, this is a really good burger, I can say this about other select joints just the same. We should be so lucky to have so many great options for the classic American cheeseburger in The Big Apple. If Corner Bistro is the best burger you've ever had, all the power to you. It's not my number one, but it's up there and deserves all the praise it receives. You certainly can't find a burger this good elsewhere at its price, and really, I think that's the point. Alas, the debate rolls on....
