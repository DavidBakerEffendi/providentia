I'm taking a taxi ride down to Tribeca yesterday afternoon, and my cabbie, a gracious Sikh fellow and I get to talking about India and Sri Lanka, usual small talk. He offers to stop and by me some chai at his favorite spot, this place, so we pull over and he comes back (while I wait) with two steaming cups. Haven't had this great a chai in some time, it's old school with heavy cream, 2 lumps of sugar, spiced just right. Sukhwinder (the cabbie and I are now best buds at this point) tells me that for breakfast, lunch, dinner, just a snack, this place is all that and a bag of samosas.
