This restaurant had it's good and bad moments. I went on a Saturday night. Not alot of action which isn't bad. The bruscetta they bring out to start off is pretty decent. The bread they brought out was cold. I ordered the Shrimp scampi which comes with tons of food. A salad to start which was huge and pretty good! The entree was awesome and it came with a side of mashed potatoes which is strange but considering it was delicious I forgave the strangeness. My boyfriend had the Grilled Ribeye Steak Aqua which was amazing! So after the awesome meal I was thinking Tiramisu was going to be good but I hated it. It's more like a cake and it's dry and not creamy. So a quick recap, wasn't happy with the bread or the dessert but the entree and sides were delicious and the helpings were huge and that I think is the most important part. The best part of dinner should be the dinner itself even if the other aspects fall flat. Quick tip: Print out the yelp deals before you go if you have one because when I showed the waittress the app on my phone she had to get the owner and they had no clue what to do with it. They still honored but it took them a while to sort out the bill.
