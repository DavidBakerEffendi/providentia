I had tickets to the Philadelphia Orchestra on 10/20/12. Since Knock is only 4-5 blocks from Verizon Hall, I decided to try Yelp. This was my first time to visit Knock, and I could not have been more pleased. First, the food was quite good (all -- the entree, the sides, and the dessert), the service was consistently attentive without suffocating, and the atmosphere was pleasant. The best rating I can give is to say that I will definitely return.
