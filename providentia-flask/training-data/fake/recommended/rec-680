This place is fantastic! I went here for Valentine's Day with my boyfriend and his family. It was such a fun, cozy atmosphere, the waiters were great, and the food was AMAZING! My favorite dish was the phyllo dough pastry, filled with chicken and topped with powdered sugar (I'm sure there were more ingredients in the making of this dish, but I just don't know what they are). It sounds really weird, but it was super delicious! We ended up being seated at a table with another couple because the place is actually pretty small, but that wasn't weird. The entire atmosphere was very friendly and all the tables were very close to each other. We were lucky that it happened to be a Friday night because there was a belly dancer there! She encouraged us to get up and dance with her, which was really fun and made us all laugh. Like all the reviews say, be prepared to stuff yourself! They give you more food than anyone can handle! But it's all amazing, so you can't say no. The restaurant is also BYOB, which is a great plus! The only down side is that it's cash-only, and the bill can get quite high if you have a large group (It was a bit under $50 per person).
