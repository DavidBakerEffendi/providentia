LOVE, LOVE, LOOOOOVE this place. One of my favorite sushi places by far. I don't know if it's the price, the ambiance, the BYOB, or the fact that they offer all you can eat sushi, including specialty rolls. I guess all of the above. Great place for a date night or with a group of friends. Bring a bottle of wine and your favorite sushi-fan friends and make a night of it. Will continue to go back. Only problem is their sushi is so tasty, it makes me want it ALL the time. Service is a little iffy, very rushed staff and a little impolite at times, but all in all they are usually a pretty busy place so I expect it. Expect a bit of a wait in between sushi orders if you do the all you can eat, and whatever you do... GO THERE HUNGRY! :)
