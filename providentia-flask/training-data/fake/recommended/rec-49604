So good, so yummy, so creative.  Vegan!  Wonderful!  The staff is awesome-super nice- it is small but roomy enough inside (you may have to share a table).  I have not had anything there that wasn't amazing.  I like the combo choices and I also like that they have things packed up and ready to go if you just want to run in and out.  Super fresh ingrediants and good for you!
