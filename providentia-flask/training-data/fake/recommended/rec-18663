This place proved to be much better in the alcohol dept than food. I shared about 4 different dishes with someone and they all were extremely mediocre on quality and flavoring, not to mention luke-warm. I mean, they put out pieces of salami rind on our charcuterie plate, and the bread that came with it was obviously old. Beware- you can eat the tortellini appetizer in four bites. An 80 bill was annoying to say the least.. I liked the atmosphere and if your a beer lover there are plenty of options -- but id skip dinner here unless your extremely hungry.
