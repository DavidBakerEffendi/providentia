Not enamored with this place. Tofu scramble (a breakfast menu item) has no scramble-no egg at all. Just a huge plate of tofu. Frittata just ok. Needs more spice. Tomato juice was fermented. They did crack open a new container of it, but still-check expiration date guys. All in all for $12 per dish, really just aww'right. I recommend looking elsewhere for better deliciousness.
