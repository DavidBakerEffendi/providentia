I came for the eggs florentine and stayed for the cute waitstaff dressed in bow ties. Pretty straightforward place as far as brunch goes. Atmosphere is good, prices are fair. As I recall, they don't do any substitutions- however they did swap out my home fries for their delicious french fries. Sorry to all you home fry lovers, but they just don't do it for me. Give me deep fried or give me death!!! (You can put that on my tombstone) RIP. Death by fry.
