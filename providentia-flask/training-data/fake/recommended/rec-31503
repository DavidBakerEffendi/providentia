very disappointed with my dine-in experience. went for dinner last weekend, there was only one other table in the restaurant, all kids working behind the counter. everything that we ordered besides the pizza was cold, i don't understand how that was possible because i saw the food go up for the waitress to serve & she served it immediately. i've never had cold wings or fries before or a cold cheesesteak for that matter. the waitress was great, but this time i have to say the food was not. i will order pizza for take-out but thats about it
