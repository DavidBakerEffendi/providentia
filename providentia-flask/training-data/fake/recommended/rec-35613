1st time to the famed burger joint. Had the smoke shack and fries. Fries were ok, burger was very good. The smokey sauce plus the slightly sweet, slightly spicy cherry peppers made the burger. Looking forward to a return visit to try with the "concrete". Didn't realize they had a liquor license, good to know for next visit.
