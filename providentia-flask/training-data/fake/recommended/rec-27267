Being from So Cal, searching for good mexican food in NY is a tough feat but I have to say, Barrio Chino is as good as it gets!  The guacamole is full of flavor and paired with the freshly made chips, it's one of the best guacamoles that I have had.  I also had a simple carne asada taco...and they hit that on the mark.  By adding some refreshing options to the menu, you can't really go wrong here. Oh yeah...the spicy margaritas are delicious too!
