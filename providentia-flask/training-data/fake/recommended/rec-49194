Breakfast was so good, I went two days in a row! They bring a French press to your table when you order coffee. Get the large, you'll want more than one cup. I ordered the avocado toast with eggs over easy. It was a lot of food, but filled me up for the entire day. Â The combination of flavors and textures was delish. The servers are friendly, and atmosphere was perfect for reading the paper while taking mindless sips of coffee.
