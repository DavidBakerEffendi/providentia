UNBELIEVABLY, DISGUSTINGLY SHOCKING BEHAVIOR BY OWNER, PLEASE NEVER COME HERE.. - almost choked on a piece of metal foil in my wine, took it to waitress and man behind bar (turned out to be the owner) as they attempted to sort out my cheque they double charged me to my credit card, then offered a measly $8 refund for the terrible mistake. Long arguement short, French owner told me I planned it from the start and put the foil in myself, also told me "i must have problems in my personal life" and then in his embarrassing state of rage, as i faced him calmy asking for a refund, yelled at me to "FUCK OFF" twice infront of a bar full of patrons, all over an $18 pitcher of Savigion Blanc. Â 15 People proceeded to leave afterwards in embarrassment over the owners raised voice and lack of ANY compassion or business nous to offer a calm customer a refund - when I had almost choked on a piece of metal (IN AMERICA) and politely asked for a refund. Really, really, unforgettable and unforgiveable, digusting experience and cant believe me and my girlfriend were disrespected like that. I will never visit this place again and hope you dont support this type of customer service ever. New York is too great to deal with this trash, this guy should lose his liscence.
