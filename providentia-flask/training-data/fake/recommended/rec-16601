It's good, but after all, it's meatballs. Supe crowded and people were fighting for seats.   I had classic beef with spicy meat sauce and risotto.  Meatball is meatball.  It is okay.  Sauce was tasty, but pretty oily, and not a lot of sauce for the dry balls.  Risotto was good for the price considering the portion. Overall, cheap food for tiny little above average quality.  Good ambience.
