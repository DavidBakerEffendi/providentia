I only comment on restaurants I go back to. Very solid cooking here, reasonable prices, and BYOB. A trifecta. Sweet people too. Especially love the crab-corn chowder. Does get crowded, but their bar on the corner is a great place to wait, and they'll call you. Typically, dinner for two runs us $60-$70 plus tax and tip for a shared appetizer, two entrees and one dessert.
