I love Peaches restaurant and decided to try to the HotHouse with my younger cousin. I ordered the fried chicken (since it seemed like their specialty) with side orders of kale and mac n cheese. The best part of the meal was the mac n cheese. The kale was way to salty and tasted over seasoned. The fried chicken was okay, did not like the seasoning they put on top of it and it kept getting in my nose lol. My cousin ordered the ribs, hers was okay but didn't have enough sauce for her and requested bbq sauce on the side. Overall, it is okay. The atmosphere is nice but the restaurant is very small. I would go again if I am in the area.
