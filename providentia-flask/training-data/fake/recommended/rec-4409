Give a vegetarian meat and still get a four-star rating...say whaaaa? Like people said before, this place didn't look like anything special from the outside, but the atmosphere is chill, not too bright, and they play fun alternative-y music. (You know, like they had the 90s?)  Anyway, for the record, I'm not vegan. I would be a better person if I were vegan, but I'm ridiculously addicted to cheese, and anything cheeseless usually seems like it's lacking something to me. Not so with the Vegan Volcano. This wrap was AMAZING. (tofu with homemade black bean hummus, zucchini, carrots, sautéed onions, broccoli, lettuce & tomato). If you're trying to be healthier, or if you just want a great sandwich, eat this. The drinks are also shockingly strong, which is way too hard to find around here. I was buzzed with just one vodka 'n cranberry! (full disclosure- I had two :) Anyway, so happy with my experience, I ordered quesadillas to go for my boyfriend ("just cheese"), and somehow the same bartender thought that the chick ordering vegan food was now ordering meat, or the kitchen got confused, since we got home to find that the chickens had come home to roost, quite literally. After a long day, this really sucked, since it didn't seem worth it to go back, but fortunately we were able to pawn them off on his brother. So yeah, they screwed up my order, but the relaxed atmosphere, crazy strong drinks and awesome vegan-deliciousness saved the day.
