I came here with my sisters on a Monday night. We were told the wait would be around 20 minutes but got seated in less than 10 minutes. I guess we came at a good time?? I was really excited to try this burger as I have heard so much about this place. I ordered the Original Burger (asked for mine medium) and my sisters had the Truffle Burger and the Truffle Speciale Burger. I can't really speak to my sisters' burgers but mine was okay. The burger was smaller than I expected but a pretty good size for me (considering we had other starters to share). I think the consensus at the table was that these burgers were very greasy. Overall, I don't think it was anything spectacular... I don't know that I would wait in such a long line to eat this burger (as all of my other friends have). That being said, the burgers were "GOOD" and I will definitely give the other burgers a go... perhaps I should ask for the "Trust Us Combo" next time to see what they recommend. The other sides we had were the Fried Pickles, Smushed Potatoes and Truffle Fries. I'd say the Truffle Fries were really good and the Fried Pickles were surprisingly delicious... the Smushed Potatoes were nothing special, they are your average potatoes.
