Great spot that we hit up instead of Buttermilk Chanel because we wanted to stay a bit more healthy. We failed at being healthy but the food was awesome. We got the lamb ribs and the shrimp étouffée.  So tasty. Because the restaurant was empty (or they thought we were famous?) they threw us the pastry sampler and wow that Oreo bread was awesome. All in all a great experience that would have been better had there been more people in the restaurant for brunch. I'm here to scream this...add Dover to your brunch rotation!  Or just give it a shot.
