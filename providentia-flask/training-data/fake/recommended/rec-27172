This place would probably earn closer to 3.5 stars than a flat 3 rating from me, but the wait for brunch (like every other place in NYC) was crazy Â (1+ hour)...and cramped inside. Service was nice enough, and food was good, complimentary drink was overly sweet with barely a hint of alcohol. Not necessarily worth the wait, but if you're lucky enough to snag a table, go for it.
