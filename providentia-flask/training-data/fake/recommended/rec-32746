Popped over here between sets at Toads for a few slices. Mushroom was good. I liked the crust. It's not super thick. Yes, the slices were greasy but they definitely hit the spot. I realize my review would probably be different if I spent more than 5 min there. However for what I was looking for, Yorkside hit the spot.
