Grew up on Hoagie Haven, if you live in the area, you can't not love it. I always get the veggie. It is super loaded with all the cheeses, they never skimp on the veggies. Just the right amount of o&v. I have had some of the other sandwiches and they are great too but this is my favorite! Whenever I am back in the jerz, I find my way back to HH!
