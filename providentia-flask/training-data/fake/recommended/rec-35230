Worst Service. I went there with two of my friends. The waiters did not offer us water and we had to ask for water ourselves. Next, they mixed up our order twice. Afterwards, we gave them 15% tip and left. When were going to leave, a waiter chased us out the door and demanded more tip. We gave them two more dollars and they did not even thank us. AIN'T NOBODY GOT THAT TIME FOR THAT!
