How do you make a vegan BLT?   Come here and try the smoked coconut club.  Full disclosure: Im a carnivore.  When I heard about this unique sandwich, I had to experience it for myself.   Deep fry slabs of tofu to get as much water and moisture out and then marinate it with some olive oil and other flavorful sauces.  Smoke pieces of fresh coconut for a crispy texture that is also darkened to resemble bacon (sans the fat).  Throw it between toasted bread with some lettuce and tomato and TA-DA: a vegan BLT.  Delicious.  It was enough to convince the carnivore in me to try its other inventive vegan dishes.
