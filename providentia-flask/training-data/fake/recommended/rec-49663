I hated this place. The setup was cool but that's about it. There are leather couches but Mike and his buddies just hog them all up watching the NASCAR race packin lips and drinking bush light. Also, someone released 1000 Mosquitos in there, I guess to make it more like Miami. Service= garbage. The waitress had no emotions. Once we got our food idk if she even looked at us. She was too busy chatting about dudes from last night with her coworkers. I was pissed when she didn't change the stupid NASCAR race that was on every tv. We wanted to watch Kyle synder kill it in the rodeo ha. Food=garbage. Nacho cheese wasn't even melted. Burger was like raw and disgusting. Wings were dry and the blue cheese looked and tasted like mayo. Couldn't eat it. To top it all off mike is like hitler. It looks like Jim b posted a picture with proof (see above). Someone needs to call john taffer from bar rescue to come save this sorry excuse for a business.
