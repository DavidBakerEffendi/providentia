I've mentioned before that I can't really differentiate between good sushi and great sushi; good sushi vs bad sushi is an EASY distinction, but good vs great is a little harder to discern. That said, Zento had good sushi. We were here for Restaurant Week last night, and after a reservation snafu with another restaurant, (*cough* thanks a LOT, B....) we were able to find a seat at Zento. The place is pretty small, so seating is kind of crammed in every nook and cranny. Our particular seat was straight back against the back wall, DIRECTLY across from the air conditioner. It was FREEZING. The ac blew so hard, it blew our candle out on our table. And speaking of that candle, you absolutely need that thing. Zento is like a cave inside. Its very dark. The upside is that the service was very, very good. Everyone was polite and personable. The restaurant week menu was decent, and we were able to get full, although I felt that we didn't eat $100 dollars worth of food, which was our total bill. I wouldn't mind a return trip, but there are many, MANY comparable options closer, cheaper and that don't force you to deal with infuriating Philly parking. Oh, check in on the Yelp app and you get 1 free validated parking.
