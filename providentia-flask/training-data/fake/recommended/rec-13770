one of the best breakfast places ive had so far! i went on a saturday morning so there was quite a wait about 40 minutes but definitely worth the wait! i had the egg dish with the cheese and avocado and my friend had the blueberry pancakes with a side order of biscuit..so delicious! the pancakes were hands down amazing! the biscuit with the homemade fruit compote was really good too! the egg dish was good but not as great as the pancakes! overall a place to try but be ready to wait!
