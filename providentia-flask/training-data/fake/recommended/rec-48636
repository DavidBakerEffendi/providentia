I've been going to JB's for shows and food for several months now and I have to say I'm more in love with this place for food and people watching than the music. I don't know what it is about Philly music venues, but the sound systems are horrible (it couldn't possibly be me! wink wink) most places you go, so for that JB's is on par. The specials are usually special indeed. The staff are all pretty easy going with few exceptions. And if you are like me you'll love just checking out the patrons.
