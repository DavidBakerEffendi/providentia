After my first visit here, I was hoping it wasn't a fluke how much I liked the food and ambiance here.  It wasn't a fluke.  This place is really delicious and overall very enjoyable.  Both times we were with a group of 8 or more and the service was awesome.  I've tried the green curry, which I'm always a sucker for at Thai places, and the pad thai with crab.  The curry was scrumptious and had some good heat behind it.  They let you choose how hot you want it and they seemed to get it just right.  The crab pad thai was pretty good too.  The portion is very large so it would be good to share and packs some pretty solid flavor in each bite.  This place is one of the best Thai restaurants I've found in Philly and is always a great choice for our friend's bday dinners.
