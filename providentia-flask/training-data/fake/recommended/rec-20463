DO NOT GET TAKEOUT, GET DELIVERY! IF YOU GET TAKEOUT THEY WILL FORGET YOU, GUARANTEED, EVEN IF YOU ARE STANDING RIGHT THERE. THEY WILL SET YOUR STUFF DOWN RIGHT NEXT TO YOU THEN STAND AROUND TILL YOU ASK THEM "UM, EXCUSE ME, IS THAT MY STUFF?"!!!!!!! Okay, now that's out of the way (sorry, it happened exactly the same way twice)! Get delivery, they are mad fast and it's just as good as eating there, particularly as it's kinda stuffy inside. CHEAP! GOOOD! That is what you will think while you are shoveling the massive tupperware of curry with tons of chicken and the equally sized sticky rice into your suddenly voracious craw. Skip the appetizers, they're all honestly a bit greasygross and the curry is gonna be enough food to put down a horse. And it's like $7.50. Wow.
