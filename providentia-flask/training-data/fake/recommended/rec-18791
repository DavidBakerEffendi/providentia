So glad the truck stopped by the flatiron for lunch today ! LARGE portions for CHEAP prices, BIG taste, FRIENDLY service - what more can you ask for? I got the tofu something (#16 on menu) which was comparable to a red curry. For a full styrofoam container, they charged less than $6. Also got me a cambodian iced tea which is like a thai iced tea (not sure if there's actually a difference) for an extra $2. Iced tea was rich and not watered down like so many thai places these days... While looking the truck up online, I found a cute article on the couple that runs the truck: newyork.cbslocal.com/201â€¦ This truck totally made my day. I have to say tho, I probably love it a lot more bc it reminds me of the food trucks at cmu. :)
