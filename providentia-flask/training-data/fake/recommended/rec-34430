I originally stopped by out of curiosity. The treat I was in for was better than I could have hoped for. The Bagel Place is a true neighborhood gem. The customer service I experience when I go there is some of the best you will find in the area. They remember you and work on making your bagel like its a piece of art. The ambiance is welcoming, inviting, and contemporary. They feature a plethora of beverage choices and their bagels and cream cheeses are a little piece of heaven. Forget breakfast at McDonalds or Dunkin Donuts and head on over to the Bagel Place. You won't regret it!
