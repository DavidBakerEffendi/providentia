People who go to City Fish Market expect  certain level of quality from the seafood on offer.  Having been a loyal customer long before they opened their dining area, my family and I are never disappointed in the quality of food on offer and the service as well.   The second you walk in, you're greeted by someone, either from the fresh seafood department or the cooked food area.  The place smells of delicious cooking seafood!  Don't be put off by the lines, because the move quick!   This particular trips, my mom and I both ordered the shrimp basket, which comes with 10 large shrimp and loads of crinkle fries.  My dad ordered the fried oyster basket with "an extra piece", meaning one piece of fried fish along with his oysters.  He was plenty happy with his oysters, which were apparently larger than the ones he had gotten a few days before at another restaurant! All in all, our experiences here are always amazing and the food is delicious!  If you haven't gone to City Fish Market, make the effort and get some delicious fresh seafood!!
