$3 glasses of wine during happy hour!  Hurrah! And not the kind of lame-to-average wine one might expect for only $3 -- actual good, tasty wine!  Had we been hungry, we would have ordered something to eat, but, as it stood, we just needed some drinks. PS: Make sure to check out the library ladder on the wall of wine.  Awesome.
