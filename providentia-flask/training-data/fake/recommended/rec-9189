Amazing.  The bone marrow and oxtail marmelade is a worthy experience on it's own.  Pair that with Beef carpaccio that melts in your mouth and fried oysters served in shell on a bed of cream spinach and I will definitely be back.  Wait staff is extremely attentive as well and make you feel at ease.
