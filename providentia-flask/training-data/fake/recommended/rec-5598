Strawberry Lemonade was bang-ing, might be my new favorite. Sangria was a little boring and basically I should have ordered another lemonade haha. Overall, I think this place is super cool. Love the layout and there's plenty of space. Cool spot to hang out after work for drinks/appetizers or for something more intimate/cool to get to know each other better (wink). Waitstaff were quick and effective. Smokin!
