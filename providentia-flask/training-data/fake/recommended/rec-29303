as part of my road trip, i wanted to try a philly cheese steak i had mine with hot peppers and it was DELICIOUS, i ate the entire foot long in one sitting, no leftovers! my dining pal, had a chicken cheese steak with hot peppers, which was not as good they are CASH only there is ample street parking there is NO bathroom. the food was prepared quick and staff were very friendly! try it out!
