She said: I love this place. This is my second time dining at Lupa for lunch and there will definitely be a third, and a fourth, and many more. We started with the calamari appetizer which was light and delicious. I ordered the Bucatini alla Amatriciana. The pasta was al dente and chewy and the flavor was just right. The little pieces of meat were a nice little surprise. My favorite dish was dessert. Lupa's Tartufo is a must-try, it was hazelnut perfection. He said: When coming to an Italian restaurant it's pretty much mandatory pasta ordering. I went with the Spaghetti Alla Carbonara, a solid dish that had a wonderful balance of flavors. Just the right amount of saltiness complemented by the sweet flecks of meat. The noodles were al dente to perfection: firm but not crunchy, chewy but not mushy.  Definitely have paid much more at restaurants like Babbo and Del Posto that didn't even come close.  Do yourself a favor if you want a solid meal for a decent price and visit Lupa.
