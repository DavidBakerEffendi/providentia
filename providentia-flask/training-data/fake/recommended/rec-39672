A good happy hour place that isn't filled with the fresh out of college frat/sorority types. The place wasn't overly crowded, had a good mix of different types of people. The service could have been a little better considering the place wasn't that packed. As a 30-something looking for a place that is a little more mature and doesn't do too much damage to my wallet I am glad I found this place.
