I've only had the fish burrito, shrimp burrito, and guacamole, but they've all been delicious. I've gotten delivery a number of times and it's always hot and tasty. I also love the mini accoutrements with which they come. QCEP burritos rival only those from Pura Vida and Loco Pez, my other favorite Mexican places.
