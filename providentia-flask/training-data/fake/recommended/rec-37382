We have been to Koto about a dozen times total it this is my first review. A the beginning it was off the charts good! Clean, fun, entertaining and such awesome food! It's an expensive resturaunts, but we never used to mind. The more times we go, we see they have nothing really new to offer.....the habachi chefs do pretty much the same routine every single time. Lately, the business seems to be taking a turn for the worst, looking more run down, the floors were kinda sticky and the service really lacking. Our last waiter messed up our order, and was arguing with the other staff in Japanese. Not friendly like in the past. When they are on, it's an amazing meal, great rice or noodles with tasty terriaki steak, chicken, lobster, whatever you want. It used to be the food was all ready at the same time and amazing. Now...it's a long waiting experience coarse by coarse. Again, 3 years ago it was 5+ stars, now like 1 or 2 I hope they can turn it around.
