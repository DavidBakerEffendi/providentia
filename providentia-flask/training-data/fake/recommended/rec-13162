The second I saw the huge line I knew I needed to get on it and try whatever it was that Tommy DiNic's was selling. Stood in line for about half an hour on a Saturday afternoon at 1PM and it was so very worth it. I got the Roast Pork with Sharp Provolone and it was delicious. Never had such tender pork with the perfect seasoning. Craving it as I am writing this review! Tip: If you see a seat at the counter open up, grab it. Anyone on line, whether you are in the front or the back can grab the empty seats and you get served first!
