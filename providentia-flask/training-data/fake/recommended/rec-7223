I've worked in North Arlington for about a year and a half now. I've noticed this spot a few times driving on Ridge Rd, and I decided to give them a chance. Oh boy, I'm glad I did... Let's just say they had me a macchiato... I consider myself a bit of a coffee aficionado. When I asked for a macchiato, i was told not to expect the Starbucks version, expect a real macchiato: expresso with milk foam.. My goosness!! So good!! I wanted some breakfast, and was craving something heavy-ish, so I had the French Toast with berries... Again, another perfectly made meal.. I was there rather early, looks like the person attending me (possibly the owner) was rather attentive, making sure I had everything I needed. She gave me some take home menus for my office and added my office on a fax list for daily specials. With Â that said, I will be returning for sure. I'll make sure to write a follow-up review..
