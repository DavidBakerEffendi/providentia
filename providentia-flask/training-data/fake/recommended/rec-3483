Not really sure what the big fuss is over this place. Waited 2 hours, which is fine, but there are constantly a ton of open tables. I think they make you wait longer so you stay and drink more, especially considering pizza takes maybe 10 minutes to make. The food also wasn't anything great. Sure, it's pretty good pizza, but not enough to make everything else worth it. This is another one of those places I'm happy I tried, but won't be returning.
