My Boyfriend and I decided to go to Max Brenner for Valentine's day dessert. I knew it would be crowded so I made a reservation weeks before. We arrived 5 minutes before our reservation time expecting to be seated. We were then told that there was a wait of 15 minutes. We were both a little disappointed at having made a reservation and then been told that there was an additional wait, but understood as it was Valentine's day and the restaurant  was packed. We waited our assigned 15 minutes but when a couple that had arrived after us were seated we were a little worried. My boyfriend then asked the hostess how long our wait would be and she seemed alarmed that we hadn't been seated yet and gave us a table immediately. Besides the wait our service was excellent.  And our poor over-worked waiter made us feel like we were the only table he was assigned that night. While we were a bit disappointed by the wait I would absolutely recommend Max Brenner to a friend looking for a great chocolate experience.
