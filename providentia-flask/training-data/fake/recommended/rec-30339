Great space, bar area very sexy but main dining room has too much "wood" and not in a good way but in a slightly dated way. However, the food and drinks were wonderful, service was good. The hummus was delicious, shrimp salad lacked a good balance point from the spicy shrimp to the bland lettuce....lots of lettuce. Can't remember the name of my entr√©e but it was delicious.
