Went there about a week ago on a Friday.  The place was very nice.  Glad to have something like this in Hartford.  I was not too impressed with the late menu selection,  which was limited.  Crowd seem nice,  a little older than usual but it was a more diverse crowd than other places which I liked. I will definitely be come back to this place.  Nice addition to the front St area.
