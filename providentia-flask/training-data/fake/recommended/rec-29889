A great find on the east side for dinner, if you like tapas-style small plates. We ate in the intimate downstairs bar area - I did not venture upstairs. The service was excellent and the turkish food was good throughout. Dishes worth calling out are the Turkish Beef Dumplings (a bowl of tiny dumplings in a light yoghurt source) and the warm semolina dessert. Good selection of wines by the glass too.
