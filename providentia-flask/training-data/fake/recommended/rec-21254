One of the best brunch places in NYC! Amazing toffee glazed brioche bun! Although their thick cut bacon is nothing close to the one I had at Peter Luger and their porchetta is a little on the dry side(I'd prefer Porchetta's version) , their prosciutto was ok and the Malfatti Al Maialino was just delicious! I can't wait to try their dinner menu.
