I came here on a recommendation of a family member who swore this was superior to Grimaldi's. After having the Margherita pizza and pepperoni pizza I must say- this is the best pizza ever! I actually left this place with a food high which is only the third time that has happened in my life. Make sure to have your pizza with some wine as this is gourmet pizza. If you happen to be in the area, you owe it to yourself and your partner to try this place out.
