Tiny and tasty!! This restaurant is small. Like tiny and tight. So don't go with a big group. By some miracle my friend Erika magically made a reservation for 8 people on a Sat night, so she's a miracle worker. But we had to wait outside until the table was empty empty b/c there was no room to wait inside. It was worth it. Great authentic mexican food! Homemade salsas and chips are unlike any other. Great margaritas. I had the enchiladas verdes and they were amazing! Lots of our table got the tacos and the plates were wiped clean. The enchiladas moles were also amazingly good! Definitely worth a trip to the LES.
