After waiting 5 minutes with no one to seat me I sat myself, no brewed tea only bags BOO! Very nice authentic Thai decor with w/ soft oriental music in the background with water falls surrounding really bringing the zen home. The servers were absolutely clueless when I asked for tom yum soup 2 staff member had to check w/ the kitchen but that's the lunch crew for ya. They rate they're spiciness of food from 1 to 5 so they ask you what level you'd like I said 3 in retrospect I should have went with 5 but a side of freshly chopped Chili Peppers were made available to add the extra vavoom that I love.   The soup was really good with all the wonderful ingredients including the jumbo shrimp that I love along w/ the added chili peppers had the nose running.  The seafood Pad Thai was very unique, they had a combination of shrimp, squid a muscle along with the traditional noodles and a  small amount of sauce ( I'm a heavy sauce glutten) to really make me want to come back and try something else of the menu. The servers were very attentive did their very best to make sure that I had plenty of water and well taken care of. I would definitely venture back to check this place out and perhaps raise my rating.
