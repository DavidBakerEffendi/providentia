Could not have liked this place less.  But lets start with the good thing!  The decor is neat.  Now the bad things!   The service was comically lousy -- whether it was serving lukewarm fried yuca; replacing said lukewarm yuca with more lukewarm fried yuca after the first batch was sent back to the kitchen; taking 45 minutes to deliver the first glass of wine; forgetting entirely about the second glass of wine; or spilling beer on my friends jacket, and not bothering to notice the spillage. The food itself was unimpressive, though that might have been a product of it having been served lukewarm.  Really though, probably not.  I got the tuna ceviche and fried yuca.  The yuca actually wasn't bad, though as mentioned, it was lukewarm and a little greasier even than fried yuca typically is.  The ceviche started out being pretty good, but pretty soon tasted like nothing but the soy sauce and sesame oil it was floating in.  My dinner companions' comments on their food ranged from "This is gross" to "This is lukewarm."   Let's get back to the service!  At one point, all waiters disappeared from our area for about half an hour.  This helped to turn what should have been an utterly mediocre 1.5 hour meal into an utterly mediocre 3.0 meal.   Yuck.  Just avoid.
