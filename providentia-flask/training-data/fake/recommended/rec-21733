Despite all these reviews I didn't have crazy expectations.. But when the bread is stale, the mussels not too fresh, the wine tasting like box wine, and the food took a whole hour and a half to arrive, it's hard not to be disappointed! I do admit, the place is gorgeous! We sat in the garden area and it was extremely charming, perfect lighting, and the seating very comfortable! If I were to rate the setting alone I will give it a 5 stars hands down! But the food and the service were waayy too bad to go back to the restaurant! Yes we were a large group.. 7 of us.. And maybe since the tip was included already the waiters didn't care but there is no excuse for the bad food and wine!
