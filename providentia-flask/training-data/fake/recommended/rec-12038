As far as pizzerias go, Casa Mia is 5 stars.  In a town full of Italians, a Spanish guy does Italian food best.  Pizza is full of flavor, sauce is slightly sweet.  Best pizza in the area and I've had them all.  Order a pie with chicken cutlet and bacon on top and prepare yourself for heaven.  Buffalo chicken wrap is great as is the chicken with salad and side of pasta.  Buffalo chicken pizza has huge juicy chunks of chicken.  Staff is all super nice and they are a really nice family.
