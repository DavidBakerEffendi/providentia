Family and I ordered three different sandwiches today, and we all had the same reaction - wow!  Great place for lunch in Philly.  All three sandwiches were served on delicious Italian bread - perfectly fresh, soft to the bite, and well, amazing.  The Pieta Pastrami sandwich had a very generous portion of very lean pastrami combined with an interesting mix of dill pickles and onions.  I normally wouldn't order dill pickles, but I wanted to taste the sandwich as prepared, and I really liked it.  The Italian Stallion was very tasty - fresh, high quality, delicious meats and cheese.  Definitely worth ordering.  Uncle Guy's Turkey was absolutely delicious as well - Thanksgiving quality turkey  with a generous portion of pancetta, perfectly dressed with garlic aioli, tomato, and arugula,  The combination of flavors made this sandwich our favorite for the day!  The staff and owners were all friendly and helpful.  I can't wait to return - there are several other sandwich offerings I want to try out.
