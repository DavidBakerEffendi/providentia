One of my neighborhood haunts.   Happened upon Jack approximately 9 months ago when I moved into the neighborhood.  As cliche as can be, it was love at first bite.   Must have's - - Mac n Cheese - hands down.  The smokey-ness of the gouda and stringy-ness of the fontina make this one of the best mac's in NYC. Although, I wish they gave you a bit more...good breadcrumb distribution on top as well. -Smoked Trout Salad - even for someone who doesnt love "fishy fish" - this is damn good - nice balance of sweet and salty - combo of textures and bite is fantastic.  And I did not find one piece of that lame leaf they call "Frisee" (throat hairball) in there at all.  A+. -PEI Mussels - Oh gawd how I love this dish with the crispy garlic bread for sopping up the mussel juice. -Any drink bartender Jay is making.  I like the dark stuff (yumm, Bourbon) so I enjoy the relatively new addition the Buffalo Rifle. They also make a damn good Old Fashioned and Vieux Carre.  Don Draper, anyone? Right. In a neighborhood (Brooklyn Heights) in which legtimately "Good for NYC!" restaurants are quite scarce, this one's a major win. Great atmosphere - they know me in there by now, so I am always greeted by the manager, hostess, bartender(s) and servers.  It just feels like home.   Be sure to make a reservation on a weekend! You will have to wait to even sit at the bar.  It's just that good.
