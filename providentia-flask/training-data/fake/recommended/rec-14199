another yelp success story. thanks to the 200+ reviews on perilla and the yelp recommendations. our party of 4 opted to try the favorite duck meatballs appetizer. the meat was so tender that it practically melted in my mouth! my mom and split the arugula and red romaine lettuce salad with fava beans. i love anything with fava beans! the special fish of the day was the grilled halibut and it was prepared perfectly. i had the natural spring chicken and again the meat was tender and moist. for dessert we had the warm chocolate tart. it was good but i've had better chocolate desserts. next time, i would probably try the doughnuts/beignets instead.
