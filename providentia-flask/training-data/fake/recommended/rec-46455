This was on my list of restaurants to visit after reading all the fabulous reviews on here and ToNY. I have to say, I agree with most of you - the meatballs are delicious! I had the chicken meatballs w/focaccia, my bf had the beef meatballs (he liked the beef better) - both were with their classic red sauce. We ordered the side salad as well which added a nice balance to the meal & somehow made me feel better for eating a bunch of meatballs and bread :) I'll comment on my chicken meatballs since I didn't taste the beef: the consistency was perfect & crumbled in my mouth as I took each bite. I wish I had ordered a sandwich or larger entree (I chose from the first bucket of options) because my meal came with 4 meatballs and only 1 sliver of bread; i definitely could've used 2 or 3 more pieces to eat with my meatballs. The classic sauce was also a very nice compliment to the meatballs - not too sour or sweet or salty or spicy (my bf said he could have used a little more salt, but that's just him). I wonder now if it would have been possible to get a little extra on the side for dipping... I had a glass of sangria which was surprisingly tasty (i find sangria is usually hit or miss at restaurants that don't really specialize in making the beverage, but it was delightful here). I regret not getting dessert because the ice cream sandwiches that the table ordered next to me looked aweeesome. all in all, very good meal, nice ambiance, great location, good crowd, service was good & the price was affordable...2 thumbs up.
