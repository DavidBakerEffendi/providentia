Went here for my birthday after hearing rave reviews for its gourmet pizza and beautiful location....and hard to get reservations. Definitely worth the trip above Market street, and has plenty of street parking. The restaurant is beautiful, but it's not tablecloth fine dining. I went in jeans and felt comfortable doing so. Pizza was good, and the app was as well, but small. (I was warned beforehand about portion size.) Seems best seats in the house would be on the side, it's enclosed glass and farther away from the open kitchen and busy hostess stand. Definitely get their ice cream, or gelato...amazing.
