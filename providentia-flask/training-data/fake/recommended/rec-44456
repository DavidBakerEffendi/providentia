Lived less than a block away for 2 years. I ate there many times simply due to convenience. The pizza is great; thin and crispy if that's your thing. The pulled pork and ribs are pretty good as well. My main gripe, which is enough that I don't return often, is that the owner has a terrible attitude.  Glad to see I'm not the only one on here that noticed.  He always seems pissed off and hardly has any manners. Dude, you're in the customer service industry: the least you can do is put on a fake smile, stop barking at customers and have some manners. I've seen him yelling at his staff on numerous occasions. If you like Jazz/blues, you'll probably like going there on a Friday/Saturday during the summer. They have a live band there and they can get loud, since the place is quite small. If you don't like Jazz/blues, get your order to go.
