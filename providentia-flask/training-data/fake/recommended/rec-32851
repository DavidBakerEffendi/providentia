Went here with some friends. The food was really good and the atmosphere was nice, quaint, small and inviting, music not too loud and overall enjoyable. However...there were some big drawbacks as well. My girlfriend requested one of their pizzas without a specific ingredient she did not like, the kitchen refused to do it essentially because of the artistic integrity of the food. I didn't realize we were dealing with world famous chefs. The food was good but very non-traditional, with very small portions. The small portions also came large prices, everything was over priced. The meal itself took a while, over two hours for everything to get done with.
