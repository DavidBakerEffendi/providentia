My favorite Hartford restaurant. A menu that changes with the seasons, beautiful displays and incredible flavors. Usually I end up eating off the pub menu for the sake of my wallet but here are my must have's - - Spicy Margarita - the first time I had this it was infused with cucumbers and it was the most amazing thing I'd ever had to drink - Disco Fries - after a show next door at Billing's Forge this is what I'm craving! The plate is huge, share with your friends and make everyone happy - Chickpea gnocchi - these delicious creations are usually switched up with different vegetables or sauces depending on what's in season. Do yourself a favor if you see them on the menu and EAT THEM! - Fried chicken with sriracha honey - the chicken is crisp and juicy and the honey is the perfect amount of sweet and spicy. If you're lucky there will be a bartender working who remembers how to make a Dr. Firebox, it is one of the tastiest cocktails there is! Tastes just like Dr. Pepper which means watch your intake because remember there's booze in there! People will complain about the parking or the neighborhood and I will tell those people to get over it, and valet their car if they're that worried because the experience you'll have once you go inside is worth it. It's beautiful to your eyes, your nose, your taste buds, it's worth it.
