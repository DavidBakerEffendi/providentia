I was craving some ramen today and i was meaning to check this place out. I came in for a late lunch, there was only two other tables seated which was fine, i enjoyed the quiet lunch. I gave this place a 3 based on the space, service and food. The space was great, definitely said izakaya just a tad classy for one though. Majority of the restaurant looks like it was made for picnic bench style dining so more group eaters instead of single or double. I took a seat near the cooks. Service was ok. I understand that it might be a slow start to the day but when the cook starts hinting at the waiter that there's someone waiting, you probably should turn around and seat them. I laughed it off and said it was fine, got to keep busy on a slow day some how. server was very prompt with water and the menu and the clean up was on point. Food was ok. I ordered the pork broth shoyu ramen. It had a bit too much of miso for my liking, i had to keep drinking water to take the salty taste out and the only pork flavor i tasted was from the pork slices in the ramen. The noodle itself was a bit firm, i'm partial to something a bit softer and chewy, i guess something with substance. i had to try the yakitori since it was a izakaya after all. I ordered the skirt steak skewer and the oysters. The skirt steak was pretty good, as far as price vs quantity goes, i probably wouldn't order it again. One skewer for $2.50 i believe and the oysters were 2 for $3.75. I was not a fan of the oysters at all, no flavor what so ever, i think the chef was trying to add some flavor by adding soy sauce to one of the oysters and not the other but it just tasted more salty. I like a freshly shucked oyster here and there but to grill an oyster i was expecting some sort of zesty brother within the shell but it was very bland even with the lemon. i'll have to come back here again and try it with a friend and explore the menu some more. maybe it was a hit or miss kind of day.
