On a trip to Philly, a bartender at a restaurant directed me here for good beer. The staff were very nice, but I went for the beer, and I'm giving this place full marks for beer. Khyber Pass had three cask ales on tap, one of which was an ESB which was even served at the right temperature. I'm not pretending to a lot of local knowledge, but if you like beer, I can't imagine there are a lot of places as good as this for beer in Philly. If I'm wrong and Philly can spare this one, I'd love to have them move to Boston.
