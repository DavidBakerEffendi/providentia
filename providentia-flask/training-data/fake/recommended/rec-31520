Very easy to review this place. Blah. Bland. Tasteless. Boring. I cannot even remember what I ate here it was that ehh. It isn't that it was bad, but there are so many other places close by that you could eat at that have FLAVOR. This makes eating here piss you off that you sent money for food made by someone with no taste buds. If you want to eat food that tastes gray, go here.
