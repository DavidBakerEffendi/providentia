In my opinion, this is arguably the best valued meal in Chittenden County.  Besides the fact that the food is very tasty, it is extremely affordable. The waitstaff is very friendly and knowledgeable and I've never had a bad meal there. The only downside is that the dining room can be a little cramped at times, but I like that vibe.  It makes me feel like I'm in a corner restaurant in Little Italy. There's a reason there is always a line out the door to P. Franks: The food is damn good.
