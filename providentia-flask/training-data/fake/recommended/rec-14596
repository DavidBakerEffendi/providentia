Clean place, decent (but not superlative) service... About the food - everything they made in the restaurant tasted great... Oven baked lemon potato wedges, felafel, home made fries etc. However, their veg burger had store-bought patties that tasted sterile and bland. Owners said it's just something they "needed to have" though it clearly diluted the experience for us. The chef-owner was within earshot of our discussion and still did not bother.
