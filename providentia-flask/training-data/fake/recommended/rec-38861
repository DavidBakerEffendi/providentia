6.16.13: I decided to revise my review after taking home some of the very large portion I was served. The food was actually very good. The unusual ambiance negatively impacted my impression of the food. Original Review: The food was diner quality food. The ambiance, with its fever pitched lighting, checkerboard floors and water stained ceiling, would be perfectly suited for a scene in a David Lynch film. You may want to try it as a funky change from your normal diner visit.
