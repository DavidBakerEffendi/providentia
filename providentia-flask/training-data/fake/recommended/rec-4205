When I was in college, I had one of those NYC-centric friends (the kind that frequently said things like "I've had better in NY" or "the only good bagels are in NY" or "ugh, well in NY, nothing closes before 4am"). Anyway, she was intent on showing me the best burger her fair city had to offer and before I knew it, we were pushing through the doors of Corner Bistro. The rundown look of the place... or, well, not rundown, but just worn in and woody and cozy, was an instant surprise. This called for a heavy pint of beer, and thankfully McSorelys was only $3 per (and still is today). Then, the fact that there is no menu, but just a board with a mere 6 or 7 options kept this the kind of simple shack I typically like to frequent. These days, the menu hasn't changed and not even the board. Order the Bistro Burger and never settle for a less excellent burger again.
