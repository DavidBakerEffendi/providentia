Very overpriced for the quality and amount of food you get. I ordered the mahi mahi tacos and when they came out there were two tiny what looked like taquitos from 711 on my plate, and they really didn't taste too far off from that. The Mahi Mahi was deep fried and it basically tasted like a fish stick wrapped in a tortilla. The atmosphere was cool, but honestly save yourself the time and money and visit one of the smaller local mexican restaurants in Philly.
