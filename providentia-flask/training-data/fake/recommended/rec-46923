We had our going away party for leaving Philadelphia at this German beer garden, and had a great time. It has indoor and outdoor sections so that if the weather sucks, you can run inside, but there are also heaters if it's a little too cold. There are ping pong tables and picnic tables everywhere for seating, as well as multiple bars, including a beer only bar to make sure the lines don't get too long. You must get the pretzel with cheese dip. Must. This place is great for groups of friends to sit around, drink pints of good beer, and play Jenga if you're feeling wild.
