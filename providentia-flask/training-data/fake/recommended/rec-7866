Wow!   Very impressed!  Locally sourced, fresh food.   Everything was delicious.   I tried the lamb bolognese pasta, which, as other reviewers have commented, is simply amazing.  I asked for the recipe, to no avail.  My daughter had the crab cake and special scallops,which were fabulous, and another daughter had the lamb merguez, also delicious.A little on the expensive side, but definitely worth the price.  The decor is cozy and warm, featuring a dog motif (with blue dog paintings by George Rodrigue -- (it is the converted house of the owner, who founded the restaurant over 30 years ago), and is surprisingly capacious.  The staff is extremely professional and attentive.  A great place to go while visiting Penn!
