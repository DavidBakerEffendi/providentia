Spices is another fantastic Yelp! find.  The restaurant is clean and modern yet manages to exude warmth.  The menu was interesting and varied.  We tried the mango tofu (sorry, I don't know what it's officially called) and the drunken noodles with tofu.  Another friend ordered the chicken satay.  My mango friend raved about how tasty it was.  I gave it a try and mentioned that it reminded me of a General Tso's sauce and she agreed but said it was better as it was a lighter flavor, and of course, it was mango!  They must have cut and put a whole mango in the dish as there were many very large slices (slabs?) of mango.  My meat-eater friend loved her chicken and we all enjoyed the noodles.  Our water glasses were continually filled and the wait staff were extremely nice and responsive. After we polished it all off my mango friend was happily complaining how full she was.  The waitress then came and offered us complimentary dessert - she called them small pumpkin cakes - and my mango friend declined.  Lucky for her the waitress brought three anyway as we took a bite and it wasn't pumpkin cake, it was perfectly pan-fried pumpkin mochi.  Mmmmmm!!!!   We ate our perfect pumpkin mochis with delight.   Spice 28 is now on my "must visit" list when I'm anywhere near Philly.  The food was interesting and delicious, the service was excellent, and the price is right.  If I lived anywhere near here I'd be working my way through their menu one dish at a time.
