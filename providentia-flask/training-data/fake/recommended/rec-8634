Thanks to the Yelp promo I bought, I was able to afford Le Petite France.  Honestly, only go there with the Yelp coupon because LPF will just rob you. For $9, I got two croissants, a medium latte, a salad with a piece of bread, and a macraron; not a bad price for WHC.  Better than Cosi's across the street.  All were very enjoyable, but they didn't offer me dressing for my salad.  Somehow, I got a side of spicy mustard for my bread?  Again, the croissant and baguettes are the true gems of this cafe. Customer service is still very little to be desired.  The crunchy granola-looking lady with the French accent was very nervous taking my order and that made me feel uncomfortable.  I felt that she was afraid of me though I thought I was very nice.  I was honestly afraid to ask for my salad dressing because I was afraid that she freak out.  Perhaps she was new to the organization or to dealing with American public.
