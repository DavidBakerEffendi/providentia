The Wishing Well is a great little dive bar near the Italian Market for drinking. With $2 mimosas and $3 bloody Mary's on weekends before 3:30, you can get a buzz on before heading down to enjoy the smells and tastes of the Italian Market. The restaurant is pretty deep for a corner bar and features bar stool seating, tall top tables and some booth seating in the back. Service is pretty speedy and our glasses weren't empty for long. Also, it is open on Labor Day weekend unlike so many other bars in Philly!
