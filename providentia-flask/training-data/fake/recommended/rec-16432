Seriously fantastic. Place is small, but that's fun! Easedropping, people watching, and eating all without having to turn your head, or pretend to be on your phone. Cubano was fantastic, as was the Polish (gotta represent). Really just great service, and really awesome deserts. Totally forgot what we got, but it was amazing! Something with figs and chocolate and happiness and puppies.... great price, great place. 5 stars all the way
