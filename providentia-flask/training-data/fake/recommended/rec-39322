AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!!! I am still reeling from  utter shock by the rude and humiliating experience we endured at this restaurant. I would recommend that NO ONE eat at an establishment that would ever belittle and humiliate any of their patrons in such a manner. Basically my husband and I arrived with our 2 twin toddlers while we awaited the rest of our party of 8. My daughter sat at a table and played w the salt shaker (about a teaspoon amount into a plate). When some of the rest of our party arrived and we asked to move to a larger table I noticed The salt, apologized for the salt and proceeded to pick it up. The waiter rolled his eyes, shook his head and told us we shouldn't eat there if we couldn't control our kids. It's a small place so the ONLY other table that was seated obviously heard this  exchange also. I could almost understand his reaction if they had destroyed the place or broken something. But some salt on a plate??? At any rate we left. I am not sure if this waiter guy  is the related to the owner or has some management type role that he thinks it's ok to speak to people like that. he's also been there a long time so maybe he is just bitter. On principle  (or in solidarity if you have ever had a child) --PLEASE do not eat here. Shame on you Istanbul cafe. Ruined our night.
