Awhile back my life was much different. Because once a month** I would walk down the street and around the corner from my apartment to my favorite neighborhood joint. Â  I had my favorite bar, my favorite restaurant, my favorite coffee, pizza, fries, sweets, and even favorite store for making unnecessary retail therapy purchases. But then there was Corner Bistro: my favorite joint. The on the corner around the corner haven. Because they have aw-some burgers*** and McSorley's on tap for under $10. Seriously, what else do you need!?! ** once a month may actually mean closer to once a week. *** the awsomeness increases when cheese and bacon are added
