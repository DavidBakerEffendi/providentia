So disappointed. I heard  such good things about this place especially how exquisite the roasted squash ravioli dish was. So of coarse I ordered it. But before I talk about my dish I need to say something about my experience from the time I entered to the time I exited. First, since my friends were already seated I didn't need to be seated which was perfected cause there was no hostess as a walked in. Second, I sat at the table for a good ten minutes before a server came (which I had to get her attention)  to take my order for a glass of wine.  I sent the first glass back because it tasted like really cheap wine. (There was only one other table occupied) Actually I'll cut to the chase. When my ravioli dish finally came it was cold and it's presentation was sloppy. It tasted like it was  store bought  and put together with no care. See my posted picture. And as a side note no one ever came to ask if I wanted another glass of wine. I should have know that this place was probably not as good as was previewed because they had a "B" rating by NYC.
