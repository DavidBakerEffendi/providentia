The fabric wall is beautiful. I felt even more cozy with this place listening to middle eastern music. I went for the merguez plate. It has salad (some lettuce, tomatoes, onions and kalamata olives), spicy lamb sausage, and a choice of baba ghanoush or hummus that you can decide between one of them. I also got their famous pita bread which tastes really good. The service was great and even greater when the server gave us free basbousa as a small dessert.
