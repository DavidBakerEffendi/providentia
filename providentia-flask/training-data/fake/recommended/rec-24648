This a decent, dingy, dive bar that has gotten a lot of attention for its burgers. I admit that it is a decent burger, but definitely not one of the best in New York (not even in the Village). It's tasty, big, but slightly dry. The fries are decent, however, as are the deals on beer. BEER SELECTION: Average. Some good stuff, some usual stuff. $2 mugs can't be beat, though. FOOD: The burgers are what everybody comes for. There are other options, but nothing above "meh". SERVICE: Decent. Not great, but I've never had a complaint. Everybody should try it for themselves, but I seriously didn't like the burger all that much. Try Paul's, instead.
