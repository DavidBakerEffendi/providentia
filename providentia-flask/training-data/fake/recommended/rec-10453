I kind of love this place. It's a shame I've only been here once. A friend who lives in the SoHo area suggested it. I work right around the corner and have never seen it. Upon first sight it's pretty quaint. The sign is made out of an old neon 'BAR' sign with the corners of the B blacked out to look like 'EAR' which got a good laugh from my boyfriend and I. It's very small, but we sat near the back which was nice. I can imagine sitting towards the front could get a little annoying. The inside is old and cunning. Very European! Reminds me of the bars we used to head out too when I was living in Wales, which is where my boyfriend is from, so he was right at home here. The beer was good, not a huge selection like I'm used too, but good! Their house special is fantastic and their food was pretty good. Typical pub food, I had the irish beef stew myself as it was a special. I loved it! Very filling. Not to expensive for my boyfriend, myself and our three friends I certainly wasn't regretting treating! The wait staff was fantastic. Plus I got to doodle on the table, which is awesome in it's own right. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it gets really, and I mean really, loud. Pubs are usually loud but there's so many people so close together that you can't really have a conversation, even a pub one. Plus the lady in the next table over was listening in on our conversation because of this fact and kept butting in. It's not really the pubs fault, but it is rather annoying. Also the bathrooms are so small it was a little awkward.
