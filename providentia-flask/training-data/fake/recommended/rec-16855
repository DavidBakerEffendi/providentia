Moved to the area in July and have been trying out different restaurants each weekend. So far most have been a disappointment., and we haven't found one to which we'd return. Â Inchins Bamboo Garden has restored my faith in the suburban Asian restaurant. My standards are high, having grown up in a city with a bonafide Chinatown and no shortage of great restaurants in general.This is a restaurant we will definitely return to and will recommend. We had Mushroom Salt Pepper, Shrimp Salt Pepper and Vegetarian Lettuce Wraps to start. All were very good. Food was fresh and presented nicely. Would order each again, but will likely try other items because there are so many intriguing options to choose from. The entrees we ordered were Basil Fried Rice (vegetarian), Fish in Cilantro Sauce and Broccoli Beef. All were good. Service was very attentive. Waiter, busboy and manager/owner were all serving and checking on our table. The assortment of 6 hot sauces on the table is great, and allows individual diners to add the amount of heat they each desire. Truly the only Asian restaurant we've been to that we will definitely return to and we're glad it's only 3 miles from home. The Chinese/Indian fusion results is interesting and delicious food. Give it a try. The restaurant was not very busy on a Saturday night at 7:00PM; I hope the community supports this place because it's a great addition to the restaurant scene here in Lawrence Township.
