Fun and loud restaurant.  Food was pretty good but not great - I had the lamb tenderloin with merguez.  The cous cous that came with it was also ok.  I also tried the mussels, brandade, snails, steak frites, and steak tartare.  I thought the dishes were generally well prepared and seasoned with some good flavor.  The bernaise that came with the steak was very nice, even though I normally don't like bernaise.  Also prices were reasonable - $21 for the mussels, $28 for my lamb, and $30 for the steak frites. This is a NYC institution and is worth a visit if you have a large party and like a hip and loud environment.   Wine and drinks overall were a bit on the unmemorable and pricey side but I was told that it was normal Manhattan prices (average $14 per cocktail).  Service was better than average which made the experience probably better than the food made it out to be.
