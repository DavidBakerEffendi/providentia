Happened across this place on Seamless tonight. Had the BBQ Chicken entree, and was totally blown away. Healthy, light, clean, SAUCE OUT OF THIS WORLD....! I am thrilled to have found it and look forward to turning my team onto it at our next weekly meeting (where I order food for everybody....!). I felt that the price was very reasonable for the amount and quality of the food and flavor. Bravo guys! I look forward to more.
