Kind of pricey. I guess I expected a ridiculously huge sub for $9 but it was about a 6incher...well loaded steak & cheese, pretty edible although the meat quality was kind of meh. The place just feels skeevy, bad vibes, etc. - the doorway into the place looks like a black hole tattoo & hep B parlor.  It's pretty chilly inside, and the fluorescent lighting doesn't warm things up at all. Drab, in a word.  Then, the God posters on the wall in the dining area are just...odd. I'm not especially anti-religious, but I tend not to patronize businesses that push religion...kind of a conflict of interests, I guess. If you get stuff to eat in, don't expect plates - your food will come out as if it were to go, albeit without the plastic bag.  Fold out the greaseproof paper and go to town.
