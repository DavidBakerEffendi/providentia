Been here 3 times, got the scallops twice. I actually enjoy the slightly overcooked super seared small scallops instead of your usual giant squishy ones. I know that it's not everyone's favorite. crab appetizer with guac is not that flavorful but has good chunks of crab. seared tuna app is tasty. crawfish cake is too tough. grilled octopus is great. Had the snapper tonight which was not dried out and seasoned enough, got a good sear, light on butter and tasty with capers. The sweet potato side would be much better roasted rather than steamed. the smashed sweet potato is way too sweet. the sweet potato fries are just ok, not crispy enough. The shrimp appetizer with the lime sauce is amazing for that sauce, i would eat it with everything. buffalo calamari is not my favorite. sauce makes it kind of soggy. brussel sprouts are also mushy. Desserts are good, i've tried almost all of them. Key lime pie is on the sweet side. Tiramisu is decent.
