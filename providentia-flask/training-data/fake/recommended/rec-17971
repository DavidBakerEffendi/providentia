Rudest server ever! stopped by for coffee and dessert one late afternoon. A server (kid with long hair) told me they "just don't do that". I asked again as the place was empty. He looked at me disgusted and pretty much asked Â me to leave. Will never come to this place. Unfortunate as i've heard the food was good. Then i went to Lievito next door, sweetest servers ever.
