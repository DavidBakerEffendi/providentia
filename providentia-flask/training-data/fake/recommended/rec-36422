A former boss brought me here and ever since, I try to visit every time I am in the city. Love the different menus - lunch, dinner, bar food. Quite fun to be at the bar and watch the restaurant transition from lunch to dinner crowd. Great food and ambiance. A little pricey. Worth trying at least once.
