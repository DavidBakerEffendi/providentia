I have been here a whole slew of times since my original visit. The menu is SO good! The wings, flatbreads, grilled cheese-all very tasty! They have great happy hour and game specials, too. And they consider all the yummy local microbrews "domestics," instead of Bud Lite. Two thumbs up. But the staff is mostly terrible (with the exception of the bartender, the guy who works most evenings and the petite brunette waitress).  The last time I was there, I joined a table that already had drinks.  I waited 45 minutes to place my own order...even after repeated attempts to try and catch someone's eye and a couple of waves.  Then when my order finally was taken (after literally waving the server down), he seemed almost annoyed to have to be taking it. The other server was equally rude, she was very unfriendly, cold and overall unpleasant.  She has waited on me several times now and she is ALWAYS nasty.  As a previous server myself, I understand having a bad day and dealing with crappy customers, but this is consistent (and I've had her as a bartender and a server.)  She makes me feel bad for asking for ketchup. Its to the point where if I go there again and she is working, I'll probably leave. Or sit at the bar with the cool bartender. So beware the blonde waitress. But otherwise, the place is still pretty awesome.
