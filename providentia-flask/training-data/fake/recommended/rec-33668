I'm not a huge seafood lover, but for what I do enjoy, Petite Crevette more than catered to. We started with a tuna carpaccio that was thicker than I'm used to, but incredibly fresh and had the right accompaniments for well-balanced flavor -- A+. We also had a mushroom salad which I enjoyed but found a little soggy due to a heavy hand on the  dressing. My scallop entree was outstanding and the common entree sides for both of our dishes were also very good, if not a little plain. I tried a bit of my husband's cod and really enjoyed the flavor... not being a fish person, this must mean good things for Petite Crevette's preparation. And although I really like their off-the-beaten-path, cozy atmosphere, I found it a little odd that they only post their menus on the wall in a darkly-lit room... so you have to stand and walk over to read it. I pictured bringing my family here for a meal before this came to light --  imagining my half-blind relatives trying to huddle over the wall contemplating the options quickly made me nix that thought. That said, the service was very friendly and the meal worthwhile -- we will very likely be back. Oh, and its BYOB, which is always nice.
