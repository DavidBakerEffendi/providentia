We absolutely LOVED In Riva! Everything was excellent. Food was super flavorful and a lot of knowledge and passion went into it. Our server was terrific. The atmosphere was fun (we sat outside on the patio on a Saturday night). The bartender at the outside bar made an excellent Mojito. I told him lower on the syrup and he nailed it. Highly recommend this place. You wont be let down. I look forward to going again soon. Great job to everyone here.
