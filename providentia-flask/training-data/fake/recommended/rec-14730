I'm one of those annoying people who jeer at all those weaklings who can't handle anything spicy -- SPICY = GOOD, weak sauces!  Except this halal cart's hot sauce has totally humbled my tongue and pride.  Like the idiot that I was, I DUMPED hot sauce on my lamb & chicken platter (fantastic, by the way, without loads of hot sauce)... and probably did not digest this baby for a good 12 hours and did not regain feeling in my mouth or lips for another 8.  Seriously, I can usually handle spicy pretty well, but this had me sniffling and sweating like a maniac... on top of already being gross from drinking. So lesson learned: cut back on the hot sauce (NOT cut out -- it just doesn't give you the proper kick without it!) and enjoy the lamb and chicken.  These guys are GOOD.  I can't eat at other halal carts now without being a bit disappointed and thinking about this one now.
