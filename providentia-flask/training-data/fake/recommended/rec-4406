I can't say I hadn't been warned, but I was feeling optimistic when I came here for dinner on a Saturday night, as it seemed the reviews had been turning around of late. Eh. Catahoula had better Southern food and I didn't even really like that place very much. We started with the buttermilk fried shrimp, which were probably the best item of the evening, E had a plate of the clams and shrimp appetizer, and I got the jambalaya. Many of their starters are just too large and too heavy to be appetizers. The clam plate was obscenely big and rich with all the cream. The jambalaya ramekin probably weighed 2 pounds. E liked his clams well enough, but the jambalaya was nearly inedible. It tasted like nothing but andouille sausage and bay leaves, the rice was slightly mushy but also too dry. It was not good. I ate the seared shrimp that were arranged on top, which were fine, nothing exciting. I snagged one of the last 2 plates of fried chicken, and E got the burger. By this point I was already starting to get full, working on my second Lagunitas IPA. The fried chicken was decent, but not significantly better than, say, Popeyes. The mashed potatoes, on the other hand, were abhorrent. Think garlicky wallpaper paste. Collards were passable but a bit bland and on the toothy side. E's burger looked better than it tasted. The brioche bun hadn't been toasted, so it basically disintegrated on contact with the juicy burger patty, which was really thick and meaty. The overall impression was just soggy and greasy, and there wasn't enough presence from the condiments to give it any excitement. Oh, and the bacon was super floppy. What a fail. Service was fine, our server was a pro and the place was super busy. We did have to wait a bit for the table we reserved at the packed bar, and the lone bartender looked pretty overwhelmed. Drinks tended to take a while all night, but he was willing to make E a mojito even though it wasn't on their list.
