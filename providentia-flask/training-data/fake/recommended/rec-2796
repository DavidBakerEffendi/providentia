My wife and I were back in town with our kids.  We've been gone from the area for over 20 years, but we still know what good pizza is, and Fred and his team fit the bill.  What was even more important than how good the pizza tasted, was the fact that we got into town much later than anticipated, and by the time we dropped off everything in our hotel room, most every food place was closed, except for fast food.  We found Piccolo Trattoria at 10pm, just as they were wrapping things up for the night.  But, Fred opened the door and welcomed us in, as all we wanted was a takeout pizza.  We offered to leave, but Fred and his team took very good care of us and had us leaving with a smile, and soon thereafter, full bellies. We are in NJ for only a few days, but will try and make it back before we leave.  For those of you who live in the area and have not tried them yet, do so...you won't be dissapointed! Thanks again, Fred!  btw, sausage just the way I like it!
