I've passed by Red Cat hundreds of times over the last decade or so, but just ventured in for the first time a couple weeks ago, and I'm sorry I didn't try it sooner! Lovely, understated space that's intimate without being too cozy, great staff, and fabulous food. You should go for the amazing Fragola cocktails alone (perfect and refreshing for those steamy summer evenings.) I had the watermelon and feta salad (a summer special!) along with the snow peas side, and my husband had the scallops. Fresh and delicious. I'm happy to have another go-to spot in the neighborhood!
