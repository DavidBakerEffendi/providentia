The first time I came here, there was a 1.5 hour wait so my party bailed and we had ramen nearby. Last night, the wait was 45 min, so we grabbed a drink nearby (the bar at Redhead was completely packed) and came back for dinner. Totally worth the annoying wait. Every single thing we got was impressively good. The table favorites were: The much-lauded fried chicken of course The cornbread - unreal!! The 'Carbomb' hot chocolate The peanut brittle If this place is on your list - make it happen. Just be ready to wait.
