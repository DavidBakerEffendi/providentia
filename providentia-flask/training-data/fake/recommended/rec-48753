Order the pork buns and your life is changed forever. But seriously, this is a solid lunch place and I was extremely happy with my meal here. Being someone who does not understand the appeal of ramen dishes, I was thoroughly impressed with this place. The prices were also extremely reasonable, and the energy in the restaurant was contagious. There was a bit of a wait and it is on the louder side, so expect that if you are coming to visit. However, the line moved quickly and the wait was totally worth it.
