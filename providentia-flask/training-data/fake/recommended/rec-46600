Their vegetarian food is pretty sub-par. I know that the French are not known for their vegetarian cuisine, but there you go. Pasta for the appetizer and the entree, and neither one was particularly good. With pasta, I feel like you have to do something special to make it blow me away, and I wasn't that impressed with either the presentation or the taste. The desserts, however, were excellent - I got a sampler that included their take on raspberry macaroons, chocolate pudding, and cake. Would definitely recommend them to anyone coming here for dinner.
