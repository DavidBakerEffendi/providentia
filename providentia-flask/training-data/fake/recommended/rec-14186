This place is one of the best street carts I've been to. Luckily I haven't stayed in line for too long, maybe because I get there within the first two hours the cart opens. But sitting and eating near the cart you can see the line getting longer. I love their lamb, chicken, rice, and pita bread. Their white sauce and hot sauce are yummy too! Everything really I ever got there was simply delicious. It's nice and warm with generous servings. The price is reasonable, I believe between $5-$7 for a plate. The people are really nice too.
