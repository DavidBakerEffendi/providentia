Another outstanding NY dining experience. This was a "wow" for sure. In Tribeca, two blocks from Marc Forgione (a fave of mine) is Bouley. They each have a Michelin star and each couldn't be more different than the other. While Forgione is casual, Bouley is elegant....waiters in suits and ties elegant. Gorgeous design, elegant manor sets high expectations for the food. Those expectations were definitely met. Waiting a few minutes outside the main room we were served a glass of champagne (in mismatched glasses curiously enough). Two sips in we were escorted to our table. Service was right there. Our waiter was the right balance of courteous, casual and confident. Wine list (very good) and menus. Bottled water. Ordering began. My guest began with the Organic Connecticut Farm Egg, Serrano Ham, Steamed Polenta, Artichoke All-Natural Radish Sprouts, and Coconut-Garlic Broth. I countered with Harwich Wild Blue Fin Tuna, Chu Toro, Fresh Hawaiian Heart of Palm, and Yuzo-Miso Dressing. Both were excellent. The sommelier came by. I ordered a 1999 Chateau Musar, an old friend. The waiter was a bit surprised and delighted that I went Musar. Not many people know about it evidently. Next were entrees. Long Island Duckling with a Balinese Pepper Crust, White Truffle Honey, Fresh Fava Beans, Japanese Sweet Kabu Turnips, Ginger, Lemon Thyme, and Lemon Verbena Sauce for my guest. I ordered the All-Natural Pennsylvania Chicken Baked "En Cocotte" with Alfalfa and Clover Hay, Fresh Fava Beans, Buttermilk and Tarragon. Both were, again, excellent. The pace of the meal was languorous. The food excellent. The service impeccable. The ambiance beautiful. The evening unbeatable. Highly recommended.
