Understanding and appreciating what Fare is attempting, the food gives me little pleasure.  Two meals and I've had the same reaction to each - simply too subtle.  Even the chocolate torte lacked flavor.  The service was good and the atmosphere was very pleasant.  And it's not too pricey.  But I can't recommend it to people who like conventionally delicious food.  For people who like natural and subtle flavors, may be worth trying.
