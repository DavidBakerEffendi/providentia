You can certainly do worse. It's better than any of the chains that people who come here in droves (tourists) are used to, but that's faint praise for a pizza place in the world capital of pizza. Service is also apathetic at best. If all of the glowing reviews and hype about this place are coming from locals, they need to get out more. The hubris of this place billing ITSELF as "the best pizza in New York" is so transparently laughable once you taste what they serve that it deserves a docked star. Go to the Bronx. Oh, and any sit-down restaurant that only accepts cash in 2014 is probably a front for something illegal. Knock that shit out. You are popular enough to afford the credit card fees. Overall, not impressed.
