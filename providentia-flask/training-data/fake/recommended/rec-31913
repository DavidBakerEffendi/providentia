Cozy little find in the E. village - love the afforable wine list (who knew Serbian wines were delicious)?  Had some hearty eastern european food, my Russian boyfriend declared the stuffed pepper special, "just like Grandma's."  Serbian burger is good, but the texture is more compact and sausage-like than this Pat LaFrieda fan prefers.
