A friend and I were in Philly for the evening and decided to grab dinner here after some menu-comparison while walking around the neighborhood. Quite frankly it blew our minds and I would come back in a heartbeat next time I'm in the city, and I suggest it to anyone who tells me they're headed up. They have a really impressive selection of craft beers on draft, a quick way to win me over. As for the menu... I don't think there was a single thing on there I wouldn't like to try some day. The friend I was with grew up in Texas and told me this is probably the best barbecue she's had in her life if that tells you anything. Service was super friendly and appropriately attentive. We split the sampler (two or three meats and two sides) with the pulled pork, ribs, and brisket with onion rings and smoked cheddar fries. I too have had my fair share of barbecue fare and it was just... so perfect. As the older gentleman who raved about it to us outside the door for quite some time said, you don't need teeth to eat the brisket. Onion rings were without a doubt the best I've had, perfectly light batter yet you won't drag the whole onion out of its shell on the first bite. Everything was tender but not gristly and flavorful and oh god if I ever moved to Philadelphia living within walking distance of Khyber Pass Pub would be a non-negotiable.
