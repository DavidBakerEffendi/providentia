a friend and i decided to check out the newly opened Ardesia. the location is tucked into the remote far western part of midtown west, which i guess could either be inconvenient, or off the beaten path. right off the bat i was impressed with the wine selection. i told the bartender that i'm the biggest Chianti fanatic but wanted to try something new that had a similar taste/body, and he immediately returned with a Lagrein that I fell in love with and drank the entire evening. the space was fairly small, but with its minimalist decor and high ceilings, there was a nice air of simple coziness to it. the service was impeccable. the waiter introduced the menu with great detail, highlighting standout dishes and pointing out interesting tidbits, such as that the pastrami they serve was cured in a fellow chef's home, or that they didn't have goat cheese because the goat's milk they use is strictly sourced from this one small upstate farm and their goats are pregnant this month. we ordered a bean salad, shrimp skewers, and a 6-cheese tasting board - which was absolutely the stand-out dish of the night. the cheeses were lined up from light to strong, and paired with apple pure, honey, pickled peppers, and other mouth watering combinations. Â seeing our excitement, the waiter made us a copy of the cheese names, and hand-wrote in all the pairings. i was thoroughly impressed. my friend and i haven't seen each other in ages and just wanted to catch up. Ardesia created the mood and satiated our palates. what a wonderful night.
