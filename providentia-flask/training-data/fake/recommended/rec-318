We are missing out on Ramen in Seattle. It's a problem that needs immediate resolving. A coworker suggested this location for when I was visiting after I told him I wanted to try Momofukus noodle bar. While I can't compare the two I can say Ippudo is AMAZING. The scene is loud, crowded and fast paced. Waiters swirl around while you twirl your noodles. I wish I had brought a friend to try some additional dishes but my eye was on the price: Ramen. Akamaru Modern was my poison and I happily died in its arms that night. Salty, umami goodness. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the flavors cannot be accurately described, they must be experienced. It all happened so fast I sometimes wonder if it was a dream... the reality is I just have to get myself back to NYC to enjoy it again!
