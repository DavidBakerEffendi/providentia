My boyfriend took me here as part of a birthday present.  Very intimate although a little cramped.  Food was great (had the recommended skate and halibut).  Preparation was perfect, and sauce/side pairings were delicious.   The oyster selection was very good.   Orgasmic meal. Staff seemed a little bit inexperienced about the food and serving in general but were earnest and attentive.  Only downside was a very loud group in the corner that destroyed the intimate atmosphere, but overall a wonderful dining experience and I'm looking forward to going back and trying something new.
