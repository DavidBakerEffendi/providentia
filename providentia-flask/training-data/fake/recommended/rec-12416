LOVE this place; it is probably our favorite Italian food in the city.  Their caprese is always amazing and the rigatoni alla vodka is perfectly creamy with nice pieces of pancetta and quality mushrooms.  We have tried a couple of veal dishes as well, which have been good but one time the veal was a little tough.  The veggies that come with secondi are ridiculously buttery and delicious.
