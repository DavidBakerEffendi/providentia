I like JP Dempsey's because it's got lots of character. Character isn't something a business owner can just plan for or purchase. Either a place has it it doesn't. This bar/pub is a great place to go after grabbing some pizza at Modern Apizza with a bunch of friends. It's just a couple blocks away on State Street.
