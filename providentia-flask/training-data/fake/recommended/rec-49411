"Empanada Mama" is quite a small establishment (30 people max.), but a colorful spot that offers tasty dishes with reasonable price and good atmosphere. It was so good, that we were actually craving to go there again. As a vegetarian, I was happy to find so many delicious dishes to have, while my meat eating friends had many options for them, no one remained unsatisfied. You pay between $2-$3 for an Empanada, filled with vegetables, cheese or meat. They're all good, especially with the green and red chili sauce (The green is better :) ), but I really liked the Spinach and Cheese (Greek) and the Mushroom and Onions Empanada. I like that the food arrives in small paper bags stamped with writings of its content. All this food goes really great with some beer or cocktails, and the prices are pretty reasonable. (Between $5 - $8). I must admit that sitting there in the evening was much more fun, because it was packed with people having a good time. They actually have a happy hour time from 1am - 4am, and in the afternoon, where every drink is $5. The service is very good, even though when arriving hungry, one could wait 15 minutes for food to arrive. The wait is totally worth it.
