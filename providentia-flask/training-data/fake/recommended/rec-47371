Returned to Kefi and was once again pleased with the experience. We had a reservation, so no wait for a table. For an appetizer we shared some fried calamari which were fresh and crispy. I wasn't expecting too much for my entree, the Macaroni & Cheese. But I was wowed by the creamy goodness. I think there was spinach mixed in with some delicious white Greek cheeses. Definitely a plus. Great atmosphere on a Saturday night.
