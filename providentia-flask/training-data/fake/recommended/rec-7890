Go for brunch!  One of the few bottomless brunch places in Philadelphia (believe me, I looked) and such a cute quaint place.  Bottomless mimosas are only $14, which is such a steal. I got the three-egg omelet and it was fantastic -- the goat cheese and sundried tomatoes gave it great flavor.  The others in my party got the pasta and really enjoyed it.   Great place to come with friends or take family!
