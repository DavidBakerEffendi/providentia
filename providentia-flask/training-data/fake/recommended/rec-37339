Fried pork dumplings, $2 for 10 and a pork sesame pancake for $1.75! Hubby got the dumplings, I had a few bites in between his moaning about them - apparently this was the snack spot back in his high school days. I had the pancake and shared some with the mister to be polite. We arrived before the lunch rush so we got to see everyone in the back making the dumplings and that was pretty neat. Let's be honest here: if you get anything fried - you're going to need a napkin or two, but don't be afraid of it!
