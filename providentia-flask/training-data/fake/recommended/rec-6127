$7 lunch specials even on the weekends? Count me in! The lunch specials are awesome here, including rice and an appetizer for $7, and soup for only $2 more. The soup I could have lived without, I've had much better, but all of our entrees were fabulous, good portions and great prices for New York. The atmosphere is extremely trendy but not arrogant. I would expect to pay much higher prices for this ambiance. Plus the location in Midtown West makes it ideal to bring out of town guests that want to spend time in the touristy areas
