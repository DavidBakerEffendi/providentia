Sorry but $12.00 for a cheesesteak cooked to death that tasted like STEAK-UM.                  Beer in a can is only at a dive bar. Just dont get this place they try to hard to be hip.               nice looking bar , but most of the young patrons look like they were happy to make there a live. They need to add just a few regular beers for the local peeps. Right now its a lot of new beers made with cheap hops. I need my brewery in bus for more than a week
