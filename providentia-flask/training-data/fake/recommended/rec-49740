Overhyped and overpriced. Nothing close to tofu soup in Koreatown in LA. Will save my $$ for when I am in Koreatown. The mineral rice was kinda blah blah. Soondobu was not bad but not exceptional. The kimchi chi gae was just standard. The best part about the meal was the banchan which was never filled.
