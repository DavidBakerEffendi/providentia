A funny coincidence led us here: needing inspiration of where to stop in for a quick sip, we discovered Robataya due to some inebriated fellow who pointed and hollered to his friends lauding praise for this place. Who can go wrong with that sort of recommendation? We giggled at his sheer enthusiasm sprinkled with unexpected silliness and went in. We were seated at the main grill where 2 very skilled Japanese chefs flipped and served entrees and snacks alike using long wooden serving spoons that were broom-length and resembled what one would use for a pizza oven. Interested diners were offered the chance to attempt holding up said serving device, mostly with little luck due to its sheer weight even sans plate. Taking every order with traditional Japanese confirmations shouted and then echoed between servers and chefs, I could tell right away that the plans for one drink would turn into half a sake bottle of a magical beverage unlike anywhere else (Narutotai sake, for those curious) and at least a few nibbles. Grilled king crab, tasty mushrooms, crispy brusselsprouts, Â and incredible sea bass followed. I could not believe our fortune for stumbling upon this place. Thanks so much, random drunk guy on the street! You helped us find a new favorite place.
