Fastest delivery I've ever received. I ordered the rice bowl with teriyaki chicken. I loved the vegetables that it came with, they had a buttery taste to them. The rice was great and the teriyaki chicken was awesome because it wasn't smothered in sauce. It tasted as if the teriyaki was all in the seasoning. The only thing I disliked a bit was that the fat was still on the chicken strips. But they were juicy so that was a plus! I enjoyed my meal and felt like I was being healthy at the same time! Unfortunately they close early, at 2:45. But I was satisfied. Would totally order again.
