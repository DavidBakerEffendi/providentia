This is a hyped up place that I initially assumed would not live up.  Turned up with my wife and was seated immediately despite it being very busy (assume much harder for groups though, there appeared to be people waiting ahead of us).  Dear wife got a margherita and I took the Prosciutto Funghi. Mine was delicious but wet (expected), and DW enjoyed hers too.b cash only is a little annoying in this day and age, but a chatty atmosphere and good tasty Brooklyn pizza made this a returnable spot
