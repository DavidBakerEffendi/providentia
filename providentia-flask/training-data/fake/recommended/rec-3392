I'm revising my review because I've found the way I love Fort Defiance: for weekend brunch, sitting at the bar. They offer a fabulous prix fixe brunch deal, with entree, side, coffee and cocktail for 20 bucks. Considering many of their drinks have double-digit price tags, that's a steal. The tables are a little too close for my taste, but at the bar, I'm simultaneously a little removed from the hubbub and have a great perch to watch everything, including the bartenders. In my experience, it seems the wait staff can be stretched thin working the tables, but at the bar, I've always been well tended. So my tip: go for brunch on the early-ish side, ideally Saturday and not Sunday, and sit at the bar. Get the Dutch pancake and a bloody Mary. It's pretty close to perfect.
