So so so good! And always. I've been to all 3 locations - Soho, Flatiron and DC - and they are equally tasty. The atmosphere is fun and alive but not intrusive and the wait staff are well-trained and helpful. Favorite dishes - pan con tomate, gambas in the most awesome garlic oil (definitely get more bread to soak up its deliciousness), blistered peppers, patatas bravas, lamb skewers, hangar steak. And churros for dessert are a must! You can go with a group and keep the tapas coming and the sangria flowing or you can go on your own and sit at the bar or the communal table and enjoy a glass of wine and some meats and cheeses - Boqueria works no matter what.
