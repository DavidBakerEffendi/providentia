Either I just had good luck on my last trip to New York or my theory of the cold weather being a factor is correct, but the line at 53rd and 6th was only ten minutes long.  Gone were the horror stories of the 1-2 hour waits for this vendor. The wait was so short that I wasn't prepared to order when I got to the front.  What do I ask for? "Uh... four please?"  Thankfully, based on my request, he figured we were from out of town and gave us the combo of chicken and lamb. I thought the chicken was dry, so I didn't care much for it (I did finish it though).  The lamb was the clear-cut favorite for me.  Mix that with the rice, pita, the white sauce (mmm, the white sauce) and the red (hot) sauce, and you've got a winner.   After I inhaled my plate, I finished off my friend's plate.  And then another friend's plate.  I almost finished off a third friend's but I decided I shouldn't overdo it.   Dang, I wish I had that plate with me right now. Dang, I wish we had something like that here in LA. Dang, you really need to check this out if you're visiting NY. Dang, dang, DANG.
