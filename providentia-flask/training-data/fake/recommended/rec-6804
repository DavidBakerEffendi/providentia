delicious! had their sandwiches at a catered lunch meeting. was fantastic - there was a selection of 4 different types of sandwiches, plus salad. first off, let me say that i *love* the bread that they are using - really the perfect consistency, didn't get soggy and held up well. i tried the turkey sandwich and the capri. both were delicious - capri has a roasted red pepper spread which was really really yummy. turkey had a special aioli, also delicious. the salad was so-so -- mostly a lack of salt in the vinaigrette, because the greens were great and it had nice slivers of cucumber. i gave feedback about the salad dressing and it was well received so i am sure it will be more flavorful in the future! looking forward to when they have a shop open!
