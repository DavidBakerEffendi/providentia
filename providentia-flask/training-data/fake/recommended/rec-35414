3.5 Stars My friend took me here for my Birthday Brunch. She chose the location - my requirements for her on choosing a location for brunch 1) Interesting/Creative take on Brunch menu items 2) Reasonably priced Public fit those requirements. I chose the Brunch set and ordered the Black Pudding waffles washed down with Vanilla & Fig Bellini and sobered up with a pot of English Breakfast tea. Lamingtons were self serve in the middle of the restaurant. Best Lamingtons in New York ever! Moist cake and the coconut shavings were not overpowering or falling apart. I would come back for the Lamingtons! The waffles were delicious and served with a generous helping of foie gras butter - holy richness! I could barely eat more than half of my plate because it was so rich!
