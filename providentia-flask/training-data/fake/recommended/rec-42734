How do you have perfect cocktails while also having fabulous food? That is what you get at Eo. This place was perfect from the minute you walk in. I have never had a bouncer look at my ID, welcome me using my name and introduce himself. I waited 4 seconds for my table which was ready and at a great location. The service, impeccable, friendly, attentive, fun and genuine. The drinks perfect and fun. The food great. The place is small, dark but ultra sexy and unique. There's only one small unisex bathroom it can be a bit of a wait but stop bitching it's Eo it's NYC have a great time no matter what. Grab your drink and engage in conversation while waiting in the bathroom line, and if people ignore you and act stuck up they don't belong at Eo tell them to take their asses to one of those lousy yuppy rooftop places. Last but not least Do your self a favor and call ahead see if there's a table available for you to sit relax and sip. Peace
