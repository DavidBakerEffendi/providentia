I came back here for a quick lunch again; and I must say that after trying the Thai Blackened Striped Bass; I decided to revisit this review and give them a 4 stars... the dish was delicious, tasty and fresh. The combination of the Mango with the sweet sauce and the fish was perfect. If they prepare every dish like this one; they would have gotten a 5 stars.
