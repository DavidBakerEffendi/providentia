really wanted to like this place, but it was just ok. The sandwiches barely had anything in them. The bread was tasty. The french fries were VERY good. croquetas are not very good- it's a good portion, but for two people it was a lot and not very good, so we found ourselves just eating them to get rid of them. Also- we had ordered the "clara" because we thought it was a light/white sangria. NOPE. it is beer with club soda. and it was $10 for the pitcher. but the regular beer pitcher was $8.... so we paid more for watered down beer basically. also, wish this place was more of a bar and less like a fast food joint. You order/pay up front, then they bring your food out wherever you are sitting. Didn't really like that part. In all, I'd go back if someone wanted to go, but I don't think I will go out of my way
