Had the squid ink pasta.  Sorely disappointed.  Bland, flavorless, boring. - the size of the shrimps were wonderful though. The atmosphere threw me off a little.  Made me feel like they would have rather be a club, with bottle service, rather than a restaurant.  May be back - Don't know yet - wouldn't count on it. I feel like Yelp failed me on this venture as I was looking for good Thai food in my area and was lead to this place.
