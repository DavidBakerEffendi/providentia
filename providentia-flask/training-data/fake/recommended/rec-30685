the exterior of this place is sort of deceiving. given its unremarkable signage and the fact that it's in an area that isn't exactly, how shall I put it, "spectacular" as far as chow goes, I was expecting this place to be pretty divey. when I decided on takeout the other night and ended up giving this place a try, I was surprised to walk in and find a nice and even somewhat hip sushi place. not to mention that it was pretty packed for a weeknight. the sushi I ordered was fresh, and the steamed pork dumplings were sufficiently tasty. I'd definitely go there again.
