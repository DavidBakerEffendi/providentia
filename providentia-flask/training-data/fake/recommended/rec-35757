Went for our anniversary, so good!  We got the tasting menu with the wine pairings, and it was the perfect amount of food.  Everything was delicious.  We loved the cheese plate, the jumbo shrimp were delicious, the duck confit was lovely, and the lamb was magnificent.  Of the 3 desserts, only one was very good, but after all that food, one was plenty!  I'll overlook the other desserts since everything else was so delicious!
