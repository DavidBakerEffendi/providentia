A really little restaurant with some mighty fine burgers. It's nice to not have to pay $15+ for a burger as the Bronti comes at $11. It comes in a ciabatta style bun. The burger was actually cooked to medium as requested and had a wonderful spicy pepper flavor behind it. A great spot for some simple delicious food.
