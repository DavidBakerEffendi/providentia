My friend who has celiacs was in town so we went here for dinner. Now I may be a tad bias as I typically don't eat gluten free pasta and bread but did this weekend since we split all our dishes. The bread they give you was pretty good for gluten free bread. A little dry, but compared to other GF breads I've had it was not too bad. We ordered the Tortellini, which we thought was too salty, and the Fusilli which was good. For desert we ordered the red velvet cake which was a little dry. I know GF breads are, but I have had moist GF cake before so it can be done. If you have celiacs and are worried about cross contamination than sure this place is a good place to go, but it was only okay. I personally wouldn't go back unless I was going with someone who had celiacs.
