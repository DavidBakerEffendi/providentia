The service was terrible, it was a small place and we kept having to flag down any waiter we could grab to get anything we needed. Two of my friends and I went and only one person enjoyed their dish and for the price we all should have left satisfied. I'm thinking YELP reviewers do not know their food, based on the reviews I try many places out to only get disappointed.
