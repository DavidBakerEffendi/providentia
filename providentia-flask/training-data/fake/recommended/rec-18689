I live in Brooklyn, however; I have not been to Brooklyn Heights in a while. Last night while walking through the hood, I stumbled upon this place. The name alone "Iron Chef House" sounded inviting. I am so glad we decided to stop in. I ordered the aspargus roll and the chef's special kirrin roll and my friend ordered sushi ... sea urchin, eel, salmon, tuna, and couple of other items. All of it was delicious and fresh. My friend was unhappy with the sea urchin, was expecting the caribbean sea urchin but it was from California .. I honestly did not know there was a difference. Overall, I would definitely dine here again and recommend it to friends.
