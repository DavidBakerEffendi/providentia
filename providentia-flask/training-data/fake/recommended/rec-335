Pomegranate sangria FTW! Service is fantastic and prices are very affordable. The paella however was more like a rice dish and not in the traditional pan with all the crunchy deliciosuness on the bottom, still good but I had different expectations. Mussels were amazing! Did I mention the pomegranate sangria? It is a MUST!
