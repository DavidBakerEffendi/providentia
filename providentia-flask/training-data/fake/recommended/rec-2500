A friend recommended this place and I thought it was great! The noodle soup comes out fast and piping hot. I got the Beef Noodle Soup and it was very flavor and delicious. I especially loved the noodles since it tasted very fresh. The only complaint I have is that it was a bit oily, but no matter.... for about $6 a bowl of goodness, I definitely will be coming back! :)
