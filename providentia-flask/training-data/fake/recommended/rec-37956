My husband and I have been waiting for Zavino to open since we live a few blocks away. Tonight was the "official" opening so we stopped by around 6pm. It was packed with a few couples waiting around on the sidewalk but there were seats at the bar so we went right on in. The restaurant is tiny but very nicely remodeled with exposed brick, dark woods and a white marble bar. Definitely an improvement from the check cashing place that proceeded it. They didn't yet have their liquor license so they were comping beer and wine. Off to a good start! We had a lovely glass of the cote du rhone. We each had the mixed green salad at $5 per. It was perfectly dressed with a balsamic vinaigrette. They had a cheese tasting menu and several entree choices along with the pizzas. We split a white pizza with smoked mozzarella, garlic and broccoli. It was very good. Prices were very reasonable (and you can't beat that free wine). For dessert they have panna cotta, chocolate-pear cake and biscotti. We split the cake and I highly recommend it. Moist enough with a deep, dark chocolate flavor, small diced pears mixed in and a side of whipped mascarpone and dark chocolate sauce. We'll be back!
