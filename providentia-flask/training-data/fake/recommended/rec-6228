Pylos, you are perfect in our eyes. We've been dozens of times over the years and it is always great. The food is phenomenal and great value for quality. The staff is usually very attentive. We've never ordered anything we didn't like and it is hard now to weed out what we don't and not totally over-order. Fabulous "neighborhood" spot. Only slight complaint is with parties over 2, even with a reservation, we always wait for a bit. They are usually honest about how long it will be though.
