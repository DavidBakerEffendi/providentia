DiNic's constantly slips my mind the second I walk into RTM, because I always come across something new and fun to eat here. I wouldn't say this was a meal for me. I think I was expecting a monster of a sandwich that I wouldn't be able to finish. I had the sandwich with the brie, its name escapes me. Dispite my assessment of it not being much to eat, I didn't finish it because of its drippiness. Even so, I would say do stop by Valley Shepherd's Meltkraft - the quality of the ingredients is wonderful and the service is friendly, too. Fun, imaginative sandwiches are on the menu and they taste delicious. Also, they have cream soda.
