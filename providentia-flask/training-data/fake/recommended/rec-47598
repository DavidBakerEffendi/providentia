I've only been once to pick up a cake for a party. I can't stress enough how important it is to have what you order ready when you need it to be, and they did. That in itself gained them my respect. They were extremely professional. It was a little overwhelming in the shop because there was no line, just a bunch of people standing around looking at each other and workers running around, or just standing around. I stood there for about 10 mins until I flagged down a flustered attendant who looked at me like a deer in headlights. When she found out I was ordering a cake, someone more experienced stepped in. That was kind funny to me at the time, but she was professional and helped me order the right cake. While I was there I decided to pick up some Italian cookies, that were to die for. I can't find anything wrong with them, but I will stay FAAAR away because I could see myself gaining a good 20 lbs. There's no seating or dining in the shop. It looks like it's just for ordering or buying pastries, but there is a diner next door that is owned by the same people/company, but not associated as far as I can tell. It's also priced very reasonably. In more trendier bake shops in the area I couldn't find anything in our company budget. The amount of cake I got and the size of it for the money was quite phenomenal.
