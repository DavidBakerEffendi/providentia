What a nice find!! I used to wonder what improvements can chipotle do make its burrito taste better. This place has the answer to that question. Probably the most delicious burrito bowl that I have ever had. There following were the ingredients - Cilantro lemon rice, chickpeas, saut√©ed onions, mango salsa, pickle.
