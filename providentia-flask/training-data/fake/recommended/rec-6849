I went to the Pines with a group of friends and we all enjoyed our dining experience. The service was attentive and not over bearing. The atmosphere was cozy but not crammed. They have a nice outdoor area that I want to check out as soon as it warms up. As for the food, it was all great. I particularly enjoyed a pasta dish with homemade ricotta. It melted in my mouth. Lastly, who ever made the playlist of music for that evening won my heart. I love early 90s R&B. Will definitely dine here again.
