Went here on a Saturday afternoon. Relatively empty. Seated quickly. Atmosphere was very trendy and clean. Food was good. Definitely would go there again. We ordered empanadas but what seemed to be the plate to order was the rotisserie chicken. EVERYONE had chicken. Will definitely order it next time we are in the area.
