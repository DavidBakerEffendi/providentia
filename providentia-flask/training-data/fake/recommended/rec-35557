Yea its good. I hate to give it 5 stars but I feel like I have to because the price/taste combo is too good. For like $11 or 12 bucks you can get a bowl of pasta piled with meatballs. I've tried different combos and I'm really digging the spicy sauce with the spicy pork balls. The meatballs are sauteed (maybe fried) to give a nice crisp exterior and a tender inside. The sauce has just the right amount of spice. I'm a firm believer that tomato sauce shouldn't be spicy but I really enjoy this. Overall its not the best bowl of pasta I've had, just the best bowl I've had for the price. This place always has a line, get it for takeout or sit at the bar at off hours.
