Okay food, really bad experience. I went for dinner with a friend who highly recommended the cobia, which he'd had many times before and really enjoyed. But when we received our dishes the fish was as tough as a pork chop. I very, very rarely send plates back but this was the dish we came for and there was no way it had been cooked medium rare, as we'd ordered. At this point the chef came out and angrily told us, "Hey, you're the guys who sent the fish back? Well why don't you order something else because I thought those were two beautiful pieces of fish and I'm not going to be able to cook it the way you like." That was embarrassing, and I spent the rest of the meal convincing my friend not to go and stab the chef. We should have left but I was really hungry by then. The menu was limited for me since I don't eat meat; the only other thing I could have was the arroz con queso. I'm not sure if chefs know this, but vegetarians really resent mushroom risotto. I can't count how many iterations of this boring dish I've had over the years. Is it really that hard to think up a main without meat? Because I do it every day. Anyway, it was serviceable. My lime pie tasted nothing like lime, only cream, and I found it revolting. My friend did like his pumpkin pecan pie, though. They may be capable of serving good food, but I absolutely will not return to this restaurant.
