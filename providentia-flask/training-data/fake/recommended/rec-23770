ZERO STARS. Party of 2. Seated immediately, great. Then over 11 mins and nobody approached our table. The funny thing is two other 2 tops right next to us were seated after us but got drinks, nachos and placed an order. That's when we left. I made eye contact with every employee but still no love. Go to Stateside, much better service and a great menu and bourbon list.
