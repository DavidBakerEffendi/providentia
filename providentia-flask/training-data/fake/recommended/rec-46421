Pretty simple review, because we had a pretty simple dinner: Food: 2 of us shared wild Alaskan salmon pastrami with pickled red onion and rhubarb salad and one Parma pizza. Salmon pastrami sounded interesting and delivered on taste. Really fresh and left you hungry for more. The pizza was exactly as good as everyone says. Great ingredients, perfect crust, and served at the perfect temp. Service: Our waiter was kind, attentive, and put up with our indecisive mentality. Also, the drink menu was displayed on an iPad, which was pretty unique and memorable. Ambiance: Perfect space with casual but refined feeling. Could be perfect for really any occasion, or just to grab a quick bite. Bottom line: I'm definitely coming back.
