Food: Phenomenal Ambiance: Cozy, rustic, borderline romantic for dinner, vibrant bar scene on Thursdays, packed Sat/Sun for brunch Price: Reasonable Service: Good, mostly consistent, at times slower depending on your server Cons: Close proximity to other tables, subpar coffee Brunch: Please order the Fritata - I DIE!!!!! DIE!!!! DIE!!! Sooo good! I usually order the fritata, the man orders eggs benedict, we share the goat cheese pistachio salad if not the out-of-this-world banana french toast. Other notable picks: chicken sandwich, scallops, chilean sea bass. EV always hits the spot, never fails to impress. I brought so many friends and family members Â here (both from town and out of town ) and everybody left satisfied. Run don't walk to Extra Virgin :-)
