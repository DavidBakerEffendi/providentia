My husband and I found this restaurant after we left another before we got our food. When we walked in and it felt right. Our waiter was very nice and made us feel welcomed. I ordered the lasagna and my husband had the fettuccine shrimp. Absolutely delicious!! I have had many lasagnas and this is by far one of the best. It was creamy and just right. My husband was very jealous of my choice. Don't get me wrong, his fettuccine shrimp was amazing too. Â Overall, it was a great way to end our weekend in Pennsylvania.
