As of my first visit, I wasn't too impressed with the place. Don't get me wrong, the cornbread is fantastic (I tried the bacon/jalapeno version) but the half-rack dr. pepper ribs were uninspired. I will give this place a second chance. I really want to like it, since it so close to my place and from what I can gather from the other reviews, a much welcomed addition to the neighborhood. but on first glance, it hasn't earned my loyalty yet.
