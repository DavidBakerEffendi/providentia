Errrr...were my taste buds broken today? Cafe Orlin is aiiiiight. Arrived around 2:20pm, we were seated shortly after arriving. The place is alot bigger inside than it looks on the outside. Sooo to the food. I wanted to order the pancakes but I had a salt tooth, so I ordered the Eggs Benedict and my bestie ordered the breakfast sandwich meal. Def had better eggs benedict in several other places (Jane!!), but the home fries were delicious. soft, with crispy skin and a touch of rosemary :) Marissa wasn't thrilled with her food, but no complaints...except that when she asked if the bacon in the sandwich was pork, our server gave her a look and asked what else would it be. She was cool for the most part though :) Dislike the OJ which is kind of tasteless and cool instead of cold and not pulpy enough and the cappucino which is basically all foam. I like the vibe of the place and the prices are great, would come back to try the famous pancakes.
