Went here for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. Fairly difficult to get a good reservation time - we booked a week in advance and still couldn't get a table until 2:00. But that actually made me more excited because a restaurant on 10th avenue and 20th isn't busy because of the environment. We asked for a seat outside and the hostess was very kind to us. After we had a bloody mary at the bar she ushered us out to our seat - they were very accommodating to us. When our food took a little long to be delivered (although we didn't notice until the waitress mentioned it) we were given two complimentary bloody mary's. I ordered the scrambled egg on rye toast (not a fan of biscuits) and my boyfriend ordered the poached egg dish. The fact that he had no complaints about his food is huge. He will eat anything without complaining except for a bad poached egg. I'd definitely recommend it for brunch and I hope to try it out for dinner!
