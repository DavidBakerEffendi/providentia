The ambiance is wonderful, the staff are super nice, and it's overall a great dining experience. I just wished I liked the pizza better. The rest of their food that I've tried has been great (the meatballs, the cheese platter, the ice cream). I've tried 3 different flavors of their pizza and each one has been just *almost* really good. The crust is bit too thin and soggy, maybe. It's a shame because I love pizza and I love this place.
