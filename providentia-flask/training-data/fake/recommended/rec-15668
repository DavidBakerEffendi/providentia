This is my favorite Thai restaurant - delicious food, reasonable prices, and a really cool atmosphere.  I'd recommend the Thai Salad, Basil Chicken, Pad Thai, Sesame Tofu, or any of the curries.   The only downside - I tried to come here with 8 people and they told me each person had to spend $20.  Strange policy but I can forgive them once I start eating their food!
