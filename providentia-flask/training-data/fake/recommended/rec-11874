Monday lunch must be their off day. My friend and I got Cuban sandwiches with a side of rice and beans. The sandwich was awful! Mystery meat with mayonnaise oozing out of it. It almost looked like salami in it because of the deep pink/red color but that piece must've been the ham. Yuck and yuck. Not coming back here again.
