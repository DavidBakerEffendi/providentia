Fun vibe, good food, great service from Jean Marie!  We stumbled upon this place after going to union hall.  My boyfriend is a carnivore and I'm veg- great options for both.  He loved the chicken wings and I loved the arroz con seitan.  And the empanadas were great!  Looks like they have an awesome happy hour until 11pm M-W, we'll be coming back!
