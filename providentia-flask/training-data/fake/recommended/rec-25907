I am very upset right now. Today was my best friend's birthday, and all she wanted in the whole wide world was a fantastic Italian dinner. So, being the best friend that I am, I set out on a mission to find an Italian dinner to make her swoon. Yelp led me to Piccolo Angolo. All I can say: we'll never be back. Well, fine. I'll say a bit more. I made a reservation for two. Thirty minutes before our scheduled dinner, I called back to confirm dinner and remind them of her b-day. Once there, we ordered a bottle of house wine. It was fine, good even. She ordered the gnocci bolognese, and I ordered the lamb ossobucco (sp?). It came out and it was good enough looking. She took a bite of hers, and the response was "meh." Since it was her birthday, I gave her a bite of mine before I took a bite. She said, "it's a bit cold." I took another bite, and it was COLD to the bone! FREEZING! LIKE WINTER! I sent it back. By the time it came back, she was done with her food, I was done with my side, and the entire bottle of wine was nearly spent. There were no apologies, the waiter avoided eye-contact for the rest of our stay, and didn't offer to comp us for the lamb. To add insult to injury, no one mentioned her birthday, and I was embarrassed for having suggested the place. I've been to far better establishments, with better food and service for the price.
