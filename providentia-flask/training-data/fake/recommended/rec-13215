Simply AMAZING! WOW WOW WOW. The service was great, even from the very fun way they can text you when your table is ready (which ull need because the wait is generally 1 hour +). Best pancakes ive ever had in my life, hands down. Fluffy, light and extremely tasty. Whatever their secret is...it changes the game on pancakes. We also got one of their chicken sandwiches and it was equally delish. Packed with flavor, great portion size and really tasty sweet fries. If you live in NY or are visiting..you MUST go here. 100% worth the wait time.
