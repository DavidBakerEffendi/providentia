A solid three-star joint. I ordered the roast duck noodle soup. Flavorful broth, and firm (in a good way) noodles. The duck itself was a bit of a different story - though there were a good many hunks, most of it was fat and bone. I got two solid bites of tasty meat. My male counterpart ordered the dumpling soup, and he was less than thrilled by it. Service was attentive and friendly - our tea was refilled at least twice. The kitschy decor was cute. When conversation turned stale, I simply looked past my dining partner to the ping pong table mural on the far wall that actually featured a real (miniature) net and paddles.
