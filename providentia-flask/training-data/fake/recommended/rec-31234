Got takeout which was decently portioned and well seasoned. I got the bhindi and the goat curry. The goat was tender and very good. As others have mentioned, the ambiance of the place was definitely lacking. Walls ere completely bare, and it had an impromptu office cafeteria feeling. The owner seemed more interested in taking an order on the phone than finishing mine. It's close so I will probably go again, but it's not anywhere I would bring guests (see ambiance).
