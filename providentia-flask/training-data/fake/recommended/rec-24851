My experience was disappointing all around. We ate with a group yesterday evening for a special occasion and it was anything but special. Our server was rude and slow. When you can tell the waitstaff resents you for dining at their restaurant, it might be time for them to move on. The food was bland and poorly prepared and served. Our calamari appetizer came out with our entree, was cold and had bits of what I imagine was sand in it. My salad was drenched in way too much dressing and had no redeeming qualities at all. My boyfriend ordered a burger that had no flavor. Another member of our group had to send their fries back they were so poorly prepared. I heard the deserts were tasty, but did not try them. All told, the meal wasn't worth the calories, and we all wished we had broken into smaller groups so we weren't charged the unearned mandatory service charge.
