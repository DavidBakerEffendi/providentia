Best vegan and vegetarian options for a sushi lover. Extremely convenient, affordable, FRESH and fast. Service is always pleasant. Sort of solves the problem of going out for Japanese with a vegan. I wish they were open until 2AM because it would hit the spot after a night of drinking, but other than that they're tops.
