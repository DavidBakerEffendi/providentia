Had a random craving for Mediterrenean food so i went to Falafel Hut. I got the Chicken Shawarma on pita and waited for 5 min. Short wait gave me GREAT RESULTS!!!!!!!! Pita was delicious and not overly cardboard-y like pita can usually get, and filling inside was great, but could've done without all of that extra cabbage. Best part was the tahini sauce!!!!! Get here ASAP!!!
