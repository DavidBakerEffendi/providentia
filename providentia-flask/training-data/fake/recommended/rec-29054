This Walnut St restaurant has no respect for it's patrons... four adults sitting around a tiny table that was barely bigger than one of those tv tables. Luckily, we are all average weight otherwise we would have had a tough time being squeezed in to the area in which we were seated.   They offer you a glass of water. I wanted to order another beverage but I quickly realized there would be no room once my entree came out. The meal is presented on a long board. Between the 4 of us, we couldn't fit them on the table.  I had to have mine hanging over the edge of the table quite a bit. Quite a balancing act.  The total bill for 4 burgers (two of which were portobellos) and 3 desserts was $108.00 before tip!  How crazy is that!  My daughter ordered the ice cream pop that came with choc sprinkles and crushed nuts.  This was noted prominently on the menu.  When it came out, we were shocked to see the ice cream pop was about 2 inches in length!  My portobello was very good, but for $15.00 hardly worth the price. It came with FOUR waffles fries. How generous of them!   And don't dare go to the restroom when it's crowded. The line could be very long. Only ONE restroom for women! Like I said ... it is very evident there is no respect for patrons at this establishment.
