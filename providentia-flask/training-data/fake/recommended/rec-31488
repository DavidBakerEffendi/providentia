Canal Street Grille was a disappointing dining experience. We felt rushed throughout the entire meal. We were pushed to order immediately upon our arrival. We were not finished eating our appetizers when our entrees arrived. The Athena Salad was superb. The pears, cranberries, apples and feta cheese were well balanced with the balsamic reduction. Our Scottish Salmon did not taste fresh and it was entirely overwhelmed by a thick and heavy pistachio paste. The desserts were just fair, but uninspired - chocolate mousse and creme broule. For $42 per person including tip we expected a better experience.
