Always come here as a group .. and come hungry! The dishes are great but they are very large; they aren't kidding when they say family style.  I've been to all of the Carmine's Restaurants in NYC, the one in Atlantic City, NJ and even the one inside the Atlantis Resort in the Bahamas.  The service and food are always great so I appreciate the consistency.   My favorites: Caesar Salad, Steak, Chicken Parm, Ice Cream Sundae.
