Loved this place and was actually pretty impressed with it!   Nothing like tall ceilings to make you feel like you're in a fancy shmancy place.  And the service was fantastic to boot!  Our server was extremely helpful in helping us choose our dishes and gave some awesome recommendations.  Basically said to get things you wouldn't normally get even though everything is delicious - so we avoided the hummus and falafel.  Also really appreciated that they staggered when all the food would come out.  Maybe because I was hungry, but my favorite thing was the chips and yogurt that they brought out in the very beginning.  haha Brussel sprouts - I'm usually used to brussel sprouts with bacon but this slightly sweeter version was awesome too Lamb and beef meatballs - my favorite!  Server told us to eat it whole... and it's basically like a gusher!  You get a little burst of soup or something from the meatball... so good! Duck shawarma - mmmm Bone marrow - not too much marrow but tasty Octopus - I wish they would give you all 8 legs... instead it's always a monopus - they did a good job though Lamb makloubeh - Also a server recommendation since the portion is big enough to share and it's delish!  so good and not gamey at all!  esp with the cucumber yogurt thing that accompanied.   Phoenician fries - garlicky deliciousness! Candy bar - pretty sweet but awesome.  esp liked the dulce de leche ice cream Pear and huckleberry cheesecake - yummm!
