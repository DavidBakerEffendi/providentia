The lighting in the private rooms is currently terrible! In past experiences in private rooms at Yakitori Boy, the main voerhead lamp was adjustable.  There this evening, the control for the light was locked, and the only option was super bright light glaring directly at you. Kind of a bummer when you're a bit shy, but trying to let loose and sing some ace of base.  If the lights were still adjustable, I'd most definitely give five stars.
