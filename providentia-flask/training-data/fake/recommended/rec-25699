Couldn't get reservations on Valentines so we went the next day.  Still very busy. Made reservations at 5:30 (can't make any after 6:30).  Nice piece of bread to start out ... garlic butter spread really nice.  Would have liked more bread with it! Ordered the recommendations of the server which was the Rib ragu with gnochi.  Portion was not overwhelming.  Very nice flavor. Also had the special of the night - Baked Tilapia over crab stuffed ravioli.  I have never seen ravioli that large before... also with asparagus.  Very good. The place was very charming but small...tables were spaced very close together. For dessert we both had the gelato.  Just the perfect size to compliment any meal.   Will definitely return...highly recommend.  BYOB
