Delicious and great atmosphere. We went to ikea and decided to grab some lunch before going home. We heard about this place and decided to check it out. We were seated with no wait on a sunday afternoon but by the time we left there seemed to be a 20 min to be seated. We both got the crab roll and a beer with a shrimp cocktail appetizer. The shrimp were big and delicious! The crab roll was also very flavorful. We cant wait to go back for the dollar oysters on Mondays and Tuesdays. Need more tastings :)
