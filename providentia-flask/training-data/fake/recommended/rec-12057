They're pizza is awesome, best around here (I think). But, the service first time around could be more accurate. I don't think I've ordered something without something being wrong (delivered to the wrong place, ordering buffalo chix but getting bbq chix instead). The redeeming characteristic is they're happy to fix it. I just make sure I'm not in a rush when I order from there.
