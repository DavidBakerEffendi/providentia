Dim lights, tasty sangria. Nice date spot (unless your girl is a super jealous person, because the wait staff is cute.) Just off the beaten paths of Astoria. I had the Peito de Park (Saut√©ed Duck Breast Marinate with Cachaca and Lime, served with Brown Sauce, Rice Mixed with Veggies (Arroz A La Grega)). Delicious. The staff was quiet and polite.
