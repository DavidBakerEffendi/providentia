This was one of my go to spots while I lived in Rahway for 11 years; first the original location where the parking deck is to the current location on Cherry St. It's a great neighborhood bar that draws from a big "neighborhood" a friendly place where they take the time to make you feel welcome, get to know you; I have been to a ton of events here, watch the Giants beat the Pats twice here, etc. And each time, always was made to feel like this is "my spot" It's a really great looking place on a nice downtown street, practically across the street from the Rahway Train Station (hence The Waiting Room) with a large municipal parking lot behind the building. The food is above average bar food to restaurant food; the menu is really good, the specials the same...on the menu it's noted that, along the lines "this could be made a thousand ways, so don't be shy to ask if you want something custom." It's a fun spot for all kinds and types, for the stop in for a drink to a party to dinner with the family, etc. etc. etc.
