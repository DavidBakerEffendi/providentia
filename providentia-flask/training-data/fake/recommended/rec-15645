Market Table is one of my favorite restaurants in New York. The food is so fresh and well-prepared, and it's got a charming, non-pretentious neighborhood restaurant feel. I first ate here while visiting the city for a work trip in the winter of 2010 and could never forget the epic deliciousness of the gouda gratin. Apparently I raved about it so much that years and a cross-country move to the city later, my husband brought me here for a birthday dinner. I was thrilled to find the lamb shank (crumbles on your fork!) and gouda gratin were still on the menu and (!!!) still every bit as delicious as I remembered. My husband had the evening's hog special. Look, I'm not a big fan of the fatty bites of meat, so I was sort of glad it was him and not me with the hog. But I had a bite and dang if that fat wasn't absolutely bursting with incredible flavor. We ordered (and enjoyed) a bottle of the Primitivo Quiles Monastrell, and you could certainly do worse at a restaurant for $40 (this is at the very bottom of the price range of their wine sold by the bottle). The service was just what you would want: unobtrusive and at that lovely medium cadence where you feel neither neglected nor rushed. Market Table qualifies for me as somewhere for a nicer dinner--a special date, a birthday, guests in from out-of-town, a new job. You won't feel like you need to sell a kidney while still enjoying a lovely ambiance and high-quality, beautifully presented food.
