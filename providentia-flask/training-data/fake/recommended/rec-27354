Friend from out of town wanted to visit ps1 so we popped in and to my surprise found m wells had relocated here. I kept rushing her through the exhibitions because I wanted to eat here haha. I wasn't a regular to the old establishment so can't really say I expected something from before. As a queens resident and a fan of pdc, it's just nice having a place like m wells in your hood. During this visit, i had the tortilla espagnol, which was very tasty (perfectly seasoned, not too heavy), and the stone crab claws, more on this later. My friend had an egg/tomato dish which she liked but said it tasted like eggplant parmesan, dunno what that means. My only complaint would be that when I was served the stone crab claws, the dish presented to me had a huge empty shell right in the middle of the bowl. Would I like to have meat in there...of course, but no biggie. It just would have been nice for the server to toss that piece away or turn it upside down to make the presentation more aesthetically pleasing. The crab was nice though--fresh, sweet and it came with wasabi mayo, which i think was a good complement. I would avoid coming here if I were alone though because they stick you in these uncomfortable pubic school seats with the table attach to the chair on one side. Bring a friend so you can enjoy what queens has to offer!
