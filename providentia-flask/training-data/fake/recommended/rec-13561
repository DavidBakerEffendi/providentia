I visited Ippudo and it was convenient because it was right around the corner from where I was staying. . All the waiters and waitresses were extremely welcoming and everyone greets you when you're seated. It was no more than a 25 minute wait, which wasn't so bad but I didn't like the fact that I needed to share my table with a bunch of people I didn't want to see and frankly didn't want to watch while eating my food. I ordered Â the Akamaru Modern with extra Kakuni becuase that's what everyone was raving about. The broth was really good but the ramen noodles were plain jane, just like any other ramen place. There are so little pork pieces which is why you need to order extra. The pork pieces are pretty fatty but they melt in your mouth like butter which is a plus. This place isn't that extraordinary but decent enough. Honestly I prefer to eat Santouka Ramen.
