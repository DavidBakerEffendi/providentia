Seriously damn good!  Had dinner tonight for my husband's birthday and it was WORTH every penny.  Definitely lives up to the hype.  We ordered the Kampachi tartare and Chili Lobster.  I am deathly allergic to shellfish so I didn't try the lobster but my husband LOVED it and he didn't seem to want to share any of it.  The Kampachi tartare was tasty but I would have preferred a bit more acidity, it finished a little on the sweet side for me. For entrees, we ordered the Chicken under a brick which was everything you wish chicken could be and then take it up a few notches.  Hubby had the duck special.  Boy, was that good.  I will be dreaming about both for the next few months. Dessert- we ordered the s'mores, cheesecake and 10 minute cookies.  All unbelievable.  S'mores were whimsy, cookies comforting and the strawberry rhubarb sauce on the cheesecake was out of this world. NOW the reason for 5 stars is for the EXCELLENT service.  Ian was our server and he went above and beyond to be accommodating.  Our sommelier (didn't catch his name) was fantastic, helpful, knowledgeable and great personality.  Chef Forgione came to our table to make sure everything was to our liking, suddenly all form of speech left me and I could only smile and thank him. Fabulous dinner.  Will be back for more.
