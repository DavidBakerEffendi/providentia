Very small restaurant on the inside, but delicious none the less. I had the meat ball smash which was sort of a mix between a burger and a sloppy joe in my opinion. Plus the side salad that it comes with isn't half bad either. The meatballs aren't anything above the ordinary, such as beef, chicken, and lamb. But, there was something about how they prepared my food and how you could add your own touch of a sauce onto your meatballs that made the experience quite unique and above average. To me, the sauce made all the difference. Overall, great little place for lunch.
