Was here on business, went last minute and turn out to be an nice Korean BBQ tofu place, limited menu, but  all you want is tofu and buckwheat noodle this is the place to go.  Prices are reasonable, great for cold winter nights. Seafood grill pancake has no seafood just bunch of onions, DO NOT ORDER it.
