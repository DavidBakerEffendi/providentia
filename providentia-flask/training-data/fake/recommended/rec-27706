I love going to this restaurant, especially on Sundays when most of the people there have just come out of church and are dressed in their Sunday best.  Even though there may be a bit of a wait to be seated, it's totally worth it!  I usually get the church plate.  With only a few exceptions, everything on the menu I've tried was delicious.. especially the chitterlings, fried chicken, cornbread, candied yams and stuffing. The collard greens and macaroni and cheese could be a whole lot better.  Aside from that, it's a pretty good restaurant with a very friendly staff.  I always find myself going back.
