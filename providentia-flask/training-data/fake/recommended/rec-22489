Eh, if I could give this place negative stars I definitely would. Service is horrific and be careful what you eat because it's a guarantee you WILL BE SICK for the rest of the night. I have had to endure this place twice now, solely because it is close to my office and the quickest, closest spot to get lunch with clients. However, after yesterdays fiasco I will never be back. El Camino you should be ashamed. Instead of trying to hire as many dirty staff members you can to compete with Dos Segundos- try coming up with your own atmosphere! My guest ordered a barbecue platter. Barbecue? Did you scrape it off the camino real??!? NO FLAVOR- I mean this stuff was terrible. Not only did he get sick and have to leave our company meeting early afterwards, but I spent my entire night with the worst stomach ache I've ever had. No thank you El Camino Real. I'll leave this place to the rude hipster crowd.
