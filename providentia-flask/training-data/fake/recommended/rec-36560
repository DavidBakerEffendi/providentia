The Food#1 You know I would thought the food here was absolutely the best since it's recommended by so many people. Plus being the high class expensive restaurant but I was completely wrong and I don't understand why it's so crowded all the time. We order the simply medium rare steak and fries for breakfast and it was horrible.  After we waited 40 minutes the steak came out to be over medium and it was completely dried even with the melted butter mixed together. I didn't want to tell the waiter to get us another dish and waited longer so we ate it. Didn't enjoyed it though. The Price #2 The price for the simply steak and fries was $30 that tasted horrible. Here's a picture: yelp.com/biz_photos/KgpO… The Restaurant #3 There is absolutely zero parking anywhere near this place and you'll have to either walk or get a taxi here. It's always crowded and we had to make reservations for a table and still we had to wait for 30 minutes. Now here's the part that got disappointed with the waiter service. My waiter was a smart ass and he asked us some rude questions when we order and before we get to answer them he would do it for us. He must be having some sort of a bad morning and it seems he's taking it out on the customers like ourselves. So we asked for a different waiter and when the first waiter walked by he would stare at us with the angry eyes.
