I was pretty depressed to leave Cobble Hill, where I lived within a mile of Calexico, one of NYC's only decent Mexican restaurants.  But within a week of moving to Crown Heights, I discovered this place, and all is well again in the universe.  We tried 5 different tacos, and every one of them was great.  The fried avacado is amazing.  The homemade chips & salsa are incredible.  Thank you, Gueros.  You're going to make me very fat over the next few months.
