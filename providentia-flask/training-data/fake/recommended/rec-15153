My father and I went on a trip to Philadelphia yesterday to visit Citizens Bank Park, and figured it was only right to try some cheesesteaks before the game. I searched online for the best place in Philly to go (wanting to avoid the gimmicky, tacky neon lighted aforementioned places which juxtapose themselves across the street from the others). We arrived around 3:00pm, and to our joy, there happened to be nobody on the line at the time, so we were able to get our food within ten minutes. I got a cheesesteak with mozarella and onions and was extremely pleased. Service was quick, and the food was amazing. Was the right amount of food, no fat in the sandwich, and no grease dripping from the sandwich. Would definitely go back there if I'm back in the area.
