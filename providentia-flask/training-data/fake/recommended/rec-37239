The Bagel Box has been and is a regular Sunday morning stop for our family for the last 6 years.  Bagel, bagels and more bagels.  Big and crusty on the outside and warm and doughy on the inside.  Lots of different varieties, sizes and types.  The sandwiches and wraps are all good and run on the larger size.  I usually eat half and save the other half for later or the next day.  Coffee is a little watered down, but if you don't like a strong coffee then it will do the job.  The grilled balsamic chicken breast is one of my favorites.  Parking is very, very tight in this lot.  But you can just park on the side street and walk.  I've ordered trays of sandwiches for parties before and they were great.  They've messed up a breakfast sandwich a couple times over the years but we just roll with it.  Not a big deal.  So what if its missing a slice of cheese, you probably didn't need it anyway on top of the Taylor ham and egg sandwich.  It's enough calories, fat and sodium for the day anyway.  Overall, if you're looking for the best bagels in the area, the Bagel Box is the place!
