My husband and I went to Bibou for our 1 year anniversary and we had a great experience.  We went on a Sunday in July for the (then $35) prix fixe menu and it was the night before they closed for a few weeks to go to France.  We were wowed by every single dish we ordered.  They served a chilled cauliflower soup that was incredible. I also had the foie gras ravioli and the pheasant stuffed with sweetbreads and red beans & rice.  It was good, but I remember being especially impressed with the marinated tomatoes and arugula that the pheasant was plated with.  I don't think I've ever had such basic ingredients that tasted that great.  We will definitely be bringing friends back to this place!
