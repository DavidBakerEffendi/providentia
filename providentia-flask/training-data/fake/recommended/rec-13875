With only 5 seats, this hole-in-the-wall is off the beaten path, but well worth the slight detour from Chinatown. Menu items are generally less than $2 and very tasty. My favorites are the fried pork bun and the sesame pancake with beef. Sometimes there's a slight wait for the next batch, but getting it fresh can't be beat!
