Terrific brunch spot. You should expect a minimum 15 - 20 minute wait on a Sunday afternoon, but the food is worth it. The menu is a diverse and interesting amalgamation of ingredients one might not expect to see on a plainer brunch menu: oysters, shrimp, cod, and so on. Sure, there's the standard fare of fluffy sourdough french toast, crunchy granola, and ingredient-filled omelettes, but Stone Park Cafe shines in the other menu items. Try the fried-oysters and eggs, the shrimp grits, or the cod cakes loaded with hollandaise sauce. If you're feeling particularly carnivorous, feel free to take aim at the bone marrow. With high ratings from NFT, Michelin, and our very own Yelp, I'm not sure this is a place a foodie can skip in good conscience.
