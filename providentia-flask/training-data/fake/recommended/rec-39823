Came here with a couple of friends who won't quit raving about the place and, well, not sure if I see what all the fuss is about.  As Randy Jackson would say, it was just a'ight for me, dog; I can't say I was blown away.  Tried the maple french toast and a few bites of the mac and cheese with truffle oil.  Service seemed kind of confused, and the place certainly isn't much to look at.  I'll give 'em another try next time I'm down here, but not making a special trip for it.
