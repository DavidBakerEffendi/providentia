AMAZING. (You can stop reading right here and go eat at Spice 28...) After departing early from Made in America, a friend and I ducked into Spice on a whim. It's beautiful from the outside: candles, modern furniture, dim lighting. The place just oozes chic. We began with the Tom Yum soup, despite the recommendation of the Spicy Cucumber from Dip, our waitress. It was so yummy (see what I did there? Tom Yum...yummy...?!): hot, a little creamy, with the perfect amount of vegetables and a touch of spice. For the second course, I had the Ma Pao Tofu and my friend had the Pad Thai with Tofu. My entree was just as Dip had described it, hot and rich. The Pad Thai was light and fresh with crispy tofu strips. I almost stole the whole dish! We also had the opportunity to try the Spicy Cucumbers. GET THEM. THEY ARE INCREDIBLE. Yeah, they're spicy. But they're also ridiculously good. I can't explain it. I can't describe it. Just eat them and thank me later. We split a pumpkin cake thing for dessert. It was good, not great. Overall, we had an excellent experience that I can't stop raving about! I'll definitely be back to see Anna and Dip and their delicious, affordable food.
