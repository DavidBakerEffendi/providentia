I got some resistance on not giving this spot 5 stars, but I'm honest in my reviews and the service, slow drink refills don't grant a 5 star rating. I also wasn't blown away by some of the dishes like everyone else. However, some dishes I did find outstanding, for example, cavier pie (best thing I've had in a while), broiled oysters (everyone liked the broiled vs the raw oysters), cauliflower salad, and cod. Other items that were good: tarjarin, lamb tortelini, lobster, and one person especially loved the octopus (i just wasn't a fan of the butter beans, it threw the texture off for me). The lamb ribs were cooked well but were too fatty. My least favorite was the berkshire pork.
