Awesome lunch!!! Unique and surprising.  I had what I thought was going to be the typical Chicken Caesar salad.  What a great surprise.  I wanted to try everything on the menu just to see how different things would be.  I enjoy eating out just about everyday.  The staff was great and really passionate about what they are doing differently.  High quality all around.  Just go and trust the chef!
