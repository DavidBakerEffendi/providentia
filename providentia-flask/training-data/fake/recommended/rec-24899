the bartender was friendly but made me a g&t in a chipped glass. the food was a great deal - $30 for a three course prix fixe. the food was done well - i started with a house-made pate which was surprisingly delicious. my second course was decent - salmon, so you can't really go wrong. i finished with a grand marnier creme brulee Â - the crust was too thin (it is the best part) and the alcohol hadn't mellowed. i like a strong alcohol taste, mind you, but in my drinks and not my food. all in all, a lovely place but i'm not sure it merits a return.
