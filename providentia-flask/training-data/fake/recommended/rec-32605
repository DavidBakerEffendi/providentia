I'm know I've been giving out a lot of 5 stars, but I just can't think of any complaints about this place. I've been twice,and got a table pretty quickly, and the food, service, and ambiance are all great/. The food is very high quality, featuring a lot of local, organic, and free-range stuff. The branzino and ribeye were amazing, as are the salads! Such a refreshing find for soho, where most of the restaurants are about the "scene" and not the food, read more about my experience here on my food blog:http://thedappleddachshund.com/2011/12/02/Â­where-pretentious-and-soho-arent-synonymous/
