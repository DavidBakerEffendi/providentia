I have had nothing but good food in New York. Everywhere you turn there are wonderful places... But this by far was one of the best meals yet! I went here with my family in a Monday evening, which was great because we got right in! Atmosphere: This place has a great vibe! We sat on the second floor by the window looking out on the street. Toloache has a classy casual atmosphere. Service: All I can say is wonderful! Our server Xavier was extremely efficient, giving us great recommendations and fast service. Food: Delicious! We started with the guacomole trio, which was great. Our table entr√©es were the Camarones Toloache, Paella de Quinoa, and the fish and brisket tacos. All three were great! As sides we got the fried brussel sprouts and the avocado fries... More than delicious. Desserts: Yum! Try the Crepes! Overall 5 stars! I definitely hope to get back here one day!
