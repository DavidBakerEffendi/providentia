The family and I love this place... It's a given that this is not authentic Mexican (the word Tejas coupled with the Cajun portion if the menu sort of give that away)  so I'm not certain why that seems to be given a good deal of attention on the reviews. What they do make, they make well... And the price simply cannot be beat! The chips and salsa were fresh ans delicious, and they gave us two bowls of sauce and serranos AND jalapeños on the side so the adults could spice up our sauce while the kids could enjoy the milder version...what restaurant does that?!!I had the blackened salmon over salad and the vegetable jambalaya. My hubs had the combo fajitas and it was all fantastic. The dressing on my salad was a light lime vinaigrette and it was fantastic. The jambalaya was flavorful and chock full of fresh veggies like broccoli, cauliflower, mushrooms, carrots and onions. My husband liked his dish very much a well. The kids had large chicken quesadillas with fries, a juice (or they can have soda or milk) and a full-sized M&Ms or Starburst: and all that was for $4 each! The best part was the awesome server we had... Didn't catch his name but he was patient, friendly, super efficient and have the kids both candies each (citing it was Easter so why not?). He's stockie, very friendly and is Latino himself... If you go there, I recommend sitting in his area.
