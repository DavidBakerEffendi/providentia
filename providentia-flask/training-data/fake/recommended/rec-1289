El Vez has a lot going for it:  great atmosphere, unique cocktails, and an array of guacamoles to choose from.  Go for the crab.  It's awesome. Things aren't cheap here but they're not outrageously expensive either. Go make funny faces in the photo booth.  Especially after a few blood orange margaritas.
