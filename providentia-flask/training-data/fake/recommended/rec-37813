Doc Magrogans was a great addition to U-city. We needed a great sea food place in the area and they filled that need. I've ate here twice in the last month and both times have been great. The first time it ate solo at the bar and the bartender Ben was great. He suggested the lobster Mac n cheese which was out of this world. They also have a good beer selection. The second time I are with my girl in the dining room around the back which is beautiful. We had the lobster ravioli and a seafood combo- the scallops were my favorite. The manager showed us the up stairs private dining room which seems great for an event. I will be back!
