I came here with my German friend and it was worth it just to see the look of bewilderment on his face as he tried to comprehend the menu, which (for lunch) is split into: prix fixe, raw bar, small dishes, country hams, local/seasonal and large dishes...[does not compute]. We came here on a Saturday on the recommendation of a friend. I'm not usually down for the latest trendy spot and was dreading the inevitable crowd, but we actually got a table pretty quickly. And man, you cannot deny that most of the food here is outta-this-world-delicious. The items that aren't are, at the very least, interesting innovations on the tired dishes you usually see, so I look at it as expanding my horizons. The pork buns were amaaaazing, perhaps the best I've ever had. The bbq rib sandwich was the perfect mix of tastes and textures - crispy crust, soft, tangy meat inside...yummmm. We also had the spicy rice cakes (as recommended) and the brussel sprouts - both of which were fun twists on fairly simple dishes, but not my favorite. The same goes for the PB&J pie, which tasted like cold grape jam fro-yo plus crushed peanut brittle: weird, but good. The one complaint I would have is that it's fairly difficult to build a cohesive meal out of the hodge podge of options offered: the menu is a little skitzo. The wait staff was almost brusque but not rude, and the food came fairly quickly - pretty standard for NYC. All in all, it's worth a visit.
