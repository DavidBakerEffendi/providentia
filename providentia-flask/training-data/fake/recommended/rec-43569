Loved the place! My husband and I went there on a Friday evening and boy, it was packed!! The hostess was very sweet and made sure we were comfortable and got seated quickly. The food was delicious although the service slacked presumably because it was a full house! FYI: This place is def not for a couple who is looking for a quiet romantic dinner setting.
