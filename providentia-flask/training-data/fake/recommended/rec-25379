Came here on a recommendation from a friend.  The atmosphere was warm and inviting.  My party enjoyed the food and wine. I would suggest the warm octopus salad, pappardelle, and apple crisp.  Their house wine was fantastic.  Their portions are not skimpy but not too much to feel stuffed.  I would plan a day in the city just to come here again.
