I understand the vibe corner bistro is going for. It's very no-frills. I had always wanted to go. We got lucky on a saturday night, because we (party of 5) got seated as soon as we came in. Burger was delicious, and I am critical, but it was not the best I have ever had (Royale! go there!). Anyway - fries were also delicious. I kindof wish they wouldn't use plastic plates though - so wasteful and honestly so sloppy. Anyway, everything is really cheap, and there is no menu (they're on the wall) so basically you better know what you want, and it needs to be a burger or some kind of greasy food. Our waiter brought us everything, and fast, but he seemed to be in not a great mood. But honestly, I think it fit with the place.
