A very good & unique style of pizza. A friend & I tried to get a sandwich at Paesano's a few weeks ago, but forgot they keep wierd hours.  We tried Santucci's instead and it was defintely a good call. It was dinner time during the week & the place was busy, but we were still able to snag a table right away.  We got a large pizza with pepperoni & sausage & we absolutely demolished it. Its a square pie, cheese on the bottom, sauce on top & "toppings" somewhere in the middle.  The crust is great - strong enough to hold itself up when you pick it up, but not so thick that you get filled up right away & done perfectly. Service was fine.  It didn't take too long for the pie to come out & they were pretty attentive with soda refills. I'll definitely be back, hopefully soon.
