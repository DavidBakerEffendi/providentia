Let me start with... This was my first visit and I'll probably go back. We ordered the following: pork nuggets, chicken wings, ribs, steak, mac n cheese, and s'more tart for dessert. The Good: We were seated promptly upon arrival. The ambiance was nice. What's not to love about deep fried pulled pork balls? The wings were perfectly seasoned and fried. The ribs were tasty but not very meaty. The greens that accompanied the ribs were very bacon-y. The mac n cheese was good enough. The s'more tart was rich and delicious. The Bad: I requested my steak to be medium well, but it first arrived medium rare. I had to send it back. After receiving it the second time it still wasn't done enough, but whatever. It was rather bland and had a weird sauce. I was over it after a few bites. I was really disappointed because I was in the mood for steak and our waiter highly recommended it. If I block out the steak experience, it was a pretty solid meal.
