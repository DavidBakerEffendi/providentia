Very yummy tapas.  The $45 chef's special gave us a great variety of dishes from salad to scallops scewers to lamb chops (desserts are separate).  It was a lot of food and we were pretty full by the end.  White sangria was good too.  We were saying that the restaurant looked like it came straight out of Crate&Barrels, but the food was good enough that it didn't bother us.
