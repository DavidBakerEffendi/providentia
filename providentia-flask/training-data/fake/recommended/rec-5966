I've yet to have this food sober so keep that in mind.  The last time I was there, it was 30 degrees out and drizzling.  I made my then gf(now wife) wait in line with me.  What reassured us that it was good food, was that the cabbie got in line with us.  If you hop in any cab in NYC and say take me to chicken & rice, 98% of the time they'll know.  Be careful of the white sauce, it's spicy and you might regret it in the morning.   C&R is hands down the best late night food.
