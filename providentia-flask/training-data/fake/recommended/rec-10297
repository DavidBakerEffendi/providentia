I was actually pretty disappointed. I came for happy hour where you buy a drink and have a free "buffet". However the buffet consisted of 4 plates of food that was not heated and just sitting out there. There was a pasta dish, cheeseburgers, and potato salad. I then ordered from the menu. The bruschetta was pretty good and the arugula salad was delicious . However my ravioli was horrible ! It was a huge flat noodle with a tiny tiny center stuffed with barely anything ! Super salty and oily as well. Super disappointed, especially since I paid $20 for it! My roommate ordered the sweet Â potato tortellini and it was nothing special . Our waiter Henry was nice and attentive . The dark chocolate s'mores dessert was good but the portion was small . The cranberry orange margarita was great and the only reason for the 2 star. I do not think I will be coming here again .
