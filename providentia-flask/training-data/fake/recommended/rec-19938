Me and two roommates came here during the summer and I still remember every part of that meal. It was one of the best meals I've ever had! We had a 9 PM reservation but ran about 15 minutes late and they still seated us immediately. Goat Cheese tart- AMAZING! This is a must have. I was having a really difficult time sharing this with my roommates lol. It is savory and delicious and I love the texture. Escargot- This tasted like escargot I've had in paris and it was delicious! Especially with the bread. Moules Rochelaises- Again this was delicious. The apple and curry mixture was awesome. I got the Tournedos Rossini (the filet mignon) as my entree and the meat was cooked to perfection. It is topped with foie gras so I basically couldn't ask for anything better. Also Entrees come with unlimited vegetable sides and even if you are not a vege person you will love them. They are delicious! I can't wait to go back!
