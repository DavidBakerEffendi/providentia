I want to eat at Lucali for the rest of my life. Or maybe one day I'll be so rich that I can build a mini-Lucali's in my basement so I can eat it every day. Â Absolutely delicious calzones and pizza, a warm atmosphere, and BYOB. Aside from the wait (we called ahead and were able to be sat at 9), the only "beef" I have is with the prices of toppings: $3/each and the night's special of artichokes was $8! Nevertheless, we had 6 people and got a ton of food, and the bill was only $21 each.
