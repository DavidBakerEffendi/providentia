I really wanted to love this place but it fell short of expectations.  You would never think that an izakaya would be remotely close to Rockefeller Centre but this one is hidden in the basement of a Japanese restaurant.  First off, you will wait on line unless you arrive when they open.  They are that busy.   We ordered a lot of typical dishes(12 or so) and they were all okay.  Nothing really stood out.  Someone mentioned that the frog legs were delicious, but I didn't try them. Just a few tips: it gets very crowded and loud, don't come in a party greater than 4 or 6, and you will probably wait on most occasions. Service here was attentive and quick.   I would give them 3.5 stars but can't quite give them 4.  So I'll have to round down to 3 stars.
