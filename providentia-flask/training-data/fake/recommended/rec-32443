When you only see 4-5 things on a menu, you assume they better do it well and tastes delicious. Pho 501 does just that. I've been to another spot in East Hartford that had better atmosphere and had Pho with broth that is just as good. I stopped in during rush hour (anytime from 11a-1p tues-fri). i was blown away by the amount of people crowded into this spot that had a diner setting with snow on the ground. Since my first visit a few weeks ago, I have stopped in and ordered take out 4 times in 3 weeks. This spot is awesome and will be back again and again.
