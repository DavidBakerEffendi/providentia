Ok, I came here to celebrate my last day in Jersey.  The usual suspects were there:  Los X., Daniel C., and Johannes R. And as usual, we were served an immense amount of food. The picadinho was superb--just the right amount of kick. The shrimp apps nailed it again. But the winner of the night was the seafood platter.  Well, it was a trough actually.  Clams, mussels, lobster, shrimp and scallops all floating in a cilantro-infused broth.  My God...  This dish was soooo freakin' good.  I can't say enough.  I forced myself to eat more.  No one could stop me.  The other guys were telling me to relax; I didn't pay attention. This may have been the best meal I've had all year...
