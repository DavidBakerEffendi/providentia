visited Fri night 5/30/08 Pizza is the 5th food group according to my husband.  So we HAD to do the Grimaldi's thing even though there was a 40 minute wait in line to get in.  This is not a romantic place unless you call getting squeezed into the middle of a long community table romantic.  And, there's no such thing as a private conversation because it's so loud that you have to shout across the table.  At which point the people all around feel the urge to join the conversation.  (At least everyone was friendly.)  But I digress... Have to say the pizza was pretty darn good.  Okay, maybe great.  We had no problem finishing a large sausage and roasted red peppers with a bottle of valpolicella. And the place was like a big party - pretty fun after all.
