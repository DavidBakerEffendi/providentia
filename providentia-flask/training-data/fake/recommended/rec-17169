I went to venus today and at first we got lost looking for this place. As we arrived there was no parking near the restaurant so we had to park 2 blocks away. When we went inside the restaurant it was definitely not a fancy place, it looked more of a house with a bunch of brown people eating food together. Â my girlfriend and I ordered the tostones, lomo saltado, chaufa mixto, and chorizos. The chorizos looked burnt when it came to our table, it was just okay. I definitely had better chorizos, the tostones were decent. The lomo saltado the gravy was good and the fries, but the meat tasted like it needed more seasoning. Finally the chaufa rice with seafood honestly say was good. The seafood is definitely fresh, but what everyone else said two bites and you're full. I gave this place 3 stars because the food was just okay, but the service was really nice. The waitress was attentive and very nice. Overall I will not come back here again, or if I do try something new.
