It's a place I'd definitely go for happy hour or for drinks, but the food is inconsistent. They have GREAT happy hour specials and a pretty darn good beer menu.  They have a stout on tap, which is impressive for any place in suburban New Jersey.  TV screens adorn every wall.  I'd definitely have fun watching a game here. But I came for dinner.  My burger was solid--nothing special.  We had some wings, which were pretty good, but not as spicy as we had thought.  The cheesey fries were nasty--they melted the cheese, but it had solidified and gotten cold by the time it was brought to the table. The place was pretty well furnished and the staff was friendly.  I'd go here again for happy hour.
