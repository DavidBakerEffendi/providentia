I've been meaning to come here but never had an occasion. My friend was visiting from London and it was his birthday, so I figured what better time to try the acclaimed ABC Kitchen. The food was excellent. Bright, light and filling. There were so many textures and the flavors blended well. The presentation was perfect. The servers were efficient and polite. It was everything I hoped for and had expected. I didn't care for our chairs. Their location in the restaurant and design were a bit uncomfortable, but otherwise gorgeous experience overall.
