I went to this place because I read Risa Y. and Eunice T.'s review. I don't know you guys but if Asians say its good. Then it must be good! And it WAS!!! Thank You Risa and Eunice for being Asian and providing a good review. Now I don't if they infuse pho flavor into the meat. I doubt it. I just think the smell of beef, hoison, bean sproouts, basil, and siracha, tricks my brain into thinking Pho love. And then my tongue tastes the Pho and then I'm some how transported into my friends Mom kitchen! Hi Vicky and Celeste's Moms!!!! Your Pho's are delicious.
