Truly one of the best on Smith St. The food always delights, and their Weds night specials are terrific (Gumbo nights, Chili nights... depends on the month). Great for dates, small groups, or bringing the out of town guests in for a snack. The drink selection is wonderful and I trust their pairing recommendations. Terrific little place - usually room unless it is a Sat night!
