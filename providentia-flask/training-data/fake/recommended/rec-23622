OK, a snow storm, a wretched bitch of a woman we met in Norristown, sloppy roads, lack of sleep and general hatred of everything this morning made me a total scumbag...and a hungry one.   Into Dalessandro's we go for a cheese-steak and a lager.  Behind the counter the heavens open into a ray of sunny happiness as our wonderful waitress smiles and greets us in the way she always cheerfully does, listens to my complaint about the awful person I had dealt with, takes our order and sends us on the way in a short 20 minutes of culinary bliss....yes and smiling all the time.  Love her! I LOVE this place.  No pretensions.  No credit cards.  No french fries (a negative...the only negative but totally acceptable) Only great, fast steaks, gallons of free peppers and pickles, a huge selection of beers and sodas, music on, game on, lines of eager people for the carry-out.   Dalessandro's is my own personal fave for Philly's sandwich-meat contribution.
