Amazing food eat octopus everything here. Seafood ramen-the noodles are out of control. Everyone in our party was obsessed with the pork belly- if pork is your thing def grab pork belly kimchi. (I don't eat land animal, but everyone else would not shut up about it so it was worth a mention) And grab a cocktail they are awesome! I recommend the white walker and not just because of the name.
