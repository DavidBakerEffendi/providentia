It is about time philly got some decent, healthy lunch options.  This place reminds me clearly of my days living in DC. Use of the computer screens is easy and convenient. I wish thy included calorie counts! Salads and stir fry always tastes fresh and I well made. I wish they chopped the ingredients more thoroughly for the  salads.  A pricey lunch option but certainly unique.
