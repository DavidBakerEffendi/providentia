American Flatbread is one of my favorite restaurants in Burlington. The service is good, the wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable and the food is AMAZING. It gets packed on the weekends and reservations are difficult so just be ready to wait a while for a table. They have a great beer list and brew several beers in-house. The brick fire pizza is YUMMY--I think I've tried almost all of them and I would recommend them all. The salad is good and they have a few dessert options. Highly recommend!
