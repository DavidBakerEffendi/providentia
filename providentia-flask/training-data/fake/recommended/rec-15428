There has never been a line here including even Friday nights, which you hardly find in NYC. Â  The interior decor of Uva is absolutely beautiful, it gave off an extremely romantic vibe. The lights are very dim and there are small candle-like lights on. The outdoor patio in the back of the restaurant is equally beautiful as the inside. If the weather is nice sit outside! The food is delicious! Especially the Gnocchi. Hands down one of the best Italian spots in the Upper East Side.
