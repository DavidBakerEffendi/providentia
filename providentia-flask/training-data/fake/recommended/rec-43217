Spoiler Alert.........it's off the chain, the end. Â It's great to have an affordable and healthy option in the area. The baked falafel is delicious, pair it with a side of home made hummus (with just enough garlic) and for under $10 you're sitting pretty and ready for your second wind. You can also call ahead to pick up your order during the lunch crush which is smart in such a small restaurant but they do offer stools if you prefer to eat in.
