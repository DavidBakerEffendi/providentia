Adorable BYO right off Rittenhouse square. I went here for a large group event and the amount of food they served us for $35/person was astonishing. They brought out appetizer after appetizer. I had the scallion crusted lemon sole fish for my main course, and it was delicious. I'm not sure how they got scallions to taste like bacon, but it was great. This restaurant gets an extra star for the amazing creme brulee. I never have been a fan of this dessert, mostly because I'm usually more a fan of chocolate desserts. However, their version of creme brulee blew my mind away. The crunchy top part (I guess that's the brulee of creme brulee) was so well done. It had great flavor and every bite had a crunch. The creme part of it was fantastic too. It was so light and decadent. I essentially licked the bowl clean! If you order nothing else, try the creme brulee!
