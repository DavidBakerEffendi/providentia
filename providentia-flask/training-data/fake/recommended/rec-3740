A friend of mine made me try Il Porto claiming they had great Brick Oven pizza when I said I love Graziella's pizza. The pizza was ok but I prefer the infused Basil taste of Graziella's pizza. I also prefer Graziella's calamari. The calamari at Il Porto is seasoned some kind of way and it's just weird. Il Porto is great however in that I can pay with a card over the phone for delivery where as Graziella's I have to order takeout at the location or through Seamless.com. Il Porto also has a quicker response time for delivery. I do occasionally still order from here.
