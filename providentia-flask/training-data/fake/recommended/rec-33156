An out of the way gem, Malagueta offers excellent authentic Brazilian food in a cozy atmosphere.  We live right around the corner so we eat here a few times a year, sometimes with the kids (both under 10), sometimes without. The menu is not extensive but many dishes stand out for their simple, yet flavorful elegance.  The shrimp stew, Frango con Vin Branco (Chicken in white wine sauce) and Corvina Com Vatapa (roasted fillet of pollack) are a few of our favorite dishes. For appetizers, the warm lentil salad with goat cheese is excellent and the Linguica Grelhado is "to die for" - grilled Brazilian sausage with fried Yucca slices with a delicious herbed mayonnaise dip. My mouth waters just thinking about it. If you're there on a Saturday (and you like robust. meaty dishes) be sure to check out the Feijoada - it's a national dish of Brazil combining pork, black beans, bacon, sausage all slow cooked to perfection and served over rice with a crumbly topping.  And top off your meal with the passion fruit mousse for a sweet flavor explosion.   Service varies a bit, can get slow when they get busy, but never rude or pretentious. The owner Heriberto is usually cooking in the back but his wife is frequently out in the restaurant helping the wait staff. They are closed on Mondays, but open the rest of the week. Weekday evenings are usually very quiet (particularly early) so it would make a great place for a first date or romantic night out during the week. Even on weekends it's manageable but can get a bit noisy when crowded (there are no booths, only rows of tables). We've had parties there up to about 20 people and they are very accommodating (just make sure you reserve your party well in advance as it is not a large restaurant).   Overall, a nice place with solid service, nice ambiance and tasty food.
