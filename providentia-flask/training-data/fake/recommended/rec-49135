We thoroughly enjoyed last night's meal at Joseph Leonard.  The meal began with a greeting from Lacey who is very sweet.  The highlight is the food. We both loved the pate and the amazing vegetables.  The cauliflower appetizer was light and pleasing and the sprouts were deliciously spicy.  The portions were very generous.   All in all I would highly recommend this restaurant.
