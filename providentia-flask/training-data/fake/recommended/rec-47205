Hands down the best Thai food I've ever had, and I've been to Thailand. My friends and I split three dishes, including the Rad Nar, which was the special for the evening. We also had the green papaya salad, which was sublime, perfectly tangy and spicy. They also have a solid beer selection, including local craft brews. The decor is fun and makes you feel tropical, even in the middle of a snowstorm in NYC.
