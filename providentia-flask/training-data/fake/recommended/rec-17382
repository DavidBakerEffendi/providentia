Nevada Diner is a typical NJ diner. They have an expansive menu that includes everything from breakfast served anytime to burgers & fries and a few Greek staples like spanokopita, gyro and souvlaki. To me, you can't really complain about the prices because they give you large portions. My only issue there is the "sharing charge" if you want to split a dish with a friend. The food is generally pretty good, we usually eat breakfast but neither I nor my husband care much for their home fries. They're just bland, no onions or anything to give them flavor. Service can be iffy. Sometimes, we are seated and promptly brought water and greeted by our server. Other times, we sit and wait for our invisibility pills to wear off. Particularly on a weeknight after 10pm, despite the place being practically empty, we wait, and wait and wait for service. One older waitress seems to question why we order what we do and she even chastised me for not eating my carrots once! The outdoor seating is wonderful during nice weather. The large umbrellas provide plenty of shade and the outdoor speakers provide background music while you chat and wait for your food.
