Woohoo! I absolutely love Whitman and bloom. Pretty much every date I go on I bring them here. It's a perfect spot to sit at the bar and get to know someone. Perfect lighting and awesome music at just the right volume. Super super helpful bartenders and waitstaff. The hostess is the bomb too. I will say that I'd recommend this place more for drinks and apps than anything else. The food is great but nothing to write home about. Go here!
