I've been dreaming about their lentil salad for days now. Imagine that -- if a lentil salad can have you swooning then you really know you've found the best. Every course was divine. Â The ambiance was just perfect, as well -- not too dark, not too loud. Highly, highly recommended. I can't wait to go back!
