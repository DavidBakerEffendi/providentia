Dinner was delicious, filling, and didn't break the bank. Portions were on the "larger" side; Take for instance, the lamb ragout which could be ordered as an appetizer or an entree. I opted for the appetizer portion and when it arrived, it was definitely larger than any appetizer I had ever had. There was a huge dollop of ricotta that topped the lamb ragout pasta that made my belly smile. The crab croquette was nothing to write home about. I chose it over the Mac and Cheese because I thought it was the more "healthy" choice. I caught a whiff of the dish and was thinking about the gooey goodness the rest of the night. I highly recommend the duck breast done medium rare. It was juicy and tender and the cous cous and tomato chutney were great in accompanying the "gamey" meat. Also a great entree to share. For desert, your best bet is the warm chocolate cake. It reminded me of lava cake. I throughly enjoyed the molten, warm cake dusted with powered sugar with pistachio ice cream, which had real pistachio in it. Great ambiance and amazing service. I was late for my 7:30 reservation and they weren't upset at all. High marks for Rye!
