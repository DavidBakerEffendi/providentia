My boyfriend & I finally tried this place last night-- it's long been on our "list"-- & we both had a great experience. First of all, it's CHEAP!  Most of the entrees are like $8 or $9.  And the portions are BIG!  (Just look at all the people walking out with doggie bags. Go ahead!  LOOK!!)  The food was great too.  I got the pineapple pork fried rice.  The portion was enormous & it was very tasty.  It was a tad on the oily side, but I was still happy with it.  My boyfriend ordered the Kang Gai curry & he absolutely loved it.  He ate every last drop of that stuff!  He was ENAMORED with it!  I was getting jealous!! We ordered the chicken curry puffs (a special, apparently) as an appetizer & the bill still only came to like, $22... TOTAL.  Of course we opted against having drinks that night, but that wouldn't have done much damage.   What's also nice about this place is that it's sleek & clean, with a modern decor.  The bar area is very hip (I hate that word) & seems to pack in a nice crowd at night.  The kitchen is exposed, which is cool.  And it looks like they have DJs spinning regularly, though not the night we were there, which is probably a good thing, as other reviewers say it tends to get a bit loud.   But we had a very nice first experience at Joya.  We will definitely be back next time we want to go out for a quick meal without spending a fortune (which is often!). UPDATE: A few months after writing this review, my bf & I continue to come here A LOT.  And we're always happy with the food, prices, etc.  But here's one word of warning: do not ever call in order to pick up!!!  In fact, don't ever call them, period.  They are like, seriously incompetent when it comes to answering/working their phone.
