D-E-licious!! I have either been eating subpar pizza my whole life or this literally is the best pizza I have ever had, and I think its a little of both. This place is amazing!! I came here on a Sunday afternoon with two friends and waited less than 20 minutes to be seated. While in line we quickly became friends with two New Yorkers that were such a hoot! The conversations and their sense of humor made us forget we were waiting in line for the most delicious meal! Gosh I love NY! Once we were seated the owner (I think) came over to greet us and make sure we were comfortable. Our waiter promptly took our orders and made awesome suggestions. We ordered a small size Bufala Mozeralla and the Mozzarella, Prosciutto, Arugla, and garlic pizza (No. 4 special on the menu). Wow! So amazingly good!! I put on 5 pounds just thinking about it. Julianna's is a hallmark restaurant of Brooklyn and if you are in the area and miss out then good luck finding better pizza because it doesn't get better than this folks! Historical aside: its well known that Grimaldi's is the original best pizza in Brooklyn which is right next door to this place but the name was bought out when the original Grimaldi's closed down. So Julianna's, is actually named after the mother of Patsy Grimaldi's the original founder and Julianna's is in the Grimaldi's original location. I only learned this waiting in line behind some Brooklyn residents...but fun facts nonetheless.
