The Mojitos are amazing.  Especially at the happy hour prices. They are strong, made properly and include the sugar cane which seems rare now a days.  Adding the fact that one of the female staff loves to add one or two on the house every time I go only adds to this place as  a personal fave. The appetizers such as Spanish Bruschetta are simply, very cheap and quite tasty.  I even brought a friend who is a chef and he was very pleased with the steak tacos, lean meat, good salsa and the Brushettas Machego cheese.   The location is right near the park and in the heart of East Village and it's outdoor seating (weather permitting) provides some ideal watching.   The place does lose its luster a bit in the winter - - so what do they do? They extend the happy hour during winter and I know where I will be during those times.  Enjoy.
