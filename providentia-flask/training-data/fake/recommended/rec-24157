My bf and I were in town looking for a cute, yummy, affordable dinner and as usual, Yelp was spot on with this recommendation. We parked in Chinatown and were beginning to wonder where on earth this place was when we happened upon the big windows, and candle-lit gem on the edge of the neighborhood. I won't begin to mention all the dinner options, but suffice it to say they are diverse and good. I ordered the coconut-crusted fish sandwich cause I read so much about it - and at $9.75, it was definitely bang for your buck. My bf ordered steak fajitas which he enjoyed and was full (an accomplishment:). My only two complaints: 1) the hard wooden seats started to hurt my bum after only 20 minutes - pls add cushions or more comfy chairs!, and 2) my glass of wine cost more than my dinner at $10 a glass. Oh well. The food is tasty and way more affordable than the average spot. Great ambiance.
