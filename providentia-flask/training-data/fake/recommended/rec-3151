Mmmmmm....what great food they have there and the service is super friendly too.  I loved the fish that they had there, and the salad was fantastic.  The person I ate with said the meat was fanstastic as well.  Great deal, you can get all you can eat for $15, or else just get the food by the pound.  I've got to be honest, I know nothing about Brazillian food but this food was simply great.  Great restaurant and its walking distance to the NJPAC and Prudential Center.
