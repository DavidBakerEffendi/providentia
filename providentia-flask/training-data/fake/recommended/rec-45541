Went here on a Thursday morning so I didn't encounter the wait that other weekend-going-Yelpers did. Ordered the Monkey French Toast after seeing it on Best Food Ever and I wasn't disappointed! The meal did look a bit bigger on TV, though. The homemade whipped cream that comes on the side is fantastic. I somehow managed to eat the entire plate and was so stuffed that I literally did not eat another thing for the next eight hours. My mom, who came with me, ordered one of the day's specials: a lemon waffle with blueberries. I tasted it and it was, like the french toast, delicious. The only drawback for me is the price, but I would splurge every once and a while to come back here.
