Went here yesterday for dinner at around 9pm with my Japanese friend from high school. We shared an okonimiyaki (very tasty -- comes in a small rectangular hot iron plate), a tonton yaki (excellent -- grilled pork feet with scallions ponzu and yuzu pepper), mentaiko rice (spicy cod roe on top of hot white rice), and kakuni (excellent - slow cooked sweet pork belly). Pork feet are really good for your skin because they're pretty much nothing but a ball of collagen! Overall, the taste was excellent. It was a bit on the heavy side, but then again I guess it's Hakata food so I suppose you have to expect it to be that way. It doesn't bother me in the slightest though, since I tend to prefer heavier foods. The Japanese waitresses were all very friendly and we ended up up striking a conversation with some of them. What really made my day was that two of them were locals from Hiroshima =) Our extremely satisfying meal with tax and tip came out to 26 bucks a person. Will definitely be returning on my next and upcoming trips to New York. I also appreciated them playing a local Hakata artist, Sotte Bosse's music in the background. Apparently she covers all sorts of old J-Pop songs and I personally really liked her stuff! Check her out as well while you're at it!
