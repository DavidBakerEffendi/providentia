We had apps and wine at Vinted last night and really had a terrific experience.  This wine bar is owned by the same people who own The Federal in Agawam and while I have never been, I've always heard good things.  Vinted serves small plates and there are plenty to choose from.  We chose the Risotto Balls in truffle oil to start and this was an excellent choice.  My understanding is that this is the only menu item taken from The Federal.  We paired it with a half glass of Sauvignon Blanc.  You can choose a full glass, a half glass and even a one ounce tasting from what looked to be a menu of 60+ wines.   Next, we had the pork belly tacos paired with a Cabernet blend and we loved it,  Two good-sized soft tacos filled with pork belly and a variety of pickled veggies - nice balance of crunchy and soft.   Our final tapa was scallops on a bed of short ribs, really enjoyed that too.   We sat at the wine bar and I think that this made for a more memorable experience as we were able to chat with Lincoln who was our wine connoisseur for the evening.  He gave us great advice on wine pairings including matching our chocolate cake desert with an exceptional and spicy red called Clio. This is an upscale restaurant and the prices reflect that.  If you like wine and are OK with small plates and flavors vs. generous portions, this is great change-up. And do yourself a favor and sit at the wine bar and soak it in.
