Very cozy, warm and welcoming restaurant! Small and quaint. Â At first, my partner and I walked in expecting a large almost pizzeria-like eatery but found a lavish and snug wine bar with a pizzeria on the side. My partner and I came up from Baltimore, Maryland for the day to sight see and found the restaurant on GayCities app for iphone. We couldn't be happier with the restaurant. We ordered the first pizza on the menu which was the perfect size for a couple. Water was served out of a neat jug and the service was perfect. Quick and polite! Thank you very much Zavino for adding to a great experience in Philadelphia!
