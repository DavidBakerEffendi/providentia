Delicious Food. Love that they have Cisco Grey Lady on tap. It's always served ice cold, and well priced at only $5/glass! Brunch service can be a little slow at times, but could just be that they're still getting their bearings. Dinner service is consistently efficient. Servers are very nice. I would recommend this place.
