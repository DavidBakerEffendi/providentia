This place has SO much potential but every time I come back I seem to run into the same problems. I'm obsessed with the ambiance and it has become one of my new favorites in the neighborhood, but they have a lot of work to do. Its the perfect place to sip on some wine and catch up with a friend or grab some coffee and a pastry to cram in some work BUT I've unfortunately had more disappointing experiences than positive. The service is below average 7/10 times I come. I understand that it is a fairly new establishment but there seems to be some confusion about whether this is a cafe or a sit down restaurant.  Whenever I decided to order off of the menu they direct me to a table and let me know that they will be happy to serve me. Throughout my dining experiences I always end up waiting on myself (have to wave my hands around to get their attention or get up and go ask the barista for simple things such as, napkins, silverware,  water refills, and sometimes even the check.) The menu items aren't always consistent . I'm  OBSESSED with the hummus/pita  and mozzarella sticks and marinara so I brought a friend back and was given ONE small fist size roll instead of the warm pita and cheese sticks with nothing to dip them in. I understand that sometimes places run out of things but you need to inform the customer when its different than the norm. ALSO wouldn't mind if when ordering a hot coffee you got a refill... just saying. Tis a bit shocking when you're charged multiple times while you're just trying to relax. Sorry I cant afford to spend $12 on simple coffee while checking some emails. Overall like I said I think this place has a lot of potential but seems to always be fairly empty. The outdoor patio is great, the second floor is great, the comfy couches are great,  and thankfully they finally added beer and wine to the menu... BUT they need to work on their service and consistency.   I'm rooting for you guys!
