Obsessed with this place. My new favorite East Village spot! I've been trying to go all summer, but every time I walk by it's spilling out busy. Still crowded but we scored three perfect spots at the bar. The bartender Chris/Kris (sp?) was awesome. We each got the sweet HH deal of 6 oysters and a beer, then shared the mussels, salmon tartar and crab cakes. Everything was so great and the atmosphere is fabulous. Will definitely be going back! Thank you for joining the neighborhood!
