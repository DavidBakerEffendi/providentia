Love this place.  Small, cute, great staff, yummy food, great prices, and so convenient!  And, they take Level Up!! Pros: - Greeted the second you walk in the door. The staff are so friendly! - Order at the counter, then pick a table.  Love this, for a quick, cheap breakfast - I had the smoked salmon and whitefish platter.  Large portion sizes (see my uploaded picture), delicious! - Food came out in less than 5 mins.  Wow!  And I went during a sunday morning brunch, so it was busy, but not packed. - Staff, staff, staff!  They are all so friendly, they really seem to love working there! So sweet! -  Daily specials, they also had a nutella french toast w/ cream & berries on the specials menu, but i decided for fish instead. - LEVEL UP! - Cute decor & atmosphere There was a prior review about someone who ordered the smoked salmon & whitefish platter, and he said there wasn't a lot of fish, and he felt skimped on portion size.  They must have listened to you buddy, cause i totally disagree!  The portion size was big and I had plenty of fish! Cons: - Nothing!  Maybe, only con would be they close at 8pm? I wish i could eat here later! hahaha. I will be back. Many times. With my roomie also!
