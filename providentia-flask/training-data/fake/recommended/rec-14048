they just opened up and are only serving ramen, beer and sake. the place is small. i came by myself so i was seated in a couple of minutes. i ordered the totto chicken ramen and a sapporo. i watched one of the cooks take a flamethrower to a platter of sliced pork while another one manned the noodles. the ramen tasted good, but the ramen to broth ratio was way out of proportion. i just like that its close to work. i might go back to try the spicy ramen, but not until winter.
