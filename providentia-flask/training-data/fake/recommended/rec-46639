The best dim sum I have eaten; I spent more than a year in China and travelled various parts of Asia including SE Asia and Hong Kong. Atmosphere: Significantly nicer than most of the other spots in Chinatown. Well lit and clean. This would be one of the nicer date/outing place to take friends who are visiting Philadelphia. Service: Efficient. Not overly friendly but very pleasant. The owner, an attractive Shanghainese woman, generally only speaks to my friend, who is of Taiwanese descent, but she appears to visit most of the tables to ensure the patrons are having a good experience. Food: EXCELLENT. The BEST fried rice I have had on any side of the Atlantic or Pacific. Their gai lan is delcious as are their vegetable dumplings. VEGETARIAN friendly! Cost: Very reasonable. Cash ONLY. Overal: This is a default place for me to go when I am hungry and don't want to chance whether or not the food will be good or not. It's always good.
