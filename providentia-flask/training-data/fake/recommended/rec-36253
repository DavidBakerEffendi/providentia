Balthazar. I have lived around the corner for two full years, heard its praises sung on countless lips, seen its allure firsthand as I walked past untold times, and finally experienced the magic for myself this month. Ambience. Balthazar feels good. Homey, not in a quaint way at all, but in the most inviting way possible, exuding warmth, camaraderie, comfort, and class. I don't know how they do it, but it's exactly how you'd picture eating in Paris in the 20th century. Gorgeous wood everywhere, lantern lighting sort of feel, round tables, and waiters in crisp little waistcoats. Food. Strong, very strong. Came in for an impromptu dinner after mingling at the Yale Club one early Thursday evening and got a reservation thanks to a friend. Ordered a fish entree (brook trout, I believe) since a recent oral surgery left me unable to grind through something as hearty as steak. Came over a fresh salad, each and every bite melted in my mouth. Followed it with mixed sorbet: pomegranate, berry, and mango. Inspiring. One of the accompanying ladies chose the creme brulee -- looked perfect and came with the most amazing ginger cookies, so soft and rich. Service. Not intrusive by any means, offered advice on the menu selections and joined our conversation happily, sharing his story from the old country with a smile. Kept our water glasses full and our tablecloth clean, a miracle despite my clumsy friend's best efforts to make an unspeakable mess. I strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone; moving a few blocks further away has made it all the more dear to me and I will return frequently.
