Wonderful ambiance, upscale, but felt comfortable in casual jeans.  I had the BEST thing EVER her - the clam chowder.  I savored every delicious slurp.  Unlike anything I've ever had.  NOT super thick (like Legal Seafood - and I mean this in a good way), it was broth-y, chunks of thick bacon, carrots I believe as well.  It was unique and simply divine.  I can't wait to go back for another bowl!
