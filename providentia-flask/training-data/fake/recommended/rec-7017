I'm surprised this place has an A grade rating - I feel like I'm in Guatemala.  They use crates as seats and the tables look like they were donated from a thrift store...from a third world country.  Maybe that's an allure for some people?  But i've been to many scrappy hole in the wall mexican places in LA/So-cal that didn't look like this.  Broom and a mop would be a good idea too.  But I digress. Chicken sandwich was awesome.  On a biscuit bun with gravy.  One of the best I've had in the city thus far.  5 stars for this bad boy. Po boy was pretty good too, but not as good.  The baguette type bread didn't go as well, maybe it was the quality of it.  Hot sauce was a good addition. Overall I'd come back but prob would only do take out.
