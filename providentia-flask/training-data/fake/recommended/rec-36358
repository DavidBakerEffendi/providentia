Given its Bourdain pedigree (which I didn't know about before coming) and the friendly guy at the bar yapping away in Japanese with a Japanese couple, I wanted to like it, but it was just meh.  Had the wasabi shumai - certainly delivered the wasabi kick, but was otherwise just ok.  Then had the tofu steak and it was covered with mozzarella cheese, and surrounded by watery "sauce" which is water from the tofu diluting the teriyaki sauce.  Really meh.  I've had some GREAT tofu steaks in LA so hard to be ok about this.  Scraped off the cheese to just get at the tofu, which was ok.  Finally, had the mentaiko fried rice, which was the best of the bunch.  This was decent, but not something to come back for. At least the wait wasn't long - I got there at 11:30pm.
