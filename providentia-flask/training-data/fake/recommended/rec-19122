I was in Philly on business, and thanks to my fellow yelpers I decided to try this place out based on it's reviews. I was not disappointed.  The wine list was good (only 4 stars because they were missing a coulple of wines off the menu).  Not a good sign for a wine bar.  One should expect for them to always be prepared.   However, the wine we did have was delicious. The decor was pretty cool too.  Good crowd, chill place, good ambiance and not too loud.  I would definately reccomend this place to someone visiting. Thank you to the yelp crowd for giving this place good reviews, otherwise I never would have gone :)
