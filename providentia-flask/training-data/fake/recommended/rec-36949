My family and I ate here to celebrate my sister's med school graduation.  I had heard many good things about this place, and frankly, I just thought it was ok.  We ordered the tasting menu and nothing in particular stood out to me.  The meal consisted of 5-6 courses plus dessert.  I think there was one vegetable dish and then some fish and meat.  I felt the service was great and the ambiance was nice.  Not super casual, but not stuffy at all.  Overall, it's a good restaurant, but I've had better and more memorable meals, especially at around $100/head.
