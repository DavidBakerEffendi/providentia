This restaurant is one of the best Italian family style NYC restaurants there is. Yes, it's insanely packed. The best time to go is for a family or friendly gathering with 4 or more. Everything is good from the bread, pasta, meat, desserts, coffee etc. Â Make sure to make a reservation, because it's an easy 2 hour wait.
