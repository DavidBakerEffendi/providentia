I remember the last time I was in town and Penelope had a 90 minute wait so we skipped it. I made a mental note to come back the next time since my sister raves about this place. The space was beautiful and the servers were friendly. We came for weekday breakfast and it was busy but minimal wait. Sadly, their Penny Sandwich was not available when I went so I had to opt for something else. I ordered their 3-egg omelette that came with toast and home fries. The omelette came with a choice of three toppings and I picked goat cheese, spinach and sausage. My omelette was delicious but I'm a sides-lover and my sides were sad. I don't know why, I do not like tiny cubed home fries. I've had better home fries at local diners. The brown toast was cold and stale. The home fries must have been old and prepared much earlier. I'm disappointed that this uber-popular place failed to impress when I finally got around to visiting it. I'm hoping it's not just over-hype and I caught it on an off day. My sister's pumpkin waffles were yummy. I loved the candied pecans.
