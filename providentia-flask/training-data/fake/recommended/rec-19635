These folks were gracious and welcoming!  We arrived late, just after they'd begun to close the kitchen.  We must've looked disappointed, and hungry, because they agreed to serve us from one of three 'ready-made' dishes.  We chose the feijoada, and it was a winner!  All the toppings (and 'bottomings') that came with it made it a feast!  We left full, and with leftovers!
