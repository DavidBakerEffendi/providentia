Excellent tomato pie! And I'm very pleased with the price at $8.50 for 3 hungry people. We each got two large squares. The place looks closed from the outside during the day. The lighting on the inside gives the place a nice 'you'd probably get shot here' feel. If you can get past that, they are making tasty pizza here!
