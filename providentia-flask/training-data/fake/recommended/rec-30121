This place gets a solid 4. We had reservations for Sunday brunch, arrived on time, and were seated promptly. No waiting like other diners had suggested in other reviews. DRINKS - fabulous mixology. I had the Cookshop Champ, which was a perfect accompaniment to my brunch FOOD - solid. We started off with the beignets with concord grape sauce. OMG! They were so light and airy and the sauce was so tasty. I had the broccoli scramble with biscuits and it was amazing. The eggs were light and fluffy. My hubby had the b'fast sandwich which was also outstanding. AMBIANCE - it's a tad crowded and noisy, but we enjoyed it cause the place felt like it had a ton of energy. VALUE - prices seem reasonable by NY standards for the location and quality of the food. Definitely recommend a walk on the highline afterward to balance out the caloric intake! We'll definitely come here again. HIGHLY RECOMMEND making reservations as you'll wait a long time for a seat if you don't have one.
