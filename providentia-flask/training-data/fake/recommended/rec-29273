With 300+ reviews, I feel like foolish posting a review, but, i'm off of work and have nothing else going on. I really love osteria.  I have been here a few times and have liked it more each time.  My first time was in the private kitchen table that was definitely an experience.  The tasting menu was amazing,  It was over a year ago so I can't remember what I specifically ate unfortunately.  My most recent trip there was fantastic.  Started off with several pizzas for the table.  Loved the sausage with runny egg on my pizza, it was amazing.  Moved on to sharing several meals.  The pasta with wild boar ragu was great.  The consistency of their pasta is something to experience.  Also had one of their specials which was a generous serving of pig roasted on a spit.  Everyone at my table loved it, but I thought it was a bit fatty.  That was really my mistake as one should expect it to be quite fatty.  On previous occasions we've had much of their menu, and I liked pretty much everything. Their beer selection is okay, but i'm a hop beer fanatic and they dont have too much in the ways of hoppy beers, but they have a nice selection of italian micros.   Their service is great as well, and the restaurant doesn't feel pretentious at all given the praise it gets.   Highly recommended.
