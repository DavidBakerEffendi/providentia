In truth, I would give this a 3.5 star rating if I had the option on my app. I visited Honey Grow on a Friday at noon. The first thing I will say is that it seemed far more busy than it really was due to the design of ordering and picking up food. What appeared to be a line that was practically out the door moved very fast and was actually also people who had already ordered waiting to pick up food. There are 4 or 5 touch screens that you order your food on and pay. These help to move the line along. It's like the Wawa of Rittenhouse! The cold food being pushed out in one location and hot in another was also a little strange and leaves you crawling through people trying to order on the screens or eat to simply get your whole order once they shout your number. The food was good enough. I had a customized salad and my girlfriend had the red coconut curry. It's prepared in a whirlwind in the open style kitchen and some details are a little rough (skins on avocados, shrimp tails on some shrimp, etc). The curry was a little bland for a curry. Good news: hoisin and sriracha on tap. The prices are a little high, but it's a fast, customizable lunch option that I will probably try again.
