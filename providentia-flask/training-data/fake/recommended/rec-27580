Good fries, just not sure how Belgian they are.  Dumping them through one oil vat directly into another without any time for cooling is cheating. Also, they didn't have the European style mayo.  My husband acted as if someone had just slashed his tires when we were informed of this.  (Supposedly they are temporarily out, but there was something in the way the guy so quickly informed us of this shortcoming that seemed rehearsed and suspicious.)  Dill lemon mayo was good though.   It was nice they serve the frites in a cone but we missed the tiny forks they use in Europe. Seemed a little gimmicky for french fries, but who knows, maybe I'll give it another shot.
