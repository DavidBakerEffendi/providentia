This place, quite simply, is awesome. Picture large, outdoor beer garden, picnic tables everywhere, everyone around with drinking, laughing, with smiles on their faces and fire pits making you feel like you are sitting by a campfire in the wintertime. There are two bars outside and bars inside so you never have to wait long to go up, order a beer and walk away with a pint of good German beer in your hand. Plus, they always have a game of dirty Jenga on the table, which keeps it entertaining when you are trying to hear and participate in a conversation with your friends four seats down (one of the drawbacks of picnic-like tables). Last time I came here it was with a group for a friend's birthday which ended up being a blast. My boyfriend got the split-roasted half chicken, which was honestly the most moist, tastiest chicken i have ever had at a restaurant. I got the Jagerschnitzel which was equally tasty, thank God or i would have had major order envy. I highly recommend coming here anytime you want to go out with a group. One note of warning - if you come here in the winter and they have the fire pits going, you will leave smelling like you just slept in a campfire for 3 nights. But when you're getting drunk with your friends, who really cares?
