My office is just around the corner from Caseus so I eat here once every other month or so. I would certainly eat here more often if there were more seats. The menu is classic Bistro food and is quite good. In fact it may be the best in New Haven. I usually have the Grilled Cheese or the Cheeseburger, but everything is quite good. The French Onion Soup is amazing. The beer and wine selection is great. Frankly, the only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is because its a bit crowded, and the bar area really could be more comfortable.
