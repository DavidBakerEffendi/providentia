Ate here this past week and had the anchovy appetizer and the lamb entree.  It was all just very mediocre and for the prices, it really should have been better. I think this restaurant falls in to the category of being one of those overly expensive NY restaurants that had a lot of hype, but just doesn't deliver.  Yes, the setting and decor are beautiful, but I am also here for the food.  However, the drinks were very good as I did enjoy my Pisco Sour. On another note, I found out the next day my credit card had been swiped twice by my server and I had to go through the ordeal of having it voided.  I did get some attitude by the women over the phone as they told me that it had been voided immediately by my server - which my bank said didn't happen.  And if it did, I should have been told immediately by my server instead of noticing it on my online bank statement.
