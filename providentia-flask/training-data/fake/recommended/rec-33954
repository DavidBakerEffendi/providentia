We live around the corner so we've eaten here a few times. The sides and drinks are the highlights. The mains, especially the chicken, are well done, but nothing spectacular. All of the sides are spot on, some good enough to eat by themselves. The drink menu is creative and happy hour is a great deal. If you want spicy chicken, the hottest on the menu will burn your entire G.I. tract. It must have ghost pepper in it. The ambiance is great for a neighborhood restaurant. Over the past year it's been filling up with hipsters from Friday to Sunday, especially for the weekend brunch, and lines can get long. Since they don't take reservations it's best to show up well before you want to eat, or come from Mon.-Thur.
