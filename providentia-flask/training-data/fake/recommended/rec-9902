Despite the hype, I gotta give this place only 3 stars. The fries are cut a bit too thick for my taste, and there's really nothing special about them. The sauces make this eatery so popular, but you only get one choice with your order. The good thing is that it's open till 1 am, making it convenient for an after dinner/post drinks stop. We had the mango chutney sauce, and I really anticipated it being sort of chunky, kind of like a mango salsa. What we got instead was something that resembled nacho cheese in its appearance, and tasted similar, but slightly sweet. The sundried tomato mayo was much better, but still not AWESOME, like I expected this place to be.
