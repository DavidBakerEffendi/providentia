The absolute best Shanghai dumplings (xiao long bao) outside of China (maybe even better than Hong Kong). The crab ones are so delicious they melt in your mouth. Don't expect great service or comfortable surroundings. This is a restaurant in Chinatown, so you go there for the food, not the atmosphere. When I lived in Hong Kong, this place was a must when I visited NYC to get my xiao long bao fix!
