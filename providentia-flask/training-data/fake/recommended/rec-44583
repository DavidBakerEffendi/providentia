Came here with a friend while visiting new York and the food was actually not bad. But I do have a few qualms to pick with this place. The sitting area and was way too small, and most people cannot be accommodated. This place is even worse if you are claustrophobic or don't do well with small confined spaces. The food was a bit over priced, and the rice portions were very small. I'm sorry but as a Filipino, I know that we like to eat rice, and this Restaurant just gives tiny servings!  The service was "Adequate". But on the plus side the food was moderately good. The Lecheon Kawali was Way too Fatty, and did not have much meat. It was greasy and most of the pieces were all FAT!  The highlight was the Binagoongan, which was cooked perfectly, and not too salty. It was seasoned just right and I really enjoyed it. Basically all of the portion servings in this restaurant were small. You would have to order several dishes and extra orders of rice just to even get full!  My advice is to only come here if you want to try it out of curiosity, and if you don't know how to cook Filipino food. I recommend cooking your own food at home, so you don't have to spend so much, and so you can make some realistic LARGE portions which this restaurant is obviously unfamiliar with.
