One of the ten best meals of my life. Flavors are intelligent and expansive. Dishes are inventive colorful and delicious. We skipped the main courses and had almost all of the starters. The akami torchon was smoky tender and acidic - beautifully done. The chili lobster dish was savory and umami to the max. The tortellini veal - good god! If you are a foodie, this is the best money you can spend.
