10 - 15 minutes wait on Labor day dinner time. Not bad! This is a relatively new branch of the ever so popular Ippudo, which has a significantly longer wait. Good location, simple, clean but polished interior. My favorites were the appetizers. Pork buns were mouth watering good, lamb chop was tender, and full of flavor. I'm usually not a huge fan of ramen. I liked the ramen here but I wouldn't say it has changed my view of ramen. The egg was perfectly done, noodle was fresh and chewy, broth was full of flavor, but a little bit too fatty in my opinion. The fattiness is not unique to Ippudo though, I feel the same about a lot of authentic ramen places(yet I keep coming back to try more ramen...) The fruit tarts were delightful, but the fruits on top weren't sweet enough. I wish they could have half sized ramen so I could eat more appetizers and dessert without feeling bloated afterwards.
