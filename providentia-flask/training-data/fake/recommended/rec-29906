Magic moment at Sea Fire Grill last night ! Our server (Arben) offered the best service. We started with a bottle of Chablis Premier Cru (Arben's suggestion), delicious and the perfect match with the appetizers we had (yellowfin tuna tartar, steak tartar and madagascar garlic prawns : yummie). I had the Swordfish as entree, loved it! I finished with their homemade cheese cake: perfectly airy and tasty. I would recommend this place to anyone without hesitation !
