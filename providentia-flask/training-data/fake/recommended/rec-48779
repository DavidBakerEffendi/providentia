If I could rate this place 0 stars I would. I read such great reviews about this place. Then yesterday me and my coworker ordered good from here. We were waiting for about 45 minutes when the delivery man called and asked the address. After repeating it to him about 5 times he told me he doesn't know where that is and he's not coming. I immediately called the restaurant telling the woman who took my order that he said he was not coming. She was astonished and said he didn't speak English but that she would call him. After about 2 minutes she returns my phone call and explains to me that he said he's not coming to deliver my food because he doesn't know where it is. Then why is he a delivery man if he doesn't know his way around manhattan and especially such easy address as where my work place is. She said she doesn't know why he's acting like that but she apologizes. I wanted to know how was I suppose to receive my food I've been waiting for , for over an hour. I demanded to speak to a manger but she was not in. I do not recommend this place to anyone. They have horrible service and horrible delivery people. People of manhattan beware, you delivery man might not want to come to deliver to you! I have still yet to call them back but when I do there better be free food involved for the extreme misunderstanding.
