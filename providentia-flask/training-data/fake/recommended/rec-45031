I came here in the middle of nowhere to celebrate a friend's birthday. I would readily travel the 50 minutes it takes to come here again :-) The combo plates that we got were huge, but I could just sit for three hours and eat another one. I've never had food quite like this before, but I'm a big fan now. The meat was perfectly grilled and super tender. The taste: to die for. The waiter staff: very friendly and funny. Overall, a great place to go with a large group of people.
