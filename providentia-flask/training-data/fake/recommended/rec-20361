How I Rate: 3 stars = exactly what I was hoping for. Food: Wonderful Service: Mostly unpretentious Decor: Great Other Patrons: 90% respectful. Towards the end we got some rude women next to us. (wait, that's can't be a rating against the restaurant?! In my book it is, patronage is created by the owners) I would gladly go back again. But likely will not. Â This was a special dinner out for my wife. Exploring if you will.
