Kefi was delicious. My friend and I split the Kefi Salad, which may have been my favorite dish of the evening. The fennel was mild and crunchy, and went perfectly with the feta and acidity of the dressing. We also had the Selection of Spreads. My favorites were the eggplant and the caviar, although the tzadziki and chickpea dips were wonderful too. For our meal, we split the branzino entree. The fish was a large portion, great for splitting, and cooked perfectly. I loved the roasted grape tomatoes on the side. We also had a few glasses of wine - I believe it was the Domaine Skouras - and it was excellent. Fantastic, filling yet refreshing meal.
