I found this fast food chain to be very overpriced for what the company offered.  The store was empty but the staff was too busy talking to each other to fill orders from customers at the food prep bar, and sent them to the ready made section. Now how lazy is that? I really wanted more out of this place other than a high-priced deli with less appealing foods than a standard Whole Foods chain.  I wouldn't take anyone under 16 here, as the place is noisy and boring for them. Most of the customers were busy on their smartphones and ignoring those around them in silence. It's not a very social environment or very tasty food.  We spent $60+ on snacks and most of it went uneaten by the three of us -- why uneaten? The food lacked flavour Would I go back? Nah -- to many other wonderful places to enjoy than spend time at a Fast Food Chain that is as pricey as a nice place. Would I suggest this location to Vegan/Vegetarian Friends? Probably not -- there are much better choices in the area
