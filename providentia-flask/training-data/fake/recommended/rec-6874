The interior of this place definitely feels more like a hip hotel or swanky lounge than a Thai restaurant, but it definitely works.   The group of us all really enjoyed the experience here.  Service was an A+.  We sat at the communal table on the other side of the giant chandelier in the middle of the restaurant.  We all enjoyed the ribs and dumplings as appetizers.  We ordered an entree each.  My pad prik king was super spicy but almost too spicy.  Everyone else seemed to really like their dish.  An order of the soft shell crab, the steak, the chicken and fish dish all off the specials side of the menu.   Looking forward to trying more not so spicy dishes on my next go around here at Room Service
