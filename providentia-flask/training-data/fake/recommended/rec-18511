Went here with some friends who studied and lived in Spain, they were ecstatic to get back here and said it's exactly like the Spanish restaurants. Perfect spot for a cheap drunk brunch. Mugs of bud light only $3. Sangria is fairly weak, but buy an extra glass of wine and make it stronger. Sandwiches are cheap and taste okay. You get chips with each order so that helps. Ambience is pretty good with an indoor garden patio with sunroof in back, nice on a cold winter day to get some light. Place gets fairly busy so recommend going before noon if you plan to stay awhile. Bottom line don't come here if you're looking for great food, but DO come here if you're looking to hang out with friends and drink for really cheap.
