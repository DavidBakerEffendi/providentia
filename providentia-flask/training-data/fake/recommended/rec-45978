Consistent Excellence. I've been eating here the better part of 10 years and the food is always fantastic. The kitchen is super fast and the BYOB aspect makes it an appealing way to have top notch food at a bargain price.(much like Pho Hong) I always get the Som Tam Salad.(green papaya with traditional lime/fish dressing) Otherwise you can't go wrong with any of the items on the menu. Be sure to mention how spicy you'd like things. They can really kick it up to sweating/hallucination level which I love. Favorite Dishes of mine: Pad Ki Mow(drunken noodle) and Krapow which are essentially the same, but one with noodles and the other with rice. Their curries are also delicious and the Tom Yum soup with a Som Tam salad is a great lunch. This place will always be in my rotation.
