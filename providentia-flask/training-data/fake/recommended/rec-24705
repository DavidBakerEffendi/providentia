Although it came highly recommended, ilili was just average when compared to the plethora of options available in NYC. The service was buttoned up and food was well prepared, but nothing off the charts. The batata harrara would be my best recommendation to complement any meal - it's the side of potatoes and it is just delicious! Highly recommend this.
