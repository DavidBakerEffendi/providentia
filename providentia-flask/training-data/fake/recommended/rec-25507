Service is 3 stars on a good night, but drinks and location are 5 stars. Way too much attitude from the servers around happy hour- I understand that it gets busy and people can be rude, but the wait staff should at least treat their well behaved customers with respect! Karaoke on Wed night is a big plus. As I mentioned, drinks are very good and selection is impressive.
