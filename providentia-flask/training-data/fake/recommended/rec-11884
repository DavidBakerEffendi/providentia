Met up with a friend there for dinner last night, after being away for so long! To keep it short - saw 2 roaches, one midway through appetizers, and one midway through our entree....crawling right next to me on the slat bench.  The waitress was really nice and apologized up and down and moved us to the bar.  Wasn't her fault.  She said there was construction going on next door, and well.... you know...it IS NYC.  Needless to say, we both stopped eating. They comped us everything, which I thought was superb customer service, but I felt bad about it since we did finish up the wine (it was a corked bottle so figured we were safe).  We left a healthy tip to make up for it, and chalked it up to taking your chances in the EV.  All was well...until my friend emailed me this morning and said he woke up in the middle of the night, feeling ill from what he surmises is the gnocchi from dinner.  I think NSC is removed from my dinner spots for a while.  So sad since it was so good, and the staff is so nice :(.  Maybe when construction finishes, I'll give it a try again.
