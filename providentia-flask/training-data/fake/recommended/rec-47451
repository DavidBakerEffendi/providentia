I hate sharing. I don't know anyone that truly, honestly does like to. Sometimes I can be convinced to part with a bite or two of something, but I know it's really good when I don't even feel guilt after blatantly ignoring someones hints and/or attempts at trying what I'm eating. I had plans to have brunch with a fellow food lover and I had to pick the spot. Uber-intimidated, I made the final choice at the last moment and we ended up at extra virgin. I think I earned some major cool points as the food was delicious (baked eggs are as good as the menu makes them sound), the staff incredibly helpful and accommodating and the outdoor seating perfect. It was relatively quick for the 2 of us to get a table at 1:30 Sunday afternoon, however I did notice parties of 4+ having to wait for quite a while. All in all, a lovely brunch spot.
