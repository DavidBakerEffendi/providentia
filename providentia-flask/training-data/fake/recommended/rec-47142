Cool little spot to watch a game! Definitely elevated bar food for a game as well. Lots of big screens and a good mix of a higher end restaurant, still being okay with some excited football fans. My friends got steak and the like, which they said was good. I got the truffle Mac and cheese which was pretty bland, but a good side caesar. Service was wonderful, super friendly and attentive. Easy to get a table Sunday night. Give it a shot!
