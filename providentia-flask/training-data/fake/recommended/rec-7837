We went for breakfast on our first morning in Philadelphia and had the American breakfast with eggs sausage hash browns and one with pancakes the other toast . I had the White Dog Cafe special French toast but it was so sweet and sickly I was jealous of my husbands and daughters breakfast.Yes it was nice but we would not go out of the way to go again only of we were passing, but would not think twice about getting on a bus down Clark to go to Ellys White Dog Cafe for breakfast or lunch and Ellys will be the last place we go to before going home.
