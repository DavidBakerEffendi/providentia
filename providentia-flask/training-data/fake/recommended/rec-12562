This place was recommended to me by someone, so a friend and I went to try it out..I was told the banana walnut pancakes were delicious and believe me I was in no way displeased..It was the most delicious pancakes I have ever eaten and to add to my joy, I had a side and of sausages and some delicious hot chocolate..To say I enjoyed my meal would be a great understatement..And to make the experience even more enjoyable, our waitress delivered wonderful service with a great personality..Although our wait was long, about an hour it was worth it..I am very much looking to returning as many times as I can..
