Having lived in manhattan for 7 years, am a bit of a snob when it comes to pizza. This place surprises on the positive. Creative offerings (the cherry tomato, truffle oil, fontina and Parmesan cheese pie was the night's special pie and was excellent) and attentive wait staff is what to expect. Pie sizes are 10" which is enough for a hungry adult. Thin crust which just a hint of brick oven black carbon on them to give them that crisp authentic flavor. For our 2 year old we veered into Mac & Cheese territory and it was very good as well. BYOB is a small drawback and our plain pizza was a tad light on (the excellent) tomato sauce. But will be coming back.
