I have eaten here a few times and it's consistently been great. Just about every thing has a vegetarian option, which is great, and it's always nice and tasty. The best thing to do is go in a group of 3 or more, each get different things and then share it all. It's great for new-comers to the neighborhood who are tight on cash. You get a great meal for a great price. Their hours can be kooky and the place is really small, so make sure you investigate before you decide to go. I've gone a few times and not been able to get a table or found out that they're closed. Oh! Definitely don't venture from the norm on the drinks. Some of the drinks they offer are, well, terrible. It's BYOB, though, so just bring some good wine and enjoy!
