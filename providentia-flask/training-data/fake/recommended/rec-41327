The pork bone ramen was a good life decision. I am reminded of this as I eat my leftovers: the bowls are huge, so go hungry. A friend recommended Chuko for the kale salad (meta-review?), but I was more in the mood for piggy goodness. It arrived piping hot with a perfectly soft-boiled egg, fatty (in the best possible way) pork slices and a little pile of greens on top. Definitely get the hot sauce. It was delicious, though I did feel that the noodles themselves could be improved - they were a bit limp (overcooked, maybe?) for my taste. At 12:30 PM on a Wednesday I expected Chuko to be packed but was pleasantly surprised to find only a few people there; it filled up over the course of my meal but at no point got overly loud or crowded. I sat at the wrap-around window counter and people-watched; it's a good corner for that. The waitress was super friendly, and I briefly considered asking her if she wanted to be my friend. I chickened out. Maybe next time. Oh and cash only!
