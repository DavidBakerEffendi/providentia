I'm Gonna make this review quick because I hated everything about this place although unlikE a lot of other people I didnt wait in much of a line so I'm just gonna break it down Bun--McDonald's Meat--cheaper than McDonald's Toppings--had the hot?? And it was a bunch of red crap that we will call peppers I also had a concrete?? And it was nothing special what makes me most upset is the bill came to 12 bucks and Wendy's is much better and it would've only cost me 2.00
