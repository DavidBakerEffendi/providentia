Yes, there are two carts.  Yes, they are the SAME.  Feel free to go to the shorter line. A hearty and tasty meal.  Get the lamb and chicken combo.  Two white sauce containers and a small red sauce container will do the trick.  Mix and enjoy. It's cheap and it's open late.  Beware of drunken dudes yelling and wasted chicks screaming.  I was once there when the cart was about to close up and a bunch of drunk people raided the poor carts and swiped their pitas!  Only in NYC, baby! Visit before 00:00 and you should be okay.  This cart offers some of the best NYC grub.
