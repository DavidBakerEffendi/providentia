My perfect kind of dinner. When I go back to New York, this is where I shall dine, I hope, repeatedly. The Extra Virgin salad is simple, but has every angle for a perfect starter in my mind. The caprese, of course, delicious. The lemon crusted seabass melted in my mouth. A bottle of Prosecco and dining on their cute little patio on a warm evening, plus the food here makes for a perfectly lovely evening. Or even inside with it's sexy dim lighting. Grrrr.
