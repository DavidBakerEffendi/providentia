Went there for lunch today and was very disappointed.  Had the fried Calamari and the Saganaki for appetizers.  The calamari was cold and under-seasoned.  The saganaki was fried and cold.  It was not broiled, hot and lit up with a flame like you would expect in most nice Greek restaurants. Reviewers raved about the gyro, so I ordered the gyro platter.  Again the meat was cold.  I actually looked like it was previously sliced and reheated.  It was a mess of thin, well-done, cold slices of meat. I am a Greek-American, so maybe my standards are too high, but this place definitely disappointed today.
