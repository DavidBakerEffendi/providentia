Great new addition to the Vetri line up! Loved the casual atmosphere and menu. Tried several of the seasonal specials that were fantastic, most notably the heirloom tomatoes with sweet corn and cream and the rice pudding with strawberries and balsamic vinegar. The ribeye was great, but a small cut for the price. But cooked and seasoned wonderfully. Great wine list of mostly southern Italian wines. Tiramisu (not on normal menu) was perfection. Am so happy this place is right around the corner from our house. Sure to become a neighborhood favorite.
