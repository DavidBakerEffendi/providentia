More like Chez Meh - this bistro tries, but not too hard. The ingredients are OK, but fall short of excellence. My steak was slightly overcooked; not enough to complain about, but enough to slightly disappoint. My companion's fish was free from any discernible flavor. Service is adequate, but neither attentive nor warm. The execution from the kitchen is likewise very average. This is basically decent diner-level cooking masquerading as a French bistro. If I had to sum it up in one word it would be "tepid". It's not awful, but there are many better choices in the neighborhood.
