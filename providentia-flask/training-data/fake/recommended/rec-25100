The food was pathetic I ve had nepali food earlier and it was pathetic der momos wer really gud but rest everything was really bad  we ordered chicken tartari n it was not even close to a tarkari the vegetables wer soo undercooked d garlic was raw cooked in tomato paste I cud hardly chew the chicken it was extremely rubbery I have never seen any restaurant playing  very loud religious songs you can't do dat !! Service was bad I wish I cud give a zero star I think dey ll need restaurant impossible really soon  I actually read all d reviews before visiting n was really impressed with d reviews but when I went der it was my worst experience I ve had in ny restaurant
