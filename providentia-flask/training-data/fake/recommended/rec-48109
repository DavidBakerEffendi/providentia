Manhattan Pizza & Pub has a great ambience.  It is hip/grungy, with talkative bouncers and a fair selection of beers. There are some weird characters milling around there on the weekends, along with totally average students and older people.  I think a 6:1 ratio of the normal to the odd is a perfect mix for a bar.  This hilarious dude almost got into a fight next to our table and since a very polite/observant man warned us about the brewing trouble, we were able to turn around and enjoy it rather than get accidentally knocked over while he flailed. I will say that one particular night they had put up a lot of beers on their chalk board that weren't available on tap yet, so every time we would try to order beers (that were on the menu!) they would cut us off and say they weren't actually available until the next night.  Why did you write them on the board then??
