For brunch they have all you can drink, FREE Sangria!!! The sangrias were all delicious! My favorite was the Havana Banana which had lychee, coconut and banana in it. The refillable bread basket comes in a cigar box and had yummy treats like mini cupcakes, corn bread, donuts with dulce de leche inside, cheese bread and chocolate chip bread. To eat I got the vegetarian paella which was simply delicious!!! Make sure you have a reservation because when they opened at 12:00 on Sunday they were telling people without a reservation that it was a 2 hour wait.
