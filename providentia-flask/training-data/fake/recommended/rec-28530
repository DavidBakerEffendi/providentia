This place is really hidden off the regular beaten path of (east) Williamsburg, tucked away in a residential area. I am so glad I discovered it one day when I was really craving a good banh mi, it's worth the trek! The baguette is warm and toasted, and if you ask for spicy, it comes spicy. I think I've had the classic, chicken, and pork, and they were all good--though my fave is the classic. The grilled chicken vermicelli is tasty too. It's so out of the way for me, but I'm happy to make plans to get over there when the cravings call.
