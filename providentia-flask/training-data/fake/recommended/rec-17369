Cuban Pete's is an anomaly for me insofar as I actually wish it were a chain. The food was amazing, the atmosphere holds the hard-to-perfect dynamic of a place that is both bustling with activity yet intimate. I've heard stories of long wait times, which is why I'd never been before, but we got right in. We ordered the chicharon de pollo (chicken 'lollipops') and empanadas for appetizers. For my meal, I ordered the churrasco (marinated skirt steak w/ spicy chimichurri sauce) that came with white rice, black beans, and plantains. I can honestly say that in all of my restaurant experiences, the quality of this dish far outweighed the price. They could easily be charging more for it. We shared a tres leches cake slice for dessert, and that's probably the only thing I didn't love as much as I wanted to. The staff was attentive, but not overbearing. The food was all prepared perfectly. No flavor overpowered another. Everything really played its role in what was hands down one of my best dining experiences of the year. I can't speak to authenticity, but when the food is this good? I don't care what they're branding it as. Just keep it coming.
