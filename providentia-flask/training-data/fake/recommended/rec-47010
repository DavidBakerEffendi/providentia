My boyfriend took me to Sabrina's Cafe (Bella Vista) while we were nearby browsing the Italian Market late one afternoon. He mentioned it would be a tad more costly than the typical diner but claimed it was a must try while visiting Philly. Candle lit cafe tables lined the sidewalk combining the charm of street dining in Paris with a New Orleans French Quarter vibe, peppered with the coolness that is Philly. We were instructed to sit wherever we liked so we picked a quaint little table outside. I ordered the make your own omelet with spinach, feta and tomatoes and it was probably one of the best omelets I've had in a long time; it was perfectly cooked and the portions were big enough to share. I liked this place to much I reviewed it in my blog - definitely a must try. I recommend going at dusk for the ultimate candle lit meal. Sabrina's Cafe is perfect for couples, catching up with friends or go solo for a nice, outside people watching experience.
