Top sirloin with yuca fries and rice are great!!, we discovered this quaint little piece through a family friend, and boy were they right with the authentic Brazilian and Portuguese food. The flan was a nice consistency with a sweet glaze atop. The feijoada was a great dish on this cold and rainy Saturday, one of the best I ever had in Newark. Everything was also reasonably priced, with a home cooked feel to every dish, which is what I think everyone is looking for.
