If I wanted to travel to a boring neighborhood to wait an hour in an ugly, uncomfortable space to watch an old man make a pizza for $30 I'd go visit my grandfather in the nursing home where he lives, give him a Celeste pizza and use that hour to watch him figure out how to use his microwave while I set fire to the remaining $26 in the toilet before I'd ever go back to Di Fara. It's great that this guy has made every pizza in the place since he opened it. Really it is. But for someone who cares about what the end product of this pizza making legend actually tastes like I recommend you look elsewhere. Put it this way: If this place was $12 a pie and right down the street from me with zero wait in a great space I still wouldn't eat this greasy, salty, lackluster pizza.
