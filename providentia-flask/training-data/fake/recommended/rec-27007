We want to give 41/2 if possible. The only thing that was not good was we had to wait for a awhile before we can order. Our server was missing for about 15 minutes after we were sat down. Once she took our orders, it was fine. Food was amazing. We had the pleasure to sit at the bar watching all the chefs cranking out food. That was an awesome experience!! We both love the Hen of the Wood Mushroom toast.  T loves the House-Cured Ham in Olive Oil and L loves their Grilled octopus.  We also had the Lobster and winter vegetables fritters. We think they were just ok. Overall, we enjoyed our dinner and can't wait to be back.
