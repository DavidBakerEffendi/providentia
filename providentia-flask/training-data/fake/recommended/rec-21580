i've been in this neighborhood since 1987, so to see a bar that's right up my alley and not on the other side of washington avenue is...interesting. especially since i'm not 100% comfortable with walking the 4 blocks here at night. anyways, the food is great, the portions are huge. onion rings are mandatory with their wonderful spicy ranch dipping sauce. when they were taking a while to serve our food, the bartender gave us a round on the house. loves it. of course, i'm coming back.
