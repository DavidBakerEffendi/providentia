The pork was delicious but I wasn't a fan of the broccoli rabe (sorry gluttonous dude on Man vs. Food). The line moves quickly, the Provolone cheese they use is amazing and the owner looks like Peter Petrelli, I thought he was dreamy. Go here. He's amazing, er, I mean the food is amazing... and so is the Peter Petrelli look alike. And the brisket and the roast beef... everything.
