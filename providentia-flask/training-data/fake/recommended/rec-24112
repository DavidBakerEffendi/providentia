Had the wonderful opportunity of being invited back with my (now) fiance to reexperience a new and improved Tashan the way it should have been experienced.   A promise of an all new staff of front of the house and behind the scenes in the kitchen.  The menu was improved -- long gone was the menu of the past, with the horror show of crunchy donuts, overly well done food and no staff in sight to flag down. This was a delicious 360degree experience.   I highly recommend the Chef's Tasting Menu; however, be prepared to come with a starving belly, because you do notttt want to miss the dessert round! The Creme Brulee had the perfect crack to the crust, and secret hidden twist inside.   I was not disappointed in any dish, and was even surprised when they snuck in a vegetarian dish of Eggplant something or other that was extremely tasty.  Everything was amazing, and I could not put the dessert dish down until it was scraped clean. Thank you for turning this place into what it should be
