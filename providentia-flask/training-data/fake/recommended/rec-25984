I love this restaurant. They have the only steak in the city that I will eat :) (I don't usually eat steak ever). The drinks are great--the pineapple mint capi is delish-- and regularly priced at 8 dollars for one. They play awesome Brazilian music that isn't overbearingly loud. And the food. Ahhhh the food; it's to die for. I definitely recommend this place
