We tried Nerai as a previous reviewer had indicated it was as good as Milos on West 55th Street. It isn't. Â That does not mean there are not positives. It is in a nice space, location and the service was very good. The food is somewhat spotty (greek salad good. Octopus was fair as were the scallops. In the latter two dishes, the flavors fought with one another and the entrees were a bit too precious. Nevertheless, we might give the restaurant a little more time to evolve and see where things go.
