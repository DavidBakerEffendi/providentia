I came here on Sunday night with about four of my friends for dinner. We waited about 20min to be seated. But when we were seated, it was totally worth the 20min wait... Our waitress was nice enough to explain the dishes to my non-korean friends and even was patient with my friend's complicated vegetarian order. We totally destroyed the delicious vegi and fish banchan as soon as they were served and the waitress gave us a refill without me even asking. My seafood tofu soup was the best I've had and the service definitely made my visit extra memorable. You must go!
