Stopped in recently after a trip to Fairway on a Tuesday to take advantage of $2 beer day.  There was no wait for a table but we decided to sit at the bar and enjoy the view.   We could not have asked for friendlier service.  We stuck to beer, so no complaints about the price of drinks.  The food prices are a little high, but crab isn't cheap anywhere.  If you are looking for a pleasant and inexpensive way to pass an hour or more on a Monday or Tuesday with a great view and $2 draft beer, Brooklyn Crab is the place to be.
