The Buon Appetito food truck is the unsung hero of the tiny Hartford food truck scene. For $6.50 you get a big helping of pasta, a salad or sandwich. Eggplant marscapone is good; this spring's special involving penne, shrimp, sausage and spicy is also; and the penne a la vodka is good. They really like penne, but I don't find that to be objectionable. I haven't tried the sandwiches or salads, because I have a tendency to get stuck in my ways and only order pasta. Also, they're efficient, which is a positive quality in food trucks.
