This place was amazing! I've had my eyes on this place, and decided to go this past Saturday night. We arrived around 9:00 pm with no reservation. We waited about 40 minutes to be seated. We were accomodated with seats at the Chefs Counter as the table wait was taking longer than expected. I actually enjoyed the experiencing of watching the food prep at the counter. I'd request seating here again. We started with the maryland crab on toast. Delish!!!! The chef then sent us out 2 cups of tomatoe soup on the house. I'm not a tomatoe soup fan, but OMG this soup was amazing!!!! I will definately order that on our next visit! I had the baked half chicken which was cooked to perfection! My husband had the sea bass which was amazing fresh and moist! We also order the peppered califlower and seasoned greens on the side. Both were great, Service was top notch! Nice intimate dining experience. Will definately return.
