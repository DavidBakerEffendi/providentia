I've been coming to Woorijip for the past 3-4 years. If you're craving Korean and don't have the time or cash to go to any of the other expensive, packed restaurants in the strip (or are not terribly hungry), Woorijip is the place to go. It has a great buffet. The Kimchi fried rice is a personal favorite.
