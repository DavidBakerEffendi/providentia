Ridiculously good!  Get the sausage pizza (I think it was 3rd from the top).  Actually, order 2 - so you don't have to share w/ your date.  Yes, it is that good!  The gnocchi was pretty darn good too, but definitely on the heavier side.  I'd rather eat 2 pizzas than 1 gnocchi.  My recommendation is to choose any pizza, but don't share with anyone.  After the first slice - you want to savor every square inch of the pizza to yourself.  I felt like Joey on that Friends episode, "Joey doesn't share food!"  After eating at Luzzo's, you'll become a Joey too!
