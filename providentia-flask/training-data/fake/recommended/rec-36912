The only word I can think of to describe Balthazar is "decent". The service was excellent, with our glasses and bread basket always full. Even though the service was very attentive, I did not feel like they were being invasive, as I have experienced at other places. The food was ok -- I think the appetizers and desserts are the best off the menu. Everything tasted fine, but it was not worth the money. To start off, we had the onion soup, duck liver mousse, and goat cheese and onion tart. For the main course I had the duck confit, which was very tender, fell right off the bone, and melted in your mouth. While it tasted fine, the dish had no balance -- it was piled onto wild mushrooms and potato crisps. I would have liked to see some wild rice or gnocchi under there. Because of this I was only able to stomach about half the plate. For dessert I had the pavlova, which was excellent. Again, food was fine, but only the goat cheese and onion tart and the pavlova were worth the money. I don't think I'll be coming back to Balthazar, but If I do, it will only be for coffee and a dessert.
