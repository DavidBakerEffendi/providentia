Very good food, excellent menu, smart and attentive service, nice atmosphere.  It wasn't a mind blowing experience, but now when I think Greek in Manhattan, this is the place I will think about.  Can't wait to go again.  Oh, I should mention that it is very reasonably priced relative to quality.  Most places of this caliber are more expensive.
