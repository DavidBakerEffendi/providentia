Just awful. Long wait and bad food. My girlfriend got the Pad Thai, I got the Pad See Yue.  The Pad Thai was completely flavorless: just tasted like a bunch of rice noodles in a bowl.  Included a pathetic amount of vegetables. The Pad See Yue, on the other hand, had a lot of flavor.  Can you guess what it tasted like? BURNT noodles. Way too greasy as well. It's cheap though and the portions are big.  Do yourself a favor and spend $1 more at another restaurant in the neighborhood.
