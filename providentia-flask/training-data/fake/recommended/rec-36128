2 words: pork buns. The pork is so fatty and delicious, I almost died when I bit into it. Could you get very similar - or even better - pork buns at an authentic Chinese/Taiwanese restaurant for a much lower price? Probably. But these are amazing nonetheless, and the pork is of good quality. Spicy pork sausage & crispy rice cakes: these were so spicy that I started tearing up when I ate them...but then again, I'm not good with spicy food. If you're like me and freak out over spicy sauces, I wouldn't recommend getting these. Customer service: not amazing, but not bad, either. Overall, it was worth the try!
