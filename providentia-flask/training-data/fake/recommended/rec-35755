This is a great place, I come here almost once a week and the waitstaff is so polite and knowledgeable.  They really make an effort to keep things organic/bio-sustainable/eco-friendly, but what really makes this place is the food.  My wife loves their fish preparation and I'm always wowed by their modern takes on classic dishes (blood orange confit with veal, yum!).  Their wine selection is also very accessible and easy to drink and enjoy.  All in all, definitely 5 stars, no doubt.
