Hmm, not sure how valid my review will be.  I didn't really go to Pat's, my bf did.  He flew back a mushroom cheesesteak with provolone cheese to me in SF! Of course the sandwich wasn't the freshest but from looking at the grease stained bags the cheesesteak came in, I can tell a hell of a lot of oil was used to toast the bread! But I think all the oiliness made the sandwich taste delish! I would have liked more cheese and mushroom on mine though, after all it is a MUSHROOM cheesesteak! But the sandwich did come with a lot of meat.  The bf had the pizza steak, which he sat and ate at Pat's. He said this was a very popular choice since everyone in front of him ordered it. Out of all the cheesesteaks he tried (pizza steak, pork cheesesteak, mushroom cheesesteak, italian cheesesteak), he says the pizza steak is the best because of the marinara sauce. Overall, this place has average cheesesteaks. The sandwiches are definitely pricey though. If I were to go to Philly, I don't think I need to come here..maybe just to step foot at it to say I went to the original cheesesteak place but I'd rather try another place for cheesesteaks.
