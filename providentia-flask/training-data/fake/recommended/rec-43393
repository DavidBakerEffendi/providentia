Three words: Del i cious All right, just one word, but one amazing word that should be three words. The name confused me a bit because I think the area the food (and hopefully owners) is from is called "Lan Zhou", but that's ok. It's definitely not the worst translation error I've ever seen. The broth was, as it's supposed to be, teeming with flavor in every bite. I got the beef brisket, and convinced my dining companion to get the lamb. I felt kind of bad for him after tasting how awesome my beef is, compared with the mediocre lamb, but really... I wasn't going to share more than one bite.
