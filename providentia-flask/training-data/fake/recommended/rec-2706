Went here with really high expectations. i guess that was my mistake. Â  Plenty of yelpers spoke very highly of this place & have written raves reviews about the service ,atmosphere and food.Arrived for brunch a few minutes after our reservation slot and our table was still waiting for us. The service here is impeccable and the staff that helped us out were friendly and know the menu. Everyone in our group commented on the awesome decor especially the exposed brick wall and dark wood furniture. The brunch options sound very inviting with a southern spin so i was excited to try something different. I decided on the heuvos rancheros with a crawfish etouffe. What arrived to my table was a semi warm dish that looked as though it should be an appetizer. The tortilla base was a little on the hard side and the crawfish etouffe though flavorful was not as warm as it should have been. The sunny side up egg (yes just one) was not nearly as runny as i would have prefered but at least it was warmer than everything else on the plate. I probably should have sent back the dish but i was starving and didnt anticipate still being hungry post brunch. The theme for this brunch was small , cold servings but fantatsic service so based on the service alone i would give rex another shot. Im hoping the rest of the menu is full of normal size options that are WARM and filling.
