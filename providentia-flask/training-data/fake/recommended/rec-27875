If nothing else, this place is great for the price alone.  The roti is fresh and stuffed to the max with your chosen ingredients.  Personally, I get the vegetable roti and, no matter how hard I try, can never finish the whole thing--a bit more than half if I'm lucky. The area is gross and the storefront lacks character.  The signage boasts that they cater for all occasions and that they sell "Trinidad Style Chinese Food".  The hours are sporadic.  I've walked past late at night and it has been open but have also walked by around dinner time and it was shuttered.  I guess that's the luxury of a family run business--which I believe it is. There isn't indoor seating... perhaps a bench or two by the window.  It's not somewhere you want to dine.  So grab your $5 roti and head home to enjoy the island goodness.  Their special hot sauce is not for the faint at heart.  I consider myself to be a spice addict but I cannot even begin to put that liquid fire on my roti.  Tobasco will do just fine.
