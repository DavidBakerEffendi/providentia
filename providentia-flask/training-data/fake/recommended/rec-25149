A really amazingly delicious spot that I could not recommend enough! I've been twice and am eager to go back again. I've tried a number of things on the menu and loved everything. But the absolute standout and one of the best things I've ever eaten in my entire life are the Black Mission Figs with grilled serano ham, mozzarella and port reduction. I DREAM about this dish it's so good!!! Other very delicious things: combination platter, sauteed wild mushrooms, baked meatballs, shrimp & chorizo, lobster cakes, short rib.
