The food and coffee here are both excellent! The service stinks!!! Don't get me wrong, the staff and servers are very friendly but it takes FOREVER! You wait for a seat, you wait for drinks, you wait for food, you wait wait wait for everything! Honestly, we have gone elsewhere to have not so good food just to not deal with a breakfast or brunch that takes 2 hours start to finish! I love Hinge but they need better management of the front of house!
