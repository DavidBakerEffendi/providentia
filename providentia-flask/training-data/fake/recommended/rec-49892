Tamalex is listed under "Mexican" here on Yelp, despite it technically being a Honduran restaurant. Yes it's true; they do tacos and burritos (my current favorite burrito in the city, actually) but they also do traditional Honduran cuisine.   For something a little different, try the "huarache": a thick corn tortilla with salsa, refried beans, peppers, onions, cactus paddle, Oaxaca cheese, and chicken (if you like).   They also make some of the best fried chicken that I've had outside of Speck's (in Collegeville, PA). They also offer a selection of fresh juices by the quart! Pineapple, watermelon, strawberry, hibiscus, and cantaloupe are the most common flavors that I've seen.  I think they're about $3 each, which is SO worth it, especially on a hot day. It's not fancy and their English can be a bit dicey, depending on who's working, but the food is more than worth a little effort to overcome the language barrier.
