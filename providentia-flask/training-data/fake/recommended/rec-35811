I would have rated this place 4 or 5 stars except we had this very off-putting experience.... and at this point want to put 0 stars, except you can't, but let me tell you the whole story. 6:30 reservation for 4. First person arrives on time, I was 10 minutes late (because their web site directions are so messed up - I'm not sure how they could be more wrong - sue me, I'm from Chicago and was driving, but the directions were REALLY F%$ked up). I was supposed to bring person #3, but she was ill and couldn't make it (which I told the person who seated me). Our 4th person was going to be late - his aunt passed, and the funeral was that day. So we also told our waiter, and he was happy for us to wait, but we 2 who were there said we'd order, and he'd just join us for a drink or maybe one or two things. We ordered a nice bottle of wine, one thing to try, and then were planning to order more. The waiter came by, but only refilled our drinks and headed off. We actually wanted to order more food, but didn't get the chance. At this point it was around 7:15 and our friend was stuck in traffic, but expected to be there maybe 7:30. And the manager came over. And told us that he had a reservation for the table at 8:30, and that if he'd known our friend was going to be so late he wouldn't have taken the reservation. Which I had made weeks before. Now, it's not like we were just sitting there. Plus it's a tapas bar! It's also not like you have to be there for appetizer, entree, dessert. He essentially told us to get up and get out! NOT the way to handle it. If we were still there at 8:30, and they needed the table, they could say "you know, we need the table and were wondering if you'd mind if we reseated you at the bar?" But to tell us over an hour before they need the table that we have to hurry up?
