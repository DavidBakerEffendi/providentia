You're either a Pat's guy or a Geno's guy. I am a Geno's guy, all the way. It's a classic Philly establishment, with a Philly attitude and I love it. It's a staple of the community and it's got great food to boot. I love the hearty cheesesteaks, and they're probably my favorite in-city joint. Only thing that is disappointing is the lack of seating once it gets crowded.
