This is the best addition to South street in years. I am absolutely thrilled. I almost didn't want to write a review for Rex because I'm afraid everyone is going to find out about this spot and I'll never be able to get in again. The food is incredible! The mac and cheese is out of this world- it has such a different flavor and comes with tomatoes in it... the crumb topping is delicious. We also had the sweet potato fries, the burger, and the arugula salad with pears. The maple vinaigrette on the salad was a really pleasant surprise... my only gripe was that the pears were a liiiittle soggy, but nothing to complain too much about. Everything was really really delicious and I can't wait to come back again soon. I kind of wish they had regular fries, and I kind of wish they had other burger options (aka not blue cheese/bacon/carmelized onions). HOWEVER, it's enormously exciting even without these things.
