I have been going to this restaurant about once a week for the past several years.  The food is fantastic!  The best bargain in this area is the Sunday gravy dinner, which is all inclusive. For dining other than Sundays, I must say I've never had a bad dish here.  New to the menu are Berkshire pork chops, which qualify as one of the best pork chops I've ever had. There is a long list of specials that I typically try to select from.  Service is good and since we've been going there for such a long time, everyone knows you. It is a BYOB, which makes this more appealing.
