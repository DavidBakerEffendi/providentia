Because I love this place, I took my mom there this afternoon. What started out as a disaster led to a wonderful lunch. I ordered the vegan hot dogs as I usually do. My mom got the salmon sandwich. I bit into my hot dog and spit it out immediately upon realizing that it was beef. I'm a vegetarian. Uh oh. I notified the waitress, she apologized and my food was brought out. It was delicious as usual, but I was pretty upset by the experience because it was my first bad experience of any kind at Westville and I was definitely let down. She offers my mom and I a complimentary dessert. I thought this was the extent of the apology but was still gracious. We ordered an apple pie and I got a coffee. Then, she brought us the check. We were only charged for my mom's sandwich. The total was twelve dollars. I was shell shocked. What would have been a meal costing over thirty dollars, was twelve dollars. I thanked the waitress so much because I was genuinely happy to know that the business really cared about its reputation and its relationship with its customers. I commended her on her professionalism and her graciousness. I wish I caught her name but I can attribute the gestures of apology only to the business as a whole. I was honestly doubting whether I would back into the restaurant after being served a beef dog after clearly ordering a vegan one, but now I know that I don't have to fear mistakes because they will take care of business.
