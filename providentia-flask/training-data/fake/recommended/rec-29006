Roast pork, broccoli raub, and sharp provolone for the win!!! It is worth the wait; besides the wait isn't really all that bad. The staff is used to handling the masses of people. The sandwich is so juicy and delicious. Try getting there either before the lunch hour or after the lunch hour if you want to get in and out quick. They only take cash, so come prepared or stop by the ATM in the seating area of the market.
