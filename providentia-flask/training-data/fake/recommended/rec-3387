Beautiful and upscale restaurant. Nice for a romantic date. The staff is friendly and it has an open kitchen. I took my gf there for her birthday and she was very impressed. I made reservations and was promptly seated. Very nice waitress. The food was delicious, I had the special which consisted of scallops, shrimp and a cocoa sauce. The entire experience made me feel good enough that I didn't faint when I saw the bill. Yea, its kind of a pocket breaker for the average joe.
