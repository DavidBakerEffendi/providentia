I just got back from the bar at Heirloom and the service was awful! We sat down at a table near the bar to wait for some friends and after about five minutes, the waiter stormed up to our table and said "are you going to order anything? ... I mean, you can order whenever you are ready, I was just checking." Weird. Anyway, our party took a while to assemble and our rather overeager waiter repeated his shtick twice. When we were finally ready to order, he seemed really pressed for time. Someone in my party asked if there were any cocktails and it turned out he hadn't given us the cocktail menu. So he went and got one ... for a party of nine. And then, god forbid I should actually want a minute to look at the menu and then change my order! What annoyed me even more than this waiter's poor attitude was that he didn't seem to be treating any of his other tables so poorly. We were definitely the youngest group there and it seemed like our waiter had decided that we were just some group of rowdy college kids and weren't worth his time. New Haven is a college town, so if you're going to treat "college kids" badly, you're going to lose a lot of business. And oh by the way, no one in my group is even in college anymore! Shape up, Heirloom.
