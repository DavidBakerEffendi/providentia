My husband and I happened upon this tiny little diner on Sunday morning and decided to go on in for breakfast!  We had a full spread including a Western omlette, bacon, pancakes, toast, coffee, orange juice and more!  The food was really good!  The staff was very friendly! We will definitely be going back!
