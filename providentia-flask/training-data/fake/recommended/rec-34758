This place is my spot for really cheap and fast korean food. Also, a really cheap drink spot. It's self serve, and the beer and soju is cheap.  The food isnt great but its okay.  Its open late and they have a reward system where they stamp your card for every $5 you spend.  I like their spicy pork pre made dishes, their seaweed soup which is only a dollar, and bulgogi premade dishes. Skip the bi bim bap (tends to be dry), and their spicy chicken dish.
