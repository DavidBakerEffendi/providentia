My motto is, when in doubt, round up. I feel Wolfnights is not quite a 4, but much more than a 3. the wraps taste great, they're open late, the food is fresh and made upon ordering (even the wrap itself is MADE). I also adore the ambiance and how it adds a little kick to the neighborhood of sit-down-bar-restaurant, but-we're-really-boozin-hard. make sure you try the home made sauces. Theyre located in the back of the tiny store on a tray. Don't worry, they have to-go cups for the sauce as well. missing stars because no one knows where their meat is sourced (always looking for animals that had a good life without antibiotics/hormones)
