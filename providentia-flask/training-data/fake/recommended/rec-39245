Located right next to the entrance of Cheesecake Factory, UMI Sushi + Tapas is one of the best addition in town. I would never imagine having kaiten sushi in Connecticut but there I was staring at the conveyer belt hoping to snatch something tasty off it. Be there for lunch (from open til 3PM) for their Lunch Special. Most sushi are priced at $2.50 (lower than normal). I'm quite picky with my sushi and I can tell you that UMI has the freshest fish.
