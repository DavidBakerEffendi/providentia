A hidden gem in Staten Island! You feel like you're in New Orleans when you come to Bayou. I usually do the prix fixe menu when I go, which is pretty cheap for a 3 course meal. Some items I've tried are the beef medallion, lobster bisque, crab cakes, alligator bites and pork cutlets. I can honestly say I have never had a bad meal here. The space is a bit small, but newly renovated. The parking can be a hassle, so car pool if you can. Mondays are usually psychic night, for those interested. They do have other entertainment throughout the week, so definitely check their website for updated events.
