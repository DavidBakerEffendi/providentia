The food here is not amazing, but it is good, especially considering how inexpensive it is. I had the chorizo and cactus appetizer and the carnitas taco. Both were good portions and were not expensive. The chorizo was nothing special, as it tasted almost like a hot dog, and the carnitas on their own didn't have much flavor but were good together with the onions, cilantro and hot sauce. My friend had the steak fajita, which he loved. I tried the steak and it had good flavor. I would definitely come back to try more things on the menu. In general, it is simple Mexican food that is good and inexpensive.
