Here's the deal. On a recent vacation to Philladelphia I thought to myself "I'm in Philly, clearly a cheesteak is in order". After the show on Food Network I knew exactly where to go... that crazy corner where both places have those great sammy's. Ugh. I was surprised when i noticed that Geno's Â boasts signs like "If you can't speak English get out of line" and insane racial propaganda that is honestly ignorant. After talking to some locals it turns out that these guys are some seriously racist dudes who feel like it's okay to spew their hate talk like it's no big deal. I got out of line. Not spending a penny here. It's not okay and in most of the country these hate mongers would get run out of business. I got a great cheesesteak down on South Street by some rasta dudes who were AWESOME. Suck it GENOS!!
