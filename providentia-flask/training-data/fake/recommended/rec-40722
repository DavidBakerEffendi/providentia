Dear Tasty Hand-Pulled Noodles, You have successfully ruined noodles from any other establishment but your own for me. Why are you so good? This was my first foray into the world of hand pulled noodles and I'm definitely a fan. The ingredients are fresh, basic and unencumbered which truly allows the noodles to shine as the star of the meal. Thanks for also being patient with me and my many questions regarding ordering. As others have stated...definitely go for the beef broth with an egg in it. The pan fried noodles are pretty awesome too. The prices are very affordable considering the portion size. If you ever have a hankering for some noodles...catch a ride down to Chinatown and check out tasty hand pulled noodles. I promise you won't be disappointed.
