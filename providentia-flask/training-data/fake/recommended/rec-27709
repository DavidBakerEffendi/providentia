Great, modern decor (black and white checkered floor did it for me), courteous staff, and tasty eats.  Even though my colleague and I had to wait approx. 15 mins. for a table, it was quite pleasant as the host created some banter.  We ordered the Mac & Cheese which was gooey & cheesy (yet light) with bits of ham and green beans (or haricot vert as they state on the menu), and topped off with bread crumbs.  Quite tasty although I would have liked a little more cheese. I ordered the BBQ Pork Sandwich with red onion, sweet pickles and sweet potato fries.  The bun was toasted to perfection, and the BBQ (although a bit commercial tasting) hit the spot.  I could have used a bit more fries, but it was a lunch portion which was adequate.  I'm looking forward to the next visit for a nice, casual lunch. PS - try to get a seat outdoors if it's nice weather out.
