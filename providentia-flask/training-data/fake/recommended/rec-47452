Little piece of French heaven on Williamsburg soil! This cold February evening my significant other and I decided to open the door of this cute looking tiny place. Immediately our hearts were melted with the nice attitude of the server and the chef who served us our main dishes. The stew was perfect for the winter weather and the crepe with white wine, mushrooms, a bit of chicken was just delicious. With the musical background of Motown, we sank into dessert of house made chocolate and bananas in the crepe...and we left already dreaming about our next visit. Dreaming a little dream about this place to be revisited soon, or pardon my simple French "Rêve un petit rêve de PATES ET TRADITION". Highly recommended.
