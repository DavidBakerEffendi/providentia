Excelent service. The owner personally waited on us. Even thou the kitchen mistakenly added bacon to my sandwich, the owner made it right immediately. He was very apologetic, offered a drink and personally delivered a new dish in no time. Very respectful and friendly. The place looks astonishing. Amazing decor, new industrial indie style with pictures of the restaurant renovation on the front dining room walls. An amazing artsy chandelier is watching upon the guests in main dining room. And like that wasn't enough, the restroom offer a cozy elegant "rest"
