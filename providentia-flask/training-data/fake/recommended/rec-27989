This is the best pizza in South Philly. It's not quite as thick as sicilian but it is rectangular. The prices are great. My landlord, who recommended this place, likes to get it with extra sauce. We like it with a well-done crust. They have great toppings but I love their plain cheese pizza. It's addictive. Â Cash only.
