I went today for the first time and had the dill scrambled eggs and feta. Coffee was superb, food was very good and fairly priced, and the staff was very nice and attentive.  The feel was also much better feel than the traditional Rittenhouse options (Marathon, Continental, etc). On the downside I had to wait about 20 min for a table, but I did go at 1pm on a Sunday, the height of brunch I suppose.  Regardless, it is great to have a nice brunch spot on this end of the city without having to troop to Sabrina's each week.  I will definitely be going back!
