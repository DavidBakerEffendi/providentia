Delicious and cheap. What more can you ask for. Came here for lunch with a few work buddies. We ordered several dishes including the room service pad thai. Everything was delicious. The lunch menu started at 6.95$ which included a standard dish + an appetizer. And the appetizer was not a joke like most other restaurants. It was a serious and delicious side dish. The room service pad thai was interesting and tasty. It was made out of glass noodles and was wrapped in an egg.
