This place is soooo good! Went here on a visit to new york with the boyfriend. We loved this place, the pizza is so yummy. We ordered the meat/cheese plate, apple salad, cuttlefish and 2 pizzas (Brusselmania was sooo good I could eat it all day every day). Everything was amazing, and the employees are awesome, nice and super cute. The restaurant is easy to miss, but once you're inside you immediately get a "this is the spot" type of feeling. The food is just good, the ambiance is awesome and the music they play is fun. Have since gone back for a bday party, and they serve beer in mason jars. It just doesn't get better. I'm happy my friend works there and can hook it up. I have been thinking about planning a trip to bk just to go to Roberta's.
