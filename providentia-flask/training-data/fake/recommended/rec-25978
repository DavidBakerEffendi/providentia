Small restaurant, great atmosphere, romantic and delicious food. Came here for Valentines day and it was completely full. The service was great and the drinks were on point. They gave us free dessert (chocolate and passion fruit) and have live Brazilian music at 9pm. This place is definitely a hidden gem! I plan on going back soon.
