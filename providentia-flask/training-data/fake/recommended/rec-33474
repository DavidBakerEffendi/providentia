i've been here thrice now, once for brunch, once for an afternoon beverage and once for dinner. the ambiance can't be beat; lovely natural light in the daytime illuminates exposed brick and stucco walls, lush potted trees, dark wood-paneled ceilings, terra cotta floors and mediterranean stylings of tile and hanging pottery. it really just makes you want to take a nap on their cushioned benches as a light breeze plays around your face. at night, candlelight sets a more romantic tone, and on friday nights, a man in the center of the restaurant plucks away on his spanish guitar. it was on such a friday night that i had dinner with a friend here, consisting of various tapas and an entree each, washed down with a carafe of raspberry sangria. the tapas were, overall, excellent. herbed goat cheese croquettes, cod croquetas and a chicken liver special whetted our appetites, which were then honed with a roasted half-chicken for me and a lentil bean salad for my friend. these were sadly not as amazing as the tapas; my chicken was drier than expected and though i thought my friend's salad was delicious, she felt it wasn't quite up to its usual snuff. the raspberry sangria, however, more than made up for any lack of satisfaction in the fare, as we were both left buzzed and blissful by the end of the evening. i might mention also that adrien grenier, canoodling in the corner with his lady companion added to the charming ambiance that evening. the brunch at this place is simply delicious. i had the green eggs and lamb, which consisted of lamb sausage, cilantro scrambled eggs, home fries and a side salad of leafy baby greens. the bloody mary is one of the best i've had; i was told the secret is in the A1 sauce used in lieu of worsterchire sauce. the coffee is strong and flavorful and, if you're sitting outdoors, it's great people-watching. prices are reasonable, and certainly sweetened by the chocolates (bearing the name of the restaurant on the wrapper) provided atop the check.
