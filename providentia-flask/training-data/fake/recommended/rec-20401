This place is deliciously tacky. But because I'm pretty low-brow, I didn't mind it when: 1. The waiter came over in a rush, pointed to the menu on the wall, and said, "Ready to order?" Or when he never came to check on how we were doing. Or when we had to actually flag him down* in order another round of beer. Or that he seemed VERY annoyed at us from the minute we sat down. We are nice and quiet and charming, sir. Wrap it up. 2. That the $3 grilled cheese I ordered was something I could have made at home . . . and had it taste better.** 3. That the $2.75 fries were awful but that I kept eating them anyway.*** 4. That the wait for the bathroom was awkwardly cramped and terribly long.**** Maybe it's because I was happily buzzed from all of the $2.75 McSorley's, but I survived. Best of all? A table of 6 people with a round of beers, a burger, a grilled cheese, and two orders of fries only came to $30 total. Corner Bistro may be a lot of things, but a robber it is not. __________ * And I mean, I never wave waitstaff down--it's tacky. But if the shoe fits . . . ** And I'm the world's worst cook. I can barely pour cereal out of the box without it getting all over the floor. *** Secret Fatties Unite. **** And that some girl was trying to cut me for the men's restroom.
