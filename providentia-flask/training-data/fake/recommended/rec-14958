I really love this spot.  It's a great place to go out with friends if you're tired of the same-old same-old of Center City bars.  It has a spacious indoor bar area as well as a big courtyard-style beer garden.  There is a fully functioning bar and kitchen outside, and anything they can't make at the bar they will order from the inside bar and serve to your table.  Both inside and outside areas feature a few ping-pong tables and jenga sets on many of the tables. The beer is all great and affordable, but what's unique about Frankford Hall is their milkshakes.  I know the thought of mixing liquor with dairy sounds pretty gross, but it's delicious.  The orange creamcicle one is the best. The food is mostly German cuisine, with several different choices of hotdogs, served with sauerkraut or red cabbage.  For a Steven Starr restaurant, the food is surprisingly reasonably priced. Frankford Hall is even great in the wintertime.  With dozens of adjustable heat lamps and a few big fire pits, it stays warm enough even in 30 degree weather. One last minor point: I'm not sure how they do it with how big the place is, but they have some of the cleanest bathrooms I've ever seen at a bar.
