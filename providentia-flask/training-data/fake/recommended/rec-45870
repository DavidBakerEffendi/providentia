Andrews is a God send for those of us on a gluten free diet. The sandwiches are so good I've had them all. The Irish is my personal favorite. The cakes are so so good I treat myself to a nice big slice from time time and it can almost bring a tear to my eye. Andrews gets pretty crowded and dining in may be uncomfortable. Â Please call your order in advance as the food is so fresh and the sandwiches so big each order takes awhile. Andrew for President!
