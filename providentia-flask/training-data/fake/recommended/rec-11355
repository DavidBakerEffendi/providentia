What an enjoyable restaurant - from every aspect. The upbeat, urban-chic, airy atmosphere punctuated by the casual open-kitchen feel.  An Italian- country (lunch) menu, that offered an innovative take on dishes that could well have been mundane in lesser hands. Prompt service and well portioned dishes that were not outrageously priced. The food was better than good. It was unique and memorable. The kind that makes you long to taste everything else on the menu. This is a foodies place - that said i've noted other reviews critical of the dishes. The only wisdom I can offer is - i guess thats why there is chocolate and vanilla... Is there a downside? I think Osta Ria has a reputation for being a bit loud - which I can imagine could be true at a more crowded time.  If I have any criticism, it would be the wine list. Not for lack of imagination, but simply because the pricing seem incongruous with the rest of the menu. The majority of wines tended to be mid-forties and up per bottle - which seems out of whack with a menu that proffers entrees in the low to high teens. I believe adding a selection of wines in the 25-35$ - at least for the lunch menu would make this place perfect. Can't wait for the repeat performance.
