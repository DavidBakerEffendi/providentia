This place used to be one of my favorite restaurants in the Northern Liberties area, but is now one of my last choices.  The food seems to have changed over the last few months...and not for the better.  It's been bland, too salty or too greasy.  The traditional menu is good, but their brunch needs help.  The margaritas are quite tasty and I recommend the tacos.
