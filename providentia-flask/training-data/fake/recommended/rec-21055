This place is a tremendous value and the servers are great.  We ordered tziki and I enjoyed the subtle use of garlic. Most Greek places usually load it up with garlic. For the main course I ordered the lamb stew with orzo and loved it! My wife ordered the spanikopita and she was also very pleased.  The only downer was that we were seated in the back right next to the exit and it was very drafty. It also gets really loud so don't count on a quiet, romantic night out here. Just count on delicious Greek cuisine and great service all for a great price!
