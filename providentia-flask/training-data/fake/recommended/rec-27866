i don't even LIKE pizza and i have to say that this pizza is ridiculously delicious!  a friend and i went recently for an early (6pm) dinner and were both kinda blown away!   our server was very cool, made really good suggestions for apps and wines, and sat down with us to go over it all.  we had the meatballs and white beans and pesto to start.  delicious.  for the pizzas, we got the artichoke and smoked pancetta and the cremini and fennel sausage.   i repeat: i don't even LIKE pizza but i definitely am a fan of what they're doing over at barboncino!!!
