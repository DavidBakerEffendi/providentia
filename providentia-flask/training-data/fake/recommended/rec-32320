I'll be the slight downer in this litany of praise. I've been to Sketch a few times and though the atmosphere & service is pleasantly quirky and the menu & specials are unique, the burgers themselves leave a bit to be desired.  Maybe I'm not as adventurous as the menu suggests I should be - I get the sirloin burger with cheddar, avocado & bacon (no sauce).  However, even the most basic burger should be delicious.  There is never enough seasoning to the meat, which is I suppose why a sauce is recommended.  I also wish the lettuce were a better quality served in big luscious pieces as opposed to just shredded flavourless iceberg. The portions are indeed huge (sometimes not a good thing - I dislike having to figure out how to bite into it) and you get your money's worth in that respect, but they never ever sit well in my stomach.  I had one over two hours ago and it's just a brick in there making me feel gross. The shakes are really good, but I'd suggest getting one to go and not having it with the burger because either one, the other or both won't get finished in that sitting (maybe I just have a small stomach, who knows). I'll end with this - a block away is a place where I get the exact same order of a burger (minus avocado, but plus tasty pickles) that is always perfect and digests beautifully.  Try Kraftwork's burger - you might not return to Sketch.
