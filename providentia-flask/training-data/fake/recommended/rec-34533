Fries are great quality, sauces are brilliant, but have a drink with you as they are super salty.  I don't think they are worth waiting on a really long line for, but they are definitely tasty. I don't think they are the end all, be all of French fries like some people swear it is, but I have frequented it over the years.  I don't know, sometimes I crave expensive Pommes Frites, and sometimes I crave dollar menu McDonald's fries.   Just depends!
