Ghandi is a very small, homey-feeling restaurant in Bed-Stuy. My friend and I had Tandoori Chicken, Aloo Motor Gobi, "special" (and they were) vegetable samosas, Daal poori, and plain poori, plus "assorted condiments". Poori was fluffy and just the right amount of crispy. Tandoori chicken arrived properly spiced and sizzling on a scorching platter. YUM. We ate almost too much. Best thing about the place is the warm, friendly service. And lets face it, for some reason Park Slope Indian is just, meh...A short drive to Bed Stuy brings you to much better Indian fare. And fairly priced too! I will go again. Only not so spectacular part of this meal was the gratis dessert offering - some sort of syrupy-sweet cake-like balls that looked like beige, skinless, grapes (not bad actually), and a bowl of cottage cheesey pudding with an odd after-taste (sure wouldn't pay for it and will likely turn down another free dessert of this stuff. While we had no trouble parking, when asked, the owner promised that for a decent-sized (he said $30+) order they would indeed make a deivery to the Slope. We shall see. Unless you want to schlepp to the east village, you should check out Gandhi...
