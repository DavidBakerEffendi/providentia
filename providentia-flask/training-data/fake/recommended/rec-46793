First thing you need to know about the place: it's classy. If you sit by the counter ( which I recommend you to do that), you can see into the kitchen through the wooden slide doors. And you can tell from things they wear (hat and gloves) that you don't need to worry about food poison. 4 stars for the Incredible service! They serve hot towels before you order the drinks. And sometimes offer hot towel again if your food involves fingertips. And very helpful when you make the order and especially after the food is served. I speak Japanese and know a lot about Japanese cuisines so I don't really need their help but other guests sitting next to me are mostly not so familiar with the food. The waiter speaks really good English and explains everything about the food he served and gave tips about how to eat the food in the right way (mix things up, eat what with what, things like that). It's very considerate for them to do that. Even I was surprised to see so many small plates and small bowls in a large plate when I order a set. People may be confused by the whole things and can really use some advice. The only one star I take away is for the relevantly long time I waited for the food to come. I understand the place was busy especially during the time when I visited and really enjoyed watching the busy kitchen and other people's food. But if you are extremely hungry and really in need of a quick meal, or you are extremely short-tempered, you may find the place "slow". Anyway, I'll definitely visit the place another time myself and try their sake and grill.
