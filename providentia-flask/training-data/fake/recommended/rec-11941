They got hit hard by Hurricane Sandy, but they are open!!  (Currently cash only). While seated, you can look at the wall and see the water marks from the flooding. Their kitchen was devastated, but they cleaned up and repaired and everything is brand spanking new. (Yay!!) They have a limited menu, but it's still a wide selection of food and drink. My favorites include the "skinny" margarita (100 cal.) and deep fried okra (see, it all balances out. Well, that's what I tell myself). They offer a decent variety of vegetarian and a couple vegan menu items too (veg chili, black bean tacos, salads, etc. etc.). The "Evacuation Zone Burrito Bowl" was too much for me to finish, but I dug it.  Check out the Post Sandy menu online. Oh, and don't forget Taco Tuesdays either ($2 tacos)! I've enjoyed many black bean tacos and margaritas or mojitos here. *Burp* Just go now and support a local business. These folks are super nice and worth it.
