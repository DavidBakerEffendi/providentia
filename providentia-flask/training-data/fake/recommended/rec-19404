First of all, a French Bistro is NOT on my  list of places to go for a meal.  But on the advice of several people I met on my tour of Philly, I took their advice and made reservations for my wife and I on a Friday night.  This is NOT an inexpensive restaurant by any means, but it's not out of this world either.  Prices range from$16-38 for entrees and appetizers, salads and wines are upper scale in price as well.  Still, the place was very busy and the staff were attentive and friendly.  We were seated immediately by a window and had great opportunity to people watch. Our waitress helped us with the "french terminology" of the menu and we made our choices.   Our meal was preceded by a basket of fresh baked bread and butter which were incredibly tasty.  The meals were delivered immediately after the bread arrived and we dug in.  The meals were quite presentable, tasty and very filling.   I may never get the chance to return to The Parc in Philly, but it will be a long time before I forget this wonderful experience.
