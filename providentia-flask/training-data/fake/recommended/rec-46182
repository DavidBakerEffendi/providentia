Average food, overpriced. Calamari was not good at all especially for an Italian restaurant. Ricotta on my vegetable dish tasted and had the consistency of cream cheese. "Butter" that came with the complimentary bread was hard as a rock, and tasted more like margarine. Staff felt like they forced their niceness, and although we didn't have a reservation we were sat in the worst possible table in the place.
