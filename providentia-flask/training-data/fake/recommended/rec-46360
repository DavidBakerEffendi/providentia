I'd received a couple of recommendations for Market Table, so as part of the food safari my husband and I are on, I thought we'd give it a try.  You know what?  It was a disappointment for us.  While my pan-roasted chicken was very good -- I think it's about as good as chicken gets - oddly, the halibut ordered by my husband was unremarkable.  I say 'oddly' because it is one of the more expensive items on the menu, and  it really fell short  (description:  "flavorless"...) We began the meal with the beet salad, and I have to say that was excellent but not a real differentiator -- we're running into equally good or better beet salads in just about every decent eating establishment in the City.   So that wouldn't be enough to bring us back in. I might be convinced to give it another try if it weren't for this: when we left, every inch of us smelled like we'd been working in the kitchen - clothes, hair, even my handbag.   Ick.  It smells good when you're going to eat it, but not when you're having to wear it for the rest of the night.  Glad we skipped the dessert so we could pay the dry cleaning bill.   This one doesn't make my all star list, sorry.
