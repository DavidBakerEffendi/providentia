This is the hottest, undisputed, hands down busiest Cuban (Spanish) restaurant in town. When they tell you it's a hour wait, they're not joking, if you get here after 6:30pm on the weekends, it's a 30mins wait for 4 or less, a hour for six or more, if you have more than 10pp, might as well stay home and cook your own. Don't try to tip the mustache, he's the owner, and he can be a little rude, the girls are easier to talk to, but helpless so save the flirting.  The wait is well worth it. Order the Churrasco, a must!  if I could, I'd order all the tapas. The food portion here are generous (except the tapas) and delicious. if you are deciding between a Mexican, Columbian, or Spanish night, I recommend you give Cuban Pete's a try. Place will be loud, filled with music and bootylicious ladies, it gets more urban as the night goes on. Parking will be a pain but there is a public parking garage and get here early on the weekends (before 7).  Aplausos!
