So I read the reviews and decided I had to come here. Stopped by on a Saturday night and was seated immediately. Seating is bit crowded but I never have a problem with that, gives me an opportunity to see what others are eating, lol. The waiter came quickly and gave the daily specials (in his heavy Italian accent I should add) and what was not available from the menu. Went with the Crostini Toscana (Homemade toasted bread with fresh chopped tomato, celery, white tuscan beans, basil, chopped sweet onion, virgin olive oil and topped with boiled eggs) for the Antipasti. Wasn't disappointed and very tasty! For the Secondi I ordered the Taglierini Sorrento (Fresh thin black noodles with shrimp, lobster meat, scallops, clams, fresh chopped tomato, parsley, olive oil, white wine and garlic sauce) since I'm a seafood lover and it was highly recommended in the reviews. AWESOME!! Best plate of pasta I've had that I can think of. They didn't skimp on any of the ingredients and all were cooked to perfection. I was expecting something good but it was WAY beyond that. The wine selection was good and covered all the bases. The service was impeccable! They gave all the time that was needed to decide, happily substituted or explained items on the menu and were very attentive. If I didn't know better I would've thought I was somebody important, lol. In short this place is a must if your into Italian food. If nothing I have written has convinced you maybe this will. 1 Bottle of wine, 1 antipasti and 2 secondis all under $60.
