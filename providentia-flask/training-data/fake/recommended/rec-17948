About as good as pizza gets.  Pepe's is serious business and is right up there with my two favorite NYC places (John's and Nick's), as being the best pizza I have ever had.  Who would have thought New Haven, CT had such great food, (Louis Lunch as well as Wooster Street Little Italy).  My friend and I waited outside for about 15 minutes and then continued to wait in the small vestebule indoors for another 10 minutes.  As I looked through the glass window into the restaurant I could see a large sausage pie sitting on one of the tables.  My tongue basically rolled onto the floor similar to what you would see in a cartoon.  Keep in mind I had just had two Louis Lunch burgers but I was ready to dive into this pizza.  My friend and I ordered a half plain, half sausage large pie and it tasted just as good as it looked.  The underside of the pie had a perfect bake on it, airy crispy, with a nice flavor from the coal oven.  The sauce and cheese played nicely off of eachother and there was no dominating flavor.  I would urge anyone to take a trip over to Pepe's, I don't think its possible to not like this place.
