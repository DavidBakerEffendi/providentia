I really, really wanted to get there early to try and avoid some of the wait. But after a day of touring, we just couldn't wake up early enough. Got there around 11:30 am on a Saturday morning. We were quoted 1hr 30min. She misquoted the wait, she said when we checked on the list at 1hr 30min. Total time waited 2hrs. I wouldn't have minded but it was cold and windy. So, at this point you're probably wondering why I'm giving them 5 stars. I'm giving them the highest score because the food was amazing! My husband and I are breakfast aficionados. And this is one of the best breakfasts we've had. Coffee, juice(fresh squeezed/sweet), blueberry pancakes, and the biscuit sandwich. Tasting the incredible food made the ridiculous wait make complete sense. We had breakfast elsewhere the following morning and the entire time we were wishing we were back at Clinton St. Baking co. Really wish we lived around the corner from this place.
