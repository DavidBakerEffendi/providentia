This stuff is the bread that dreams are made of.  I saw a special on this bread on tv (some very cool show about artisinal food makers in NYC) and had to try  some ... got a loaf of whole wheat spelt bread at bklyn larder and I am hooked.  Truly amazing stuff.  They aren't trying to be all bread to all people, which I appreciate.  This is my kind of bread - crusty, dense, a little well done.  I am in heaven.  I've never posted on yelp before ... but this bread inspired me to do so!
