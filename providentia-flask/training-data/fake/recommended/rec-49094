I'm a fan indeed! The ONLY reason I didn't give 5 stars it because the noise level is really much too high for a restaurant during brunch and sitting at the bar next to my friend, we still had a hard time hearing each other. The waitress had to read our lips to take our order. They are in some serious need of some soundproofing under the tables or somewhere. The food was great, staff was great, and I didn't mind waiting 30 mins for a table because the food is well worth it. We had the avocado toast, omelette, side of grits, and the egg/mushroom panzanella , as well as a bloody mary. Everything was perfectly cooked, uncomplicated but great ingredients, and diverse menu.I found the portion sizes to be perfect, despite a few reviews here - I think a lot of people are used to getting Cracker Barrel sized portions and think every restaurant is like that Â - I actually think their sizes are perfect - not too much or too little. New favorite spot!
