We came here for a family dinner and was lucky enough to get a reservation for 9 on an hour notice. The service was nearly perfect overall, but then again we did go over the top with 3 bottles of wine and 2 bottles of champagne. Anyhow service wise, the servers were enthusiastic, very attentive, checked up on each set of dishes in a timely manner, they were very polite and gave us excellent treatment. The calamari was my favorite of our appetizers. Lightly crisp, but still chewy on the inside. Absolutely mouthwatering. My next favorite were the mussels which was a special for the day. Well cooked, all the mussels were open and easily accessible with a light sauce. For my entree I got Paillard di pollo. The chicken was completely flattened, tender and juicy, and packed with flavor. My only regret was not ordering the porterhouse which was a daily special and looked absolutely mouth watering! I wasn't a fan of the tiramisu, but the chocolate mousse dessert was amazing!
