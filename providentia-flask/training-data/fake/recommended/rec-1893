My brother and sister-in-law came over from Jersey today,I took them to the new David's Brisket House. In Jersey we have Harold's,Epps Essen and Noah's Ark but my brother thinks that David's kills them . I have to agree with him and add that David's kills Katz's,Sarges's and 2nd Ave. Deli on price as well as quality.. All I can say is that if you want a great Pastrami,Corned Beef or Brisket Â sandwich forget what you've heard about the area, man up and go to David's.
