Had a fantastic dinner here and highly recommend it.  Actually was on a business dinner early but would recommend it for friends dinner, date, etc.  More upscale prices - $24 - $36 for an entree.  Great corner in the West Village and relaxed atmosphere. All three of us enjoyed steak dinners - excellent meat and well cooked.  The sides were delicious and we had great service.   Good wine line - if you line Pinot Noir try the Mt. Beautiful. Will definitely go back.
