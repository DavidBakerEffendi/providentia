fun, easy going beer lover's oasis, but one oddity...they have a fairly extensive Belgian beer list, but have none of the best Belgium has to offer, just the bottom and middle tiers. Perhaps cost prohibitive, but it would be nice to see some real geueze at at Belgian tap toom. Nevertheless, a fun find!
