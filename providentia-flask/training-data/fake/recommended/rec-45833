I tried this place because it was recommended to me by many locals as "A great sandwich place." Upon entering, I was greeted by a dingy interior that was rather dark and not very clean. It was noon on a Wednesday, and not very busy yet. The table I sat at was covered in crumbs and the floor underneath was littered with bits an pieces of food from whomever ate there last. At a busy time I always let this sort of thing go, but there were only 2 tables of dinners and they already had their food. I ordered a turkey/provolone on honey oat with lettuce and honey mustard. This resulted in an $8.75 bill. I know that all food at local establishments on Church Street costs more, but I contribute that not only to the location, but to the quality of the food - usually with as many local ingredients as possible. There were not many options for toppings that you wouldn't find at a chain sub shop. The bread, while clearly made there, was dry and lacked flavor. The turkey and cheese were pretty run-of-the-mill cold-cuts that I would purchase from any supermarket deli. The thickly cut bread does not make up for the small portion of meat and cheese, and while there was nothing particularly wrong with the sandwich, it was relatively plain and boring for nearly $9. For that price, there are a lot of other sandwich shops in the area that I would much rather frequent.
