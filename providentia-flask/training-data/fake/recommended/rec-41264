Chuko is the greatest comfort food of all time. I get the veggie ramen with hard egg but also love the kimchi. The portions are just enough to stuff you and I usually leave mildly hating myself but regretting nothing. The restaurant has no AC and the service is so so but it is the best ramen I have ever had.
