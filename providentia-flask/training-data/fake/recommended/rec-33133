Came here on a Saturday for brunch around 11:30am and the place was not packed yet, which was great.  We ordered the mac & cheese which was delicious and flavorful. We also had the duck hash and a chicken dish.  Their bread was very tasty too and it comes with 3 diff. spreadings !  I'd come here again for the mac & cheese :)
