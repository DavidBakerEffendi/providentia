These tiny food establishments (aka a door and a counter) are really starting to cramp my style... Horrible puns aside, it's the food that disappointed me here (because who cares about space at a sandwich shop anyway).  It's hard to throw a baguette in the city these days without hitting a banh mi shop, so it's good to be picky. Overall, the sandwiches are good:  the meat is tasty, the veggies fresh.  However, the too-flat bread (either scooped or pressed) was crispy to the point of cutting up the roof of my mouth and the use of chili mayo is sauce overkill (don't we all add sirachi by default?).  Overall, Xe May reminds me a lot of Nam Pang in its interpretation of banh mis (whether that's a good or bad thing is debatable). I do like that they use headcheese and pate in their classic offering; banh mis are suppose to be a little funky.  But in my opinion, there are just better offerings to be had.
