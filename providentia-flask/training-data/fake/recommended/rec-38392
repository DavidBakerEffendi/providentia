Is it just me or is the waitstaff lacking in the hospitality department?... I eat here at least once a month and always get the vibe that they are trying Â to rush customers in and out. But the pizza here is soooooo goooood that I'm willing to overlook the fact that I am getting treated like chop suey. Its also always pretty cold in there so bring a sweater when you go! I've been eating here for years and I'm just now trying the Italian bomb! Its delicious and if you love meat and garlic you must try!!!
