This review is for dinner but I've been to $1 Oyster Happy Hour several times and I like it (my only complaint is that the wine special is a box champagne that isn't that great). We were seated immediately without reservations. The menu overall is really nice. Not the type of place to go if you don't eat seafood. I've had their soups previously and they are all very good. This particular visit I ordered only oysters which were great but not very hard to mess up. However, they were all very fresh. My husband had the scallop dish which he liked. It was served with a caramelized squash which was incredible. It also had kale which my husband doesn't eat. Nice beer list and my martini was decent. Overall, a good place to visit especially if you love seafood.
