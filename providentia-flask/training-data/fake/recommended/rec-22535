I love Brooklyn Commune, I really do. The food is great, coffee is delicious and the baked goods give me daily cravings. I feel that the staff is always very friendly and welcoming. My main beef, is with the owner's ungracious behaviour. Having seen myself and my family at least once a week in the Commune since it opened, she has yet to even crack the slightest smile. No "good morning", no "good afternoon"- nada. The final insult was when my family of four went to the commune with the intent to have breakfast. We figured we would have to share a table as is customary but on this particular morning, the only four spaces available we're being taken up by the owner; in her usual spot, her computer and papers spread about the table and exactly in earshot of our conversation about our seating dilemma. It would've been easy and very gracious of her to pack up her things, perhaps say, "Oh, why don't you guys sit here?" Â and allow us to spend the typical $45-50 which we were intent on spending. Instead, we grabbed two coffees to go. What a waste. I guess Brooklyn Commune is independently wealthy and has no need to cater to customers for their hard earned money. Maybe we'll go to Lark or Steeplechase next time.
