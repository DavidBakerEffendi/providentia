Holy smokes, did I love my meal at Peaches HotHouse! When I signed in to write this review I was SHOCKED that there were any negative reviews. The space is small, but so inviting. The waitstaff were extremely friendly and sweet, which always really impresses me in this city. And the FOOD, goddamn! The fried green tomatoes were like heaven. And my "regular" fried chicken was just perfect. I'm not really even a big fried chicken fan, even though it's a "thing" in NYC right now (red meat, please), but this blew my mind! Crispy, well spiced, tender flavorful meat under the crust,and it really didn't seem greasy to me at all. And the portion is ginormous. My leftovers will make two more meals. My garlic kale was also delish, and a nice side of healthiness to the fried chix. The only thing that was weird was the big hunk of bread under the chicken...unnecessary. Oh, and Mr. Andy Lee got the "extra hot" chicken, and almost passed out. The waiter gently warned him...but of course he wouldn't back down. I can't imagine he enjoyed his meal because he was huffing and puffing and sweating in pain. But, if you like to torture your face, this chicken is for you. I can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu (except the extra hot)!!!
