Good atmosphere and best enjoyed with a tall beautiful lady companion. The bar produces one of my favorite old fashioned around and the other cocktails are strong and not overpriced. The roasted chicken is superb. The Brussels sprouts are the best I've ever had.  The chocolate cake is fantastic.  This place is a classy joint and I'll definitely be back for dinner.
