Meh. Both the service and food were decent, not mind-blowing.  The serving sizes of both the appetizers and entrees are disappointingly small. The sushi and shrimp dumplings are tasty, but nothing special.  The ceviche appetizer was delicious (and served in an adorable cocktail glass) but once again, way too small.  The crab cakes were too... innovative (read: blech) for my liking. The restaurant is definitely not suitable for a date or an intimate gathering.  My friend and I were so close to the people on either side of us that I felt like we were all sitting at one big table.
