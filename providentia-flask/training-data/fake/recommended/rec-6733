Here's the deal...they have the pizza down...very good.  Some of the Italian dishes are very good as well.  The service, is very poor.  (VERY poor).  If you call for take out given time for pickup, add an hour.  Seriously, add an hour.  You will be standing with no less than 19 people waiting for your take out, for about an hour past the time you were told it would be ready (Friday and Saturday nights).  It's not a one time experience.  The most recent one, waited the hour extra with boxes of food on counter in front of me.  Told them my number, then asked my number again, told order wasn't ready.  Asked my number again, I looked over box and told them again...said almost.  Asked my number again...moved box to tell them...said soon.  After an hour of waiting...turned out the  box I was staring over and moving to see, in a row of other boxes, was my order.  There are other poor experiences.  Point is, they have issues managing orders...NOT cooking the food. Sometimes the taste of the food isn't worth the stress and that's often the decision why we decide to go elsewhere, because they can't nail the service.  Given the large customer base who do not mind waiting so looong, they probably don't even see reason to improve.
