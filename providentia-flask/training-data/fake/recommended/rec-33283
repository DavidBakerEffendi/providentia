Martha is the second installment of the restaurant in this spot under the same ownership.  Previous, BK sandwich society just didn't fly. Martha is back with a vengeance and is kicking tail.  Really interesting new american with asian influenced high-end dishes Go for the Chinese inspired style greens dishes like the Tso's brussel sprouts, or Boc choi.  Warning: Fried chicken is pretty spicy and amazing.
