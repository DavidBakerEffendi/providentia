Don't get me wrong. Place is a great hang and great spot to have a beer. And the staff are all great. The food is another story. I had a burger which was terribly mediocre to the point where bits were hard to chew. the fries so many rave about are nothing special. To talk about this place as anything other than a run of the mill burger and fries joint is to do a disservice to ones who deserve it.
