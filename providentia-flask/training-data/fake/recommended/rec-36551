the food is here is solid and the portions are huge. we got the french onion soup, chicken liver mousse, duck confit, crisp pork belly for lunch. it was soooo heavy but everything was nicely done. our waiter disappeared after getting water for us. we waited for a good 15 minutes before having to flag him down to take our order. grrr. we came here for a lunch right after Christmas without reservations and managed to luck into a seat in the cafe thanks to a lovely young man in a black turtleneck sweater. Â amidst chaos, he stayed totally calm and was the epitome of graciousness and class. that kind of customer service is what i will remember about balthazar and it is what will bring me back when i am in nyc again.
