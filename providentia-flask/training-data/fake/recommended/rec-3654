My friend brought me to this great place after we were out and wished to have dinner, for that I am eternally grateful. We started with an overly large portion of mussels. My entre (steak) was cooked to order while my friend's chicken was moist and succulently seasoned. We both enjoyed our meals. Our server James treated us to dessert which was Â very tasty and capped off a great evening. I would definitely recommend this place to others, and the intimacy makes it a great date spot. A bit pricier that other places, but the chef and food makes it well worth it.
