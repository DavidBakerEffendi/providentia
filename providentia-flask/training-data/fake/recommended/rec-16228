Hands down, the best burger in the city. You know what you're getting into going to Corner Bistro.  The insane wait.  The incredible crowds and nowhere to stand.  The struggle to make your way to the bar to get a beer while you wait.  The wait.  And more of the wait. But soon you will sit down in a dim corner of what most likely is pretty dirty and the harried yet kick-ass waiter who has like every single table in the entire place will come up to you and take your order and just like that, your burger will be set before you and you're at peace. The burger itself--thick, juicy, greasy--old school style.  This is not DB and you're not getting a fancy short rib foie gras deal--you're getting a burger that is going to mess up your hands, your face, and most likely your shirt (which will probably be white that night if your luck is like mine).  And the fries are pretty damn good as well. Before you know it you have devoured your burger without a sound.  And all this for under $10 a person including your beer.  I dare you to beat that.
