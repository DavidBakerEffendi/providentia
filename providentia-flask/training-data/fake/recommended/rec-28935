I'm very picky with Thai food. This place just opened barely two weeks and I decided to try it out. I have to say that I had such a pleasant experience. The service was great and the food was good. I ordered the pork chops and red curry - delicious! Then I ordered the fried ice cream for dessert. Even though I haven't tried everything on the menu I would recommend it! It all looks so good! And from what I've tasted, I really like it.
