Went with a group on Saturday evening. Good thing we had reservations; the place was mobbed and people were lined up on benches. We got the special Rainbow Trout, and the Fish and Chips, and also shared in some apps. The apps were all good, but nothing outstanding. The Rainbow Trout was excellent. There was a sweet/spicy sauce that was delicious, and it was a good sized portion. The Fish and Chips were disappointing. The dish was ok for what it was, but nothing special, and waaaaay overpriced for the tiny amount of fish. The chips (fries) seemed like they were just delivered from the freezer section of the local supermarket. Fast food joints do better fries. If the meal was $7.99, I would give it 4 stars. Deserts were ok, but similarly mundane and overpriced. Service was good. Overall, if they knocked $4-5 off dinners, and $2 off each app and desert, I might go back. As is, there are much better places to drop this kind of cash.
