This place is the ultimate girly hipster's dream. It's basically like anthropologie on steroids. You have to enter the store to get into the restaurant. The store is very well decorated, with string lights on the ceiling, and cute unnecessary but completely necessary nic nacs. The restaurant itself is set inside of a greenhouse. It has a very warm, homey feel. All of the servers are very friendly, and of course well dressed. There is no set menu. I think they change certain dishes each month. We tried the soup of the day, per the recommendation of our server, Anthony. It was a crab corn chowder soup, which was absolutely delicious! We also ordered the cheese plate, which seems to be a fan favorite. It definitely lives up to the hype. By the time we got our entree, we were so full! We ordered the fish and chips. It's unlike anything I've ever had before. The fish was obviously fried, but not oily at all. And the fish meat was so tender, that it just melted in your mouth. I forgot to mention the bread! The complimentary bread was delivered in a little flower pot. It was also pretty delicious. However, I wasnt a fan of the bread spread. All in all, it was a great experience. I definitely want to come back.
