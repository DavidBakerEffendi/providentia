This was the best proper, sit-down lunch I've had in a long, long time. I had the artic char, with a fantastic sauce and vegetables. It was cooked to perfection, cut with a fork like butter, and had the smoothest texture. I wolfed it down way before my companions finished their salads and had to apologize. It was just that good! Everything on the menu looked delicious, so I would not hesitate to come back again. The service was pretty good (except that waiter disappeared for a while when we needed to get the check), and the ambiance was relaxing and casual. Highly recommend.
