by far my favorite place in williamsburg. especially since they now have a full bar. lovely wine list with some really nice variety. owners are great, friendly and fun to be around. must try -- broccoli rabe, patatas bravas (obsessed with these), any pasta dish, meatballs, endive salad w. bacon vinaigrette suuurrrreeee love this place
