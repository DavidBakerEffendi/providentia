If you are looking for by far one of the most tantalizing, full bodied, extraordinary, and down right incredible meals of your life; look no further than Marc Forgione! The atmosphere itself is a very rustic and warm place with wonderful pieces around all the walls and a very comfortable feelings vibe. The food is unexplainable. I've eaten in some of the best restaurants all over Europe an am still blown away by this restaurant. I was lucky enough to be there on a night where Marc himself brought our food out to us. He is very kind, down to earth and genuinely wanting to make sure that the food is fantastic. From start to finish, I didn't have one thing that I had that I didn't want to literally lift my plate and lick off all the goodness. From now on for my New York trips, this place is a MUST.
