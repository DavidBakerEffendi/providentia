I don't come here often enough. And it makes me sad... :( Things I love: EVERYTHING. Okay, more specifically... - The food. Whether Ethiopian or their lunch menu, everything is delicious!! We get wraps once a month, and breakfast every other month or so. And we don't get dinner as often as we would like here, but there has been nothing we have not LOVED. - The drinks. Coffees, smoothies, YOOHOOS! (Yes, I realize they don't make YooHoo, but the fact that they have it blows my mind and the inner child in me rejoices upon seeing it.) - The OWNERS/STAFF! Friendliest, nicest, most wonderful people ever. Half the time I think I go there just to hear stories and chat it up with the owner. Then I realize it is best to do so while stuffing my mouth with the delicious food. - The prices. Everything is so reasonably priced. And the quality is above and beyond. - The coziness of the place. They have upstairs settings too, but altogether the place just has an amazing welcoming feeling. I have nothing bad to say. Except about how I don't go often enough. :(
