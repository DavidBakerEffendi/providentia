I always go with the #1 choice which is a plate of rice and pita bread with combination of chicken and lamb. I love to mix the chicken and lamb. However, if I had to choose, I'd definitely choose lamb. The meat is so tender and flavorful. Also it doesn't have that lamb smell that most people hate. Sometimes I still cannot believe that with only $6, I can get a HUMONGOUS portion of juicy chicken/lamb (pick one or you can mix), long yellow rice, warm pita bread, lettuce and their scrumptious signature yoghurt sauce.Mind blowingly good! I could not even describe it! I also love to add the red hot sauce as well. I think hot sauce makes everything taste better. Read the full review at thetwotales.com
