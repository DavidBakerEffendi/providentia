I went with friends one night and the food was good. The salmon appetizer was raw (didn't expect that) and I could only eat Â a few bites. Its one of those foods that you eat a little and then eventually lose the awesome taste after a while. The curry couscous with assorted vegetable was also good. It had a very sweet brown sauce over it which was a good combination. Overall the atmosphere was great and so was the waiter. I would recommend this restaurant.
