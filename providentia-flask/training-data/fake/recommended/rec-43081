This place is great!  Take advantage of the special at the bar: 1/2 doz blue point oysters and a drink for $8.  I ordered the special and tried three each of the most popular oysters on the menu (at the suggestion of the friendly bartender).  I ordered the lobster roll for dinner and my bf had the scallops, both were amazing.  The lobster roll is better (and has less mayo) then the raved about one at Pearl Oyster Bar.  Everything is a good value for the money, service is great.  It gets a little cramped since the space is small, and don't expect a lot of atmosphere...it's very casual.  Also, they only serve beer and wine..no hard alcohol.  This is a great place to come for a casual dinner with friends or a casual date.
