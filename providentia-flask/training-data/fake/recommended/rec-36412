Dined here on Monday night. Both me and my husband had the $116 seven-course tasting menu. Except the first course, some cold plate has salmon roe on top, wasn't good, the rest courses were great. I didn't like my apple tart desert as it came with bitter brandi sauce. Our waitress took it back right away and let me choose  a replacement desert off their menu.  I had the  pear upside down cake. It was absolutely delicious!   The place is more on the casual side. You don't really have to dress up. Highly recommend.
