Worth the hour wait on a rainy, cold Friday morning. The place is small and tables are right next to each other but it did not bother me or my girlfriend who brought me here, I love her for introducing me to this place. NO CREDIT CARDS! Â I'm not sure if maybe we missed a sign on the menu or somewhere which said only cash, thought we should have been told before sitting, but no sweat, there is a ATM right across the street. I had the buttermilk biscuit sandwich with bacon, and I just cant get over how much I enjoyed the combination of every single thing on the plate. our waitress was great and friendly, I wish I remembered her name. YOU MUST EAT HERE!
