Great service, in particular Jenny behind the bar. Took the recommendations from some of the other reviews, the shrimp in garlic and the potatoes in aioli were really tasty. We finished off the with the meatballs which were pretty good as well. All in all, a relaxing and enjoyable experience on a Sunday night.
