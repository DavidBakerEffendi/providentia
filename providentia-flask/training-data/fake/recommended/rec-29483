Salt & Fat, I know its only been a few dates but.. I love you, Will you marry me? With love from the bottom of my heart and stomach, Kat I really believe EVERYTHING ON THE MENU IS AWESOME. But if I had, HAD TO choose one thing, it is the scallops with the carrot puree. I tell my friends go for the "swoop!" The plating is always beautiful and gosh darn delicious.. I could eat that carrot puree alone, its that good. But if I didn't have to choose and had unlimited amount of space in my stomach, I would eat it all. All of it! Even food off of your plate. Also, this place vegetarian friendly! They'll put the meat on the side or in the case of the Korean wraps, substitute meat with mushrooms. The staff and the chefs are so great and friendly, I want to marry them all too. S & F makes me want to move to Queens (and that's a tough thing for a born and raised Brooklynite to admit.)
