One of the best Steaks I've ever had. We orders Mahi tuna, calamari and crab cakes for appetizer.. Everything was delicious.. Ordered a medium cowboy steak for main course.. Highly recommended.. Friends order salmon, chicken.. Theirs were delicious as well.. Our waitress Maria was really courteous.. Made sure everything is there and checked on us a couple of times..manager gave us a round of drinks on the house.. Great guy!! The only sad part is there is no advertisement for this restaurant as it is in crown plaza. Will definitely go back with a bigger crowd!!
