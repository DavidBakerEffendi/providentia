I finally got the famous sandwich everyone talks about, but quite frankly I am disappointed. Truly, Madly, Deeply Disappointed.   The meat was bland. Juicy indeed, but bland. Definitely needs more flavor. Everyone who has fervently declared that the pork  is delicious has not tasted great meat. All I could taste really was stinky cheese and the mustardy nuance of broccoli rabe.  I say, at the very least, the pork needs some more salt. This is the one time I wish I religiously carried around a bottle of sriracha and salt packets. I've had better sandwiches. If the line here is short by all means go for it, otherwise go to Hershel's or get a cheese steak. This is a big WOMP WOMP place for a WOMP WOMP sandwich experience.
