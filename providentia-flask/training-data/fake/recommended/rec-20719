I was originally planning to hit up David Chang's chain of restaurants for their fried chicken dinner - until I found out that a minimum party of 4 was required (boo!).  So I swing by to grab lunch - which is counter/cafeteria style during lunch hours. Grabbed the featured rotisserie duck over rice ($14) and I added the bib lettuce (+$1) and the chive pancakes (+$2). For starters, just look at the pictures of the fucking thing.  It's glorious food porn.  The boneless duck was tender and juicy (just look at the inviting pink) - it's a simple dish but expertly done.  Experimenting with the crispy shallots, ssam spicy sauce and duck scallion made for different flavours. In addition, service was pretty fantastic - which is usually non-existent when you're dining cafeteria style.  But the staff kept coming by and re-upping my drink.  I've honestly had worst service at 5-star restaurants. Why only 3-stars? Because... well, I'm Chinese... and I just paid $17 for a duck bowl.  Probably the best duck bowl I've had and I always give props to people that can turn a simple dish to high art - but it's a bit overhyped and overpriced.  Definitely worth a try - but I can't see myself going for it again.
