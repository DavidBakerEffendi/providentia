Let me be clear: I didn't even bother going to Gino's because as a San Francisco foodie, I know good food instinctively and so it was straight to Pat's when I visited PA on business from the Bay Area earlier this year. I was horrified when, on a whim, I visited Gino's website, and front and center is the Jeresy Shore'd out J.V. pointing to a 'This is America, Order in English,' sign, right next to a 'Carl Paladino.' Endorsement. Now, I try not to over politicize my eating experiences (which, arguably is impossible, now that I think of it), however ; apparently this place not only has bad steaks (just read the other reviews), but poorly informed politics. Doesn't this guy understand that his relatives were (at one time, maybe not for long, no matter), persecuted as the same type of 'protected class,' that he would seek to discriminate against as they are attempting to order with the best English that they can, or in any language, or gesture for that matter. This dude should be happy that he is making money in a bare market that the last president (who doubtless he voted for), created! So go on over to Gino's for a dry ass steak, unless you are intellegent, reasoning, have ancestors that weren't (ever) born in America, or are gay, or don't like 'Tea' or 'Parties,' much anymore!
