The atmosphere of Do or Dine perfectly matches the eclectic vibe of the menu and the food. The decor is wonderful and interesting and the food does not disappoint. The nachos might be one of the most decadent and delicious appetizers I've ever eaten. Wait, scratch that, most delicious dish, ever. An absolute must. I got the vegan pasta dish and it was the right amount of spicy and filling. Presented beautifully and tasted even better. My boyfriend got the chicken & waffles. Great presentation & seriously top notch flavors. We also got the Snickers dessert -- which Â seems like just a Snickers ice cream bar, but topped with powdered sugar and strawberries, it's actually quite a different and special combination. Our server was attentive, our drinks consistently filled, and service fast and fun. Overall, one of my best dining experiences. And yes, I'm still thinking about those nachos.
