I went here with my girlfriend for dinner this past Friday night. It is one of the many Steven Star restaurants in Philadelphia, so the bar was high. The atmosphere was that of a old style French bar and bistro. We walked past the bar area on the way to our table, and it was packed solid with noisy patrons of all flavors. We got to our table and still the overall noise level was very high. Had to use the outside voice as my inside voice. We started off with some wine. They have a pretty robust wine list which is broken down by the characteristics of the wine. For example, there was an entire section of aromatic wines, then there was another section of elegant wines. It is all done very well, and the waitress was fully knowledgeable. Onto the food: For an appetizer I had the French onion soup and my girlfriend had the green bean salad. We shared and both were excellent. I highly recommend their onion soup. For entrees, we had the bouillabaisse and the cod. Again the quality of the food was really good. The quantity was a little questionable, especially in the bouillabaisse. There wasn't a whole lot of the sauce and only a small sampling of the fish included. The cod was very good. It was cooked with lemon and served in some type of sauce with mashed potatoes underneath. The potatoes got lost within the sauce, but other than that it was a fantastic entree. For desert they had a pot de creme. My girlfriend loves this so it was a must have. She reports that while it was good. Modo Mio still does the best in the city. The price of the meal was in the $125 - $150 range including tip. I liked the place. I could definitely see myself coming back. 4 stars to Parc.
