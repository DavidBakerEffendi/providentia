Ok so upon my family's second time here, I had an awful food experience. The service was great - no complaints there but the pizza...ew! The buffalo chicken pizza was gross this time with a soggy bottom and way too much cheese. The margherita pizza looked like pizza huts double cheese it was smothered in mozzarella shredded cheese and not the fresh circles with fresh marinara and basil. This was greasy, fattening and soooo bad. Uh...maybe I'll just keep the memories from my first visit and not return here.
