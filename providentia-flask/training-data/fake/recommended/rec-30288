Solid brunch option, especially if you have the foresight to make a reservation on OpenTable. I picked Cookshop for brunch late the night before, and the earliest reservation I could get was for 2:45pm the next day... but the sample menu looked so good, we figured we'd wait to eat. It was busy, but our table was ready and the service staff did not seem stressed. They were all friendly and attentive, unfazed by the bustle. We both ordered the Oaxaca Maria, which I don't think I'd get again - it was a bit watery yet strong. But the beef brisket hash with perfect poached eggs was delicious, the brioche french toast was heavenly (though heavy), and the ricotta beignets with applesauce were perfect. There was plenty more on the menu I'd be interested in trying, so I'll find an occasion to return (and will book earlier in advance).
