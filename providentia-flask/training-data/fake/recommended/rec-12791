An easy and predictable (and affordable!) brunch place that you can always count on. Â I love it cause it's in the neighborhood, but not sure if I would go out of my way to try it. This past Saturday, I decided to put my party of 5 down at around 11am down. They quoted me for a 1hr wait, and put us down on the BuzzTable app that they would use to text me when our table was ready. Got buzzed within 35 minutes (d'oh! not all my friends were there yet since I told them it would be an hour). We all got there and we were told we would be the next to be seated. Ended finally getting a table at 1pm (far from the 1 hr wait we were initially quoted). Some people need to be table hogs in a small brunch place, when CLEARLY tons of people are waiting for their table. Anyway, onwards to the food. For $15, you can get a brunch dish and a mimosa or peach bellini (or juice or coffee). We ended up ordering the boozy options - it was light in champagne, heavy in juice, but good enough to be happy and celebratory for a nice day. Get the penny egg sandwich, definitely one of my faves!
