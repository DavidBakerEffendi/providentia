I am shocked I have yet to review Cafe Cluny, this is like my home away from home-office in NYC, and the best way to start the day in the city. I've been coming here for years, and have always enjoyed myself. Most of my time here has been for breakfast, lunch and weekend brunch. I know many of the staff now, as well as the manager, and they are good people... very professional, respectful and do a good job. I love the decor and romantic feel of the place. There is also a great bunch of regulars from the hood that I regularly see there. Oh yeah, in the summer they have an ice cream stand outside, not to be missed on a hot day in the Village.
