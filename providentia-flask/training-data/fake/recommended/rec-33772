Stopped in today and split a corned beef special (from Hershel's) and a roast pork sandwich (from DeNic's). Looked forward to every bite of the corned beef special in between the mediocrity of the pork sandwich. This corned beef special competes with the best of the best. (IMO Â The Carnegie Deli in NYC) Also the owner Steve is a very friendly and interesting man to speak to. HIGHLY recommended.
