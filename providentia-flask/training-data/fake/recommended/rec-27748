Tucked in a corner of Wayne which I've never before visited despite having resided in Wayne for 15 years. A friend had a Groupon and asked us to join.  Entrance and bar area seem nice and appears bigger than it actually is (large wall mirror).  Bar seemed to have a decent mixed crowd. Greeted by a friendly hostess and seated immediately.  Waitress was pleasant, helpful and attentive.   Olive bread and dipping oils were tasty.  Martinis from the bar were good; liked the small shakers which offered a top off after sipping. Food was good - salad was good but was missing the nuts advertised on the menu.  Tasty French Onion soup.  Soft shell crabs deep fried and tasty, although the oil may not have been hot enough as they seemed a bit oily.   Other table guests had good dishes too (see photos).  Everything was solid but none were outstanding. Deserts were good - notable were the mini jelly donuts, served warm.  Cappuccino was extra weak.  The waitress re-did them without a shrug but while better, still weak. Decor needs a serious refresh.  Rustic is cool but rustic and off white is odd. Convenient if you live in Wayne but wouldn't travel from afar to visit.  Local Wayne folks should give it a try.
