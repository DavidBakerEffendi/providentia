I LOVE THIS PLACE. We went two days in a row on our trip to NYC this time round. I got a tuna melt, mozzarella sticks and a banana split. SO %@*ing GOOD! SUPER  filling too. The next time, we got the mozzarella sticks again, and I had a breakfast burrito. absolutely rammed full of stuff, a huge meal (to me, anyway). my friend got the fried country seitan sandwich  which was incredible. Extremely well priced- for two people, a big meal came to about $30. Really good service too, v friendly and helpful. Easy to find from Lorimer st station. I can't wait to return.
