I'd actually give it three and a half stars, but that isn't an option. Â I liked the atmosphere quite well (although the hallway smelled a bit weird walking in). Outdoor beer garden area looked lovely, but it was raining. I met a group of 7 for a birthday party and the long tables were conducive to that. Waitress was pretty great, she kept them coming. I even ordered a beer half way through my first one, anticipating her being busy and slow, but didn't need to, she was on top of it. If you are into an extensive selection of "craft beers" this is your place. Sandwich was okay, but I don't get why all the raves from previous reviewers - it was a pretty standard pastrami sandwich. Unfortunately, the waitress brought me a different sandwich than what I ordered, but I won't knock off points because they have two very similar takes on the reuben, the waitress was kicking ass in every other regard with our busy table, and I was unobservant enough not to even notice until three bites in. I am confident that if I had complained i would have gotten a new sandwich, but it wasn't worth the fuss. It's not like I ordered pastrami and received tofu. My only complaint (?) is that the beers are slightly pricey (around eight - ten bucks) but for fancy ass beer in NY that is just what you have to expect. I'd go again if I lived in the area and it were a night where I was feeling particularly flush monetarily.
