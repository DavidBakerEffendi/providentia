This was my second time at this restaurant. The first time was during the week and the food was good. However, it was a little noisy and the table was so wide that we could not carry on a conversation. We tried it again but this time on a Saturday night. We were seated at the same wide table. When I asked for another table, I was told that there was none available for our party of 6. First the food: nothing special. The samosas were flavorless and mushy and my friend's were burnt. They ran out of the halibut special and substituted tuna. Some pieces were cooked well, others were overcooked. The rice that was supposed to be included in the dish was absent. When we asked about it, we received an apology and were given a plate of overcooked watery rice. Next the service: we waited a long time for our drinks to be served and a long time for our main dishes. We were asked by the busboy to give him our dishes. After our appetizer dishes were taken away, we were never given Â silverware for our main course. The busboy came with 4 dishes and called out "who gets the shrimp, who gets the chicken etc. rather than knowing who got what. Then we waited for the other 2 dishes to arrive. My friend had to ask 3 times for an additional drink. The busboy passed dishes across people instead of serving them from behind each person. After our main course was done, the busboy yelled across the table "can you hand me that plate" to my husband and my friend. Although she tried to control the chaos, our server became involved with a party and could not give us the attention we deserved and kept making excuses for the poor service. We waited 20 minutes for our check and 10 minutes for it to be processed. And the worst thing: the noise level. We should have left when we realized we could not have a conversation across the wide table or even with the person next to me. But, you can be sure we will not return.
