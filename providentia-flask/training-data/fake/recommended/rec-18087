Went here on business, searched for local pub. Their menu on here is NOT right they do not have pub food. They have things like fried Brussel sprouts, bone marrow, general thao's chicken, and lamb. Their menu is SO random and apparently "changes every week". Their beers were extensive and probably the best part of the meal. If you're feeling adventurous this is the place to go, otherwise... NOT pub food.
