Very good pasta in a spacious restaurant. CASH ONLY. I came here for a friend's bday dinner and we all shared bruschetta and calamari for appetizers. The bruschetta was ok, considering it's only pieces of bread topped with tomato chunks and spring mix. The calamari was phenomenal. I was expecting it to be fried like all others, but it wasn't. It wasn't covered in any breading except for some herbs. It was very easy to cut and not tough at all. For entree, I got the cheese ravioli. The sauce was good, but there weren't that many raviolis. My friends got the spinach gnocchi (one of the popular dishes), raju, and the special - orecchiette, UFO-shaped - pasta. I suggest you try one of those 3.
