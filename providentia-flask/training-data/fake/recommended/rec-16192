Visiting on business and all about supporting local family owned restaurants when I travel. I wanted to love this place but have to give it mixed reviews. Unlike other reviewers I had great service - Monday night and the place was not full at all. The menu looked awesome with lots of variety and seafood; I ordered their Pear/walnut salad and penne ala vodka. The salad was completely inedible - cold soggy pears, wet lettuce, and I couldn't name the type of dressing they used - no flavor at all. It was so bad I had to send it back :-( . Very happy to say the penne ala vodka was fantastic. Rich, creamy, full of flavor and $12.99. Unfortunately the berry cobbler was another disappointment - it was like a white bread fruit loaf and not like any "cobbler" I've ever seen. Really hope they can get it together and achieve a consistency close to the yummy pasta.
