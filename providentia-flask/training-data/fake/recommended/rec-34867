Mostly ramen is regarded as some cheap alternative that you can buy at a super market for 4-pack-a-dollar . A lot of people don't realize that ramen has another face - gourmet cuisine. And Ippudo is one of those rare existence that offers that. Ramen is art in Japan. There are so many, I prefer to call, "ramen-smith" battling out at 3 major cities - Hakata(northern kyushu island), Tokyo and Sapporo(Hokkaido island) in Iron Chef style. Because of this, there is aestheticism to it. And Ippudo delivers it. They make noodles from scratch as I witnessed in the basement where there was a "noodle factory". When I took a bite out of it, I don't know how to describe it but I could tell that was homemade. It didn't have that, rubber-ish like texture at all. Not that it was premature, but I could feel that it was made out of flour and egg... not chemical. The dish I ordered was "kogashi miso"(smoky miso). Its milky texture with seductive taste of pork fat literally melted my tongue. And scent of smoky miso was very soothing and calming. Toppings were quite generous. Â It had good balance of meat and vegetable such as spinach. And also I was really impressed that a Puerto Rican waitter was liaising with Japanese chef in Japanese. In fact, everyone were liaising in Japanese no matter what nationality they were. They were keeping it real. For "real" real.
