I started working nearby about a year ago and realized quickly that there weren't too many options for lunch until I found out that the restaurant my friend always raved about had a location right up the street!  I probably average about once a week here for lunch and sometimes even grab dinner on my way home at night.  Mexican is my favorite food and this restaurant doesn't disappoint!  I usually get the surf n' turf (steak and shrimp) burrito either in a container (if I'm trying to be good) or in the tortilla and it's always delicious.  I brought one home for my husband and as he was eating it he told me it was the best burrito he ever had and if I brought him one every day, it would change his life!  Considering he hates other chain burrito places, this is quite the compliment!  The mild salsa (I don't do spicy) is also amazing and if they were to bottle it, I'd buy it!  The woman in charge is always very pleasant when she takes my order over the phone and also when I go to pick up.  I love this place and I'll continue going back!  This is the kind of authentic, delicious, local place that needs to be frequented and cherished amongst all the crappy food (in both quality and taste) that's out there.
