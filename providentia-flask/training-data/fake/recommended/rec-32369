My six year old would give this restaurant 5 stars!  Fun spot for the family.   They start off by giving you a hot loaf of bread stuffed with mozzarella and a plate of olives.  They'll refill the bread too so there's almost no reason to order appetizers.  Their pasta is homemade and their sauces are delicious.  Fish dishes are very good although their regular salmon dish is a bit small -- the special salmon entree they had the evening I went recently was almost twice the size.  They have a kid-friendly pizza chef ("Chef Henry") who the kiddies crowd around.  They can choose different shapes for their pizza (eg "Mickey" pizza, Valentine pizza, etc) and he gives them a small ball of dough to play with as they're waiting for the pizzas to cook.  Nice dessert selection.  Service overall is hit-or-miss.   I'd stress to all that this is a family place.  The decor could be nice enough for a romantic dinner but there's way too much noise from the large family gatherings to recommend this as a rendezvous for two.   Bonus: As you're leaving the restaurant they hand you a free loaf of Calandra's Italian Bread.   Carbohydrates overload, for sure!
