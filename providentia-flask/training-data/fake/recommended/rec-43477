I have been trying to come to this Vetri establishment since my arrival back to Philly. We started off with pizza- Polpo- grilled octopus and chili flakes making this pizza hot and delicious. Special was roasted pig served with oven roasted potatoes. If you ever had freshly cut pig you will understand how juicy and savory. Portions were just about right since we were waiting for our main course- ribeye shared for two people. The ribeye was paired with pesto and sauteed mushrooms. A fellow yelper did note they did not get a steak knife and while we got the ribeye cooked rare it was still hard to cut with a regular knife. We were stuffed from our meals so no comment on dessert. Service was excellent and our server was helpful in providing recommendations when requested. Valet parking staff is friendly and they run to retrieve your car. Another star for service.
