This place is horrible and out to rob the customer.  We had a voucher from a online site.  We get to the restaurant and before they seat us they tell us we must be done before 2 hours because they have a party coming in.  I find this to be rude but since I have to use the voucher we stay and order.  At first glance the prices of these dishes are SO OVERPRICED compared to other places I have eaten the very same foods.  We order a couple of simple appetizers and our entrees.  As our food arrives a small group is seated next to us and they are also given the speech of having to be done with their meal within 2 hours because a party is coming in.  The food is good but not really great.  The chicken fingers for the kids was very bland and thin.  Our other dishes were just okay and not anything I would really rave over.  When we are done we request the check.  The meal ended up being about $103.  We then present our voucher to the waitress who takes it back to the register and returns several minutes later with a NEW BILL of $123.  How did I get charged more!!  They tried to explain it was for gratuities but I pointed out to them that their policy on their own menu states gratuities are only added for parties of 6 people or more.  We were only a party of 5.  So it seems if I had showed the voucher before hand I would never have known they were going to overcharge me.  Beware of this place.  They even admitted they tell the customers to leave after a certain amount of time because it is a small place.  I cannot even imagine how many people used the voucher and were overcharged without even knowing it.    So please beware of a place that limits how long you are allowed to stay and eat and will charge you gratuities at the drop of the hat if you are not paying attention.  But mostly because for the prices they charge I was expecting the food to be phenomenal and it was below mediocre to me compared to the numerous other places we have eaten with better prices.
