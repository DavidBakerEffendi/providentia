This place was once a favorite.   Regrettably, product AND service have fallen markedly.   Order a beer?  The glass was handed to me 3/4th full!   No kidding.  This happened CONSISTENTLY through the night. Order an App'y?  Wait 40 minutes and get it served cold.   We laughed incredulously as we watched the food sitting on a tray waiting for the waitstaff to deliver it. EVEN THE GLASSWARE was inconsistent.  One time, a beer was served in a beer glass.  Another time -- same beer -- was served in a ball jar.  No kidding! Our party of 8 were so disgusted, we did finally leave much earlier than planned. ..We received biker-bar service and product in an upper-scale Princeton icon.   Senior management:  It's time to review your staffing at the Yankee Doodle Tap Room.   I suggest a top-down replacement.   Your front-end (bar/waitstaff) team is going to kill your business. -KEA December 20, 2014.
