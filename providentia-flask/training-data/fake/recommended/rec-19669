Delicious warm banh mi. Don't think the bread was the typical baguette but I'd say it was actually better (fewer crumbs, too.) The pork was really tasty although a bit fatty and I did find a piece of gristle in it but hey, it didn't really faze me since it was just so good. I asked for it spicy but didn't come across any spice. Would've liked a bit more cilantro but that's being nitpicky. Definitely one of the best banh mi I've had in NYC so far. Bubble tea wasn't bad either. It did take quite some time, though, which I found surprising. I'd love to try the bun next time!
