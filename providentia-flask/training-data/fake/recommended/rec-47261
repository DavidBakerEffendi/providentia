I actually created this account on yelp just to rate this place. I have never seen such rude staff. Will never come here again. After waiting for over half an hour on a Saturday for a table for two. We heard the hostess tell two people that had just arrived that their table was almost ready. We told the hostess about the situation and she did not apologize or solved it. All she said was "mistakes happen, you are welcome to leave if you want."
