Had nothing bad to say about this place until last night, when a friend and I went there half an hour before they closed, desperately wanting a soy chic'n cheesesteak, only to be told by the dude that they were closed, despite an "open" sign hanging in the window and another one saying that they were to close at 10:00 that night. I get closing maybe 10 minutes early in a place where no over comes in, but half an hour at a place that's on Broad and South? Eff that. Officially changing my usual spot to Blackbird.
