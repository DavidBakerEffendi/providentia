Stopped in after reading the rave reviews and was not disappointed one bit. Actually, this place exceeded all expectations. First off, the "A" rating on the door was a wonderful welcome sign for someone visiting from out of town... from a very foodie part of the world, PORTLAND, OR! We can't get great Indian food like this in Portland. Sad, but true. Amazing service, very warm and welcoming. Ordered tikka masala and it was incredible (not too creamy and overly buttery tasting... perfect in my opinion). Samosas, amazing and served with a trio of tasty sauces/chutney. The garlic naan was super fresh and hot out of the oven. Quite addicting. My only complaint is that I wish we had been hungrier to try more dishes. We'll be back!
