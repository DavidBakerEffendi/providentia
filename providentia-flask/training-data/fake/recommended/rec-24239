Happy thanksgiving everybody. Look I don't mean to take down everybody MACY DAY PARADE (I see you Snoopy!!! Lol) but this place suck more turkey than having a baster HAA!!!! My girlsfarnd order fish tacos and they look like retard robot make them. Cold cheese and lettuce thrown on top and shameful fish. That sad fish want to hide under cold lettuce blanket and take antidepressant. My sandwich ! Oh no. What to say? The waitress she must write down "George, make sandwich ugly and look like rocks and poop in the grass. Give long roll to little Pete to play with for five minute. Then put rocks, poops, and grass on roll and serve." Sandwich taste bad and get this you can't pick it up! It fall apart every time Boris try to yummy down on it. Boris start to cry but girlsfarnd say "Boris! No!"" Also another friend order cheesesteak spring rolls and they look like waitress write down "George. After putting down spring rolls in fryer oil go outside and have cigarette. Smoke slow and call your wife and talk and laugh about Cape May. Then take nap if you want to. And George, when you come inside, if you come inside, please grab handful of dirt, sprinkle on cheesesteak spring rolls and serve. Also, curse them as they leave kitchen. Love, The Waitress. "
