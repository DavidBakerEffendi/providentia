I've had their lox and bagel a couple of times, and it does the trick. I wouldn't travel across the city for it (the way I would for Russ and Daughters - swoon), but if you're in the area, it's good enough to satisfy the craving. I also ordered a roasted veggie sandwich there once that was pretty darn good - again, not worthy of a special trip, but if you're nearby and want a sandwich that doesn't suck, it'll do the trick.
