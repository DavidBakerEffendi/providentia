This was our first time. We went to an event in the neighborhood and among the recommended restaurants this one had the best  reviews on Yelp. We were not disappointed.  We had the vermicelli with shrimp (#33) and lemon grass chicken on broken rice (#28). We opted for the regular and veg spring rolls.  I had the Vietnamese coffee. All were excellent and we will definitely go again. ------------------- We went again with a friend and all agreed this is a terrific place for lunch.
