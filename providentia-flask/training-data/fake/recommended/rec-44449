good stuff! The guy behind the counter was a little rude, maybe we confused him when we added a slice to our order, oh well buddy get over it you sometimes you are going to get your occasional slow/indecisive customer! I would def. go back, 3 slices and a coke were 14.00 which I am ok with right in times square. Place is very small we ate outside on a little ledge they have to accommodate more customers. We had the "grandma" slice, chicken cutlet slice and pep & shrooms slice Â . It definitely satisfied my craving for yummy NYC pizza.
