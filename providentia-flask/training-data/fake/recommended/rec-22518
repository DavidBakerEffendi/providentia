Only giving it 3 stars because I have never been inside the actual location. I ordered take out one night via seamless.com , it took about 45 minutes to arrive which is standard, okay from top to bottom I had the buttermilk fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy. It was pure yummines my chicken was fried perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, the mashed potatoes were smooth like butter and the gravy delicious, how can I forget the sautéed broccoli which was your basic veggie sauté nothing special but good none the less. I also had the Mac and cheese which wasn't the best Mac I've ever had but it was good enough for me to def go back for more. Lastly I had the bread pudding YUMMERS !! It came with a warm white chocolate sauce intended to be drizzled over the top, perfect combo, can't wait to way here again I may have to make this a regular thing.
