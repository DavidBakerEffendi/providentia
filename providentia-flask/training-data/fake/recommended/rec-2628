Great tapas place in the far west in Chelsea. Get there early because the space is small, the wait can be long, and they don't take reservations - while waiting, find a spot along the sliver of a bar by the wall and order yourself some of the tiny crispy fried chickpeas and a glass of wine to hold yourself over. Croquettas were lightly breaded and fried and were very good - the jamon with manchego and was also good but the ham definitely overwhelmed all the other flavors a little bit. The pork sandwich with the cheese sauce and peppers was delicious! although it got rave reviews from the bartender, i thought the peppers were just ok. the salt cod with potatoes was like a creamy mashed potatoes with cod mashed in served in round dish with bread - delicious but filling. Chorizo on bread with chocolate was simple but flavorful and light - a nice treat. the sangria was a little watery. the deviled eggs were smokey, which i didn't like so much but others may. Best of all were the patates bravas - aMAZING roasted potatoes with a tangy creamy sauce that i couldn't stop eating. was warm, delicious, and addictive in flavor! don't come here with more than 3 or 4 people unless you book the back room - the food is definitely good, but best for small parties who don't mind the wait over wine.
