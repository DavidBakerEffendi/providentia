Sure, they are friendly. Service is good. But everything else is average. The drinks are expensive and good, but not a reason to visit. The burgers are good, a little small with a massive bun (bun is the best part however) I had the Cali burger, I honestly don't remember tasting anything but bun. The sides, we ordered almost all of them. The smushed potatoes were the standouts, everything else tasted bland. My friends liked it, but I think they just haven't had a great burger. I'd rather have shake shack.
