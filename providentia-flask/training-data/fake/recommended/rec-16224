This place is great for those late night cravings or a nice snack after a night of partying. It's open till 4 and it stays lively until closing. The burgers are decent, what makes them stand out are the cuts of meat they use. But their prep and seasoning is lacking. First, it's broiled. I always thought that that was a lazy man's way of doing a burger. I like my burgers with a nice salty sear, accomplished by either a pan or grill, accompanied by a scorching fire. I also like my burgers to be nicely salted on the outside. Burgers here had neither of those. But the atmosphere and the fact you'll probably be drunk when you come here more than makes up for it.
