This place has the BEST pizza in New Jersey. It's one of the only places I will actually eat pizza from. The pizza isn't the only star on this menu. The decor in this place... not great, but I completely overlook that because of the fantastic food ( I usually take out anyway). The Chicken Parm from this restaurant is the reason I don't order chicken parm anywhere else anymore. I just end up disappointed and compare others to theirs! My second favorite Dish is the chicken murphy. You could consider this place pricey, but in reality the portions are big enough for two people. Sharing is recommended!
