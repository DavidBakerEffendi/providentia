My friend and I were in town for the weekend and found this place rated as one of the top brunches. We were not disappointed. The food was delicious. I had the chicken and waffles which was cooked to perfection. What really made it a great experience was the service. We were running late and when I called they had no problem accommodating us. Our waiter was really attentive without being annoying. Our drinks came quickly and were refilled without us having to ask. The food also came within 10 minutes of ordering. You could tell they want to make sure to get as many people in for brunch, but we never felt rushed. We will definitely be going back!
