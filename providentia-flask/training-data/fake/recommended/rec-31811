OK......................Let me get this right?????? The place is small. In fact, so small if you are sitting at the bar and someone is sitting at a table no one can walk down the aisle without bumping into someone. That doesn't sound comfortable and it isn't. The whiskey selection is impressive, but the pricing and the pours by the bartenders are not. Please get over yourselves. The food: The burger is the "hang your hat on" dish? Thanks, but there are already plenty of places to get a good burger for less money, with more room. Â I can have a beer and a bourbon at those places as well. Here's a tip for anyone who likes Village Whiskey. Please stay there. You'll be doing me a favor. It leaves even more room at other great spots in the city.
