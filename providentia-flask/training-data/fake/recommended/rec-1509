My gf had bought a new dress about a month before, but hadn't had any reason for wearing it, so I decided to take her here one night. Unfortunately the guy next to us spilled his wine, and it went all over the bottom of her dress :(. The staff was very helpful in cleaning it up as best as could be done. We had great food and service. This place is a little more pricey than the average place, but worth the money for a nice evening out. We also had a couple of guys from Texas on the other side of us, who had a bit to drink and were fun to talk with.
