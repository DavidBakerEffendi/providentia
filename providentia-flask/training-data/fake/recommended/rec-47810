Our favorite of the New Haven pizzas. We live near another Pepe's, and their clam is still amazing, but for the best beer at a Pizza place around, and a great combination of toppings and flavors, this is the one we go to. The white mashed potato and bacon is a must have. Do not order extra garlic for it. However, the sausage, pepperoni, basil and garlic red (with mozz) is another key purchase. As for beers, the IPA (when avail) is good, as is the espresso stout. I'd suggest it for sure. They now have some other locals on tap as well, and the Black IPA was pretty good (albeit not too hoppy). Great music from time to time, too. Wish it was in my backyard.
