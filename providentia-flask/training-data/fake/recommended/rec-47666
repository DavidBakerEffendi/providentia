I didn't quite get it.  Better than average "street meat" but only by a fraction.  Been to plenty of carts near my office there are very near to Halal in terms of quality/taste.  However, because of the hype I had to wait 30 mins this cart, which is absurd.  It appears I got caught mid shift or something, but it would have been considerate for one of the guys to have notified the line how long it would take.  I'm sure most would have stayed, but it was irritating being in limbo for so long.  Honestly...meh.
