There are so many great things about this place.  It is open 24 hours which is amazing so whenever my friends and I are leaving the bars/clubs, we can stop by for a bite of good quality food.  Everything else in the area seems to close between 11pm-12am.  I have yet to try something I did not like.  Their Buffalo Chicken Mac and Cheese is AMAZING.  The  burgers are grilled to perfection and are one of the best burgers in the area.   IMPORTANT:  BE SURE TO CHECK YOUR BILL CAREFULLY.  THE LAST TIME I WENT THEY HAD THE NERVE TO CHARGE GRATUITY (FOR A PARTY OF TWO!) AND NOT EVEN TELL ME!  Needless to say they did not get a penny more and I would have tipped a lot more had they not done this.  Nothing more insulting than a restaurant charging you gratuity on a small bill.  I cant tell you how amny other times i did not pay close attention to the bill and the sneaky wait staff got a double tip.  MAKE SURE TO DOUBLE CHECK YOURR BILL!!!
