I've been hesitant to come back ever since I ordered a slice of pie and found green-mold on the crust 6 months ago... BUT I came back this morning and it was decent. I just played it safe with pancakes and bacon but my friends' breakfast looked good so maybe that pie incident was a fluke. Still, I definitely would stay away from their desserts because it seems as though they don't move very fast out of the display case. If you're looking for a diner breakfast though, this place is okay
