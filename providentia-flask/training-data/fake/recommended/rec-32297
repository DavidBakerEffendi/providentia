No joke, this spot is the jammy. I've only been here for lunch, and I've never been let down. You'll notice from other reviews that it's a small spot, so don't count on getting a seat inside - but they have some nice spots outside. There are a few stoops along Fairmount too that are perfect for eating a sandwich and chips. The sandwiches are so good. Lots of choices, so you can get what you like, and they're always fresh. The folks who work there have a great attitude - personality goes a long way. I sat down outside on one of the tables along Fairmount after we ordered, and someone brought our sandwiches out along with napkins. I was very impressed. Love this place. I'll be there every Friday for lunch haha! Â Hopefully they'll continue to do well and have a chance to expand - it'd be great if they had some more indoor seating for the wintertime. Here are a few of my favorites: - New York (just tried it today): corn beef, sauerkraut, swiss, russian dressing - Savannah: turkey breast, brie, cranberry sauce - Lake Tahoe: tuna fish & cheddar - Santa Fe: grilled portobello, squash, eggplant, caramelized onion & pesto
