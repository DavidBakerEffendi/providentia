The only memorable thing about dining at BPG was the waitress, who was very nice. I ordered the mahi mahi and he ordered the trout, both of which were dry and bland. On the plus side, I'm sure that they were healthy, which could explain some of the appeal of BPG, especially among older people. Personally, though, I think that flavor if king, and I'd go to Mediterra over BPG any day. The prices are basically the same, but the fish at Mediterra is savory and flavorful.
