I come here often so I decided to finally right a review. That quirky little hostess that works on Sunday. Poor thing.  20+ people piled up in the small waiting area/ entry way and she HOLDS IT DOWNNNN. She might forget your name, or how many guests are in your group but baby girl never breaks a sweat. I love her. The food is always great, I'm obsessed with the turkey meatloaf, collard greens,  sweet potato fries, catfish, mac & cheese... just add everything. The service is great, if you ever need anything ask for Reggie, he's the shit.  The bartender was great, I introduced him to St Germain Margaritas and he nailed it.  But of course I forgot his name.  Dark skin, tall, and bald... you can't miss him. Tips: Not great for groups 10+,  Fairly small restaurant, so don't try and have your birthday brunch here,  you will look stupid and inconvenience patrons, just saying.
