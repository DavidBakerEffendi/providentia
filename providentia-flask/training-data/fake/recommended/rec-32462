Very warm, welcoming restaurant in South Willyburg. Great staff, excellent service. The reservations policy for 6 or more only is my only gripe, but it's worth any wait you may have to deal with. The sourdough rye bread with sweet butter is great. Fried Brussels' sprouts were fantastic. Crab Croquettewas good. Meatloaf Sandwich lives up to the hype. Butternut Squash Ravs were weirdly overspiced and overpowered an otherwise well prepared dish. The ice creams were great, doughnuts were a nice ending. They need a better selection of craft beer.
