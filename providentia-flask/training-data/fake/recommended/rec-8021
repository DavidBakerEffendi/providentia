Excellent Beer selection. If I wanted good pizza I should have kept on walking by. ugh The pizza tastes EXACTLY like Ted's down the street, not a good thing. I asked for fresh mushrooms and got slimy yellow canned mushrooms. When my fiance went up front to point out that the mushrooms were definitely not what we wanted and obviously came for a can, there was no apologies for the misleading information the cashier gave when we ordered. A fresh mushroom is one that has never spent time in a can... and if you like em fresh you cannot be fooled. I heard the other food here is good but I may not take the time to find out
