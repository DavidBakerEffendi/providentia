Balthazar is an absolute french art deco must.. especially for brunch. Have had many great meals here, from the steak tartare so delicately prepared with just the right touch of mustard to the steak and frites and the endless oyster selections. Busy NY style, practically having to fight for the bar, fortunately friends of the maitre d gave us access to seats when we we were in town and return every time. Champagne and oysters were our groups favorite past times here.. miyagi oysters accompanied with a great mignionette sauce.
