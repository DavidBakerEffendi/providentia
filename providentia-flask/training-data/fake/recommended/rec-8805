They do a great job here.Just accomadated 18 of us for my mothers birthday and the food and service were excellent! We always enjoy the seasonal pizza ( WHITE PIE SLICED NATIVE TOMATO BASIL) Â here in the summer mainly but for this day we ate inside and enjoyed a variety of different pizza and they were all cooked well and tasted even better. Thanks for always being consistant and serving good pizza
