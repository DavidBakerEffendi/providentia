Decent selection on the beer. The mixed six pack is a nice option, but some of the beer I chose tasted a bit stale. Some that I've had and enjoyed, just didn't taste quite right. Sign by the register was funny, but perhaps should have been a warning?- Maybe a bit old? One beer was clearly marked as expiring in June, when it's august. I steamed clear of that one due to brewers labeling. If so, maybe just lack of turnover in stock, but just a caution that this may be a better place for some Corona than Victory or Dogfish. Haven't tried the food yet but might be back based on other reviews.
