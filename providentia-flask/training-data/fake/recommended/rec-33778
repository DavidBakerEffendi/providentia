Probably the most impressive gastropub I have ever been to. It took us a while to get a table, but the food was very, very good for a very, very reasonable price. The sandwiches/burgers were incredible. My girlfriend got the Mushroom Dip Sandwich, and it was so unusual and wonderful that my tastebuds went nuts. Make sure to get the fries and the risotto! They are a must. I would avoid the brussel-sprouts though. They were overdone to the point of tasting a little charcoaly. Â Their portions are very generous, and you won't break the bank.
