Three words: Delicious, cheap, incredible.  Let me elaborate on each. Delicious -- Amazingly fresh noodles; a rich and flavorsome clear broth; fresh green herbs, and delectable pieces of meat.  Even the tea was tasty. Cheap -- My husband and I each got a bowl of noodle soup.  The bowls were larger than we expected, a very bountiful soup!  Our total check came to $11.50. Incredible -- Being able to watch our noodles made right in front of our eyes warmed us before we even began eating our soup. We definitely plan to return.
