I've always been a fan of DINO BBQ. I always come here for their FAMILY STYLIN' entree. Which cost around $70 for the right amount of food to feed a party of Â 5 - 6. I recommend making reservation 2 - 3 days a head if you are planning to come here during dinner time or weekend. It'll definitely save a lot of waiting time when you can be eating instead of starving! This location compared to the one in 125th street is a little bit off. The flavor aren't as intense as the one that's located on 125th street. And they do not serve the small fingerling potatoes that I always order in the one in Harlem! But overall, great food, great atmosphere, what can go wrong!??
