walking in, this place had a lot of potential, but everything went downhill from there. our group of 4 waited about 40 minutes for food while tables around us were being served much quicker. my dish (shredded brisket) was nothing to remember. it was dry, and i had to ask the waitress for ketchup. and come on! 21 dollars for a sliver of foie gras on a burger?
