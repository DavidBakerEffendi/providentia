I had a cut on the roof of my mouth so I didn't enjoy it as much as I probably should have. Fresh and high quality but I hate it when pizza flops in the middle. Which this did. Flopflop. Also I didn't eat my crusts and I always eat my crusts. Too bad these tastes like they were dipped in carbon dust. Service was a bit... rude? The bus boy literally took my plate from under me, which means he's either really committed to his job or trying to get us out of there in the least amount of time possible. As I was gathering my things he was standing right next to me holding a stack of plates staring as I put on my jacket. I understand people are waiting but how about just a little bit uncomfortable? Yeah. More like a 3.5, but I don't want to destroy the average. Besides no matter what anyone says, you're going to come here anyways so what the hell do I know.
