Ah, hand drawn noodle soup. An Asian classic. What's more to love on a chilly day than a full bowl of soup that literally makes you all warm inside, if only for a short time until you have to brace the cold outside again. Some things to keep in mind: this place is tiny. Not many tables and definitely don't bring a group larger than 4, max 6. That being said, the turnover is rather quick as they're fast to bring it out your orders so I've never had to wait for a seat. They have all sorts of noodle soup bowls for your personal taste. Order what you please and you won't be disappointed. They give rather hefty portions with a decent amount of thick noodles, quite good for getting full. If you're in the area and craving for a hot bowl of noodle soup, check this place out!
