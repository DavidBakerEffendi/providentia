Called on a Friday and tried to get a reservation for around 8pm that night, no luck (duh...not sure why we even bothered to call). BUT, we showed up anyway, party of 3, and were seated within 5 minutes. The hostess was completely honest with us, and told us that a big party was coming in, and we needed to be out by 10. Awesome, no problem...we really appreciated her being up front and honest with us. We sat down and ordered a bottle of wine, I'd never tried Greek wine before and was pleasantly surprised! Our server was pleasant and helpful. And the food. THE FOOD. What can I even say about the food? They bring some sort of dip and pita to the table, and it was delicious, but we barely touched it because everything else was SO GOOD. We got some beef phyllo pastries that were good, and the haloumi (my fave Greek dish), which was out of this world. For my entree, I got the honey braised lamb shank, which was tender and delicious and falling off the bone. It came with a white bean puree (sort of like white bean mashed potatoes) which was INCREDIBLE. I cannot say enough great things about the food here. My only negative comment is that the clay pots hanging from the ceiling scared the CRAP out of me. I was so afraid they would fall. Great little Greek restaurant. Would definitely recommend.
