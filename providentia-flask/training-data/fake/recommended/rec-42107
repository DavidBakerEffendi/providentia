This Place is Amazing, Owned by Family and takes care of everyone like Family. Everything is reasonably priced, and very affordable for the large portions! Visited Saturday night for a friends Birthday. Small Homely atmosphere. Being Puerto Rican, i was immediately speaking spanish upon entring as it felt very much like back home. Ordered a Combo platter of Traditional appetizers. Came right away. Guys were helpful and food was AMAZING. Had a Goat Stew with some Mofongo and a beer. Ladies ordered Sangria. Tried and tasted Great!!! PLEASE ORDER THE SANGRIA!!! you will never regret it. Overall, Great food, Sangria and home Vibe is worth every Penny. Although it didnt cost much to have a good time. GO VISIT THIS PLACE. DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH!!!!!!!
