This is a gem in North NJ, the music is great, the house DJ is awesome, the food at the restaurant is very tasty and well prepared, the staff friendly and very beautiful. The lounge and dance part of the place is outstanding and very much like being in NYC. Great venue for private parties and their weekday parties are always packed and a mix of great people..
