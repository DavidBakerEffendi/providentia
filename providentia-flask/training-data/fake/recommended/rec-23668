I'm legitimately surprised this place is rated so highly. The portions are tiny, unremarkable and overpriced; the service is glib; the atmosphere is one of yuppies and food snobs pretending how suave they are. One of the tremendous pros about eating out in Philly is that there are only a few places that try and emulate the smug, joyless restaurant culture in NY- and if that ethos raises your hackles, its best to avoid Fitler.
