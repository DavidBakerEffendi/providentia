One of the very best, fancy, elegant restaurants in DC, appropriately located in Georgetown to match its upper-class atmosphere.  My wonderful girlfriend took me here for my birthday recently, and I loved every minute of the meal-- from the exemplary service, to the fabulous wine we enjoyed, and then there's the outstanding food-- I had a delicious scallops-lobster appetizer, a main course of duck breast, and topped it all off at the end with an incredibly rich, scrumptious hazelnut chocolate cake!  I would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone looking to celebrate a special occasion or to impress out-of-town visitors.
