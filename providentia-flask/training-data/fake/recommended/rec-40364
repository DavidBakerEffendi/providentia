LOVED this restaurant!  They have a dairy-free menu for people with allergies.  I can never eat brussel sprouts anywhere else, so good here!!  We went on a Saturday night and reservations were needed.  Definitely recommend to call ahead, it's worth the planning.  A little bit hidden, at first we walked past the entrance.  Enjoy!
