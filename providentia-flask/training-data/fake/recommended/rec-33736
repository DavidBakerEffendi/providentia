Everyone makes a big deal about the noodle bowls, but the stirfry is delicious as well. Way more than most people can eat in a single serving.   The pan fried dumplings are worth getting if you want an appetizer.   Word of advice: Don't get the noodle bowl with brisket.  The quality of the meat is terrible.  It was the worst brisket I've ever had the misfortune of eating. Overall: this place didn't live up to its hype.  I would go back, but I won't be going out of my way for it.
