I've been here a couple of times, the menu seemed to change somewhere in between.  I had a really amazing and memorable cauliflower soup the first time, not so good pork the second.  My bf had good meals both times (sausage and goulash).  The beer selection is great, as is the staff...decor is okay and yeah, it's kind of cold in there.  One of my visits was animated by deafeningly loud industrial music- which, despite my love for Front 242, I could have done without.
