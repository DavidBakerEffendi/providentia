Oh, the classic. Love, love love. I do my produce shopping here and my fatty self even plans out my walks home from class so as not to pass by here, or I WILL go in. Some people have complaints: it smells, it's crowded, most people don't take credit cards, blah blah. It's stuck in its ways people, and let it be! It's all part of the ambience, and I love it for all it's loud, shouting, ocassionaly smelly, cash-only self. The culture and food are fantastic. Go here if you haven't been, just to experience it.
