I totally lived at the lunch truck that started the craze during college, and probably gained 5 lbs. because of it.  The popularity (and some construction next to the gym) prompted Penn to have these guys move into Houston Hall (34th and Spruce Sts.) a few years ago.  It's actually nicer because you don't have to wait in the cold all for your crepe. You can get all sorts of savory (with meat and/or veggies and/or cheese) or sweet crepes and they're all super yummy and around $7ish last I checked.  The line can get a little crazy around meal times and I think they close around 7pm if not before.  Saturdays are a great time to go. Even if you're not a Penn student you can get in to this place, though your first time you might want to ask a student for help finding it once you're at 34th and Spruce...I got lost my first time without my trusty Wharton buddy.
