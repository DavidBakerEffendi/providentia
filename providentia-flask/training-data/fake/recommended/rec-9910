I liked this cute little spot! Came here with a friend after work for happy hour, and luckily there were still tables available because some were already reserved, and believe me this place gets CROWDED! The red sangria is great!!! And OMG, my friend and I didn't like the lychee martini that EVERYONE seemed to be drinking. The waiter was in complete disbelief as he took the martinis back, as if we were from outer space or something lol. The apps were so good, even though I found a hair (ewww) in our chicken basil, but the waitress was happy to replace it. One more thing, this place gets really LOUD, to the point you have to shout to someone directly in front of you. Overall, cool spot to come with your girlfriends. (happy hour is until 10pm)!!!!!
