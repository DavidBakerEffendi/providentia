Typical fancy business lunch crowd, but they get the food right. I got a seat overlooking Rittenhouse Square on a beautiful sunny day, which may account for any extra happy points for Rouge. The vegetarian risotto was a great, bright green color and had lots of fresh veggies. The risotto itself was a bit firmer than I usually like it, but the rest of the dish was so good I'd order it again. Truffle oil fries were heavy on the truffle oil, just the way I like it! My fellow diners had the Rouge burger and Tuna burger, and were so pleased they took pictures to post on their Facebooks. :)
