Delicious food, great prices, fun ambiance and huge portions! This place rocks and is a great place for having fun with friends or being flirty on a date...just remember to bring cash (cards not accepted!!) --tofu panang is amazing and can be made spicier if desired...enough to always leave with a doggie bag and makes another meal the next day...only $7 -- yummy appetizers, esp fried tofu that is served with delicious chili peanut sauce... about $4 --great full bar with yummy mango martinis, champagne, wine list and shots are served in champagne glasses- fun! -- all around fun atmosphere- DJ spinning fun music, kitchen open late (till 12:30 am on weekends), usually pretty packed but wait is 15/20 minutes tops! Only complaint is that the service is sllloooowww, so be sure to order up once you nab the wait staff!
