Food was excellent. It's a pricey place and a tad precious for my tastes. Portions are smallish especially the desserts. I understand what they are going for but it's a bit stiff and precious. The chef is truly talented. Everything we had was great. This type of service is not what I look for in a restaurant experience. I hope they loosen up and warm up the decor. The food is the star here. The room needs some warmth as does the staff, they seem tense and on edge.  My summary is unless you have oodles of money, someone is treating or want to have a quiet dinner  - Piora is for you. Go try a dish or 2, and have a glass of wine in the bar area. It's quiet and you can talk, that's a plus.
