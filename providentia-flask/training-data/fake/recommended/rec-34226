Tired of being cheated by the over-priced and over-rated pastiche of places like Pastis? No? Then you're welcome to go to over-priced and over-rated places like Pastis. Salt and Fat, on the other hand, offers you something very real: original, creative and fun. My friend and I had a marvelous meal here last night: yellowtail tartar, an EPIC parpadelle with mushrooms, chinese brocolli and other bits of goodness, and hangar steak. Dessert came in the form of a chewy block of rice crispies with marshmallow ice cream. We washed the meal down with a light Germany beer from a Pennsylvanian brewery. All of the above in single portions, shared by two. Completely splendid and oh-so-much-better than rubbish places like Pastis.
