best. guac. ever. i always get the chicken tacos and they always taste just as amazing as i remember. Â plus, there's a photobooth, which is always a good time. this may be an odd observation, but i really dig the bathrooms and the shared mosaic-ed blue space for the guys and gals to (hopefully) use when they wash their hands. there's also a capogiro gelato conveniently located across the street, just sayin'.
