Great food, ambiance and service.  My beets and goat cheese salad was perfect, firm beets and soft cheese.  Entrees were pan fried skate - excellent - thick juicy steak off the bone and perfectly cooked and big juicy diver scallops again cooked to perfection.  So just a great meal.  Only slight complaint was the wine list was a bit eclectic
