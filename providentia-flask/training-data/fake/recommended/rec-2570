Easily this was one of the best stops on our East Coast baseball Road trip of 2007.  Nothing like it, right after a Phillies game - seeing many comrades from Boston in the line (let's all wear our Red Sox shirts!). I was a little put off by all the anti-immigrant jabber plaguing the establishment... but there's nothing I can do about it.  My beau felt nostalgic like he was in a Boyz II Men video here.  And it was lit up like Jesus at Christmas.  So we'll call it even. The food was great, my only regret was not getting more of it, and waiting until our second Philadelphia vacation to do Cheesesteaks in South Philly. Will go to Geno's again, and also Pat's for comparison next visit to Philly.
