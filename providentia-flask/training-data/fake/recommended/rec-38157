We celebrated my birthday dinner here last night. Our waitress (girl with a skull tattoo on her arm, I can't remember her name!) was amazing. She recommended the tuna tartar taco appetizer, which was the perfect start to our meal. The rolls were warm and melted in our mouths. I had the scallop entree (took half of it home because it was too good to experience just once!) and my boyfriend had the salmon. He raved about how the salmon was the star of the plate, as it should be. We each had a glass of wine (I had the Trapiche malbec and he had a cab that started with a C). For dessert, my boyfriend had a nutella bar-type thing, and I had a coconut mousse, neither of which I can find on the menu but they were to die for. I can't WAIT to go back.
