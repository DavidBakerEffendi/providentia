I had to arrange a dinner in Philly for a large group of friends. Jones did not disappoint! The staff was friendly and very accommodating for our huge group. I selected the items for our fixed menu, and everything was excellent - appetizers, entrees, and desserts! (This is more a testament to how good the food is, and not my selection.) If they can provide such a great experience for such a large party on a busy Saturday night, I'm sure they can knock it out of the park for anyone.
