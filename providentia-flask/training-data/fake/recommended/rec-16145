How could have lived in the UES for 4 years and just found this place? One word: Burrata. BURRATA!!!!! Do yourself a favor and order it as soon as you go in the door. Beautiful buttery goodness. A fresh presentation with yellow tomatoes and fava beans. Pure bliss. Running a close second are the truffle gnocchi. Possibly the best gnocchi I've ever had. Quite rich and best eaten hot, so arrive hungry or order one for the table. What else to say? Large list Â of Italian wines with plenty of choice at the $25-40 range and a knowlegable, non-snooty staff to help you out. A shout out to the staff actually. I've been there 3 times and each time have had a relaxed, helpful experience. Like a little piece of Brooklyn in the UES. Oh, and the kitchen is open until 2am.
