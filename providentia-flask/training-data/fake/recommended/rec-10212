Sorry to write this, but they are down to a "B" Health Department Rating.  I looked them up on the NYC.gov database after standing outside and seeing the cook do the following:  put a big ol slab of raw chicken on a pole onto the grill machine in the front window, jimmy it around for a bit, then he turns with the same gloves that he lifed all that raw chicken with and tosses the greens in the salad compartment.  And THEN he goes to the lamb gyro that is turning, slices off a piece and eats it right off his carving knife.   Sorry, not coming back when that guy (the young black haired cook) is working.
