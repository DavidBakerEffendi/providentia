The food would be good if they got order right! ALways have problems with them and it takes an hour to get the food. Today i ordered the retro burger and paid extra for american cheese and sauteed onions. Neither was on the burger. The tator tots with chilli and cheese would have been good if the paper the put under them didnt stick to them like glue. I called the restaruant and the guy who answered said he would have to call me back because he was too busy. What professionalism! Now i have to wait forever to get a new order. I was called by delivery.com and the lady said the manager said if we dont like there food dont order from them. HOW RUDE! I never said the food wasnt good they just dont get it right the first time. I wont order from them again to much hassle. Â This isnt the first time EVERYTIME something is wrong. Obviously the guys preparing the food dont read the instructions.
