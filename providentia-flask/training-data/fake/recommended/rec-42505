We hosted a luncheon in their private party space and it was a magnificent celebration.  The lounge downstairs was really comfortable for our 25 guests. We had children at the event and the lounge turned into a play room that worked out well while the adults dined next to them. All of our guests raved about the venue, food and wine.  The food was delicious and we didn't feel like anything was mass produced.  The pastry chef made a special occasion cake for our dessert that was also super yummy.   We did end up spending more than we had expected but that was only because our guests had such a great time and drank more wine than we had predicted. All in all - I would definitely recommend for a private party. They were easy to work with to plan the event and the outcome was a sophisticated, modern and simply fantastic experience.
