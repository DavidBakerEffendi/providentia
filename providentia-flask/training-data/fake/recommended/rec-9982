Most thai places in the city are pretty much the same to me, and this one ranks along with the rest of them. They have extremely cheap prices, their plate proportions are on point, and the environment is very chic! I would go there again because i really love thai food and is always great to find cozy little spots in Brooklyn! Plus the drinks are very strong so they are cheap on the alcohol. Only con is at the end of the meal I had to run to a ATM because they don't accept cards :(
