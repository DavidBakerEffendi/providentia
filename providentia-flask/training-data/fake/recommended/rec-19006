I have not been here in a little while but it is so good the memory of the pizza here makes me drool. The fresh mozzarella, the fresh olive oil, oh man... no wonder people wait TWO HOURS for a pie - it's not just for the hype it is WORTH IT.  I wish I lived closer.  My friend lived around the corner - he used to stop by after dinner to get a slice for DESSERT. This place beats all of the other "famous" pizza joints in the city HANDS DOWN.  Grimaldi's, Lombardi's, suck it!
