My girlfriend and I frequent this place a lot, as it is close to Drexel campus, and we love it! The owner, James, is a very personable guy.  The food is delicious, and the prices are reasonable.  You have the option of buying a 6 pack and mixing different drinks just in case you want to try something new, which I think is a great idea. In addition to the food being delicious, I like the customer service.  I ordered a pizza and they accidentally put bacon on it (I don't eat pork).  While we waited for another pizza to be made, the owner provided us with drinks on the house. I recommend this place if you're in the area.
