This is my go-to spot for fresh cut pasta in the Italian market. Just walk up to the counter and order which type you'd like and they cut it from sheets right there by the window. The store is also full of other goodies like fresh cheeses, Italian meats, olive oil, frozen raviolis and the like. The one draw back is that the store is incredibly small for the amount of food they have and the food can tend to be a little expensive. It is on the higher quality end though so that's to be expected. Be prepared to wait in line if you stop in on the weekend or during a busy tourist time.
