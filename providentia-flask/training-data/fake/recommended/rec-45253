Since I live in the neighborhood, I find myself at Green Line quite often.  The coffee is quite delish and that's high marks from this coffee snob.  I typically hate fair trade (sorry y'all), but for some reason, theirs is really effing good.  What I REALLY love is their teas.  I have yet to find a Moroccan mint that even comes close to theirs. I've had a few of the pastries and they are delish.  The everything bagel is well worth the calories as well. The inside is cute with pretty awesome and constantly changing artwork from local artists.  Also, the manager Dave is a super nice guy.
