Better than Monk's in my opinion....the dijon mussels were wonderful and they have a great beer selection (and all of it is fresh - I hate when you know you are ordering something a bit off the beaten path and you can tell it has been sitting around for a year) I thought the frites were okay, hence the 4 star instead of 5 star review, but this place will be on my list for every Philly trip I make!
