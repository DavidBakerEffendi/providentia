An honestly authentic experience. The sweet lady who greeted us - I am assuming it was Lali - was super cute and full of smiles. They whip together your order in under a minute. You could come and sit down and be in an out in 10 minutes if you wanted to. Fresh juices and a Latino vibe, combined with hot, delicious Caribbean food, put this place on my short list for cheap ethnic eats.
