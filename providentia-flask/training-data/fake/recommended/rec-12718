After several mediocre visits last night was the breaking point. The food was just OK, nothing really stood out as memorable. The Carmine's salad was average, the stuffed mushrooms quite greasy, the table also had the rigatoni and broccoli and chicken romana - both equated to being of "bar food" quality. The service deserved 0 stars here, our waitress was very scattered, her interests were flirting with the bartender and talking to other employees. Her service consisted of only coming to the table once to ask for drinks which were wrong when delivered, rush us for our dinner order, then after we had coffee she avoided checking back in at all and we had to literally track her down after no less than 40 minutes of waiting to get our check which also had items not ordered on it. 3 of our group of 4 were returning customers, now 4 of us will never return. There are much better options available within walking distance from here....
