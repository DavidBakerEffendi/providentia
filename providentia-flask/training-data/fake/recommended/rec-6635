Working in Chelsea, I've passed by this place numerous times without stopping in. Finally the other day when I was starving and low on cash I ducked in here to grab lunch. It was a bit confusing as there's no menu or board posted listing what they have, but I was basically able to just point at numbers of what I wanted--#1 Basmati rice with #3, a potato/califlower platter for $4.50. Delicious, spicy and filling.
