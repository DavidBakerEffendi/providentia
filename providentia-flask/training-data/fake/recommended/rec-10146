My uncle first introduced my brother and I to Pio Pio out in Queens, and we have been salivating for juicy chicken ever since. The atmosphere at Pio Pio in Hell's Kitchen is quite cool...very earthy, with wood being the primary material. I really would love to figure out how they put together the intertwining branches "wallpaper" (ok, it is not wallpaper but I do not know how else to describe it). Super cool in my book. I usually order the Peruvian combo or the Matador combo. Both equally as delicious, and usually feeds at least two (depending on how hungry you are). Â The cebiche is also a good starter before the main dish, not too filling and just right. If you are in Hell's Kitchen, check it out. Or head to another Pio Pio at one of their various locations. Also, if you are on 10th Ave already, might as well head over to Pony Bar when you are done. That is if you have the room in your protruding and satisfied belly at this point! :p Oh, and I almost forgot. Order plenty of extra green sauce and do not forget to bring a breath mint or two for after... Amex only
