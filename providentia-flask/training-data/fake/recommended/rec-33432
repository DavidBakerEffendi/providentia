I love their bubble tea usualli order the cocnut which is really awesome, however the other day i ordered the strawberry bubble tea and it was amazing! it actually had strawberry bits in it. i guess they actually used real strawberry's. it was a very pleasent suprise. I am not to fond of their sandwiches. but they always have customers ho are eating them. try them at lease once and judge for yourself. but the tea is a ure bet!!!
