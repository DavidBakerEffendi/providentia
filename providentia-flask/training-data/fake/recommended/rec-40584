This is an amazing restaurant with a great staff and quality food! Cash only, byob, and reservations can only be made for week days. It's a place that's best to come on dates or groups of two if you are coming for the weekend. If you have a larger party do it Monday -Thursday. There is a great place to pick up beer across the street too! I highly recommend eating here. Try the mussels !!
