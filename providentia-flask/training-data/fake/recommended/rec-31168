If you've never been, like before us this past weekend, run, run, run, run, run to Hobby's.  The most amazing deli food we've had in ages.  Blows places like Eppes Essen and Irving's away.  Reminds me of the type of jewish "style" delis that used to be a dime a dozen in the city and on Long Island when I was growing up.   Can't believe we never made it here sooner.  Now that this gem has finally been discovered, we'll definitely be back.   You've got to try the "onion rings".  Those alone are worth the trip.  We had corned beef and pastrami and were blown away by both, so totally delicious.  It was our only meal of the day, be sure to go hungry, you will not leave that way. Next time I'm trying the matzoh ball soup, didn't have it but was oogling it on someone else's table, looked amazing.
