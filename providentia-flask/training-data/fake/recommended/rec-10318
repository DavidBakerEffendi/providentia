Wow... So mean there. I am sorry yelpers I've Been raving about their late night hours & menu for selection for so long... Never would've imagined they could be so mean when they mess up your order & ironicLly they gave me more than I pd for... I called & told them my order was wrong - guy on phone said I had to come in In person to voice complaint - so I did & waited do patiently &tried not to let other patrons hear my problem - owner told me to leave!!! $2 my order would cost him - great job ... Been going there once a wk for at least 4yrs spending min$20 so glad you think not remedying my $2 mistake is good service. So mean
