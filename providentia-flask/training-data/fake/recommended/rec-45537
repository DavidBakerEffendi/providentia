I've eaten at a lot of shabu places in Boston, and so j know what I like and don't like. I really really enjoyed my experience here. I liked that the controls for the hot plate are on the cooker's side, which allows me to control my broth. Also, the self serve station for the condiments is super helpful because I always have to ask for extra bbq sauce and garlic everywhere I go. I probably use three times more than your average person. However, for first timers, this might be a little confusing for them. The 'side' of veggies you get with each plate is HUGE. You could probably just eat the veggies alone if you wanted to. And there's a nice variety to choose from. I had the seafood plate, which came with salmon, cod, shrimp, clams, and fish balls. I was so so stuffed by the end of it all that I could barely move. You definitely get your money's worth at this place. The restaurant itself is set up with really only five or six tables and a large bar for individuals. So I would recommend making a reservation if you could. Waitstaff was very pleasant and attentive. No drink menu available, but it is byob. Overall, great place for hot pot. Highly recommend if you're looking for shabu comfort food.
