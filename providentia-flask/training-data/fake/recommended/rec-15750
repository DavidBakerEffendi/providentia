I've always used Yelp as a gauge of places to eat, go, etc. But I've never felt compelled to actually write a review...until now... Last Saturday, I hosted a bridal shower in the private wine cellar in UVA.  It was SPECTACULAR!  Everything about our experience was lovely - the personal service and event planning went so smoothly because they were so responsive.  As someone who organizes a lot of events, I appreciated this so much. The private room was perfect for our 10-person party.  The setting in the wine cellar is absolutely GORGEOUS - rustic charm with a romantic touch.  There were candles/candelabras that lit up the stairway and the room which made it look so pretty.   The wine-filled cellar  was so beautiful that I didn't feel the need to decorate much because everything is so tastefully done.  The bride was so taken back by the beauty of the room. The staff was great.  Everyone from the general manager to our server was attentive to every need and did a wonderful job at anticipating what needed to be done next and how they can help.  At one point, we had to rush the bride out so she can make her train back to DC that we were all busy packing up things, and the staff was helping too. Now, the food.  We had a delightful pre-fixe meal at $40/pp.  It was worth every penny.  Everyone raved about it and no one went home hungry.  We all loved it so much that we offered our plates to other guests so others could experience what we all had.  The gnocchi was like little pillows - not dense at all (like a lot of gnocchi that i've tasted in even the best italian restaurants).  The short ribs and poached pear salad were so yummy too! Overall, a wonderful experience and would definitely go back with my husband/family.  Also would certainly host another party there in the private cellar!  I also saw the back patio which is beautiful too - another great place for groups!
