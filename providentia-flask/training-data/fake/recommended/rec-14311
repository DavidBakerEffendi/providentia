This is a quiet treasure in a loud neighborhood.  Give it a try in the evening for a special desert and a nice liquor.  I had the apple tart, which was a pureed apple gel on one of the flakiest crusts I've ever tasted.   I was sad I wasn't hungrier.  Each plate that passed let off a wonderful basket of scents that almost made me get out of my chair and follow it!
