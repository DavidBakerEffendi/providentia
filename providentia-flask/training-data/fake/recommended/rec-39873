Seriously..ok.   Seriously over rated.  From a middle eastern person, this is good but so generic.  The line is absoultley bonkers most nights, the tender and succulent chicken, gyro or lamb {or even better the combination} served in a warm fluffy pita or in a platter with rice & pita; portion is big enough to share for $6.  White sauce is too weird and seems mayonaise based which is totally not middle eastern, put it on the side in case you don't like it.  The red sauce.. WAAAATCH OUT its SPICY SPICY SPICY!  Worth trying but for anyone living in the NY area, nothing special
