Favorite pizza joint in NY so far, hands down! Love this place. Who knows if this is the best technically executed pizza I've had, or if the 45 minute standing wait and surrounding hype help to soften any unflattering angles if there were any, but I never fail to swoon as soon as the tangy mozzarella splotched, perfectly crispy bed of juicy tomato sauce and co. Hits my tongue. The sauce and cheese both have a great depth of flavor, and the crust is perfect. Worth the wait, this is the pizza I dream about.
