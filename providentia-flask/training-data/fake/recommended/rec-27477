The wait for this place is long.  Go as early as possible! The first attempt was when I was with five friends.  It's a small place, with several tables and a bar crowded together, which made it extremely cozy.  And this is why going as a group of six is not a great idea.  I believe the host told us the wait was going to be about two hours long.  I think my mouth dropped when I heard this.  We were really hungry so after trying to wait it out a bit, our stomachs became really eager and our party ended up eating across the street.  I decided I would try this again with one or two other people at most. The next time was with one friend and I think we were told it would be an hour long wait.  I gave the host my number and he let me know he would call me when things were about ready.  My friend and I headed around the corner to a bar to wait things out, and I got a couple of phone calls before the hour was up.  Even though I missed them as I didn't expect him to contact me so early, he was super patient when I called back.  My friend and I got seats at the bar. For drinks I ordered a Habanero Margarita - well, two.  The bartender was like "are you sure?" and had to warn me that it was going to be really spicy, but that's what I was really looking forward to - it was one of those days for me -, like a slap in the face new thing to try.  I ended up really liking it.  Actually I think that was the best part of my meal that night.  Stomach - warm and happy. My friend and I shared the tacos and the calamari salad.  I liked the tacos, and our dishes were definitely filling.  Honestly though my favorite part, again, was the Habanero!   I really enjoyed the ambience too.  Dim-lit, busy, loud.  The host, bartender, servers, were all very friendly people. I would go back.  I'd like to try the other dishes on the menu.
