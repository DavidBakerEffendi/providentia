I came here for dinner on a Tuesday night around 8 and though they don't take reservations, that wasn't a problem- there was no wait at all.  However, I think that once the weather in NYC gets nicer, that won't be the case.  They have a nice little outdoor seating area that I'm sure will fill up fast.  The service was good and we got our drinks right away.   The menu had a lot of options ranging from salads and sandwiches to pastas and larger dinner meals.  I opted for their striped bass special.  When the food came, it was the perfect temperature to dig in.  My fish was perfectly cooked, served on a bed of garlic-y greens and a large side of tomato chutney.  The skin was crispy and perfectly salted.  I would order this dish 10 times over.  My friend ordered the warm mozzarella sandwich and his only complaint was that the bread was a little tough.  He definitely had food envy and I was nice enough to share a couple bites of my fish.  Top notch. I will totally be coming to back to try out a few more entrees on their menu.  A few other things that caught my eye that I didn't get a chance to try were their beef stew and their chicken schnitzel.  Overall rating: Quite Nommable.
