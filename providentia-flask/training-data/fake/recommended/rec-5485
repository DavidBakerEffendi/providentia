Shrimp and Grits were wonderful, Casear salad with chicken lacked taste. The boneless chicken breast was tender, most and a nice sized portion, but the dressing was almost non-existent. It wasn't a case of needing more dressing, but more a case of being bland and a little of the watery side. Very good service,but if I went back I would try something other than the Caesar.
