OMGEE....this place was fantastic. I was here on a recent vacation and had stumbled upon this place. My wife and I decided to dine here because when we saw the wait staff cleaning up tables, we noticed that all the plates were as if someone had licked them clean. We only got to eat here 2x but it was the best "gourmet" food we found within walkind distance of our Bed and Breakfast. I seldom dream of the food I consumed here. I will definately be back next time I'm in the area.....And its BYOB......
