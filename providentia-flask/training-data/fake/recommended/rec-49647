best iced coffee ever! I was initially really annoyed when the waitress delivered the drink and told me they didn't have fake sugar and the only milk they had was whole - but totally didn't need either - it was DELICIOUS black! great grilled cheese, also highly recommend the kitchen salad - delic. Â very brooklyn vibe in here.
