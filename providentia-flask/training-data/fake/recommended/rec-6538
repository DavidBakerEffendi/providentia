Can it be..? I've found a place where the selection of wine is so exceptional and varies from week to week? Hell yea! Terroir Tribeca is a quaint place in my old neighborhood and now I wish it was there 10 years ago when my appreciation for Wine grew immensely. Needless to say I will return again and again because it's that good! The small plates that have to offer are exceptional as well.
