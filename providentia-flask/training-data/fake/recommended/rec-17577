One of my favorite places! DECOR/ATMOSPHERE: palm trees, cool paintings, walk way lined with coconuts, waiters dressed in yellow shirts and fedora hats..this place tries to recreate Havana of the olden days. The tables are pretty close together, which may seem annoying, but I think it gives it a homey feel. It can get very loud, especially on Friday and Saturday nights, so be prepared to project your voice. : ) FOOD: Their tapas are delicious and cheap (under $5 each). Goat cheese fritters are a must! They're small, but packed with the amazing goat cheese and hazelnut flavors, topped with a sweet vinagrette..As far as entrees, I like to try something new every time I come here, and I haven't been disappointed with anything yet. In terms of authenticity, I can't say much for that since I'm not Cuban, but my friends say it comes close to home. DRINKS: BYOB... you can drink your wine straight up, or, they will mix it up for you with one of their many flavorful pitchers of punch... : ) In the end, if you're in the area, definitely check this place out... And then walk down the street to see a movie, or, just keep walking (it's a very cute/pretty area)
