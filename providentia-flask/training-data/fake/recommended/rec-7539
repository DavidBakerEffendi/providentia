I have come here a bunch of times for lunch. Good food. HUGE portions, at a good value. Be prepared for bad service. Waitresses here seem like it's their first job ever, and are kinda strange. They usually wait to prepare the bill til after you are finished eating, so no quick exits. I kinda wish they'd just get rid of the waitresses, and just order at the counter. Probably be quicker.
