Last night was the first time that I ate at Salinas. Let me begin by saying that the food is amazing. We tasted many amazing dishes like Gamba Al Ajillo. Large shrimp with with garlic and citrus tones. Cana Al Horno baked Spanish goat cheese in a tomato broth with Sofrito spices. Pulpo A La Plancha which is seared octopus on a bed of a finger lake potato.  Tostas De Boqeron which are the marinated anchovies avocado on a multigrain crispy toast. We also sampled the PA Amb Oli  which was amazing grilled country toast with galic tomatoe olive oil and coarse sea salt spread. Each tapas came to our table with an appetizing appeal so pretty to look at you knew that the taste would be as remarkable. The two Spanish  pasta sampling we got were both beautiful to look at as we'll as eat. We ended up sharing a dinner that could have feed 4 people the Porcella this slow roasted suckling pig was like nothing I have ever tasted. It was melt in your mouth with Flavors that could only be achieved with hours of cooking. So if you have never eaten at Salinas then you are in for culinary adventure that will make you believe that you have travelled to Spain. Five stars is not enough for this NYC Jem!!!
