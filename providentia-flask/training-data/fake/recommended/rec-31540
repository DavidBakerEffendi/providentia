Ok so there are a lot of Pho places in the area along Washington Ave from 6th up to 11th and there are just as many opinions as to who does it best. For my money, I would chose Pho Ha's pho in a heartbeat. Though the meat at Pho 75 (their major rival as far as I can tell) is of better quality, the soup on the whole is not as flavorful.   The place is LOW-KEY. The ambiance is not going to impress. The people there are usually Vietnamese... which is a good sign. The waitstaff is quick and efficient, but will not hold you hand through your first pho experience. If you have never had it before, I would suggest bringing a friend.  There is really never a wait, you walk in, make eye contact with one of the staff and flash the number of people in your party. You are shown to your table, no words exchanged. In seconds someone is there to take your order. I must warn you: pho can be addictive. I find myself craving it's one-of-a-kind goodness. On a cold, rainy night... it just can't be beat. I find myself slurping up pho three times a week during some binges, but w/o guilt because it's good, cheap, and plentiful. NOTE: They do NOT take credit cards, though there is an ATM inside the restaurant.
