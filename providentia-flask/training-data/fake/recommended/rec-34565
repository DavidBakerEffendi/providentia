It looked chic, with a sleek decor with random touches that made it work for itself. The clientele was a mixture of hippies in the corner, suits in the middle, and a pair on a date on the side. The food? A layer of such awesome goodness - feeds 2-4, oysters and clams on the half shell, GIANT shrimp, a spicy calamari salad, mussels, with a trio of dipping sauces: onion mignet, cocktail sauce, and an AMAZING cocktail sauce made with tomatillos. We attacked it with ravenous delight. Bread that's been toasted with layers of cheese that made it just a mess of cheesy deliciousness. We opted to just get sides for our main meal - lobster mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, and brussel sprouts with bacon. And... another order of cheesy bread. Absolute deliciousness. We left completely satiated.
