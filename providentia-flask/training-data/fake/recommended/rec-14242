If you want to get some machismo back into your system or wouldn't mind consuming a bit of rich food, then make this a destination. This restaurant recalls the aura and luster of french dining commons.  This isn't to say that this place looks dreadful.  Being that it is French, there is a lot of decor, design, and pattern to be had.  The cream walls illicit a glow from the lighting while the dark exposed mahogany-like beams, columns, tables, and detailing help to accentuate the richness. Even though we came for a late lunch this place was still packed from hungry shoppers.  The casual atmosphere permits loud discussions, sneaks and jeans, and beer glasses filled to the brim. We ordered a tasting plate of oysters, served with several dips and condiments.  It was delicious.  The portion of the oysters was appropriate to pricing but not humongous.  A good way to get some "mojo" back. I ordered the duck pie while my guest ordered the steak and fries.  My duck pie was very rich.  It's thick outer coating of potato and cheese layering certainly layered my stomach with goodness.  It was satisfying peasant food, but I don't think I'd order the belly buster again.  My guest's steak and fries was good as well.  The fries weren't anything to write home about. Overall it's a good time.  If you're used to French peasant food prepared well, then you know what to expect.
