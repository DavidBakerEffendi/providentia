So I knew I was going to give this place 5 stars the first time I went there yesterday afternoon, but I decided to go back again today to make sure the quality was on a daily basis. The Rincon Criollo Appetizer is a plate of delicious lechon, swiss cheese, ham, and sausage. I enjoyed the Ropa Vieja and the Lechon Asado very much. The Lechon Asado was so tender it fell off the fork. The Ropa Vieja had a strong undernote of the tomato sauce, perfectly done. Yuca with Garlic was a nice addition to the meal, it was the first time Yuca didn't give me heartburn after eating it. Don't skip dessert, the coconut flan is a must have. I'm coming back as often as I can. So glad to have a Cuban place around that doesn't have a long wait.
