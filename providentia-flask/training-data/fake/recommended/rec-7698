I wasn't impressed. I'm not used to non-fried calamari, but even still, their calamari appetizer was kind of boring. For my entree, I ordered the sausage capatelli dish. It was okay. The homemade pasta was pretty good, but the dish was a little uninspired. Little pricy too. They appear to be very conscious about food allergies, especially gluten allergies. That's really great. Because I don't have any food allergies I probably wouldn't return, but I'd recommend this place for anyone who has food allergies.
