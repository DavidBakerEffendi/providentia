Had the al pastor burrito. It was just alright. All the flavors just mixed together. You figure the pork is suppossed to be the stsr of the show but it definatly did not steal the spot light. I can say it was filling due to its size but so is a loaf of bread. They also charged me extra for queso and crema ($.50 ea.) which were no where to be found. Also had the side of chips for a buck. They were good when they were hot but as soon as they cooled off they were hard and greasy tasting.
