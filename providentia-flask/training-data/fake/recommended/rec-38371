Manhattan Pizza saved me from many a hangover in college. Stumbling in right after the bars closed (or a few minutes before to save yourself the line) to order a few slices. Pizza never tasted so good. And I never felt so decent the next day even after a 12 hour drinkfest. Definitely go for the $8 all-you-can-eat pizza and wings night. In the summer, they open the place up. Nice place to grab a quick slice before heading downtown.
