Heads up: this place is cash only, so if you're like me & never have cash, hit the ATM before (there isn't one around for a few blocks). Other than that, the food was tasty and--shockingly--inexpensive. I'm talking about pasta dishes for around $8. The portions are generous as well. The location is pretty close to the Montrose stop on the L. Pleasantly surprised.
