Good selection of fresh produce but prepared foods aren't appealing.They have a rule that someone has to walk out with you if you use a cart.  The employee at the register made me unload my groceries and carry out 3 small bags because she was the only one there and couldn't leave the register!!!!! She told me to write in online to complain so I am. It's a ridiculous rule.  Now I just bring a basket and do my big shopping elsewhere.
