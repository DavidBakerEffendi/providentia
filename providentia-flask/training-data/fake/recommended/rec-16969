I have been a loyal patron for over 10 years. The food is delicious and the server assistants are attentive and kind. However, the last few years have been awful.  The hostesses are disrespectful, inconsiderate, and clueless.  It's as if neither of them were trained properly (there are typically two girls nestled behind the booth).  The manager, who I assume is the man with peppery hair and mustache is the demise of Cuban Pete's.  He stands there barking orders at the server assistants and when he's done barking at them, he proceeds to explain why an hour wait had turned into two hours by saying, "Well, I changed my mind! Okay?"  Who says that? I'm sorry. Is this your home? If things do not go as expected, you kindly explain the situation. That's your job. I felt horrible for the waitstaff because they received the brunt of criticism and did not think it was fair they had to work under such conditions.  I will not be returning to Cuban Pete's. Worst service ever. Shout-out to their employee Risa (sp?). The only employee that seems to take her role seriously and PROFESSIONALLY.
