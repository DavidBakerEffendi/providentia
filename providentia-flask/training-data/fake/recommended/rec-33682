Joys used to be just that - a joy of a restaurant.  Flavorful Thai food at reasonable prices.  But about a year ago something changed in the kitchen - for the worse. The paad thai was once a staple - the glassine noodles were firm, tasty and infused with flavor.  Now they resemble the typical congealed glop of most Thai takeout joints. The fried calamari was once crisp and light.  Now the fried crust is sodden with oil. The ribs were once tender, chewy and fall off the bone delicious.  Now they are tough and the quality of the meat seems to have dropped off. This used to be a staple for delivery or a quick and cheap meal.  What a  shame to see the quality drop so dramatically.
