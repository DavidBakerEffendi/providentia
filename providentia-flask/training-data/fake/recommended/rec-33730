Soco is amazing. I really don't know anyone who doesn't love this place. Trendy and chic ambiance and staff makes me really want to dine here. They are always packed so make a reservation. I've been for brunch and the red velvet waffles and chicken, you just have to go and try for yourself. Their organic chicken, to date, is still the best chicken I've had for brunch, ever. The waffle was too sweet for me but I also buried it under maple syrup. Thinking about the mussels here reminds me I need to go back soon and the macaroni and cheese was great. I didn't particularly like this lemonade they have here but the sangria was delish
