I originally chose this place for brunch but they only have it on the weekends so I was immediately disappointed. However, after ordering my Grilled Chicken Club my disappointment soon dissipated. There's always something about chicken, crispy baguettes, and the right amount of honey mustard that makes me less of a hater and more of a lover. It would also be wrong to dislike a place that looks like your grandma's kitchen. And it would be even worse to dislike a place that allows you to drink yummy yummy alcoholic beverages despite the fact that you are still sitting in a place that looks like your grandma's kitchen. The outside of this restaurant is just as lovely. The only downside is that there's usually a wait.
