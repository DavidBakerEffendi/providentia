I came here about a week after Anthony Bourdain's show aired on TV to check it out. We usually go to Yakitori Taisho, so that's really the only comparison I have.  I definitely have a taste for grilled things on skewers so that was probably one of the first things I wanted to try. The biggest difference I noticed between the two, is the number of items available for yakitori -- Yakitori Taisho has a bigger selection.  The only thing that stood out on the yakitori menu at Hagi's was the enoki mushroom wrapped in bacon.  Also, Taisho's yakitori is served with this mustard that I love, whereas Hagi's is just French's mustard.  Also, I liked the daikon salad with sardines better at Taisho's BUT their portion is ALOT smaller.   I did enjoy a lot of their other items, including the yellowtail sashimi, cooked yellowtail collarbone, fried chicken in yuzu sauce. All were yummy.     The sake we tried was AMAZINGLY good... I think it was under the category of "sweet and tangy" and I wish I could tell you the name of it. Service: was pretty good in the beginning but then got a lot busier so it became a little slower but forgivable... because our waiter was helpful =)   Also, the bathrooms were BEAUTIFULLY clean (especially compared to yakitori taisho's). It was a comfortable ambiance too.  I love that it's downstairs.
