It's 4o'clock on a  Saturday afternoon down in Rosebank &  we are doing the whole "shop local" thing. When I get a little parched, and as luck would have it we're right across the street from a bar, The Bayou, so we stop in. The bar area is small but accommodating and another couple is already having cocktails so we sit down for a quite break from the day and some adult refreshment. Bayou doesn't have tap beer so we order a couple of Blue Moon's in a bottle and we're good. We also order the alligator bites, and this is were it's not so good. They arrive in good time and are presented fairly well, However there's 5 of them the size of a olive and its mostly Bread Crumbs and they lacked any real flavor. In my experience alligator bites are a hunk of gator meat that lightly seasoned and breaded and than deep fried. NOT ground up mystery meat with a whole lot of bread crumbs shaped into little balls. We left without trying anything ales on the menu.
