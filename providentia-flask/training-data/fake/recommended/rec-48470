Improved Service this time around. We were seated immediately, waitress came quickly, orders came out timely, and food was very good. Not sure if the owner has been reading the reviews and has made changes or iif t really is that dependent on the actual server you get. We were pleased this time and enjoyed our meal. Good Work.
