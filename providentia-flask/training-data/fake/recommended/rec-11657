Wow! This place really lived up to all the reviews! Very tasty crepes and super cute place. Came with a friend and split the Sultan (chicken, bacon, cumin, swiss, garlic, mint) and shrimp curry crepes. We also had a coco choco crepe for dessert. The savory crepes were amazing! Buckwheat crepes with heavily spiced fillings.... Seriously, it's been 6 hours and I'm still a little sad that they're gone.   No complaints on either crepe and I think I liked them both pretty much equally, although the bacon on the the Sultan may have put it over the top (just because I love bacon).   The dessert crepe was good, too but pretty standard.  The service was decent, very sweet but not overbearing. We came around 1:30 on a Sunday and our wait was around 30 min. I agree with all the other Yelpers and highly recommend!
