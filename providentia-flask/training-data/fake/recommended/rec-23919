I live in the area, and I am very happy that this restaurant is thriving, is packed at all hours of the day and night, on weekdays and weekends, and is bringing business to Passayunk, but you should only go here if: -You want to lose your voice. From screaming across the table that is. -You've scheduled a visit to your eye doctor. You'll need one after you get eye strain from trying to read the menu while held up to a solitary dim candle. -You have lots of spare cash to spend on overpriced entrees. -You can't tell the difference between a margarita with the correct amount of tequila and one that hardly has any. (I'm not trying to get drunk, I just know what good tastes like). Â  -You desperately want to be cool.
