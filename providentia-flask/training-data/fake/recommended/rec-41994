Best meal since I moved to Philly tonight. Modo Mio in Fishtown/Northern Liberties. Sorry, animal Gods. Fried Calves Brain (spread on homemade bread with lemon scented ricotta and olive oil), Beef Tongue and Braised Veal Cheeks with Cherries went down merrily. Go and enjoy. Ignore the pretentious chef who walks around ...drinking wine in the dining room acting like Mario Batali. He's good but he aint THAT good.
