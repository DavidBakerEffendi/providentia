Came here twice- the second time was last night! While crowded and sometimes too noisy, the food pleases the soul. An eclectic array of choices ranging from Italian to Mediterranean and Middle Eastern.  I recommend the sesame salmon with Asian vegetables over bok choy, hijiki salad, rice and a nice lemon garnish. Conveniently  located in the heart of the bustling East Village- St. Marks and Second Ave, it's easy to miss.  However, in a memorable spot teeming with bars, the lovely waitresses and intimate atmosphere make this place stand out.
