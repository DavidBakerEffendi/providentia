Being a fan of Naruto, i got a craving for some Ramen. Yes, I watch Naruto. And what? Anyway, I've been at Ippudo's front door twice. One I got in, the other I walked away when the hostess said the wait time was over 2 hours. You know you would too! Thats too much time to wait. The time i did go, was during a weekday. I was seated within 15 minutes. I was with a friend and we both were impressd with the food. The ambience is cool and friendly. They clap and cheer when you order more noodles. I'm not sure what they say. But whatever, the point is, the noodles are great and not too pricey. I got the classic noodles with extra pork. IT WAS GOOD! when you go there, remember "Kae-dama" means more noodles. But if you don't finish them, its a sign of dis-respect to the chef. At least that's what I was told.
