Let's start from the beginning. It was quite an adventure to find the restaurant. Had the address, went into the 2 neighboring Japanese restaurants and asked for directions. Then stumbled upon a skinny door with no sign or any indication that there is a restaurant downstairs. Went inside cautiously. Walked down a hallway then turned and turned again. Then went down stairs. Finally found the restaurant. It is quite tricky to find. Almost like they don't want you to find them. The secretness is kind of nice too since it makes it an adventure just to get to the restaurant, which can be fun after the initial scariness/shadiness subsides. The atmosphere is nice. Feels almost like a traditional Japanese outdoor setting with wooden booth type seats and bamboo dividers. The servers were really friendly. Service was great. Food itself though, not that great. Several of the dishes we ordered used a similar sauce that was too sweet for me or saltier than I would've liked. Nothing was bland, but the taste was a bit too much, more than necessary for me. The texture was good. If they eased back on the seasoning, this place would get 5 stars. Overall, great service, nice decor, good but too sweet/salty food.
