Pats, Genos, meh... this is where it's at! The bread is incredible and the steak sandwiches are top notch. I always stop here if I am near the city for a game or concert. They also have a great beer selection to wash down a cold one while you wait for your food. I suggest getting the pepper mix to go with your sandwich, which takes it from an 8 to a 10. They don't sell french fries and they only accept cash, so you've been warned. This is certainly one of the best places around for a cheese steak.
