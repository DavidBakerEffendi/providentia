Ordered a large sicilian and an order of fried zucchini to go. The place was pretty busy and they were swamped with orders but we got our order pretty much in the time they quoted us. We changed our order from delivery to pick up but when we went to pay we were still charged the $1.50 delivery fee. I pointed this out and the man at the register said "No, I took it off." He was absolutely incorrect but we let it slide so we could get out of there. Not the worst service in the world but certainly not very friendly. The pizza was slightly above average. Very crispy and a little less doughy than the average sicilian pie. Would order again if there were no other options, but definitely low on the list of Bloomfield options. DO NOT order the fried zucchini. At least not to go. It was completely soggy and cold with no seasoning whatsoever. It sat in the window for over 30 minutes as we waited but I can't see it being much better even straight out of the frier. Couldn't be saved in the oven and ended up being a total waste of $7 Overall, not a great experience. Vinnie's would probably be a better experience dining in but we most likely won't return.
