blue ribbon was gotten a rep as the place chefs go to eat after they close shop.  all for good reason...the no-theme menu features all sorts of delectable yumminess.   where else can you order bbq ribs, escargot, hummus and matzoh ball soup all in one go?  possibly the best variety and late night eating (open till 4am) in the city.
