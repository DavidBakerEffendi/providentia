While I am not as familiar with ramen that comes from something other than a 20 cent package, I wanted to try this place out. While I'm glad I did, I think that it's not going to become my favorite lunch spot anytime soon. $9 for just the small bowl of ramen seems ridiculous. I didn't even get the egg on top. That being said...it was quite delicious. I got the miso soup, medium bowl. I really enjoyed the tender pork and the noodles were great. The broth was just a little too greasy for me to want it again, but it tasted great at the time. Reminder: cash only, folks!
