I've been going to Snack ever since it opened, over 8 years ago. It's teeny tiny, so odds are that you will have to wait on a bench outside for a table.  The food used to be amazing and has gotten a little unpredictable, but in general I would recommend the Avolegdomo (perfect if you have a cold), lemon chicken soup with orzo. it's tasteful and tangy.  The Spanikopitika (spinach triangles) are delicious in a flaky filo dough. Salads - go with the butter bean salad.  For entree, the shrimp with orzo is really good.
