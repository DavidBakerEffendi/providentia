Awesome place in the W. Village.  Good atmosphere, makes you feel like you're in Italy.  Lots of people from the neighborhood.  Reasonable prices, the guys that work there are super nice.  No reservations for parties under 4.  It gets crowded right around 8 pm on the wknds so if you're a couple come around 7:45 so you don't have to wait.  No bar to sit at, only downside.
