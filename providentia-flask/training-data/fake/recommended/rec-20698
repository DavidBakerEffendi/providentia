Dee-leash-uss! This place is awesomecakes. I've first had Hand-Pulled Noodles at this little restaurant on East Broadway (but unfortunately I've forgotten the name and door number). And it was such an awesome taste. Ever since I had it there, I will never look at dry packaged noodles the same. I was browsing on Yelp in boredom and found this place and decided to give it a try, and I definitely was not disappointed.  The broth was flavorful enough (even though I suspect there is a bit of Msg/artificial flavoring, as my mouth started to dry a bit after), but who cares, I'm paying less than half the price of Good Ramen for a filling bowl of FRESH hand-pulled noodles, some greens, and several pieces of Oxtail. I was lucky enough to sit in a seat with a view of the Kitchen and of the Man beating the dough vigorously. Wonderful stuff. The food is great, but I should warn you, do not come with a big group.  Bring 1 friend, or maybe 2 at most.  There are so few tables... Also, My friend had a complaint about her Oxtail H-P'ed Noodles though--not enough meat. I thought it was adequate, but not an all too generous portion.
