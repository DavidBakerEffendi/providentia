Rudy's is good.  If you want a burger, or a beet salad or some fries (frites), this is a solid choice.  They have a million dipping sauces for your fries, and that's kinda fun.   I do feel as though Rudy's has an identity crisis thing going on, though.  Are they a restaurant or a bar? Are they divey or nice/casual? They are often understaffed with servers.  Do they actually want to serve brunch? These questions occur to me whenever I'm there.  It's a great place to go with a group-- there are some large tables to accommodate this, and there is room to mill around by the bar. Overall, I recommend
