I had dinner again last night at Figs. I have been going there for years and needed to finally give them the credit they deserve! This BYO has the best, most consistently awesome food in Fairmount! The Tuna is pefect...every single time I order it. The portions are large (I usually get a Â lunch or a late night snack) and the prices are very reasonable. Brunch is also amazing! GO!
