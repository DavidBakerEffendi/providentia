I took my parents here for dinner and even though we were running late, the hostess told me to take our time and we were seated right away. It was quite charming and with the door and window open, the breezes took us away to a mini getaway. We shared a bottle of wine, multiple appetizers and all had the Steak Frites. It was tender and cooked perfectly for medium (rarely do I ever find a steak cooked the way I like it). I would love to go back to try their brunch. Overall, it was a very nice experience and I will definitely be back.
