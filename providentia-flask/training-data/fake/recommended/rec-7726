Had the fake vegetarian BBLT (double bacon). The 'bacon' itself was actually tempeh, not greasy or sizzling enough to deserve the bacon title. But the balsamic mayo had nice peppery seasoning, and the sourdough was crunchy and great. Â Thumbs up. On the down side, the dark pulpy mimosas weren't as strong as I like. My friend found her sausage too blackened and her french toast "really tough." The music is old-school: Beatles, Simon & Garfunkel, Jackson 5. I liked the church pews. The decor wasn't that girly, but the clientele was. There was almost a uniform for the girls here: flip-flops and those tops that look like maternity-wear even though they're not. My friend calls it the "barefoot and pregnant" look.
