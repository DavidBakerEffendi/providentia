Ok, I've been to this place a few times. The food is pretty good and reasonably priced. The drinks are interesting and fun. I've had dinner there twice. Each time the food was brought out at different times, which is very annoying. Being not-an-asshole, I don't start eating until my co-diner's dinner is brought out, so my dinner here has always been cold. I could imagine it would be tasty if it were hot. But alas, it is my destiny to eat cold fried rice. This is a much better place to just go grab a drink or two and get some snacks at the bar.
