Wings are great. Waiters and waitresses are friendly and meet your requests. Only reason I didn't give it four stars is because they are Cash Only So here's what we got F-Que Wings-Great flavor not overly spicy. It would be a great idea If the tzatziki dip was a bit thicker. Kinda was watery Buttermilk Fried Chicken w/ red velvet waffle-Nicely done waffle, moist and tasty. The fried chicken needed a by more spices for my tasting but was fried to perfection Smoked BBQ Chicken-this was great nice and smoking and was so juicy. Pretty much off the bone chicken Aunt Cruz's Mac & Cheese- Very cheese very creamy great side to order. Definitely would go back
