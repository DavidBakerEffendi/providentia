I wish I could give this place no stars... MY HUSBAND GOT FOOD POISONING!!! When I called the next day to complain, they offered me a gift card, like I'd want to return after the VIOLENT THROWING UP FOR 24 HOURS that we had to endure.  When I explained that I had no intention in returning and I would be agreeable to a refund of the offending dish (MUSSELS, BTW) I was told that "it isn't our policy to refund in this situation". The fact they HAVE a policy in this situation is enough explanation for me.  I hope the Health Department shuts them down.
