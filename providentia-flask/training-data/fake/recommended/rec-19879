My husband and I went there during lunchtime and seating was not a problem. We were welcomed and seated immediately. He had a bowl of Gumbo, brown roux, (of course I had to taste it) which tasted authentic. It had shrimp, andouille sausage and white rice, delicious! Don't pass this up. He ordered the  red velvet waffle and fried chicken and enjoyed it. I had the shrimp, grits and lobster, which was heavenly! Perfectly smooth and rich, with white cheddar cheese. I will have this again, and again, definitely give it a try.  Their cornbread is a southern must. It is not sweet, is freshly made and hot. Don't forget to order the sweet tea. I will be returning soon, hopefully the quality of the food and service will remain the same.
