Ordinary. Everything here is ordinary. It is just another "family friendly, but you can get really drunk here" type of New Jersey restaurant. The food is the same, the environment is the same, the atmosphere is the same, and the people are the same. I would just drive those extra miles to Princeton if I really wanted to have a great meal instead of going to the most convenient place. There are much better places in the area. So why settle for less when not too far away is more?
