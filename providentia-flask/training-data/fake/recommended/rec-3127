Don't miss it.  Really authentic Puerto Rican food.   The best rotisserie  chicken I've ever eaten. Perfectly seasoned n moist.  Worth double the price. Comes with large portion. Of rice and beans.  Chicarones de pollo was great . Prices can't be beat. Don't pay attention to ambience.  It's small but clean.
