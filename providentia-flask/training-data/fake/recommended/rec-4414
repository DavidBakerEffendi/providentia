So great, has this out of another era, washed up high end southern feel to it. Went here for brunch, indoors was a bit too dark for a nice summer bright brunch, it would have been great at night though. They have some seating out front. Got the shrimp and grits which were fantastic. Can't get any better. The service was nice, the gf got some omelette with duck but was a bit disappointed with it. Not sure what the coffee was but I thought it was pretty good. Overall just a really nice experience, will be back for another meal sometime soon.
