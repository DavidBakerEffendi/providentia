I love the ceviche and they have the best lomo saltado I've ever eaten. The Sangria is good if not a little pricey for the carafe. Many of the entrees are large enough to share. The space is huge and they generally can accommodate large parties if you call ahead. Considering midtown is a Food desert....I'd rank this as one of the best in HK.
