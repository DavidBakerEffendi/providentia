Upscale diner with nice atmosphere and friendly staff. I just had a quick bite one evening while recently visiting New York and all I can really say is that they make a good martini and an excellent burger. This is coming from someone who knows his martinis and burgers. A great place to stop after a day of Chelsea gallery hopping.
