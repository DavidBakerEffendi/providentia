If you're looking for Honest Mexican food, this is not your destination, but if you're looking for a burrito west of 40th St, then this may be your answer.   While I agree with most reviewers that $8 for a burrito is steep, the beef burrito I had was delicious and came with guacamole, so the $8 won't keep me from going back. This stop is certainly a truck-turned-restaurant.  Their drink choices include, rootbeer, birch beer and flavored seltzer waters.  Their menu includes tacos, burritos and chips&guacamole with filling options of beef, chicken, pork or sweet potatoes.  They also offer a breakfast burrito before 11am.  The seating is extremely limited with 2 tables and 5 stools around a busy counter.  And most importantly, this is a CASH ONLY establishment without an ATM, so make sure to stop by the CVS at 43rd & Locust to get cash back before showing up. In short, do not show up and get an attitude because there aren't menus, music & options.  It is what it is and it's not a bad spot for neighborhood taco-philes.
