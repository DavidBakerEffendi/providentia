After hearing such good reviews and a general love for empanadas,I had to try this places out.I ordered a shredded chicken and beef..which as ok.The plaintain and mozzerella were so very yummy... I am craving it now.I will be back for the helados and the spinach.Parking was good..and the place was cute clean and very small.
