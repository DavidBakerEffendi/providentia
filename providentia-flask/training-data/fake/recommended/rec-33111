My husband and I found this place a LONG time ago.  We used to live nearby.  What a find!  We have recommended this place to friends and family, and anyone who listened has thanked us.   It's a bit off the beaten track, on 36th avenue, but worth going out of the way.  The food is amazing!  We love the atmosphere. The service is great. It's clean. I even love the music they play softly in the background!   We have some hard to please people in the family, (my mother)  and she even suggests going there when we all get together!
