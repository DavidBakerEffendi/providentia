I sat at the sushi bar and order a small order of sushi with a seafood miso soup. My sushi arrived first and was just mediocre. The maguro was a bit of a disappointment and not worth the price. The soup was forgotten by my waitress until she was reminded by the sushi chef. However, the soup was much better than I expected. The miso broth was nice and strong and the soup was loaded with clams, scallops, shrimp, and crab. It was all very substantial and very filling. Give it a try! While not impressed with my sushi order (maybe I caught them on an off-night), the meal was enjoyable due to the friendliness of the sushi chefs and the quality of the soup. If I had more time in this area I would definitely give them a second look. If you haven't been, stop by and add your thoughts too.
