Came here with a friend to see what all the hype was about. We got there and waited in line (10-15 minute wait on a weekday 6/6:30pm). The line got infinitely longer by the time we were seated. Guess we came at the right time. There was a huge crowd at the bar waiting for a table. There is a menuboard by the bar (the only menu in the whole place, so know what you want before sitting). I ordered the bacon cheeseburger (aka bistro burger) and we split a side of fries. The burger was pretty darn good! I'm not sure if it's actually worth traveling down here and waiting in a long line, though. It's definitely a burger you have to try. The portions were okay, but the price was a little bit more than I was expecting for the amount of food you get. But it's still one of the cheaper burgers in NYC. The on-tap beers are super cheap (most for $3). Definitely wish I got one. If you've never been here, I definitely recommend you come.
