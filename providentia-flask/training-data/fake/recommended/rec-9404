2.5 stars First of all, this restaurant is quite large. You'd never know by walking in the front door but there is a large dining room downstairs. The restaurant is supposed to be known for its chicken and ceviche. I didn't get a chance to try the chicken, but the mixto ceviche was decent. The lomo salto was just average. The quality of meat was good, but the dish itself wasn't anything special and expensive for what it was. The worst thing about this restaurant is the service. At 3 pm with a half empty restaurant , we expected faster and better service. The good took forever and our waiter was always no where to be found. This place has potential but I won't be back.
