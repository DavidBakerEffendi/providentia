Two main reasons for coming here: 1) No long wait. You have to walk a few blocks out of the way (depending on where you are) but god, does it suck when you're craving a cheesesteak and see a line around the block. Come here. 2) really good product. The meat is juicy and the fries are delicious. I think I only knocked one star because of the location, but really, the location is probably an asset since it's off the beaten path enough to keep lines down.
