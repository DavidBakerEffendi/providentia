Just so-so. Food tends to be very fried and not all that tasty. Not to judge, but all the cooks are Mexican so not exactly "authentic" although I know most restaurants have similar composition. Food was just OK and service was about the same. Mostly just staff milling about waiting to clear plates with no personality. I had Tofu Satay which had tasty peanut sauce. Mango Tofu was very forgettable. I asked for it to be "spicy" but not Thai hot, what I got was almost a ketchup paste with little to no flavor. No frills place with food that is not worth the patronage.
