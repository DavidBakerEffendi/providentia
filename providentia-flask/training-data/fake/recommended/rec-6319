My coworkers and I have come to Room Service a few different times and each and every time I order the pork chop.  The first time I ordered it I was asked how I wanted it cooked (in terms of temperature) which I thought was odd.  I had always figured you cook pork until its done and didn't realize people eat it less than that.  The lunch portion included an appetizer (chicken dumplings), rice and plenty of veggies.  The only lackluster part of the meal for me were the chicken dumplings but I guess what do you expect, they're a pretty simple dish.  The actual lunch portion is large and it's difficult for me to even finish it completely.  The pork chop is slathered in sauce and is pretty delicious.  The fact that the meal costs less than $15 also really helps me feel good about the whole experience.  One good tip I can offer is to try to get there before the lunch rush.  The last time I was there, which was a weekday, it was jammed by quarter to one in the afternoon.  We had a difficult time tracking down our waitress after the place filled up.  Other than that the food was top notch and I would definitely go back.
