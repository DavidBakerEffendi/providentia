Being big BBQ fans and reading the pretty unanimous love for Mighty Quinns, this was maybe the only place we knew we were for sure going to try heading to our first Smorgasburg adventure.  However, after getting to the Williamsburg event early and seeing a diverse group of food vendors with such unique food items I thought I may be making a mistake using up precious belly-space on traditional BBQ.  When we got to the Mighty Quinns tent and only saw 3 people in line at ten minutes to eleven, armed with the knowledge that the lines get longer than maybe every other vendor there and selling out early happens frequently, we decided to go for it and I'm glad we did. The brisket was the best I've ever had by a landslide.  What was unique about it to me was how light it was, not overly fatty and heavy yet still extremely juicy and flavorful.  The Pigtrip BBQ blog has been to their brick-and-mortar location and noted in their writeup that they use the 'cadillac of smokers.'  Given that MQ's website gives credit to sourcing the best ingredients, I have to wonder if they go with wagyu brisket and all it's ridiculous intramuscular fat.   I decided to add some of their house made pickles on top for some crunch and acid to cut through the fat and enjoyed it on the waterfront overlooking the NYC skyline and for those three glorious minutes, life did not suck. Besides the memory of the food itself, something that will live with me forever was watching the brisket being unwrapped first from the tin foil, then the saran wrap, where it went to the cutting board where it absolutely quivered as it was being cut.  The first person in line went with the brisket sandwich and the woman doing the butchering took the saran wrap that just held the brisket and wrung the juices onto the brisket buns.  For my money, that was as good as food porn gets.
