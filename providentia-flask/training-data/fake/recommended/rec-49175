I may have a new favorite restaurant in NYC.  A long time NYC-er now, I had never been to the restaurant group of Jeffrey's Grocery / Joseph Leonard / Fedora until a few weeks ago.  After my fantastic experience at Jeffrey's, I had to try Joseph Leonard. Very cute West Village place.  Showed up at 8pm on a Thursday.  The host at the front is great - friendly and jokey.  We were seated promptly (~15 minute wait).  And, seated at the best two bar stools in the house.  There are two seats located at a small bar in the back of the restaurant, which overlook the kitchen.   Jim, the chef, is extremely friendly and chatty.  Helped with food recommendations and even passed along a few free samples here and there (healthy sized samples, I'll add). Would recommend every single thing I ate - rock shrimp and mushroom salad appetizers, scallops, pork hock (incredible), brussels sprouts, salted caramel pudding (still dreaming about it) and the carrot cake. Top scores from me for service (naturally friendly and helpful staff), food and atmosphere.
