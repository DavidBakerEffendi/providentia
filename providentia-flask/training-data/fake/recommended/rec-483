I was in Chinatown and got hungry all of a sudden.  Since my sister is vegetarian, I knew we wouldn't have much options, so my Yelp app led me to Pellegrino's. It just so happened that there was a festival celebrating Little Italy's patron saint, so all of Mulberry Street was crowded with food booths and people.  When we entered the restaurant, we were greeted warmly and placed at a table outside.  I ordered the salmon with a tomato cream sauce and it was excellent!  I also ordered a caprese, which was decent.  I wish they added more cheese because there was one tomato left over.  And, just as a warning, the olives served with it are not pitted.  It surprised my aunt who hopefully doesn't have an injury from it. The best part of the meal was the cannoli!  The waiter asked the chef to over stuff it with filling because my sister and I were sharing it.  Needless to say, we couldn't finish it because it was stuffed!  We actually couldn't finish our entrees either because they were generous portions. Great food, great service.. I can't ask for anything more.
