I've been to Chili Willie's quite a few times now.  It's my go-to restaurant if we're trying to figure out where to eat.  The food is excellent: nicely spiced, huge portions (leftovers!).  Service is great too.  It's a hole-in-the-wall place on the cute Main St in Boonton.  Highly recommended, but be aware that the place is small and if it's prime dinner time, you may have to wait for a table.
