I had the worst service I've ever experienced at this restaurant.  The food is delicious, but I doubt I will ever return, unless it is to get take out. It's a small place, and we were there on a Saturday evening.  We arrived when the restaurant was quieter, but as the place filled up, the service just got worse and worse.  We were a group of three, sat at a much larger table, and after we had ordered and served our drinks, we were told a larger party was coming in, and asked if they could move us to another table.  We're accommodating people, so we did so - and NO one proceeded to sit at the table that we were sat at for at least another hour! Water glasses were reluctantly offered and never refilled.  The food took an extremely long time to come, but, once we did receive it, it was really good.  I had the mole cheese enchiladas, and the mole sauce was delicious, and the food hot and well prepared. But the service was just awful, especially considering how small the restaurant is physically.  Though I lived within walking distance of this restaurant for two years, I never went back.
