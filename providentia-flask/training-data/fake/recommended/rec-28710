A chalkboard menu, christmas lights glowing softly, Fleet Foxes, Iron & Wine, and Band of Horses floating through the airwaves. Romantic, yet unpretentious. That being said, if the love of your life isn't around, going with your aunt and uncle and some guy you just met is also a pretty good time. The salt cod brandade and creamy quail egg toast were both incredible. Oh, and they paired perfectly with whatever red wine the waitress said they paired perfectly with. The shrimp and chorizo dish and the butter lettuce salad with buttermilk dressing didn't stand out by comparison to the first two, but ultimately, I'd have eaten any of it with pleasure. Hands down, my favorite wine bar. All varieties of company welcome.
