Fish is good, but it's overpriced. The environment was ok, nothing special. I'm not sure that the $18 dollar specialty rolls are worth it; it's literally no bigger in size or taste to justify a 3x hike. And the waiters keep pushing you to order them over the traditional rolls and pay in cash! Bad manners, however nice it tried to come across, it was wrapped all in greed and annoyance. So many better places for a fraction of price. Stay away.
