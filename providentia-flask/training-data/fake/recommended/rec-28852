Five stars does not come easily. I took the train into the city to try "El Vez" because I had heard very  good things about the place. We went on a Monday, 6:30pm and had a 45 minute wait! While other restaurants down the street were barely half full, or empty. I knew we were in for a treat. We got a text message saying a table canceled so we obliged and sat down, right behind the bar giving us a great view of the restaurant. Our server (I forget her name) was very nice, attentive and had good menu knowledge. I started with the 'El Ontono' which was a cranberry infused Jim Beam drink, tasty and strong. I moved onto the frozen blood orange margarita, again very good and strong. These drinks were 9 bucks a piece and I have shamefully paid more for weaker drinks - great start to the night. While the gauc is expensive, it is fresh and enough for 3 people to enjoy. The chips were fresh, still warm and salted nicely. The chips were also served with a slightly spicy salsa that was awesome. ***UPDATE*** 2/22/14 Group of friends and myself sat at the bar, all bar staff were on top of their game, serving one drink after the other. We all had a great time and enjoyed the guac! Also had the tuna tostadas which were really tasty. The tuna was perfect and melted in your mouth, and the tostada was nice and crunchy.  Everytime at El Vez is a great time.
