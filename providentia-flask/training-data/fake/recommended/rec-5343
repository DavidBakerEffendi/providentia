I just had the worst experience there. Food was undercooked and overcooked.  The server was extremely unfriendly and made it seem like we were wasting his time. When we voiced our displeasure,  the server offered fresh poached but he wanted to reuse the hard English muffins. That was after I had to go to the bar to get the stuff we needed. By then our food was getting cold, I declined and asked for the check. My husband's eggs were extremely runny and after my experience, didn't bother to complain. Even though you could tell by our plates that we didn't like it, we still got charged full prize. I understand about my husband's since he did not complain but I got to leave still hungry.  We've been here many times and food was always wonderful but this time it was horrible. The bartender should not be serving tables if he can't be at least slightly friendly.
