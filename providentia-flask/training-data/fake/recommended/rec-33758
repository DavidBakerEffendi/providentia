I've been going to Philadelphia's chinatown since I was a child, and have tried countless of restaurants in this area with my family. Though new ones continually open up, this one is possibly the best place to get cheap, authentic, and delicious Cantonese style food. This has become my comfort food. My family and I go here every time we come to chinatown, no matter what. Yesterday, my family drove from NJ just to go to this restaurant (and run some errands). When we walked in around 4:00 pm, it was actually quite busy. What was more shocking was the renovations done and the new waiting staff...they had sold the business to someone else? I was nervous about if the food would change. We ordered what we always get (not sure the english is perfect since we order in chinese): 1 sliced beef noodle soup 1 beef stew noodle soup 1 anchovy fried rice 1 deep fried tofu with shrimp dish that isn't on the menu, but my family magically found this dish by talking to management or something The food is always amazing and I've never had a problem with it. Yesterday though, the fried tofu dish was different from how it was originally made. Instead of the dipping sauce on the side, it was smothered with some oyster, black bean sauce. Definitely weird just seeing the subtle changes that occurred after reopening of Ting Wang. It's also weird since the waiters used to know our orders and recognized our faces. Hell, my mother even told the waiters where my sister and I currently study. They were like some odd family, we would see once in a while. Nevertheless, Ting Wang even after it's reopening (much nicer bathrooms and more sanitary eating area), is the place to go in Chinatown if you don't want to spend a lot of money and eat great food. Be sure to pick up some duck on the way out.
