This is not your average Indian place. And I mean that as a compliment. Went here with a group of 10 people for a surprise party for my girlfriend. The staff were super helpful with setting it all up- from getting us set up for happy hour with delicious drinks and rather offbeat fusion Indian food, to giving us a massive table and letting us enjoy ourselves! The ambience is fantastic- it's an offbeat, Indian and Western fusion place and the decor shows it. The people were great and very friendly, so much so that we had a nice long chat with our bartender and our waiter! The food was delicious as well! We ended up getting the chef's tasting menu with a wine tasting. While pricey, it was well worth the money. The scallops were fantastic, perhaps some of the best I've had. Their lamb was amazing and while the quail was good I'd probably go for the lamb next time I was there. All in all- a definite yes!
