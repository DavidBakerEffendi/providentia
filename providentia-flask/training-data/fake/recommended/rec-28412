after hearing only TERRIFIC things about this place, i finally got around to trying it out tonight, an average Tuesday night.  Decor is cool, service is friendly and with a smile, and the food was outrageously good.  I've never had an arepa before and I was very pleasantly surprised... I  mean, what's not to like?? crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside and stuffed with an array of delicious fillings.   a side salad an an arepa is plenty of food, and you won't go home unsatisfied... i promise.   mmmmmmmm  *drool*
