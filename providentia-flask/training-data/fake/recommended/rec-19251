-one of my all time fav bayonne spots. I now live across the country but when I visit home this is my go to spot with friends or family + you always run into someone you know.    My review is for the bar area, I never eat in the dining room.... when it's nice the tiki area is my 1st choice seating.... but when it's not I'll take a seat at the bar.  I could only think of 3 or 4 bayonne bars that offer outdoor seating; this scene and food is the best.   Reasons it's a favorite - their chopped salad might be the best I've ever had (and this is a bar)! Loaded with meats/cheeses chopped small so you get a taste of everything in each bite. It's huge so it's a great starter to share - best bar pie in town 1 disappointment.... I always crave and needed to order their coconut shrimp in raspberry sauce and it's not on the menu anymore :(  I hope they bring it back! WED 1/2 price menu
