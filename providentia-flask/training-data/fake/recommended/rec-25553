This place was awesome great atmosphere they have a huge front room with a bar in it tables set up and there is a long hallway going to the back which leads to another room with a few tvs and speakers coat hangers on the walls a bunch of tables The whole place also was so very clean and awesome the owner was so nice we sat and talked to her when we got there she was so nice and awesome the whole place was super clean even the bathrooms Drink specials were affordable and great they had a live band garden state radio and they were amazing it felt like we were all at a concert this place is great for large groups we had about 20 people in our party there was only street parking The only thing I didn't like about the place was the girl who served us she seemed a little stupid and she was a bit nasty she gave me a problem at first about not having a card to pay my bill with because she wanted to open a tab and didn't want me to pay cash but I told her I didn't have a card and I was paying cash or I wouldn't get anything she constantly gave me checks after everything I ordered which was annoying and I didn't have the exact amount of the bill I was giving big bills and she wouldn't give me my change she took it all so I didn't leave her a tip because she kept all of my change from all 3 of my bills so I assumed she was just keeping my change as her tip which honestly is wrong and pissed me off I won't get food here again because of it and I will only order beer at the bar I will never get a table here again because of that Also the bouncers at the end of the night were rather rude yelling at us non stop and pushing us out the door telling us we had to leave if we're not part of the band over and over and made us all stand out in the cold to wait for our cabs Other than the server keeping my change and the rude bouncer I loved it here not sure if I would come back because of that but the band was great
