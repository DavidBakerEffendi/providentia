During Sunday breakfast with a friend, he stopped mid-sentence and said very seriously, "You know, I have to tell you something" and leaned in closer... "These really are the world's best pancakes!" So yes, the Broadway Diner of Bayonne gets the full 5 stars.  Add to the legit Jersey diner-ness in all its glory, the 20 page menu and the waitress who knows it by heart, the hostess who greets you with "Hi hon, how many today?"... and you have perfection. So my only question is, why can no one in LA capture the true Jersey diner?  Greek salad, pancakes, giant cookies and everything in between... This is my hometown and I've been coming here forever but I've never loved it more.  I just returned from a 3 month trip back home and I ate breakfast, lunch and dinner at the diner.  Now I'm back in LA, dreaming of the world's best pancakes.  Because they really are.
