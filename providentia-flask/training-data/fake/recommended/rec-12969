You're paying $$$ to sit at the bar and look at the vegetables and fish sitting in front of you. The food was okay, overpriced... $10 for four tiny pieces of purple sweet potato was ridiculous. We ordered the kamameshi (sea urchin) which was the best dish in my belly that night. It was fresh and there was a generous amount of sea urchin. Portobello mushroom was really good, but $6 for one mushroom was kind of absurd. I guess you're paying money for the quality/freshness of the food. Our server was really kind but probably won't be back.
