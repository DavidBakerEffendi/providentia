Wow. Hamden just became the #1 place for a foodie to live. As a big fan of slow smoked meat and chicken, I'd been hoping that a wonderful no frills bbq place would open in our town. I'm also a fan of Smokeys on Whitney where you can get wonderful ribs. But this place provides a wonderful complement. I was looking to stock up rather than just buy a meal, so I took the plunge and bought a pound each of the pulled chicken, brisket and pork (the minimum bulk order they will allow). The kind gentleman at the counter provided instructions for reheating and ample amounts of the 3 sauces. Buying in bulk meant that for $58 I would have 9 ample  portions (1/3 lb each) at about 6 bucks per portion. Considering the time and care that go into the preparation (the rub, slow smoking and braising) I think this is a fair deal. I came home and heated up the brisket and had it with the Alabama sauce. What wonderful flavor. I couldn't imagine it being more delicious. My only complaint is that their hours (11 - 2:30) don't accommodate the commuting working public (!) but that's about to change - within the next week they'll be open weekend evenings.  I look forward to trying their other fare and bringing other bbq lovers. I'm a huge fan of Mikro and Caseus and Smoke House lived up to their well-deserved reputation.
