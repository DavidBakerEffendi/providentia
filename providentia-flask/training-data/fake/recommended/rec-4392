A girlfriend and i stopped in before we headed out for the night.. Brought a bottle of wine (BYOB till 2am) We had the Marrakesh and the Chihuahua combos, and both were delish!! They consisted of a semi-spicy lamb sausage and great toppings. Staff was really friendly and helpful.. overall, great time!
