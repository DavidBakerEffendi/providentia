After wandering the streets of Philly on Xmas day looking for a respectable joint we come across this gem in the city. From the time we enter the space until the time we departed, it was just pure awesome. The beers were priced great, the DJ was spinning dance music, and the crowd was smiling. What more can I ask. There was even a pair of self identified cougars there who wanted more than the great burger. I do not know about the food, however. This place is solid. The staff is very chill yet professional, and I had no problem gettig a drink an even when I moved around the bar, I had great service. I recommend this place. If I lived here, I'd not only be here all the time, I'd probably try to work here too.
