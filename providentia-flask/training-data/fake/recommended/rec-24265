If you find yourself in Chinatown after a short or long night of drinking, do yourself a favor and get the house special congee.  Its probably the most underrated dish in this place, so don't be fooled by its simplicity.  What's so special about rice porridge you say?  Perfectly seasoned and hearty bits of seafood mixed in with tender grains of rice...  On the other hand, I may have been so far over the legal limit that I might be completely wrong as to how fantastic it tasted.  Either way, this place does great food in appropriate portions and at reasonable prices. To the hostess/waitress of Shiao Lan Kung:  Thank you for taping my c-note back together while face down in my new favorite dish...
