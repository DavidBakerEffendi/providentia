My first thought upon walking in: OooOOoo this place is cute! My second thought upon walking in:  OMG, this place is sooo gay... My third thought upon walking in:  The boy must be loving this.  Gah. Aside from the utter fabulousness of the space (I mean... ornate antique mirrors on the ceilings and a boxed-in chandelier... come on!), the folks that work here are really nice.  My family not only takes forever to eat, but they're also apparently complete novices when it comes to Thai food.  Ordering alone probably took a good ten minutes, yet our server maintained composure and patience throughout.  Even -I- was annoyed at how high maintenance my parental units were being. Although the presentation of the food is noteworthy, the taste sadly was not.  I went for my typical order of pad khee mao, and not only was it barely spicy, I think it might have only had three or four basil leaves in it.  Similarly, my tom yum soup was flavorful, but nearly overpowering in its vinegar-y sourness.  Definitely not something I'm accustomed to. Great joint for a low-key affordable date.  No doubt many a Chelsea boy one-night stand kicked off here.  If you're into great Thai food, go elsewhere. NB:  Reportedly, the ladies room is pimped out like whoa.  I didn't get to see the bird sink for myself, but if someone snaps a picture in there, let me know!
