I've been here quite a few times, sitting at the bar save for one. The service is typically pretty good and the beer/wine selection is passable. My only real problem with Above is the inconsistent quality of food. I've ordered the same dish 3 times; the 1st time it was delicious, the 2nd not good at all, and the 3rd, eh, just okay. Perhaps the cooks lack experience or are not taught well enough? Whatevs, it's probably the best meal in South Orange so I'll deal. (The outdoor patio looks quite awesome too.)
