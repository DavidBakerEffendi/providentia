I am so glad there is finally a cute place where I live. It's really well put together. The decor is super cute-pin-up girls on the wall and leopard print menus- it doesn't seem like they cut any corners. Prices are decent. Only tried the fish and chpis but the food seems decent. The juke box needs some serious help! But I love the place. I wish they would have rockabily bands play or something. Its the only hip thing in Newark so if youre reading this, you BETTER GO! xoxo
