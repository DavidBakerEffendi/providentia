I came here on cinco de mayo for no reason at all. We were just exploring and got hungry so we decided to just try it. Our server was very pleasant. I had a shrimp dish which was fantastic and my friend had the chicken which looked yummy. The only thing I can complain about was the small dinning area forcing the tables to be a little cramped. The restaurant was pretty empty though when we got there around 4 or 5 so I wasn't bothered by it.
