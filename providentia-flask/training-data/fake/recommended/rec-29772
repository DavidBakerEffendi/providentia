The South Slope seems to be host to a new Italian restaurant every month these days, so four of us decided to try out this one last night. Overall, it was decent and an inexpensive $100 (the fact that they are still BYOB doesn't hurt) but I wasn't inspired to go back. I'm not sure any level of service could have made up for the fact that our waitress didn't come to our table for the first 20 minutes. Now, in her defense, 2 people were missing from our 4 person table during that time (first, waiting on the other 2 dinner guests, then a separate 2 leaving to get wine because they didn't realize it was BYOB). When I was finally able to flag someone down, the waitress explained that she didn't think we were ready because the table wasn't full. I would have appreciated a little bread and water, though - or they could choose to wait to seat tables until the entire party was there. Our appetizers were pretty good - the buffalo mozzarella with squash and mushrooms was tasty but the cheese could have been better (Union Market sells a better mozzarella, let alone Russo's up the street) and the squash was a little overcooked. The bruschetta was very good - crusty bread with jam and a piece of prosciutto, topped with blue cheese - but I'll probably just recreate it at home rather than going back for that. I had the cauliflower risotto and tried some of the short rib ragu as well. Both were pretty good, but a little under-seasoned. Rice in the risotto was very well cooked though - I'll admit that's hard to find. For dessert, the tiramisu was awesome and panna cotta was tasty as well. So, not a bad meal, but I don't think I have any reason to go there instead of closer-to-home Scalino or get great food at Al di La. Or just chow down on some of that bruschetta at the kitchen table.
