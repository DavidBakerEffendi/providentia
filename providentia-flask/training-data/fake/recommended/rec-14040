Sometimes when I go to this place, it tries to be too cool for school, while at the same time filled with students from NYU...But the food here is still really good and that's why I keep coming back here for more. Â I love how the front of this place is open to the street, perfect for a nice breeze to come in, while you sit inside the dark and cozy black and white interior, the immaculate white tile walls lined with photographs of Victorian nudes. I also like that they give each table a bottle of flat water as well as a bottle of sparkling water. Everyone raves about their French Toast with maple butter and caramelized bananas (which I have yet to try). But, I can say, that I would definitely come here for their Potato Waffle Benedict with spinach and caramelized onions or the "B L , E" with apple smoked bacon, fried egg, lemon aioli, on a nice, soft, and b-b-bouncy brioche bun.
