Went to this place after a friend had convinced me you'll never look at street food the same again. The lines are long but move quick as they have 4-5 guys and look like they are on a factory assemble line. The food has lots of flavor and for the price you get a lot of bang for your buck, they open late so you typically see a lot of happy drunk people. And taxi drivers. I've had such a craving for this place one that we drove from all the way from Brooklyn to get the chicken over rice.
