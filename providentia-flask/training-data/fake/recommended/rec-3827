Reality: People seem to like this place, simply because you can sit outside with music and have drinks and its different then other places...BUT every time I have tried this place, at least 5 times now, the food is HORRIBLE, and drinks UNPREDICTABLE ( depending on who makes them) I guess coming from the west coast and being blessed to travel and having a latin husband and a taste for all foods latino would at least mean that I have tried many varieties served up in many places and this MUST be one of the single worst I have ever had...really. Its just too bad as it is fun and cute, and YES only really popular since there isn't much like it in this city. NOTE: anyone considering opening a place, open something similar and you will be busy, make better food and you will open 5 more. I am sorry but if you read down most reviews are about drinks, fun and hanging out and NOT about the food, other than corn on the cob, which I also thought was very mediocre. (try Los Muertos on Washington, or any Mexican place for better ones) The burritos we had were absolute horrible-how can you make them that bland and average? How hard is it? It's not fine cuisine after all ! Haven't been since last summer, but do not think I will try again after 5 attempts with various friends. Really disappointed and it just shows how a little cuteness can get you everywhere!
