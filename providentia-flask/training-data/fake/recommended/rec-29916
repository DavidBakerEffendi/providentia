Well this was a find. I'm very pleased. I don't understand the bad reviews. I went during the week at 5 pm and made a reservation. This was not needed Â for 5 pm but as it got later the dining room got fuller. The upstairs area is quaint and cozy. Perfect for a romantic date or catch-up with a girlfriend. The happy hour is simple; 4-7 pm (including Saturdays which apparently are very busy), $5 Mulled Wine (so good!), $6 House Wine (a red and a white) and $4 Beers. We only had and hour and a half on our hands but I literally could have stayed for hours. I shared hummus, zucchini pancakes, and braised short ribs with my friend. The ribs were AMAZING!
