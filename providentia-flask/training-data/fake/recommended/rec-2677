I have to update my rave review with another.  We went for the Sunday dinner option which is an incredible deal of a 3 course meal for two - $35.00.  In addition to that we ordered the Pannochia pizza which was awesome- corn puree, shiitake mushrooms, truffle oil... it was slightly soggy in the center but still delicious.   Our server brought out complimentary Grilled Octopus which we devoured and definitely will be ordering again.  Also the mascarpone panna cotta with melons and pistachios was a delightful dessert and not too heavy!
