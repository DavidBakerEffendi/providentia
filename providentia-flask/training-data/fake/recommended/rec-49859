Okay food, *very* good beer. We made reservations to have dinner upstairs and then go to the comedy club downstairs. The food was okay, but nothing to write home about. The beer, on the other hand, was very good. It is crafted on premises and they have a decent selection at all times.  I had a number of pints and was very happy with all of them.  I don't believe I consumed my entire meal, however and that is saying something. The decor is nice. It is in a historic heating plant that once provided steam heat to the downtown Hartford area. The ceilings are therefore very high, and they have elevated dining areas.  Lots of old wood and iron. The bar is large and separate from the dining areas. It accomodates sizeable groups of folks for happy hour after work.  I didn't see any drunken, graft-taking politicians, but that doesn't mean they weren't there.  It is Hartford, CT after all.   The wait staff is okay; not as professional and attentive as in some of your better restaurants (like Ruth's Chris or The Palm, for example), but they are not rude or dismissive either. The comedy club was excellent.  Three comedians for $15 (or was it $20?). Two of them were okay, but one of them was so funny I could barely keep from falling off my chair the entrie routine. Of course, the comedians change every week, so you might get somebody lame, or you might get somebody great. Who knows? Take the chance. Only problem with the comedy club is that the service is really slowwww. It's as if they're trying not to disturb the comedians or something. Weird. If it were just for the food, I'd give it a 2.5.  If it were just for the beer, I'd give it a 4.5.  Since I really went for the beer, it gets a 4.  Overall, recommended.
