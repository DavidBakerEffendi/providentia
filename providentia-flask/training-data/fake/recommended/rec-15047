You can't really appreciate the place until you walk in and head towards the back.  Once in the back you realize you're outside again: a big, outdoor space with plenty of picnic tables and benches for seating, beer stand off to your left, food stand off to your right and good times ahead. This place will be a great venue for those nice spring/summer evenings.  Can't imagine what it'd be like if the weather's inclement (I went on a nice Friday night). A lot of commenters noted the security staff and douche patrons.  I didn't notice either.  Maybe I'm oblivious or could simply care less given the 1 liter beer and delicious pretzel in front me. +1 for 1 liter beers! +1 for pretzels bigger than my head (and that's saying something) +1 for the outside venue. +1 for 1 liter beers (I can double count, it's my review). Watch out for the spicy mustard.  Has a kick on the way down.
