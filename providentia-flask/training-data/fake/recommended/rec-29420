I was driving from DC to NY I though the detour for a cheese steak a worthy diversion.  I selected Dalessandro's based on the previous very high ratings.  Unfortunately  I wasted my cheese steak opportunity.  Dalessandro's did not live up to the hype.  The cheese stakes were fine, maybe even good, but certainly not great.
