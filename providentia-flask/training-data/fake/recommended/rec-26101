I will give them one star for their one redeeming quality, the design of the space. Sadly that craftsmanship is not carried through in the beer list. I waited in such anticipation to see this new beer garden with 100 taps only to be sorely disappointed and misled. How can you promote yourself as a beer hall when you have 25 beers ? There is 4 taps of 25 beers ! The beer list is a straight up a yawn fest and my local Associated has a more creative selection. The bartenders are another type of "some kind of wonderful". I am talking to you petite brunette, try flexing your managerial "skills" on someone else's time, I came to drink and spend money and not be condescended to.
