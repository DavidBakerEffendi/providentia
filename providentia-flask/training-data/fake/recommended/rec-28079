I went on a Friday night and the place was incredibly crowded (which is not my kind of thing). In order to get a table you sit by the bar you pretty much had to grab it yourself. However I'm sure its not like this everyday. The waitresses were really nice and they had a decent selection of beers. I wish they had more on their menu =/ but if you go try their fries; pretty tasty !
