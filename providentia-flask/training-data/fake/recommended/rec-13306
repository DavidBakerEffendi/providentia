Come at your own risk! They should change the name of this restaurant to Clinton St Waiting because you'll be waiting outside this restaurant on Clinton St for hours! Got there at 11:15 and did not get seated until 2pm. Seriously. I only waited because it is Pancake month and I wanted to try the Crunchy banana pancakes. Was it good? Yes it was but not worth the nearly 3 hour wait. This place is over hyped. Advice - take it to go if you live in the neighborhood.
