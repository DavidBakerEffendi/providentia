We stopped in here for breakfast a few weeks ago. It was good, didn't knock my socks off but it was good. We are also talking breakfast. The Monkey Bread was delicious and the Bloody Mary was as it should be - especially when you fill out a slip ordering it just the way you want it. I would like to try this place for dinner sometime - I've heard it is good comfort food.
