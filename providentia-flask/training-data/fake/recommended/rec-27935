This place was sooooooo cute!!! It was an intimate setting with dimmed lights and candles on each table.  The staff there is really nice and helpful!  I've never tried Cuban food, so this was definitely an adventure for me! I didn't know what to order so I asked the waitress to suggest something.  For appetizers, she suggested Papa Rellena, Lightly breaded mashed potato with a beef picadillo filling.  As for an entree, she suggested the Fricasse de Pollo, Pulled roasted chicken, tomatoes, herbs and green peas served with yellow rice and tostones.  Both were REALLY delicious!!! My friend ordered a grilled shredded port, but don't remember what it was called and that was DELICIOUS TOO!   For dessert, (of course i couldn't skip that!!!) we had flan... and that too was DELICIOUS!!! I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a REALLY good cuban restaurant!  My friend who is of latin american decent said that was really good Cuban food!  And the entree dishes range from $11 - $15! So not expensive!!! Come here if you want a mellow, intimate dinner!!! and DELICIOUS Cuban food!!!
