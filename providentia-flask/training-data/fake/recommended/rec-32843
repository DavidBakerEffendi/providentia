Zero risk - guaranteed to enjoy a wonderful dining experience and leave stuffed. Latest visit - amazing Valentine's Day experience with wife. Always starts with a wonderful greeting and first impression.  How many times have you walked into a place to meet an indifferent host/hostess that seemed annoyed that you showed?  Not here they know how to make you feel welcomed. It's a very romantic environment for a such a spacious restaurant. We were seated immediately.  Not a given in today's world where some places overbook and make you wait. Had the prefix.  Great spacing between courses - they won't rush them and will pay plenty of attention to you in the meantime. Hamachi Crudo - full of flavor - wife loved it Lobster chowder - tons of lobster and warm bread to dip in soup afterwards Veal risotto - exactly what i wanted - creamy and cooked perfectly Spaghetti scallops - perfect for her - plenty of kick Lamb chops for me - seasoned and the ideal medium rare - love the spice balance Wife had lobster - already full (lightweight!) - made a wonderful lunch the next day Almond tart / chocolate cake thingy for me - had to eat it - wasting it would be a crime. Peanut butter something for wife - surprised me and saved some room for that! Long story short (I know too late) - YOU WILL LOVE IT
