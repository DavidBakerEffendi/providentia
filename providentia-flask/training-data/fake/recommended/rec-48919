I went here today for lunch. I had amazing mulligatawny soup and my dad, who's as critical as it gets, was very impressed by his lobster bisque. We shared a falafel wrap, which was also delicious. The restaurant is a tiny spot with only one table and counters on the inside. The staff are very friendly and they let you sample the soups.
