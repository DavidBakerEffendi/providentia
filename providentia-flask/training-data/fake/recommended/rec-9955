Yummmmmm. Excellent gyro for a ridiculous price. I usually get the chicken gyro with tzatziki sauce on whole wheat.  And the fries are in the gyro, which is a fun addition. The shop is very clean and to go orders are wrapped incredibly well.  I wish they would also put tzatziki on the side, too....I usually ask for it.  I haven't tried dessert, but they do look yummy.
