I have been to this restaurant a few times in the past year and every thing has been really delicious interesting seasonal food. I have been very happy with everything I have eaten  and the service is decent as well. Here is my picky comment... Redecorate!!!! Food this sophisticated deserves a better setting. While I love that it is a cozy spot in red hook and there have  been some interesting architectural details added there are way too many cheesey chotzkas. Lose the Christmas lights , this is not a dorm room, and the bad art reproductions have got to go. Last time I was there I was seated in the little back room . It's tar paper like walls made it dark and I found the ugly Christmas decorations distracting. The space is small and a little cramped, but worth sitting in for the wonderful food. A careful editing of the  decor and some investment in good lighting could make you feel like you are in the excellent restaurant that you are instead of feeling like you are seated in grandmas basement.
