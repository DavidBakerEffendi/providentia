OMGOSH!!! If you're visiting NY and I'm around, I am always taking you to this place. Pio Pio is where I hope to have my first child. Kidding. Maybe. I've had most of their menu and by far the best deal is the Matador combo. It states that it's enough to feed two people, but it has consistently never failed to feed at least 3 (one of whom is always the biggest eater ever). The chicken is moist and well seasoned. The avacado in the salad is ripe and green. and the Totstones! Don't even get me started. Overall Pio Pio is the best deal with the best food. The sangria is always well made and wonderful. Ambience is great. Food is great. Service is pleasant and always ready to anticipate your needs. 100% recommend!!!!
