Damn that's a good burger. Yes umami burger I am talking about you. So juicy and melt in your mouth delicious. And the fries!! The dipping sauce!! Stick with this and you won't be disappointed! Skip the fried pickles and pickles platter. There was many 4 pickle spears which makes it hard to share- what do you just wanted a small piece or had 6 guests to split between?? Pickle platter didn't showcase different delicious pickles but just pickled things like okra and string beans and it was boring & should be taken off their menu. They don't seat guests until the whole party has arrived. Comparable prices to shake shack. So maybe $20 for a meal unless you get drinks+dessert. Hum.. The burgers itself imo are more delicious than shake shack actually Â for it's meat and sauce and flavor and heft. Def would come back!!
