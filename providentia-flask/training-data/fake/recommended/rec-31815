I had heard good things about Fri, Sat, Sun so I figured restaurant week was a good chance to try it out. Overall, I was fairly satisfied. The restaurant has a very "warm" and cozy feel to it, which is always a plus. And despite being very busy, it really wasn't that loud. The service was excellent. Often times, I feel rushed to leave the restaurant but here, I didn't feel like I needed to shove down my food and then sign my credit card receipt. The waiter was attentive and very helpful. I was also very happy with the wine list. As advertised, all wines are only $10 above cost, so all the bottles are very reasonable. Not only were they priced well but there was a good variety of both red and white wine from many different regions. Food-wise, I was happy with the Thai Chicken salad to start. The greens were fresh and the dressing was tasty. I ordered the filet but was pretty disappointed to find out that "rare" actually means" medium". Apparently no restaurant that is not a steakhouse knows what rare means. Either way, the steak was decent despite the overcooking. Their Â deserts were a highlight. I had the banana bread pudding with Grand Marnier sauce. Some places consider dessert a tiny little piece of cake. This place gives you a nice home style slab of cake, with just the right amount of sauce. A nice ending to a pretty good meal!
