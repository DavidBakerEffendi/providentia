I'm not a Cheesesteak expert, but the steak & provolone, kitchen sink style was awesome!  Add some mustard and wing sauce, and you've got a masterpiece on your hands. The rolls were really, really good, and the meat was being sliced fresh from some choice looking steaks and being put right onto the grill...mmm! Next time, I'll go extra-cheese for the full effect. The fries are good too, which makes the combo a good deal.  These folks that are complaining about prices know that it's not Taco Bell or McDonalds, so what's the deal?  You want to save some money & eat that pink slime?  Go for it!  Me?  I'll go with quality ingedients.  The combo was ony ten bucks, including a drink and fries, with a little extra for the kitchen sink option - not super cheap, but not too bad either. Not the low fat, low cholesterol fare, I'm used to, but that's what makes it soooo good!
