I've been aware of Tashan for a while but I hadn't made it a priority to visit mainly because I'm not that into Indian food, but based on the high rating I thought it was finally time to give it a try.  I'm glad I did.   The menu is influenced by various global cuisines.  I found it to be very accessible, even for someone uninitiated to Indian flavors and spices.   The best dish by far was the Butter Chicken, which I get the feeling is not really an authentic Indian preparation, but whatever, it was tremendous.  The tomato cream sauce was amazing, and we used it as a dipping sauce for pretty much everything else we had on the table.  The Crab Cake and Palak Chaat were both quite good.  The Kobe Chopan Kebab was the only miss - it was more like Kobe sausage which I wasn't really expecting, but I'm willing to write that off to personal preference.  I rarely eat dessert but there was crème brulee with a little Masala donut in the center which I couldn't pass up, and it was awesome! Our waiter was friendly and generally attentive.  The only misstep of the night was an unusually long wait for my glass of wine, which he remedied by providing it gratis, which I considered a fair trade for the minor inconvenience. Also free valet parking, which I didn't learn until after I left :( Will definitely go back soon!
