Greatest pizza in NYC, hands down.  No competition, don't buy reviews from people that jock Lombardi's.  Lombardi's = reproduction, just like your local TGI Friday's.   Btw - don't expect much more than good pizza here.  The rest of menu and drinks selection is 'meh'. Crowds suck, though.  big time.
