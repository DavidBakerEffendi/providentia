My wife, Irene and I joined my daughter, Kim and son-in-law Jason for dinner out last Saturday Night at XiXa (prounced Shiksa and if your Jewish, you know what it means!).  Well I have to tell you, the place is very eclectic and funky, from my point of view, with subdued lighting and tight knit rows of connected boat rope hanging from the ceiling, most unusual!  The crowd was young and we seemed like the oldest couple there!  Now this is a Mexican Restaurant, but I believe a Fusion style restaurant, blending in Asian touches of culinary treats.  So we looked at the menu and ordered 12 dishes!!!  Yes, 12!  I came to understand earlier that this was a tapas type venue (small portions), so I assumed that I would be hungry when done.  We started with an amazing bottle of fruity and crisp wine and we could have easily had a 2nd one, except for the fact we had to drive back to Bayside and Great Neck.  Our dishes started to come, one at a time and they were made up of chicken, shrimp and Mexican and Asian Fusion style cooking.  We started to taste this food and our taste buds began to say WOW!!!!!  Tastes that my "buds" had never experienced!  We were served one dish after another and were floored as to the stupendous and varied flavors that we experienced.  Although I cannot remember the names of any dishes, I can rest assure you that whatever you order will be an amazing and one of a kind tasting event.  This is a must go to hot spot, which has only been open a few months and they own another restaurant a hop, skip and a jump away, called Traip (229 S. 4th st between Driggs & Roebling St 347-844-9578,traifny.com), which we will surely try in the near future, maybe this weekend!  All I can say, is if you to have a food experience and an out of body experience, go to Xisa.  Yes, I was still hungry when we left, but it was worth every penny!!!
