I come from "out West," and we don't know Indian food well, so my review might reflect my naivet√©. Gandhi is easy to miss on a dodgy street with other restaurants and a few fast-food joints. Owner incredibly kind and food pretty danged good. Other Yelp reviews pretty accurate. I also ate at Tamarind in Manhattan. Very posh but food no better than Gandhi. I wouldn't call Gandhi's atmosphere "intimate," but food and service very good indeed. And an easy subway ride from Manhattan.
