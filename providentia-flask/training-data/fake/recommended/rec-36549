One of my favorite places for breakfast in NY.   A bit pricey, but the service, food and coffee certainly make up for it.  It's hard to believe but even though it's not the busiest street in Soho I always manage to catch a cab as soon as I walk out the door.  Not so at Sarabeth's.   I also have a little more elbow room when I eat at Balthazar's, not so at Sarabeth's where I feel like I'm dining with the group beside me.
