In the entire history of the world, there has never been a better example of good food/bad service than the Fiesta Hut. Not rude or snotty service, just consistently clueless, understaffed, overmatched service. If you are the type of person that can't stand this type of service - do not go here. If you are the type of person that is willing to withstand this type of service for genuinely delicious food, give it a shot. But be warned, the entire dining experience is almost certain to unfold with halting, almost laughable timing. Hard to believe they can't figure out that simply adding one more person (a busboy at $8/hour would do it) would transform the service to at least reasonable. Thus the true rating is 4/5 for food; damn near 0 for service. Always been this way, will never change.
