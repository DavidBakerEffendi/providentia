My friends kept saying "you have to go this place" or "I've spent all of my money ordering out from this place" and I was curious, so I finally went. I was not disappointed! Awesome food, awesome (and hilarious service), and great drinks. We got a pitcher of Sangria and it was enormous. More than enough for 3 people. Also the food was some of the best I've ever had, and it wasn't too filling, so you didn't leave wanting to die. This is my fave restaurant in Crown Heights. Highly recommended.
