i only recently discovered this little hidden gem (well, it's not really that hidden, but i must have walked passed it a million times without so much as a second thought) and i am sad that i have been missing out! the service is attentive without being suffocating, the food is phenomenal (working my way through the menu, but going to go ahead and recommend the baby artichoke app, while it's in season!), the vibe is very nyc-bustling-with-people, and the owner (if he's there, usually he is) is beyond friendly! and if you're so inclined...you can BYO bottle of wine for a $15 corkage fee. DEAL!
