I got the Cali Veggie burger and a salad for lunch (take out). I asked for a small salad but was charged for large... also they did not put raisins on it but charged me for them. The burger came with fries which was nice and the price was good so i went back... second time around i got the same meal minus the salad and got no fries with my burger... i called to ask about it and was rudely told that unless i specify that i want them they wont include them... but i didn't specify the first time? Not sure how that place runs. The to go person is rude and ignores you unless you go out of your way to get their attention (even though you are standing RIGHT THERE) Hopefully dining in is better but i will never know that as i do not plan to go back.
