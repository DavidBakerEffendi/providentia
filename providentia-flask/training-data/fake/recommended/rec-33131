So I guess I need to go back because I was disappointed. I had the Duck hash and it was just bad. THe duck tasted overcooked but I realize I went out on a limb with my order. It really is a darling place. I think I will try the omelette next time and report back. Service was good but Stay away from the duck hash. The potatoes too left a little to be desire.
