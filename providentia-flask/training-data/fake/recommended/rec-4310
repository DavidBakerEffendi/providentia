My husband and I came to Sampan for restaurant week this past September. Overall this was very enjoyable experience. We had reservations but that means nothing during restaurant week. We waited for about 30 minutes at the bar having a glass of wine and taking in the scene. Every nook and cranny of this restaurant was filled with people. It was a great young, lively atmosphere. I can't really remember what we ate except for an awesome Calamari Salad and the Pork Bao Bun (which was a bit too spicy for my taste, perfect for my sriracha chugging Hubs). The waiter was attentive and great with removing plates, bringing our next tasting order, and refilling drinks. I give this a four star experience because of the wait when we had reservations and the fact that the tables are extremely close to each other. While I can't recall the conversation I could not block out next to me now, I do remember as soon as the couple left my jaw was on the floor as I was amazed that it would be a topic of discussion in public.
