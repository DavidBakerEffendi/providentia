This cheesesteak was so, so...better than Geno's, but still not the best. The meat was plentiful and hot, melted the cheese as appropriate. The roll was soft and tasty, but still not a "melt-in-your-mouth" experience. It wasn't cheap, just like other places around Philly, but it's a better experience (and taste) then you would find across the street. Try them out, but then hit South Street and try some others!
