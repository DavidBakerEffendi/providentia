Wow! First off, I completely ignored this place due to it's location. When you open up on the same block as IHOP, forgive me for making some snap judgments. But, man, this place is my new "guess what I found?" place. So, any half-educated sushi snob will jump at the chance to tell you sushi isn't raw fish, it's the rice; hence the California roll. What's funny, though, is most people who are really into sushi don't like California rolls because there's no fish! I mean, yeah, sushi's about the rice, but the fish is what I crave! But this place. This place is all rice and veggies. And multiple types of rice, too: black, pink, brown, white. It's basically the only sushi place I've ever seen that says "did you know sushi refers to the rice, not the fish?" It's affordable, it's delicious, it's creative, and the staff are all friendly. It's a bit small, seating is cramped. the 4 seater in the window box is often shared by two parties and one party inevitably has to ask the other party to get up so they can leave. But you can usually grab a seat and enjoy yourself if you know the deal going in. Chia pudding desserts, herbal lemonades and what not. It's all feel-good, good-for-you, tastes-good food, and it's really the only thing like it I've ever seen.
