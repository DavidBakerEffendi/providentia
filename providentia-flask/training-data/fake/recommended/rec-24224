I've heard great things about this place and so I finally got to try it for myself and boy am I glad I did! Â I had the creme brulee french toast. Nothing but delicious-ness. It makes my mouth water just thinking about it. My friends got the kitchen sink, pork italiano and chicken cutlet sandwich. All very good. I definitely want to go back and try the rest of the menu!
