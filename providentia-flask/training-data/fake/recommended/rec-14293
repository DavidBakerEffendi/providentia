I'm a yakitori nut, so for me to find a restaurant of this quality so near my place (five streets away from my HK joint) is truly a blessing. For the more adventurous diner, the chicken liver and heart is divine. More traditional foodies will find the chicken thigh, pork with scallions, and enoki bacon hard to resist. To make sure you leave full, grab one of the chicken with egg rice bowls. I've never left Yakitori Totto unsatisfied, and that goes for the people I take there as well. The place is small, so go early and enjoy!
