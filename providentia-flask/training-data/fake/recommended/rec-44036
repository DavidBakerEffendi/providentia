Food quality and taste, price, and service all deserve 5 stars! We had the Thousand Layer Bread, which believe me, is to die for. Â We also ordered Coconut Chicken Curry with Vegetable Fried Rice and Cabbage Ginger soup. Ahhhh-mazing. I ordered the Rangoon Night Market Noodles, they were perfect. Not spicy, but very flavorful. The sauce that came with my noodles tasted perfect with my thousand layer bread. I am so glad I came here, I recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Chinatown in Philadelphia!
