I'm gonna say El Vez is more popular for their "hip" atmosphere than anything else... While you can certainly find superior Mexican cuisine in Philadelphia, I would have to submit their "Bazooka Limon" guacamole as the best in the city. There are some other gems on the menu to be found as well (Corn Chowder Soup, Red Snapper Tacos). An old fashioned photo booth and a bedazzled cholo bike are welcomed accents.. My only complaint would be the bartenders. I can only be ignored for about 8 minutes until my head explodes.
