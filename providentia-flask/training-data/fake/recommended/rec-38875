Horrible, rude owner. Kicked us out because we were having "too much fun." No other legitimate reason provided. Unless it was discrimination or racism. She probably thought i was drunk, dancing and acting free and crazy, but guess what, i was so sober i could remember every single detail. And i only had ONE beer. I have never encountered an owner so disrespectful, now I understand why the place was literally empty and dead on St. Patty's weekend. I am a manager of a company and guess what, i am going to tell my staff and peers to not step foot on Nick's. Thank you for the business.
