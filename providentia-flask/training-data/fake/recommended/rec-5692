#24 I'm not sure where the hype comes from for El Vez. Sure, their interior design is colorful and yours eyes dance along the walls with curiosity, but their food and drinks are nothing special. My boyfriend and I decided to give their guacamole a whirl and, man, were we surprised at their prices. I understand having unique ingredients and such, but avocados, cheese, tomatoes, and onions should not cost more than minimum wage, IMO. I'm fine with the truffled guacamole costing a bit more, but otherwise, no dice. Despite the fact that we were there for brunch, we decided to settle for just guacamole and drinks - we could grab some more filling food somewhere else. Even with such a short order, it took quite some time for them to bring everything out. We did appreciate their complimentary chips and salsa though. =) Eventually, the guacamole came out with a flourish, as did our drinks. I'll admit that, yes, the guacamole did taste rather good, but it was definitely not out of this world. The drinks were also quite subpar, tasting watered down and flavorless. =\ The next time I'm craving Mexican food, I think I'll give El Rey a shot. As for a guacamole craving, I could do better with going to Alma de Cuba or just flying home to SoCal.
