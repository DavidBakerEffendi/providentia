In town on business, was recommended church Street for lunch. So, we came here for lunch!  Church Street reminds me a little bit of Pearl Street in Boulder, CO. The location is good, the food not bad.  Service fine. I had the bison burger and it was good.  Not exceptional, but good nonetheless. It appears to have a full bar and looks like a fun night spot.  Unfortunately,  we had t leave for the next flight out and did not see Church Street at night.   Good spot to visit.  Sweetwaters and Church Street!
