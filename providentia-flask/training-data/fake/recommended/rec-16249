I've been to vite at least 6/7 times and can definitively say that it is consistently very good. I recommend the polpo appetizer, the spaghetti with scallops, the cavatelli with lamb ragu, and the pizza. The specials are also quite good and fresh. I'm sure everything else on the mini is also great, but I haven't gotten around to trying it yet! The only thing I don't like is the tortelloni, but not because there is anything bad about it- I just really dislike mushrooms! The atmosphere is warm and friendly, the staff very professional and attentive. It's better italian food than many "italian" restaurants in Manhattan. Bravi- keep up the good work!
