after having one $20 drink over at jade bar we decided on something more low key and hopped on over to the restaurant at maialino.   my friend ordered a glass of wine and they brought out a white wine and then we told them it was supposed to be a red wine.  then they checked and we were right!  weird!  ive never been poured the wrong wine before.  let alone white vs red. they had some cocktails and then mostly wine.
