Whiskey King with the Cheddar Fries! I love this burger so much I seriously get it confused with the name of the restaurant. It's a perfect combination of flavors. I grill my own burgers at home and bleu cheese/bacon is the topping of choice but Chef Garces puts those little extra touches in there (I certainly don't have foie gras around the house, or not usually anyway). The Irish Car Bomb shake is a politically incorrect taste explosion. You can't go wrong with a shake by your burger. Their whiskey menu itself is an enviable spread of delights. Plenty to try, and I'm working my way through! The venue's a little cramped, but the service has been stellar in my experience.
