A bit of advice to the next group of SF natives who come to open their first restaurant here in NY.   1. Turn the frown upside down 2. Read the book "Hug Your Customer" 3. "General Stores" inside restaurants don't work.   Just because I am not wearing a flannel shirt and rolled jeans don't mean I don't deserve the same treatment.  Ya heard. Ok, so what is it with the holier-than-thou attitude these locavore-ish type places exude.  I came here twice.  First time, was third night of service, typically when you expect to be welcomed with open arms, and gracious smiles, perhaps even a chat to learn more about your customer and his/her experience.  But alas the experience was akin to walking into Cipriani wearing jeans and t-shirt, it just ain't gonna fly. The menu was/is limited, fairly basic, decently priced, yet nothing I can't make at home.  If this menu came to be 3 yrs ago i would say differently.  The neighborhood already has this food to be brief (Back 40, even Redheads fare can be cast along this vein) Second time was for brunch, the good thing is it serves till 4pm, hence we figured give this place a second try.  The hash was nice, the pork slap beer at 3 bucks is a deal, butttt, a better deal can be had elsewhere. i am still scratching my head on how they expect to sell all that milk in the general store?
