How I Love Thee! Dined here for brunch over the weekend & we absolutely loved it! First off I must say the ma√Ætre d & waiters we had were extremely pleasant. Such a plus! It makes for a wonderful dining experience. Now let's get down to business & talk about the delicious food we had! We started off with the Mini Donuts which were served with raspberry & maple dipping sauces. Mmmmmmm good! I'm doing a dance right now just thinking about those hot donuts & sweet sauces. The raspberry was definitely my favorite. For our main dishes, my honey ordered the French Toast & I ordered the Lemon Ricotta Poppy Seed Pancakes served with citrus syrup. Both of us had scrambled eggs with cheese, bacon & potatoes. When I took a bite into those pancakes, I almost jumped up & praised the Lord! Man those pancakes were delicious, to die for, impeccable, amazing...did I say delicious already? Seriously, those pancakes are the best I've ever had. Not too sweet & a perfect amount of lemon & poppy seed. They didn't even need syrup but nonetheless tasted delicious with it. The French Toast was also a hit! He enjoyed it thoroughly along with the potatoes. We loved this place! Delightful brunch & stellar service. Next time I hit New York, I will be dining here for dinner. And I hope it's just as heavenly.
