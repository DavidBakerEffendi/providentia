Best new concept for a bar/snack bar I've seen in ages. This is the perfect place to go when you just can't think of a place to meet up with a couple friends.  It's fun and casual and  people were there with their kids when we went on a Sunday afternoon which we thought was great. I lived in Germany and other places in Europe and I felt transported to another place. For a couple hours I forgot about being in the sitting and just chilled. The food is is good, we had the fries, spaetzle and a couple sausages. Was it 100% authentically German? Maybe not but it was all tasty and it was more about feeling like you could be somewhere in Europe. Big thumbs up!!!!
