Sunday breakfast: First we get the juice, blackberry and passion fruit. Best blackberry juice I've ever had. Passionfruit juice was delicious and had no seeds. Second we get the breakfast de Venezolano. It had skirt steak, 3 eggs and cilantro. also came with Black beans and a cheese arepa. The cheese was good. Â We also shared the pabellon empanada, it was amazing. Can't wait to go back for dinner and the gourmet chocolate.
