BXL East is a breath of fresh air in this neighborhood. The mussels are delicious and a great deal. The beers/drinks are a nice change from the typical drafts you see at every bar. The food was great. The atmosphere is relaxed, cozy and very welcoming. On our first time there, it was as if we were regulars. The staff/bartenders were very friendly and seemed to thoroughly enjoy their jobs. It was the perfect place for a little date and we will most definitely be back (esp for the unlimited mussels, frites and a Stella for $20 on Sundays and Mondays!
