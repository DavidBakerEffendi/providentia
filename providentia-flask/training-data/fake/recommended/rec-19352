Haven't been back in a while so we were pleasantly surprised at how great, quick and deliciously authentic food was.  What we REALLY like about this place is that it's open at all hours and one can get as little or lot of food as one wants- and beer too if you are so inclined.  This worked out well for us since we arrived at an odd meal hour and one person was hungry an another not so .  So many choices too!!  Always reasonably priced , tasty and quick!  Can't be beat.
