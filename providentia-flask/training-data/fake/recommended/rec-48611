Absolutely amazing! We shared the bone marrow to start. The toppings were delicious and the marrow portion was perfect to share although we could have used another piece of bread. For entrees I had a new menu item-- cod roe udon pasta with a lemon beurre sauce, and the person I was with had the salmon. The salmon was cooked to perfection with a nice crispy skin and my udon pasta was mind blowing! Such an amazing balance of flavors and absolutely perfect udon noodles. I really hope this dish stays on the menu because I'm already craving it again! We were too full for dessert, but the meal finished with some complementary house-made gummy bears, which were a really tasty and cute way to finish out an excellent meal. We will definitely be back to sample the dessert menu! The ambiance and music here were also great. Service was attentive and interested in feedback, since they're new. I would give them 4.5 stars if I could. Deducting half a star because they only have beer in bottles and no cocktails, and because the marrow could have used more bread. Very happy to have this place in the neighborhood and I'm excited to see what they'll offer as time goes on. So impressed already!
