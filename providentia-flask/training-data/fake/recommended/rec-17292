Well, sushi, I tried you again, and this time you were filled with sweet potato and not much else, and you were actually delicious. I never liked you before, and while I am not sure if I will become a sushi convert now, I do thank you for being so enjoyable. Maybe next time I go to Nori, I may actually ORDER sushi. (Disclaimer: as my initial review says, I don't like sushi, but that's not Nori's fault! They are totally consistent at being good at life, and I still love them.)
