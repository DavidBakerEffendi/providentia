Go and get the burger and fries with cheese sauce. The wait is usually long, but it's worth it. I went on a Tuesday once at 4 o'clock and sat down right away. Friday at 8 o'clock was a different story; I didn't eat until 11 but it was good because I actually got to finish the whole thing. If you're a burger fan this place is a must!
