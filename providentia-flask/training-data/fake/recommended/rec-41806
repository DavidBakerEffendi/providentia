This might be the most overrated place I've come across during my yelp lurk career. I mean its decent but the reviews make you think it'll be a lot better--especially considering the price. It was my second time here and I tried the salad this time. Brisket has tough and a was swimming in an ocean of bland lettuce. Yea I know why an I getting a salad at a taco place? Because I can. The meat should taste good regardless. I'd rather go to taqueria de Los muertos, chavellas, or even Oaxaca if I'm anywhere in Brooklyn.
