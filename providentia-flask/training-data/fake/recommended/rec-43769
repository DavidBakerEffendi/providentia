City Steam...not bad. They brew all their own beers. I had their light beer and it was pretty good and refreshing. They also had a half rack of ribs with 2 sides. Half rack is $17 and Whole rack is $23. Only a $5 difference for a full rack! If you were in the south...it would be double the price. And surprisingly for New England, the ribs were pretty good. Service was decent. Not a bad spot to meet up and catch up with friends.
