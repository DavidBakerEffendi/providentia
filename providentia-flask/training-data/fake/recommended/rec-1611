3.5 stars Not a whole lot to write... We went to both Genos and Pats to try out both variations. Pats was chopped, which was a plus for me. The sandwich was moist, roll was fresh, meat was seasoned and definitely more of the style I prefer compared to what we tried across the street. Id go back, but next time I plan on checking out Jim's as I heard its close to or better.
