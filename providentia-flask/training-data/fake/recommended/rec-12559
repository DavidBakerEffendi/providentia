I loved it here. Food was amazing. The only thing that upset me about my visit here was that the place is cash only. Not only did me and friend not know that beforehand, we were told after we got our bill. Luckily all the cash we had in our pockets was equal to our bill or we would've been washing dishes. My friend even had to put up some extra cash for me. I used the bathroom, came back and as we were about to leave the ever so kind seater, approached us about not leaving a tip for our waitress (who obviously complained to her and who only showed up about twice the entire time we were there by the way) Then the waitress came and angrily had the nerve to give us back the 3 cent that was left behind. I felt disrespected. Yeah i would've left a tip if i knew to bring cash. But the fact that she acted that way and didnt seem to understand our situation, makes me glad I didn't.
