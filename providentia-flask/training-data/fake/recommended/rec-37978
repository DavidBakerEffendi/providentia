Bought a gift certificate on Restaurant.com on a Saturday night. I always check the conditions on the website to see if it's accepted on a weekend. There were none so we went and there's this big sign outside saying  they don't accept groupon  or restaurant.com on the weekends. They should post this fact on the websites.  Don't think I'm going to be back.
