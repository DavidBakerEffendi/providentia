This is our third time in this incredible place, and it never fails. The quality of food compared to the price is ridiculous- one of the best places to get your steak on! Plus outside garden, great music and atmosphere, and to top this: an incredibly sweet and respectful waiter that always offers us a shot of grappa even though we refuse to have dessert. We love PT!
