This out of the way boite  is easily the best place in the Penn Station/Macys  nabe to get a quiet drink or something lipsmacking to eat, if you're tired of all the Irish bars and fast food. Gorgeous zinc bar, very quiet, great wine, great service (sometimes maybe too attentive.). The menu is a bit of an adventure; it's laid out more like they are in France, with a "red menu" (the charcuterie) and a "green menu" (the cooked dishes) but all  the food I've tried has been delicious and the portion sizes are not too big. I've been several times; i live in this neighborhood and this is the place it needs. So far I've taken two sets of friends and they've both loved. I wish I was an events person, because they have a whole events space out the back.
