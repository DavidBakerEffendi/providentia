Oh the irony, the ssams are the least interesting things on the menu.  They are pretty much starchy, spicy Korean burritos.  Thankfully, the chef brought over his sinfully fatty and luscious steamed pork buns from Momofuku.  The veal head terrine is also a revelation for fans of snout to tail cooking. The fish is poached in a flavour packed broth, but the portion is small.  So, really just order anything with pork, pork, or pork since that is where the chef's passions lie.  They are usually accompanied by seasonal, local vegetables like sweet corn, okra, sugar snap peas, etc.  Come early, or bring a snack for the wait... The space is wheelchair accessible in the sense that one can easily wheel in, but someone in a wheelchair will have a difficult time enjoying a meal with friends. The space when crowded gets too cramped for easily access.  The tables are either too low or the counter too high for level dining.
