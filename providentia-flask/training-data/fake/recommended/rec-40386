If you're not from the area you'll find that parking is very difficult and parking tickets are handed out like lipstick at an Elton John Xmas party. I liked the fact that you can walk up to a the sidewalk counter. They're attentive and quick, albeit when I went it wasn't crowded, but they did move like they knew how to get the job done with good speed.They don't have an outlandish menu so picking what you want won't be hard. Had a chicken cheesesteak with just onions, cheese and mayo, fries on the side. My friend had a South Philly Cheesesteak with roasted peppers, spinach, provolone cheese and sweet potato fries. Both were very tasty, with some great natural flavor coming through. For $8 they were huge, I could hardly eat half. It's a small place. If you go during a time any popular eatery is likely to be crowded, make plans to walk and eat or sit elsewhere. I wouldn't so much suggest walking with this thing though... There are shops near if you wanna walk it off a little afterwards.
