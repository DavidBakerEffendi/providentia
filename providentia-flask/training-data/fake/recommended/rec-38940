AL's is awesome! I stop here on my way home, every time I travel to Montreal (3-4 times a year).  They have this place running like a finely tuned machine.  There's always a line (usually almost out the door), but you'll never wait, and your food is prepared right in front of you as you make your way through the line. HEADS UP: AL's is a CASH ONLY business! There is a ATM by the front door, but I've been there more then once when it was out-of-order.  So come prepared.   That being said, I've never needed more then $10... my usual order is 2 double cheese burgers (with everything), a pint of fries & a bottled water.  Can't beat that for about $10!
