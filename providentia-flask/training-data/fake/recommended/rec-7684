After a visit to Klimt's famous gold portrait(amazing piece of art) in the Neue Galerie, we stopped at the cafe there for an early lunch. Two in our party had open faced sandwiches ( liverwurst and smoked salmon) accompanied by small salads, both of which were fresh and delicious. All 3 in our party had pastries: linzer tort, lemon curd biscuit and coffee cream pastry - all small and tasty, each 'mit schlag' , fresh whipped cream. All that with one pot of tea to share was $75 - seemed pricey for small plates ( but it is New York), but we were not rushed, and the dark panelled room was cozy. We were lucky to get a banquette looking out at 5th Avenue and Central Park.
