I guess I should have had the sushi and not the soup, judging from the other reviews.  This was my first time here, and I tried one of the January soup specials.  I had the coconut curry broth, soba noodles, along with mushrooms and spinach.  This was the blandest meal I've ever had.  It had absolutely no flavor.  The mushrooms were a treat, because at least they tasted like something.  I was so excited to find a place that had vegan noodle soup for lunch, but what a disappointment.
