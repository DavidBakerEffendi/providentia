Had brunch today with my parents and my wife. The wait was fairly long, both to be seated and to be served, but the food was patently delicious. Similar to Queens Comfort in some ways (small space, communal tables, unusual artwork, odd drinking glasses, decadent food, rather loud). The artwork on the walls is very unusual, but it is not overdone. I got a Fingerling Potatoes Poutine with gravy, gruyere, potatoes, and hardboiled egg, maybe shallots or onions (?). I believe it was a new addition to the brunch menu as it is not listed on the website. Really delicious and really, really filling. Made me very thirsty (probably very salty I guess?). My wife got the grilled cheese (cheddar and mozzarella) with the tomato soup and thought it was great, though the bread-to-cheese ratio was high (then again, the bread is a brioche). The restaurant is difficult to locate on the street because they have no awning; I'm tempted to not describe where it is to prevent it from being even more crowded next time we go! But no, it's a narrow black storefront across from the library, between a Subway and the umpteenth Pollos A La Brasa Mario. Not for the impatient, the lactose intolerant, or the health nut!!
