OMG.  I thought places like Plenty only existed in my dreams.... Went here last night for the first time and the service was outstanding! We were offered multiple samples of various sides, just because! (or maybe I was drooling more than I noticed).   Their MAC and CHEESE is too die for!! No, let me be more specific: It's literally the best mac and cheese I've ever had! (Good thing my mom has no idea what yelp is....blasphemy.)  Oh, and just because the service is amazing, they actually went to the back to get us the hot, fresh batch of mac and cheese : )   Also had the cauliflower with pesto....amazing!  Husband got shredded bbq pork which he said was delicious; I can only attest that the whipped sweet potatoes (w/madras curry) and the HOMEADE CORNBREAD were also five stars!  It's obvious they've prepared their foods to go and specially constructed them to still have moisture when reheated....cornbread was moist and sweet and nothing was even close to dry after reheating.   Bottom Line:  We finished our meal feeling like we'd just eaten out at one of our favorite byos, except that we got way more food and only spent $20 for both of us!  I am officially declaring myself a (soon to be) regular!
