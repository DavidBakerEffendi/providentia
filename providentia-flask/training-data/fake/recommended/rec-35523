Lovely little place, too bad it's far from Manhattan (I am not a local), but that is probably why the prices are so fair. I have tried salads and pastas only, and despite another review on this list, my seafood spaghetti were excellent and so was the fresh kale salad. For dessert, the panna cota was lovely, although it could have used a little more fruit coulis, but I am sure that, had I asked, I would have gotten more, since the service was very friendly, and the whole place has a wonderfully relaxed, cosy feeling. If only I lived closer, I would be there more often. I agree also with the reviewer who wished they would have coffee/pastry options, especially during the day, since the place has the right kind of vibe for it and the espresso my friend got at the end of the meal was probably the best I have ever tasted.
