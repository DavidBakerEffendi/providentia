Worth the drive, worth the wait...the cheesesteak with fried onions at Dalessandro's has no competition - unless you want to drive another 45 minutes into the city - and these sandwiches are just delicious. Rolls are fresh, meat is MEAT with plenty of cheese and fried onions generously scattered throughout the sandwich. As all cheesesteaks are, they are best eaten fresh, not rewarmed - sit at the counter or quickly get them home. Be aware of the lines - but be patient, the staff works through the lines pretty quickly and they are worth the wait.
