Hole-in-the-wall. This is on a hidden, dirty, and malodorous little side street in Chinatown and from the outside, it's shady at best.  Yes, the tables are about to collapse, the chairs are mismatched and probably picked up from a flea market, and the floor has never been mopped since the day they opened.  This is one of those places where it's best not to acknowledge the state of the dining area or the likely state of the kitchen.  Overall, I've had better dining experiences in Flushing compared to Chinatown (in terms of authenticity) but I was craving knife cut noodles and Flushing was more effort than I was willing to put forth on this day. Knife cut noodles with duck (dao xiao mian) - The noodles were the perfect texture - thick and chewy.  However, the broth was bland and left little to be desired.  I tend to like my knife cut noodles in a spicier and more robust broth since the noodles are so doughy.  The duck was also dry and lacked flavour. Hand pulled noodles with beef and tendon (la main) - I had the regular noodles (not the wide ones) and thought they were boggy and overcooked.  The tendon, on the other hand, was way undercooked and actually difficult to chew.  The broth, once again, was light but bland.  This is not one of the broths where I slurp down to the last drop. This is definitely a place where you come for the noodles themselves and not the broth or accompaniments.  I'm giving it 4 stars despite my lackluster description above because the texture of the knife cut noodles was spot on and also because I admire businesses who try to carry on the tradition of making noodles the old fashioned way.  At $5 to $6 per person for a bowel of noodles, how can one possibly go wrong?
