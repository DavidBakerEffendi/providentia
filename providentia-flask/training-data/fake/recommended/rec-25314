Loved this place! For a year, I went to school at the Jean Madeline across the street, making this coffee shop mighty convenient. I fell in love with the fact that they have tables and chairs in front of the window. There have been multiple occasions that I have studied for a test and people watched (totally not creepy at all!) I fell in love with their bagels too! However, their coffee is just okay. It gets you through the day but isn't something you crave on a regular basis. I do agree with some helpers about the customer service. However, it really is dependent on who is working that day. For example, there is one woman there (tall, long brown hair) that is very nice. I would recommend this place to anyone that is in a rush for a quick breakfast or for a quick study session.
