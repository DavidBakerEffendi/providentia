I went at 6:30p whch is still before the usual NYC 7:30p dinner peak & was seated within 10 minutes though there's almost always a wait which I suspect is something they purposefully engineered Shake Shack-style to generate priceless buzz. Nonetheless, to keep it brief as 2980+ other reviews have already reviewed this place to death, Ippudo deserves a full 5-stars as its consistently & repeatedly delivering perfect, perfect, perfect ramen no matter the dish is true to the high esteem and art which the Japanese give ramen. And I mean real ramen, not the instant stuff which is nowhere near this place's high art. I forget which appetizer I got but despite having eaten at countless Japanese restaurants, the quality here makes it particularly memorable, all at a normal price point. Need you know more? Go!
