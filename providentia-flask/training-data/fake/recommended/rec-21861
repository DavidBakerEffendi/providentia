I came to this amazing restaurant because of the reviews my fellow yelpers have given this place and they were not wrong.  This was one of the best meals I have had in a long time. First, its a small restaurant with fantastic music.  The people who work there are very nice, efficient, answer questions, and the chef's wife (owner I assume) and the chef come around to talk and check on everything. My husband and I started with the steak tartare app and the pickled mussels.  I have to say, the mussels were a surprise.  They were served in a jar with homemade butter and little pieces of bread...amazing!!  I have never had mussels this way but I will be back to have them this way again.  The steak tartare was perfect, presented with a cracked egg with the yolk in it to mix in, tremendous. Next, my husband had the ribs and I had the scallops.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and the ribs were some of the best ribs we have ever had.  We ordered a side of hand cut fries which were again amazing but served with three homemade sauces.  My too favorite were the plum ketchup and the bacon something...let's call it bacon delicisioness (however you would spell that). We finished this off with a bread pudding that had a small scoop of vanilla ice cream and a slight orange marmalade in it.   The total bill was around $160 with tip and drinks, a little pricey but I would pay it again! Overall this is such a nice addition to the slope and desperately needed.  You have to try this place, believe me you won't regret it.
