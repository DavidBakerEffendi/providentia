Only complaint would be the size. The bathroom is right behind you if you are sitting along the front of the bar. Definitely an architectural fail. So imagine people waiting for the bathroom, while the waitress is also trying to pass... A lot of "excuse mes" and "sorrys" or a lack of which can cause an unannounced tension. Other than that. The drinks are good and the food is always fresh. I normally get the catfish bites which are always super hot and the steam pours out, so be careful not to burn your tongue. I don't really order the veggies here but I could see why people would say it's bland. When I have had them, they've tasted more like Whole Foods buffet, no soul. Â  I've always had great service. The is a thick, tattooed, short haired female bartender, she makes the best drinks. My tip would be just avoid the weekends if you are hungry.
