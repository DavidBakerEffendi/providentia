The food at Hu is great. It's healthy, it tastes good, and it's presented nicely. The only reason I held back on giving the fifth star is because I feel like Hu is severely over priced. There is no reason they should be charging more than Starbucks for a cup of coffee, and when you really think about it, a lot of what they serve should actually be cheaper than most comparable places.. In short: I loved the food, loved the ambiance, hated the pricing. If you have the cash to drop, go for it.
