The first time I came here a few years ago, I thought it was the bomb. My sis-in-law and I ate a whole large pizza. This time I didn't think it was as great. FOOD: We had the large with mushrooms. The crust was awesome, but the sauce and cheese didn't taste as good as I remembered from before. The bread sticks were not worth it. It looked better than it tasted. The house salad was plenty but ok.
