Initially food was fresh and hot and delivery was timely. However my last three orders have been subpar and the delivery time has become increasingly longer. Tonight's delivery confirmed for me that chop chop needs to be cut off. The salmon was burnt and the mash potatoes were cold and of a weird consistency. Delivery waiy time was 1.5 hours and though i reported to chop chop that this has been the norm recently the person over the phone was pretty indifferent. Definitely not worth it especially in light of the prices.
