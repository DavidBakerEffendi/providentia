This was our second time going to Pio Pio.  We had first visited the one on the UES, and found the food to be blah and the service inattentive.   We had a group in town who wanted to try it, so we decided to give Pio Pio a second chance. This time we hit the Pio Pio in Hells Kitchen.  The night did not start off auspiciously.  The table, which was covered by a brown paper tablecloth, was broken.  When I put my glass down, it spilled all over me.  The staff did respond quickly but explained away the broken table, informing us that the tables would all be replaced in two weeks.   The food itself was bland and dried out.  The chicken was at about the same level as any rotisserie chicken from Gristedes, and most of the sides were boring and needed a lot of sauce to have any flavor.  The one highlight was the beef fried rice.   After asking twice for the check at the end of the night, we were not surprised to learn that the restaurant had made no concessions for the fact that I had been covered in cranberry juice to start the night (due to their broken table).   We will not be back.  As I said, if you crave chicken, grab one off the shelf at Food Emporium and you will be guaranteed a better evening.
