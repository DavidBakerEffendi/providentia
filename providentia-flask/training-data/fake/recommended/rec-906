After searching for great Italian food on yelp we found Dante and Luigi's. There are many good restaurants in the area but when we read  another yelp review that said a mob hit had taken place at this restaurant a decade earlier,we are we decided to try it out. To start The decor is lovely,elegant and cozy. Lots of old world charm and history in the restaurant. The staff was friendly and attentive.  Most important however, is the food  and it did not disappoint!!! I had the Seafood Cioppino which tasted amazing and the presentation was beautiful, my husband had the Broccoli Rabe. Which he said tasted just like the way his Italian mama makes it. The prices were also very reasonable and you get a 5% discount if you pay in cash.  We would highly recommend  checking this  restaurant out.
