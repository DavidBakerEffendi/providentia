Marcus perhaps you should spend less time on TV and more at your restaurants.  Had dinner on Friday night at around 8pm; the fact the place was empty should have tipped us off.    I don't mind bad service when the food is great and the place is packed however neither was the case for me, bad service whilst the wait staff sat at the bar. The food was Ehhh!  I had the gnocchi which was supposed to be in a brow butter sage sauce, they must have run out of that sauce and used some oily-lemon sauce..it was like the sauce on flounder at the early bird special at a retirement community... NOT GOOD.   The atmosphere is good,  if you can spend some time and correct the food and the service it would be packed.
