FINALLY!!! I finally have an Indian restaurant in Bergen/Essex county area which I can recommend.  The menu items are pretty typical.  However, they are able to make food spicy and yet tasty (its difficult to get both).  The channa is great, bhindi nice and crispy, and overall great food. For people who are new to indian food the buffet is good.  The food is def on the mild side but has good variety and quality.   The restaurant is simple and low key, but has always had excellent service.  Also an added perk is that they have free low delivery.
