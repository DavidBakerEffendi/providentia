Andrea S.'s review suggests that NYC doesnt have their Thai food act together.  I don't disagree.  When I recall fiery beef penang and savory chicken basil I remember Jaya in Queens some twenty years ago, or Rain in the UWS which unfortunately closed a few years back. But Sripraphai is worth the visit if you're craving authentic (or closest to it in NYC) Thai food - but only the food.  Don't expect decor, or fast seating, or superb service.
