This is my comfort food in Philly. Thousand layer bread is possibly the best thing ever and the jungle chicken is well worth the hour drive for. The service is very friendly, it is always spotless and the owner makes it a point to give a very warm welcome to regulars. I moved away for a few years and thought often and fondly of Rangoon.
