Food is pretty good, although overpriced, of the locally-sourced variety.  Highly recommended chicken dish was passable but not outstanding.  Server was very pleasant, however, this dinner was thoroughly ruined by the poor attitude of the host (who, as an aside, was wearing, I assume ironically, a top hat) (hereinafter "Monopoly guy") as well as the manager.  Our party arrived admittedly slightly late for our reservation (due to rain it was difficult to get a cab), but within the 20 minute grace-period of which we were informed when making our reservation.  Monopoly guy was immediately hostile while showing us to a very cramped table.  We discovered another member of our party could make our dinner after we were seated and had ordered our appetizers.  We informed the waitress of this as soon as we found out, and of course ordered his entree with the rest of ours (I'll emphasize that his arrival therefore imposed NO delay nor used more of their precious space...we simply squeezed another chair into our already cramped table, inconveniencing only ourselves).  When he arrived, Monopoly guy refused to let our friend join us at our table, at which point I asked to speak to the manager.  She stated that they only seat entire parties and that we should have informed them as soon as we realized our friend could make it (Dear haughty manager - we did, see my comment about ordering main courses above).  The manager said that she would "allow him to sit this time" (your generosity is overwhelming) but that next time, she would not take our reservation.  My reply?  Next time, we will not be eating at this restaurant.  A pledge I intend to stick to.
