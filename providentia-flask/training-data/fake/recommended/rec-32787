This is a very good and quite consistent restaurant in my opinion, although--just like the current political landscape--people tend to be very polarized about it; they either love it or they hate it. I myself enjoy the ambitious wine list (including usually a nice selection of "real" roses in the summer), the service, which always tends to be good in my opinion, and of course the fish, with each selection available with a variety of different presentations/sauces. Love the bread basket. No drowning the salads in dressing, which I hate. The portions aren't American-excess huge but they don't skimp either. No, a meal here is not cheap in any sense of the word, but in this case you are getting what you pay for. I've never had a bad experience at this restaurant, and we've been visiting it at least a couple of times a year since it opened.
