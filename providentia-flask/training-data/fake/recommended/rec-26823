We went there for new year's eve dinner.  Go early before 6 and you get fantastic service.  The peking duck was superb.  Every one of the other dishes we got were also great.  Our party have tried dishes in Shanghai, the best places in Hong Kong, Sydney, NYC, Flushing, San Francisco, Chicago Chinatown to Singapore so we think we provide a pretty solid frame of reference when we opined that this place is great for authentic asian dishes.  The quality is pretty high.  Prices are on the higher end but you pay for a good quality Asian meal at a nice restaurant. We had stir fried shrimp, pupu, cold noodles (appetizer), spicy scallops, and the traditional spicy beef that is not on the menu. Highly recommend this place but be prepared for spicy taste.  Ask for mild if you can't take spice so as not to spoil your meal and experience.
