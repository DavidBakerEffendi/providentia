A Philly Institution! Any place that puts a sign in the window that says "This is America, speak English!", is OK in my book.  If that offends you, too bad!!!!  That's what makes America great.  FREEDOM.  Thank a vet for that right by the way and rest in peace Joey Vento! OK, so now that the terrorists and europeans are all offended, lets get on to the purpose of this review, the cheese steak. As many of you know, Geno's and Pats have been bashing each others brains in on 9th and Wharton for many years.  Both have claims to fame.  So it comes down to the whole Ford Vs. Chevy debate...........which do you prefer??  The only way to figure it out is to have one from each joint. As a famous Bose commercial once stated....we don't make the music, we just make it sound better.  Well, Pat may have invented the cheese steak but Genos makes it better! Here's why i like Genos better.  First, the Amoroso roll.  Slightly crunchy. Second, the steak.  Not chopped in a million pieces.  Real thin slices.  Better flavor content and fat distribution in the steak.  When you chop it up like Pats you can get a whole mouthful of fat chunks.  No thanks.  By the way, when you eat a steak at home, do you slice it or grind it up like coffee grounds??  Exactly. Now that's the base of the sandwich.  This is where there are 8 million different variations.  If you want a true Philly steak, order it "wit" onions and whiz.  That's right.  Cheese whiz.  I myself was an onions and provolone guy for years until I met Joey.  He asked me if i ever had it with whiz.  Guess what?  I will never have it with anything else since Ive had whiz! I wont rate Pat's because its not bad.  Genos is just way better.  Plus its in a way better neighborhood than Pats!  LOL!!! (they are across the street from each other)
