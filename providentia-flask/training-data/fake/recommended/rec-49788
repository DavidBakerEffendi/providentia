minus one star cuz i haven't tried anything other than their VIP sandwich and a meat arancini (and i only tried this to hit the 20$ minimum for delivery), and sweet god, $16 for a sandwich?! but, outrage at pricing being stated and stowed away, the VIP sandwich is literally the perfect sandwich. layers of paper thin, melt in your mouth, fatty, delicious prosciutto di parma layered with freshly made mozzarella, all on chewy, fresh, crusty bread with fig compote and lettuce and tomato... holy cow. this sandwich is consistently amazing, and due to the high quality of the ingredients, i can totally justify eating this for lunch at least once a month. also it's so damn big i can eat half with my arancini and save the other half for lunch (or breakfast.. yeah i just ate the other half for breakfast... judge me) the next day. the arancini is also delicious, cheesy, perfectly breaded, and just super yummy. but don't get me wrong. the sandwich is the star. if you hate the combination of sweet and savory in foods you might not like this. BUT if you're anything like me and know that salty + sweet = orgasmic... then you need to introduce this sandwich to your facehole, and stat. do yourself a favor. try the VIP. you won't be mad about it, srsly.
