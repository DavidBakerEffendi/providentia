Arrived just on lunch time, and it's already a long line outside the restaurant. The atmosphere is great with dark light, while it's just a little noisy maybe because so many people in it. I ordered the cheeseburger with french fries, medium-rare, the burger is amazing, juicy, tender, with rich cheese. However the fries are so "shoestring", I would prefer some normal size ones, tiny fries just can't satisfy me, and you have to grab a bunch everytime you eat. My friend ordered a thai chicken salad with noodle, seems pretty nice, and he says he loves it. It's really a popular place, I can tell.
