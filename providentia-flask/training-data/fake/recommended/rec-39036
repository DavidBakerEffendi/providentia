Delicious! Short wait, courteous, classy and professional staff. Love the burger. My temperature was wrong as I asked for MR and my friend ordered Med and we both received Med even after I verified the temperature with the food expeditor. Despite the wrong burger temp, it was delicious. The beignets were delicious too!
