I used to really love this place...like. REALLY love it.  It was my favorite place for breakfast.  Recently, the quality of the food has been on the decline.  We walked in and were promptly greeted and seated. Our waitress quickly came to our table and took our drink orders. My husband ordered five pancakes, ham, and eggs. I ordered a waffle and hot chocolate. My husbands plate came out with two hard pancakes and my waffle was not good at all. My hot chocolate was watered down. Our waitress truly was nice but because of the quality of the food, I will not be returning here.
