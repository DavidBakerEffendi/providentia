Easily some of the best pizza out there.  Prices are very reasonable and worth it. The wings and fried calamari are some of the best you will ever eat.  Every since I moved to jersey, i've missed this place so much.   The pizza's sauce is really something special.  It's balanced with the cheese.  Add a perfect thin and crispy crust and that makes gold. The service can be a bit slow.  Come early on a saturday unless you want to wait an hour.   They don't have dessert here, but Ralph's italian ices are right across the street to finish your meal.  Best pizza on staten island
