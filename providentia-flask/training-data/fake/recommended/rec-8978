Not sure why people line up for these guys?? I ordered the chicken over rice & it's just mediocre shredded chicken and a ton of brown rice with some dry pita bread, nothing even remotely special. My neighborhood Halal spot makes much more flavorful chicken over rice & I get veggies with it to boot. I wouldn't even consider going back to the Halal Guys unless it was 3am and I had no other options. And even then, I would probably save my $6.
