I love Greek food, but the places that I know take a long time prepping and expect for you to sit and stay for awhile. This is like a fast-food version. I tried the chicken here, it was a bit dry. The lemon potatoes were lacking in lemon flavor for my taste. However, the spinach-rice was sooo good! The beef/lamb gyro did not disappoint either, but I would say you need to be in a particular mood for it. I was tired and hot, and didn't really love it. But I saved it for the morning when I was awake and a little bit cold, and it was delicious. I would definitely go back to try out more of their items. Also, if you pay in cash and show them your work ID, or go in with your work uniform, they give you 10% off.
