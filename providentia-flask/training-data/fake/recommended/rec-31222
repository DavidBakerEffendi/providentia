Let me start by saying I'm hard to please when it comes to Thai food being that I'm part Thai.  We arrived at 8pm and it was packed.  Wait was only 10 minutes which isn't bad.  They take reservations which I will do next time I'm in the city as this will be  my new thai spot.  I previously have gone to yum yum across the street but was not impress with their food one bit. On the brighter note the decor of this place is really nice.  My girlfriend and I started with two tea ice tea which was perfectly made.  Not bitter and not too sweet.  For appetizer we got the fresh shrimp roll.  I'm not a peanut sauce fan at all, but I gave their sauce a try and it was perfect.  Not an overwhelming peanut taste but just right. My girlfriend had the chicken panang and I decided to try the pork and shrimp vermicelli.  Hands down panang tasted just like how my mom makes it which I have never found a Thai spot even in Southern California that made it as good as they did here.  My girlfriend liked it a lot too as she emptied the bowl.  My vermicelli was good being that it is not really a thai dish, it's a Vietnamese dish.  Could use a little more fish sauce but it was good.  Our waiter was attentive and we got in an out within an hour for being a full house.  This was a plus.  I will definitely be coming back.
