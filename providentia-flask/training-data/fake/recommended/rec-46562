So when I was thinking about how to rate this place, I was trying to figure out if I would give it four stars or five stars. I usually don't like to just throw out a five star review for no reason, so I really thought about it. The conclusion I came to was: yes, five stars, definitely. We started out with edamame, salmon and Spanish mackerel sashimi. The edamame, a tad above average. The salmon, extremely smooth, great consistency, dead on fantastic taste. The Spanish mackerel, that's where I lost it. I wasn't expecting it at all. It was smoky, not at all salty or fishy. It, like the salmon, melted away as you ate it. We've gotten sashimi from a lot of places, and this was right up there with the best we've ever had. We had six people in our party, and we all ordered two rolls. We figured the best way to sample what they have is to order a few each and then trade pieces. Most of us ordered their specialty rolls, which were all fantastic and included things we've rarely seen before, like a roll that had shallots and yuzu vinaigrette. The few less extravagant rolls we ordered were good though too. There wasn't one roll I didn't like. I can't remember what others got, but I specifically ordered, the Volcano Roll ("deep fried" roll, i.e., tempura'd) and the Green River Roll which I remember featured plum paste. All absolutely delicious. To drink they had beers as well as carafes of warm and chilled sake, most of which are fairly reasonably-priced, even for something really good like a junmai daiginjo (we got the "diamond sake"). The space itself is absolutely beautiful. Dark wood throughout, it opens up in the back Â to high ceilings with intimate lighting. There's upstairs seating as well, and I imagine this place can pack in quite a few people at its busiest. Overall this place left six people very, very satisfied. I would never hesitate to go here again.
