Fine dining comes to Fairmount. I must admit, I was somewhat expecting a super pretentious place given the culinary point of view of this place: all organic, local, blah blah blah. I appreciate that stuff but I generally associate it with experiences like the first episode of Portlandia... "the chicken's name was Colin, here are his papers". With that being said, I couldn't have been more off-base. We sat outside and enjoyed a lovely Friday evening meal that was all vegetarian. And a word about that: with the exception of Belgian Cafe and Mugshots, there is no vegetarian food in the neighborhood. But I digress... The plates we had were awesome: the cashew cheese, pink peppercorn salad; the baby artichokes; and the bbq seitan. Nut cheeses are awesome. The cashew cheese at Fare is a perfect example. It was slightly salty, very creamy, and perfectly seasoned with crushed pink peppercorns. It came with sprouts and oranges. Delicious. The artichokes were nice because they were savory and slightly garlicy with whole cloves of roasted garlic. A nice balance to the sweet salad. Finally, the seitan was insanely good. How do you get burnt ends like on a beef brisket on wheat gluten? Well they figured it out. It was so good! and the spicy sauce was a nice touch, I just wish there was more of it. Washed down with a half liter of Argentinian white wine was great. And that wine held up to the spicy bbq and the garlic in the artichokes. Good addition to a neighborhood that already holds its own in the restaurant landscape.
