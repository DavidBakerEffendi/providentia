A Philly landmark. Ok I eat at Pat's and Geno's now what? Well now you can have a good cheese steak. You've been through WHIZ, was treated like crap, and learned what "with" means. You're ready! Clearly better the Geno's which means.... you guessed it, nothing!! If your a Philly native you can name about 5 better cheese steak places at a moments notice. You also know that you have to take your friends from out of town here. Â  When I think of pat's and Geno's, I think of the rocky statue down by the art museum. Sweet we got our pictures with rocky!! Now can we go in the actual museum?
