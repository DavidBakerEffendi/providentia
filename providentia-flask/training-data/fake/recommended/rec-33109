My friends brought me here for my birthday. Though I chose the restaurant. Tehe. I got the stuffed sole. It was delicious but the flavor gets a little dull and you feel like you need something a little different. The texture was soft throughout. The outside fish and the crab were both soft and after some time a little mushy. The portion is huge. I think it's best to split this along with another dish (with different spices and more tough texture) with someone. It would be great with a salad and adding lemon really helped it. I also found bones in my second fillet and that ruined it. I kept finding bones in my mouth n my bite would just become this struggle to not swallow them. I did swallow one. I really enjoyed my meal, so I didn't want to make a big deal but I told the waiter at the end and his response was that fillets always have a few bones. What? How is it a fillet then? My friend ordered the greek shrimp or something n it tasted great and the shrimp were cooked perfectly. They were still firm and tasted fresh. I left with a full stomach and I give this place a 4 for its ambiance and quality of produce. The price is great as well! Definitely worth it and I'm definitely going again! Maybe scallops next time?!
