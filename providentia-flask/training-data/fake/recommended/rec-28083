Had the brunch $16 great value.  Ambience and quality of ingredients are top notch here.  Service was amazing, server was polite and unobtrusive.  Had the steak skillet.  Definitely big enough to share.  Steak, potatoes, peppers and cheese in a cast iron skillet with two poached eggs on top.  Very generous serving, but some of the steak was a little too chewy/overcooked.  Seems as though they make the skillet the night before, pop it in the oven and poach two eggs for the top before you order.  Twice cooking killed the steak a little.  I still love this place, great spot for a date, brunch, and awesome wine/beer/cider list.  I usually order the butternut squash ravioli, but I was in the mood for eggs.  Will be back.
