I really wanted to give this place a higher rating... it's a tiny (and I mean tiny!), unbelievably cute place. We didn't make reservations but were seated within 10 mins on a Saturday night anyway. I think this place really makes an effort with their food. Unfortunately, however, they sort of miss the mark on a few of the dishes. Nevertheless, the experience is what bumped my review from a three star to a four. I love the hole in the wall feel, friendly servers, and coziness. Give it a try! It's a worthwhile experience even if your taste buds aren't completely wowed.
