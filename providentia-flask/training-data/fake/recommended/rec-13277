I love watching that guy in the back room create those tasty hand pulled noodles almost as much as I love eating them!  Seriously - the hand pulled noodles in beef broth is wonderful (I don't actually care for the beef pieces themselves and generally just eat the noodles).  I also wasn't a huge fan of the fried pork dumplings... I think the dumpling wrapper was just a little too thick for my tastes.  But the hand pulled noodles are indeed tasty!!
