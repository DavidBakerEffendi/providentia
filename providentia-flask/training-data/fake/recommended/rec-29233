Pats definitely makes the best cheesesteaks in Philly. I just don't know if I can go there anymore. The fries are 4.00 (up from 3.50 last time I went) and the cheesesteaks are 9.00 (up from 7.50 when I first started going). It is definitely not worth the price but the cheesesteaks are still amazing and I still try to go every few months.
