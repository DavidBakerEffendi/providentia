New to New York and was given this recommendation from a local broker. I'm glad we went, by far the tastiest pizza I've ever had in my opinion. Now with that taste there are some drawbacks, so let me give you the heads up. They open at 6:00 but you can put your name in starting at 5:30. You can call ahead and it is no different than walking right up. So get there early or call ahead. If it is already 6:00 expect an hour or two wait. The restaurant seats maybe 20 people max. They sell by the pie, which will run you $24.00. They offer it plain or with garlic and basil for the same price. From there you look at daily toppings from $2.00-$8.00 per topping. So unless you are up for bringing the bill up the garlic and basil is amazing. The basil is clean and fresh, the garlic is fine and just the right amount to pump the flavor without being overpowering. So, go and enjoy a pizza. Call ahead, and enjoy the awesome.
