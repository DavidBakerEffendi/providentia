Again, this is case where reading yelp reviews made my expectations much too high. We ordered the house special soup noodle, house special pan fried noodle, and pan fried dumplings. I respect the fact that the noodles were slapped and pulled in preparation for the order, but the broth and toppings were severely lacking flavor to the point of blandness. The texture of the noodle was good however; a pleasant chewy consistency. As for the pan fried dumplings, no complaints there.
