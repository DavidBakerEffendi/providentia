The port ribs were dry, tough and stuck to the bone. They didn't have any BBQ sauce. I'm not sure if they are supposed to or not. They tasted salty but not bad. I heard this place was good but I found it hard to eat these ribs. I was very disappointed based on the reviews I've read and heard about.
