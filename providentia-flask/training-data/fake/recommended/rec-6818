Came to Manninos with a large, family party after we had just finished a wedding rehearsal. It was a six minute drive from the trenton cathedral so it was perfect for everyone coming from all over the place. As far As the food I would probably give this plave 3.5 stars, the plain and peperoni pizza were delicious, the everything looked good, but the white pizza was drenched in oil and hard to enjoy. Their wings were pretty good but didn't come tossed in sauce and im not a fan of that! As far as service I might give them 2.5 .... yes, we came in a large, loud (colombian) party and were grateful they could accomodate us, but telling us to keep our voices down because we are too loud is just wrong.  Also, they were incredibly slow to understand that wine bottles on the table require some glasses and we had to continue to ask them for some,  and water was a bit difficult to come by, napkins were like a forbidden pleasure, I had to steal off of other tables. I wish they would have been a little friendlier as a whole (with the exception of one very friendly waitress) because, while a bit louder than the senior citizens sitting in the corner, nobody was rambunctious, nobody was breaking their property, and they werent giving food away for free.  My friend was a paying customer, with a lot of food to order!
