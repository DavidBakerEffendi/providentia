My in-laws live next to this place.  I always wanted to go.  I just went starting a few months back.  I've eaten there at least 4-5 times since.  I seem to always want their pizza when visiting the in-laws.  Great ratio traditional pizza and specialty pizzas.  Family owned and operated.  Super clean.  They got Tartufo for dessert FYI. I dont have to ask for them to keep it in a few minutes longer cuz it comes out just perfect with a hint of crisposity.  My go - to for pizza in Rutherford and there's a few good pizza spots in those parts for sure.  Good. Fresh. Pizza. Great Specialty Slices Selection. Lots of tables and a TV.
