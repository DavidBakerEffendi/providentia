I almost feel as if this doesn't need to be said but cosmis has given me so many good sandwiches that two minutes to write a review is the least i can do. I moved to philly a few years ago never having experienced the cheesesteak, luckily I was told early on theres no point in even trying the horse meat served from the neon glowing establishments on 9th street, still it took a while to discover this place but once I did, I never turned back, they still have the best cheesesteak in my opinion and every time i go home to new york i bring sandwiches for my entire family from cosmis, and they can't get enough of them. my order is a regular whiz with bacon or chicken cutlet with fresh mozz and pesto, my boyfriend says their south philly italian is the best sandwich around. i will always get my cheesesteaks from cosmis even when i no longer live 2 blocks away
