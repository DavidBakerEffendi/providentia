Went today Sunday March 16 2014 after waiting an hour or more the hostess was extremely rude but our Waite staff was very pleasant and helpful we've had the same waitress wait on us before and she was still very pleasant  Patrons are waiting sometimes for hours and the hostesses are the ones with the attitudes?? Don't understand that one.. maybe they should to a job that doesn't evolve people?? These days diners have thousands of other places to spend their money. We cant forget   how fast things can turn around for a business... In A new York Minute! SO i order the banana cream pie to go and the only thing I find in the container when I get home is cream no custard and just a few brown bananas!!!! Wow how awful... it was  worthy for the trash and totally waste for money. Like most business they never respond to reviews or emails and that's typical because they just think they are beyond it all and that's OK. My party of 6 will never go back and I will let everyone I know not to brother. If I could download a photo of this pie and send it you will get a good laugh out it it!! I can show you how to make a light and flaky crust and think custard that will hold up not just milk away into nothing. The bacon very undercooked I think they just rush everything along to push more tables through. One other thing all the food came out cold.
