This place is great! I've lived in Philly for 8 years and have yet to find a pizzeria that I was amazed by. Never hearing of Francoluigi's I moved to the neighborhood and now pretty much live over the place. Lucky. I have yet to try the dinning room, but the take out is friendly & the food is beyond good. Best Pizza in Philly thus far. Coming home after work the entire block is filled with the irresistible aroma of baking bread and delicious pizza.
