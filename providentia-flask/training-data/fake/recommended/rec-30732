This place is amazing. As soon as you walk in, the atmosphere and staff are so welcoming and friendly. Â The people, food, and atmosphere feel so authentic. When asking the chef for a recommendation, he told us he couldn't recommend anything because everything is SO good. Boy, was he right! The flavors are so rich and multi-dimensional. My fav is the Rigatoni with prosciutto. Perfect amount, perfect flavors. And the house wine is even amaze-balls. I'm telling you, if you want simple affordable ($11-$15) authentic italian food with a welcoming atmosphere...this is your spot.
