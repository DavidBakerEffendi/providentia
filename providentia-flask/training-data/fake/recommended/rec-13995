After seeing the "Throwdown w/ Bobby Flay", I just had to try the blueberry pancakes here! Boy did it feel right! The pancakes are fluffy and LOADED w/ blueberries! The maple butter syrup is amazing as well. My g/f had the banana walnut pancakes which were just as delicious. The service was overall pleasant and speedy, however, be prepared for a minimum 30min wait! We arrived a Thursday morning around 10 am thinking there'd be no line and were we wrong! While you wait, there's a little italian place across the street where yo can get a nice capuccino or tea. Will definitely be coming back for more pancakes!
