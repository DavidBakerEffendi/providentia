The food was great! Fresh! I mean it even looked fresh and surely healthy.  This spot has indoor and outdoor seating.  Walking up, I really didn't want to sit outside and it looked packed inside, but they have a rear area that is lovely, I mean I really liked the ambience.  The art on the walls was not only amazing but it's for sale.   The food was delish and inside of homefries that I usually get with an omelet, I got roasted potatoes.  The omelet comes with 2 fillings, which usually at other places I would have to pay for more than one filling.  The food came fast, the service was excellent and it's in a nice spot.
