New Moon has become part of my lifestyle, though it's only a couple of years old. The sheer spaciousness makes it unlike any other eating-place in Burlington. You can relax, read a book or cruise the Internet and never feel rushed or crowded, even when the caf√© is full. You can answer your cell phone, and no one freaks out. The food is fresh and wonderful, everything homemade. Ingredients tend to be local and organic. No hormones or antibiotics in the grilled chicken. And my friends from abroad have commented on the authentic European character of the coffee. My favorite menu items are organic Irish oatmeal or Kalhua-dipped French toast for breakfast, and for lunch the so-called "small" but actually huge Omega salad with spinach and salmon. Soups change daily, and I especially love White Bean Florentine. The sweet treats are to die for. Weak-willed dieters should avert their eyes and order a custom salad. Sitting on a cushy sofa under the crystal chandelier at New Moon makes me feel chic and artistic, even when I'm inelegantly struggling with a juicy, oversized tomato basil mozzarella sandwich. The crowd is fashionably eclectic: students, teachers, artists, politicos, executives with briefcases and young mothers with babies. We bring our two-year-old grandson here without fear. We can walk him around when he gets antsy without disturbing anyone, there's that much space. The children's menu is excellent, though our toddler prefers to share our food, particularly if it's quiche or The Purple One (a fabulous smoothie).
