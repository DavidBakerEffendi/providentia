As Rachel said, we had a great visit the other day. The antipasto platter (so good!) was perfect to split Â and the waiters were attentive but not hovering. Though we split crostinis this most recent trip (omgz ricotta and honey) I've been here before and can now honestly tell you that nothing sucks here. Seriously. Order everything and anything. While visiting for dinner a few months ago I got the meatloaf panini which was killer. Carmelized onions? Tomato jam? Perfectly cooked meatloaf on warm crunchy bread? Oh hells, yes. I nearly scarfed the entire thing down, but then I would've missed out on how good it was cold for lunch the next day. All the cheese is sourced from Murrays and the staff knows their selection of meats and cheeses really well. Ask them to help you put together a meat and cheese platter to split with the table- you won't regret it.
