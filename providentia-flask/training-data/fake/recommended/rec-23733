It's been a while since I've seen you, Nanzhou. Don't worry, I did not forget about you. Everytime I want some soup with noodles or filling asian food, I think of you. All I can think about is savoring those hand-stretched noodles that seem to never end as I slurp them up. Those noodles you've got are hard to catch with those chopsticks, which may be difficult for novices like me, but I hope I can learn. And I miss the soup that is warm and not overbearing. Such a great deal. Such a big bowl. Such a low price. I miss you, Nanzhou. Hopefully see you soon!
