Ordered the Italian style pulled pork with rabe and provolone cheese. I guess I was expecting more due to all the hype. It was an excellent sandwich, but surely not out of this world good. The pork was well-seasoned,succulent and juicy. The toppings were of high quality and fresh. The bread had perfect texture and sopped up all the juices without getting soggy. I can't honestly say it is a 5 star sandwich as all the media hype would lead one to believe. Also, for 10 bucks it is a bit over-priced. Service was fast and friendly. There is nothing wrong with the food here and is worth a visit.
