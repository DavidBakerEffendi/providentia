Seriously the best food I've had in NYC. Everything *looks* like the most amazing food ever. And tastes just as good. I'm not much of a pancake person ( more like waffle!), but omg these were phenomenal. The syrup was yummy, and so unique! There really isn't enough good adjectives to describe this place. I will be taking every friend or relative visiting NY there to experience it themselves. ps. We went on a Friday at 12:30 and had to wait about 20 minutes. I'd agree with everyone else: Go early, or on a weekday.
