Believe the hype but not for the reason that you might be thinking. The food here is great. Everything is fresh and the prices are reasonable. That alone wins three of the stars. What pushes it to four stars is the atmosphere. There are plenty of places that people go where they pay for atmosphere but what sets Bohemian apart is the quiet, relaxed and casual atmosphere. Its classy but not stuffy. Its quiet but not in a prohibitive way. You'd be hard pressed to find this kind of relaxed atmosphere in New York but here it is. This is why, I think, despite a limited menu compared to other Japanese restaurants in Manhattan, that Bohemian continues to get five stars on Yelp. What pushes Bohemian to five stars for me is the secret exclusive factor. Sure it's not all that secret anymore but its not out of control. Its still exclusive to those who just know. And really, with only three locations worldwide (Japan, USA, Bali) one can't help but feel pretty cool. Definitely check it out and don't be shy on the menu. How often will you get the chance? I recommend their Foie Gras soba and their beef sliders. For dessert, their berry ice cream (vanilla ice cream surrounded by berries mixed in with mint jelly) and chocolate crème brulé. Tip: the waitress will ask you if you want water or sparkling water. Flat is free but if you get the sparkling they open a bottle  of San Pellegrino for you. That adds about $15 or $18, I don't remember exactly which, without warning.
