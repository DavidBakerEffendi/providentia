Stopped in here a few times. Probably won't return, but you never know.  I think they lure me in with the beer.  The burger itself is kind of boring.  The meat tastes bland, as well as the cheese, and I'd like more choices in toppings.  Roll looks like a Martin's Potato Roll, which is a plus; but not enough to save this one.   The crinkle cut fries are also pretty bland and boring.  They look like they work well with their cheese sauce, but I'm not a fan of cheese fries.  They seem almost identical to satisfries at BK to me, and I haven't heard anyone screaming from the top of the hills about satisfries. Staring out the window at Village Whiskey, you also kind of feel silly chewing on this burger.  It's supposed to be a step above fast food joints, but it only is in price.  There are plenty of better options around for a fast food burger: Square Burger, 500 Degrees, Smashburger, Five Guys, etc.  That's just off the top of my head.  This place is a let down.
