My wife, daughter, daughter's friend, and I again traveled to the Flynn to see the musical Memphis and had a pre-show dinner at Church and Main. We were late for our reserved time, but the staff was very accommodating and we were seated immediately. Our server was knowledgeable and attentive and our meals were served promptly. The space is intimate and the food was tasty and well-presented. As we were leaving the noise level was headed toward loud and the tables are a little close together, but altogether a very satisfying experience. This was our second visit to C&M and we will be returning, I'm sure.
