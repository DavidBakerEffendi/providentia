Holy Cow! What an unbelievable  dining experience. We were a table of seven which enabled us to sample most of the menu.  The combination of flavors and the way they popped out was amazing.  The deserts were killer,OMG. Our waitress was great and very knowledgeable.  She was able to describe each dish and knew all the ingredients.  The service was attentive and we were not  at all rushed.   The decor was new, clean , crisp and stylish.  I loved the dragon scooter. The outside patio area was an added plus and very comfortable. I can't wait to go back.
