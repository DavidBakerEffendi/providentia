The reviews here seem to sum up the place very well so I'll keep it short... Decor - The high ceilings and dim lights give this place a comfy slash modern feel.  Great for small dinner groups (4) and dates.   Food - ding ding, we have a winner.  My girlfriends and I shared a bunch of small plates (I recommend this so you can taste everything).  They do great Mediterranean classics, you must try the hummus! Next time - I'm ordering dessert
