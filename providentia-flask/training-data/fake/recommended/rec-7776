I came here for brunch with a friend and her little daughter.  We chose to sit away from the entrance despite it being a wonderful day b/c they were blasting music from speakers near the open windows.  Which was too bad. I had the corned beef hash with eggs benedict.  Even though we arrived around 10am and they had already been open a few hours, they didnt have the hollandaise sauce for the eggs.  Which is a sign that they were not ready for their customers but also might mean that they make their hollandaise from scratch every day instead of letting it sit and provide a warm cozy home for bowel disturbing bacteria.   Either way, the corned beef hash was very good and the eggs were perfectly poached.  The coffee was more of your standard weak American coffee, nothing special.   The service was perfectly good.
