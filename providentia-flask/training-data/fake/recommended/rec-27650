Another one of my all time favs. Amazing food, decor and ambiance. The mac and cheese and spinach artichoke dip delic! Beautiful but packed! Sometimes you can squeeze at the bar. Great Brunch also! And pretty friendly staff. Great for meat eaters but being a vegi I'm still able to go back all the time......
