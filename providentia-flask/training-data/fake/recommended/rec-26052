This place is one of those cute tucked away cozy places that you might miss if you were passing by quickly and not looking for it. The space is nice and the back room is super sun soaked during brunch hours, so thumbs up for the atmosphere..and the friendly service at well. Our brunch entrees were also really good. I had the duck mole and my partner had the Huevos Banados and I recommend either. Side dishes were also good (potatoes and cheese grits in our case). If you want to drink with your brunch, the pre-fix with $1 additional drinks is a good deal too! I'd go for dinner or drinks next time i'm in the area.
