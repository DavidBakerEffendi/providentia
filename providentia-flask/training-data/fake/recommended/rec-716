We randomly stopped into this restaurant before we drove back to North Jersey yesterday afternoon.  It was a rainy afternoon so this was the first sushi restaurant we spotted in the area.  We are happy we found this gem. I had the Springfield and Philadelphia, my girlfriend had the Springfield/Spicy Salmon. All were excellent. Price was cheap and the food was great. What more can you ask for? Not to mention the staff was super friendly. The owner came over to chat with us once we were done eating which we thought was nice. It was our first time in Philly but we will definitely return to have sushi here. Keep up the great work.
