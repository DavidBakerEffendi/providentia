Came here for my birthday last week. To be honest, I really don't see the hype with this place. I've definitely tasted better sushi. The only thing I really enjoyed was the ambiance. Our food took almost 40 minutes to show up to our table... And I wouldn't call 6 pieces of sushi dinner. Definitely not coming back.
