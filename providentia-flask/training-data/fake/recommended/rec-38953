While vacationing in the New England area, I tried hard to find more "local" places, so we wouldn't have to resort to Micky D's for every meal.  Plus it adds to the fun of being able to try something new. Yay for Yelp for leading me to this bistro, tucked in the middle of downtown.   Hubby had the crispy steel cut oatmeal while I had the eggs benedict.  I'm normally not a fan of oatmeal, but the few bites I stole off his plate did not disappoint.  Totally changes oatmeal - it came out like a little biscut, crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside, one of these days I'm going to have to experiment with this at home.  My eggs benedict did not disappoint either - eggs were cooked just right, and all the flavors were well balanced, ask for it with the maple sausage! We also got a few things to go, as we had a couple hours of driving ahead of us while we headed over to NH.  The Mr. Limpett sandwich held pretty well - a tuna salad sandwich without the tuna :)  The pickled eggplant salad - not so much ... unless you're a fan of pickles.... which we're not really so I don't know what I was thinking, I think I only picked up on the roasted garlic part, which made it sound yummy. We had to wait about 30 mins, but it was worth it, service was efficient.  If you're in the area, definitely check it out.
