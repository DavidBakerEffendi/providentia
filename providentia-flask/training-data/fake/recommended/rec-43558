My biggest gripe these days is the lackluster service in this city.  Not always, but more often than it should be.  I have been in the restaurant business for thirteen ("sigh") years.  I'm all too familiar with catering to demanding customers, smiling when I don't want to, responding to questions when the answer seems so obvious, etc, but sometimes you just have to do it.  It's our job!  That being said, lately my  reviews weigh more heavily on the service I receive than how much I liked or disliked the food.   Okay, now that that's off my chest; The Castello Plan has fantastic, friendly, attentive service and a killer wine list.  I have not eaten here YET but will be back soon to do so.
