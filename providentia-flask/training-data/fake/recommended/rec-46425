I came here not really knowing what to expect, despite the enthusiasm from my co-diners. I shall list what I did know - Marc Forgione is a 'top chef', TriBeCa has many fabulous restaurants, and I admittedly am somewhat of a neophyte to the NYC food landscape. Nevertheless, my expectations were met and then some. The d√©cor was both rustic and modern. Little touches like the reclaimed cedar wood from a Massachusetts sawmill on the walls seemed to aim for authenticity and warmth. We began with our amuse-bouche, which consisted of some concoction of carrot juice and one, small delectable bagel filled with cream and vegetables. The consistency of the bagel was smooth, rich, and combined well with the carrot juice (at least, that's what I think it was - our waiter was coy and would not divulge any information). The crusted bread with lardo arrived next. I thought the rich, thick and meaty flavor of the spread was much akin to bone marrow I've eaten in the past, but this had an altogether different texture. Finally, we were treated to the Bell & Evans chicken under a brick, the delightfully named and seasonally appropriate dish I shared. This was more than enough for 2 people, as an aside. The potatoes were superbly done, and the pan drippings was a welcome touch that while often provided with one's meal, the not so subtle advertisement in the dishes name really whets ones desires. Would I return? Absolutely.
