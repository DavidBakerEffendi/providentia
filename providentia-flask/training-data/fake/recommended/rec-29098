Picnic has been very good to me so it's about time I did a review. This is, and has been for almost 4 years, my go-to coffee shop and fairly regular lunch spot. Extremely friendly service and exceptional freshly prepared food. Picnic is not just the name, it's sort of the ethos. Picnic baskets decorate the shop which is dominated by a large refrigerated case that houses the freshly prepared menu, which changes daily. Everything from hearty dinner entrees (grilled chicken, flank steak, meatloaf) with sides (mac+cheese, lasagna, fresh veggies) just to name a few of the rotating selections. Everyday there are three sandwiches and three salads and of course, always, the tuna or chicken salad. The prices are about right for the quality of the food - on par with what you would pay at Au Bon Pain or somewhere like that but heads and shoulders better. Picnic does catering as well - also highly recommended. (the cookies!!!) Definitely the place to grab lunch or dinner to go in University City.
