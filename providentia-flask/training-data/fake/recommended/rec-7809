This place is great, prices are very reasonable, gyros super tasting, salad was fresh and tasty. Â My kids claim the calamari was the best we had on our week long trip back east (and they were experts at this point) the Frappe - a cold coffee drink - is not to be missed, lunchtime - get the gyro pita sandwich thing its great, service can be a bit off but hey that can be the Greek way!
