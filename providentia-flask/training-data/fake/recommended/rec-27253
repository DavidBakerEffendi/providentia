This place is the WORST. I ordered the chicken tacos and a sprite to drink. The waitress brought out a cup that had half a can of sprite in it, and three tacos about half the size of a silver-dollar pankcake. They wrote the drink menu on the back of a piece of cardboard and they dont even have a sign outside that has the name of the place. Would NOT recommend coming to eat here. Overpriced, and over-rated.
