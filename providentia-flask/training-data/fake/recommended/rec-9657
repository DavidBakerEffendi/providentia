I ordered the green curry chicken $14 for lunch.  Very good.  The price was on par with other Thai restaurants that would be in a major city.  (I was visiting Philly). Customer service: amazing.  I was one of 2 tables there when I went around 2:30pm and the server came up to me only a few times - and waited until I did not have food in my mouth to come up to me to ask if I needed anything.  She also gave me tips on the city. Ambiance: relaxing and a chic layout in the restaurant.
