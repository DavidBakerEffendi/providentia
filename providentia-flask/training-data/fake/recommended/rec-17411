Penelope is a very charming little place that provides a great retreat from the busy NYC streets. Came here for lunch and it was pretty packed, but there was no wait. They seem to be busiest during the breakfast/brunch hours. The service was good -- straight-forward and fast. Their unlimited coffee or tea for $2 is an awesome deal, and the coffee is good. We started with the Mac n Cheese appetizer and that was honestly the least impressive thing we ate. It was pretty bland and needed salt, and the bread crumb topping was way too scarce. My lunch was the Veggie burger since we ate here on Good Friday and my mother-in-law threatened our lives if we had any meat. It was VERY tasty for a veggie burger, full of flavor and I loved the pesto-mayo that came on it. I got it with Brie cheese which is definitely the way to go. I chose to get a side salad instead of the french fries and that costs $1 extra which is kind of a bummer. My $11 burger turned into $15 after the sub side salad, cheese and added avocado. Still, I think the prices are pretty awesome for what you get (by NYC standards). Hubby got the FBLT (Fake Bacon). It was good, but they forgot the best part of the sandwich which was supposed to be the black-pepper balsamic mayo, so it was very dry and quite boring. However, the French Fries were awesome. We got a piece of Red Velvet for dessert and it was honestly pretty good. The icing was a bit too sweet, but the cake was moist. All in all, I would definitely come back again, maybe next time for breakfast!
