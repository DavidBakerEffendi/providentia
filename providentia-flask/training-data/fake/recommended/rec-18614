From my experience, the estimated wait times they give are way off.  Most recently I was told 2-2.5 hours but it was more like 30 minutes...which is the opposite of a problem except that they only give you ten minutes to get back and thinking we had a long time to wander, we could've easily missed it. The wings are amazing--you won't regret getting them.  Easily 5 stars.  I will trek here from the UWS to get them, that's how good they are.  Note that you can get the wings in their bar across the street with very little wait time. Before I knew that I should exclusively eat the wings here, I ordered, following a suggestion from the waiter, the khao soi.  It was SO BLAND.  I would give it one to zero stars.  Do not order it.  I don't know how they fail at such a standard dish, but it was inedible.
