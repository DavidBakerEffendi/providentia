Had a last minute lunch for 7 at Nicola's just yesterday. My dish (Veal San Remo) was amazing and most dishes for lunch were large enough to take something home (mine wasn't because I was starving and it was two smallish veal scallops). Very good reviews from everyone at the table - both on their dishes and also on the community bread basket. Bread is the good crusty semolina loaf, presliced. Just to give an indication of the popularity of this place - we got there at 12 and the parking lot was empty - easy in a plaza that has only 3 businesses and is built for more. By the time we left around 1 45, the restaurant was packed and so was the parking lot. The only issues I had was a) not being able to call the place at 11am (before their 11 30 opening time) to tell them it was going to be 7 of us - this turned out to be not a big deal since they have many tables for 6-8 people set and calling after they opened they assured me of that; and b) our original waitress stopped by one more time but this is a place where several servers will help a table out - not a bad thing necessarily but it made for multiple requests for an iced tea and silverware. This is a BYO and/but there's a liquor store that's slated to open next month right next door.
