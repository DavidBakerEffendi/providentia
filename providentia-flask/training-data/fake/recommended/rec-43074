Once upon a time, there were Three Little Piggys.  The Three Little Piggys were friends since junior high school when they used to covet Jon and Jordan Knight from NKOTB.  That's how they met.  They used to exchange Knight brother dating rumors from Bop and Tiger Beat magazines on the benches by the English building during Lunch time breaks. After high school, then college, then through their 20's...the Three Little Piggys still remained friends until they were all grown up.  But one thing about their bonding, their Friendship never changed...They all loved to eat.  Well.  Plentifully. Frequently. One day the Three Little Piggys went to this restaurant called Little Owl.  At Little Owl they ordered a meal fit for Three Little Piggys.  They grew more and more excited with each dish, and got the perfect amount of food so they wouldn't repeat their 'piggy' behavior at a fancy Batali restaurant they went to a couple nights before... Out of all the dishes they ordered, the only one they didn't like was the rhubarb dessert.  It was too tart.  It made them pinch their faces in pucker. They even had to ask for a second scoop of ice cream to help cut the too, too sour taste in their mouths. That was their only complaint... Everything else, all the other food - made them go, "Weee! Weee!  Weee!" gleefully all the way home...  And, they lived the rest of their happy days working, eating, playing, eating, laughing, and eating. The End.
