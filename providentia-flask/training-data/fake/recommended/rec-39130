I went there a few years ago and it was a cute spot for a very Brooklyn date. You are UBER close to the other daters but it is friendly and convivial. I do not remember what dishes we had, but that it was delicious I do....my date had a sweet tooth and ordered every dessert and I remember it was good as well. It was so close and friendly I DO remember that there was something we couldn't finish and we shared with the couple next to us. :) I don't live in Brooklyn, but if someone asked me to go there again I would.
