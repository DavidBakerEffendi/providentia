Dropped in after a night out in the city and looking for something to snack on so decided to give this place a shot after pulling it up on Yelp. I have never used these words before but the place was very charming. It has this cool laid back relaxed atmosphere to it, that doesn't feel like what I typically picture a coffee shop to be. The service is very friendly and the eats are pretty great. We ordered the Tira Misu cake and a slice of apple pie ala mode. The Tira Misu was very good though a lil heavy on the cocoa powder, the apple pie was delicious but the super light ice cream through me off a lil at first but I quickly got adjusted to the flavor. This is definitely the kinda place I can see spending an hour or so on a Sunday just reading a book, sipping on some coffee with cake. Kudos!
