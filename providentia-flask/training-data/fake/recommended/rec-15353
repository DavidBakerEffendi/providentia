Officially one of my favorite places. You need to come here for brunch. I got the breakfast burrito which was great. the atmosphere is great too. they have many different kinds of UNLIMITED sangria. i am usually not a huge fan of sangria but all of the selections were sooo good. The berry one is the best. My only complaint is that they try to rush you out of there like crazy, i guess bc they have so many reservations. so eat very slowly. theyll come and try to take your plate every 5 minutes so say your not done.
