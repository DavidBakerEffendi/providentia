I was pleased to come across this truck not too long ago while running around New Haven on some errands. The quality is impeccable. Real butter, crusty bread, gourmet toppings, and 3 types of CHEESE. It felt a little too rich for dining out of a "truck" and it was slightly awkward to eat on the go (avocado was falling out because the bread was so crusty) and the toppings were masked by the delicious (but slightly strong) cheese. I'd say save your money and opt for a "plain" grilled cheese for your first time. And as as much as I love avocado and bacon (which were on my sandwich), they could not compete with the delicious bread and cheese, and just got in the way.
