Best breakfast spot in Hartford.  HANDS DOWN.  This is what Franklin Ave dining is all about people.  A local neighborhood joint making great food in a clean and friendly environment.  The food is delicious, the prices are cheap, and the service is spot on.  The owners are working very hard to provide the diners a great experience and it shows.   C'mon fellow yelpers, we really need to support places like this or the world would just be a bunch of (insert your typical boring chain breakfast place here)!  So bring your hangover, grab a cup of coffee and a newspaper, order a meal, and enjoy the day.
