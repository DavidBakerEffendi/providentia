I go to school at Rider, and I searched Yelp for a nearby sushi place to have dinner at with my friends. Masa 8 was only 6 minutes away, so I thought why not! Like other reviews said, don't judge the book by it's cover. It looks pretty unassuming from the outside, but on the inside it has a great vibe. Dark browns, candle light, modern meets some antique asian decor along with a lounge feeling. It's small, but I liked the intimacy of it. The menu was decent, and the prices weren't horrible. I've had cheaper, but this was fine. The sushi was all yummy and to our expectations. It was served in a timely manner also. My complaint? Our server was curt, unhappy, and not friendly at all. She seemed like she absolutely did not want to be there, and I felt like I was bothering her whenever I needed something. She put a bit of a damper on the evening. I'll still come here again, but if I get the same waitress I'm making a complaint!
