Food was awesome, service was decent, price was reasonable. Oyster fans must come for the Red, White, and Blue special (best oyster deal in the city). The Lobster Mac & Cheese deserves its own Yelp review... it was that good. Yes, it is $19. Totally worth it. Better show up before 7p, place is tight and gets packed.
