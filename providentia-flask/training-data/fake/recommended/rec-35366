The atmosphere is good here with outdoor seating weather permitting, but with the hot summer heat, we prefer indoor air-conditioned comfort.  I did kill a flying insect flying next to a window and saw another.  Our waitress was friendly, informed us of their specials and suggested items on the menu.  There are vegetarian and vegan options.  We went with the vegan burgers for $8.25, add french fries for another $2.  They have a large selection of beers, but better inquiry the price before ordering if you don't see the price.  Fresh squeezed orange juice is $5.  Desserts are usually $6 or $7, we asked for the chocolate mousse but it had taken so long that we asked to cancel to dessert, it came anyways, complimentary of the house.  The bill arrive totaled $40, but when the charge slip was ran, the total was $87, the bill was corrected.
