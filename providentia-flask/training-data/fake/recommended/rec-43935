Not a great place for vegetarians. Most meals come with a cup of soup, but they don't have any vegetarian soups and don't substitute for salad. The veggie burger was the worst one I've ever had. Still edible, but barely. The waffle fries are good. The service was ok. There was a shift change in the middle of our meal that didn't get addressed by anyone, which was a bit strange. Other than that...big menu, lots of options, separate breakfast menu, fair prices, relatively clean, cool decor.
