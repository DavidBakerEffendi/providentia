I was so close to giving this one 5 stars, but they seemed to forget about us towards the end of the night, when we were trying to pay our check in time for our show... However, everything else was amazing!! Atmosphere: very fun modern Thai decorations with a huge chandelier in a glass case in the middle of the room. The restaurant is noisy, so not the easiest to hear across the table, but good for smaller conversations. Only complaint is that the stereo system for the restaurant must be wired with only one control bc it was blasting in the bathroom. Seriously, so loud. Service: the hostess was a doll, as there was a miscommunication with our resi and she still slipped us in, no problemo. Our waitress was good throughout, but went MIA as we finished up our dessert. We had to ask several other waiters to help us find her so that we could pay the check and make it to our broadway show in time. Food: delicious! Starter: sesame crusted tofu - eh, okay Entrees: room service pad Thai - delicious! Made with vermicelli noodles and serves inside a thin egg. Major style points. Highly recommend! Regular pad Thai - good, but room service was better Pork chops - favorite of the whole table! Not to mention comes with 3 pork chops, 3!! Spicy basil noodles - perfect. Absolutely perfect! I was basically licking my plate... Spicy squid ink spaghetti - dad loved it, but I wasn't that impressed. Tastes pretty ordinary Pad-noh-mai - supposed to be extremely spicy and would not be altered for Americans taste, but I didn't think it was that spicy at all. This one was just okay. Dessert Thai iced tea ice cream - genius! Whoever thought of this, thank you Cheese cake - ordinary and pretty small portion Overall, this is a great place for a pre-theatre bite. I will certainly be back!
