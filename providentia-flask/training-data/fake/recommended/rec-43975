I was very very sad when I came home for some Modern pizza because they completely renovated the inside of the restaurant. The place looks nice and new however it has lost it's old Italian charm. I believe that Modern makes the best pizza in New Haven! They make a very thin crust pizza that is very oily. It is just to die for. Around dinner time there is usually a wait however it is completely worth it. Some good pizzas to try are the Italian Boob which has EVERYTHING, pepperoni, sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms ... and much more and their and their white fresh tomato and mozzarella pizza. They also make excellent colonizes I would have to say that this is the BEST pizza place in New Haven!!!!!!
