I was very hesitant about eating so close to a touristy location (right to the side of the Independence Hall), but caved into my husband's suggestion to eat there and, boy, was I happy about it! Red Owl Tavern turned out to be quite a pleasant surprise. Service was wonderful and the food incredibly delicious! I had the cinnamon french toast - amazingly good! and earl grey loose tea was of a great quality - brewed at your table - mmm! as a tea lover I truly appreciated a cup of good tea on a cold autumn day. Most of all I appreciated good friendly service (to me, service either makes or breaks the restaurant). The hostess was quite patient with me being picky about where to sit and seated us at a preferred table (in case restaurant management is reading the reviews - here is a grateful shout out to a hostess who worked on 11/25/2012 2pm ;-)). The server was polite and attentive. Overall, a really good experience - I am glad we stopped at Red Owl and will definitely want to come back! Thank you.
