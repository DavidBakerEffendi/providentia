OH.MY.GOSH. I LOVE Latin food-- and this place did not disappoint. Went there on a date with a guy who turned out to be obnoxious. But the moment my sizzling steak topped with soffrito-onion-yummyness arrived, his annoying aura faded into the sound of harps from above. Don't remember exactly what I had was called, but it was wonderful. I should also mention the service-- the manager gave us free shots just because the seats we preferred were reserved. He totally didn't have to, but it topped off and already great experience. I'm looking forward to going back to sample the rest of the menu-- and would even tolerate a second date with said guy if it meant another dinnergasm.
