Great decor and loved sitting in the cute patio area.   Overall a nice dining experience.  That being said I don't see myself going back anytime soon for dinner.   $133 for 2 people made the dining experience a tad overpriced.    I just went to Amis with 4 people and only spent $170 (and enjoyed there more). Pros:  Desserts were good though a tad small.   I would surely stop by here in the future for a drink and dessert.   Great decor. Great staff.   Enjoyed the cheese selection. Cons:  Cost.   Starters and Mains were small and pricey.   While everything we ate was good nothing made us say "we need to come back and eat this again".
