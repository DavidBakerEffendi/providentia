Eh don't think I'll be back for a while. Sat at the bar and it had that dirty beer smell so every time I sipped my beer, I was kinda grossed out thinking my beer stunk like that. Ordered the classic wedge salad and not sure how clean that can be, but I know now never to order one again. It was good, but the thought of the lettuce not being cleaned bothered me. The bruschetta chicken pasta wasn't bad, but nothing here was too appealing to me that would get me to go back anytime soon.
