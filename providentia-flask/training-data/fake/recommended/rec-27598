Wasn't quiet sure what to expect when I was told we were going to eat Himalayan.  The place is tiny inside, and two of us had to sit on the couch. But my friend knew exactly what to order and gave us all suggestions! Now ive eaten here like 5 times since my first visit! Start with Avocado salad, you like a little spicyness! Its beyond! Soups are supposedly really yummy too. I am vegetarian so I've had some of the veggie entrees. Chili Dofu, Tsel Shesha, and the Tsel Khowa are all amazing! My friend gets the same thing everytime... Casha Shamdey.. its a chicken dish and the sause it "heavnly" according to her. Really good food, once i asked him to spice my plate up a bit because I love really spicy foods. And this guy was not fooling around. It was so hot  I was practically sweating! Anything you get is bound to be yummy!
