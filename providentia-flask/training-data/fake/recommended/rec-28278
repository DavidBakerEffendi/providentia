My friend and I stumbled in here purely by accident- but it was a happy accident! We were just looking for some lite bites and what a perfect find! We both had the classic Avgolemono soup, and although it was a bit on the salty side, it was fantastic. We also split the Roasted 1.0 sandwich, which was also very fresh and very good, and a generous size. It's such a cute, cozy atmosphere with a bit of 50's diner edge to it. Our waiter was great- so cute/friendly. I really enjoyed it here! I think I'll go out of my way to go back there again.
