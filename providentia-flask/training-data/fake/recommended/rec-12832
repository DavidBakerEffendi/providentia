Tasty Hand-Pulled Noodles sure holds it's name.  Their noodle soups are very flavorful, so you will be licking your fingers to get every last bit of the food.  There are seven different styles of noodles, but I think the regular hand-pulled noodle are best for soup.  Also, you have a choice of spinach or bok choy.  I had tried both in the noodle soup and there really is no difference.  However, I just personally like the bok choy.  I had the duck hand-pulled noodle soup with regular hand-pulled noodles.  The savory broth is what made everything come together.  I made sure I had every drop in my bowl.  I really could not put down my spoon.   On the table, you can pour your own water on Styrofoam cups.  You can add hot oil to your noodles and cilantro pieces into your soup.  I went in the summer, and I was sweating when I got to Tasty Hand-Pulled Noodles.  The AC is not strong enough because I was sweating throughout the meal.  It's best to come here in the winter when you can get a nice, pipping hot soup to warm you right up before you continue your journey out in the harsh, cold weather.
