I found out about this spot after searching yelp for some good Italian places in the city. I ordered the fettuccine with chicken in alfredo sauce. The meal came with mushrooms, but I wanted broccoli and they were able to accommodate me, which I greatly appreciated. Thumbs up to the service. Overall a very nice restaurant.
