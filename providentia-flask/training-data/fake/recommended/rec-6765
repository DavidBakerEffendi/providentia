My friend and I stopped in today on a day trip to Philly.  We were greeted by a very friendly staff and we both ordered the special today which was a meatball sub.  It was amazing we could tell everything was made fresh and the potato salad was delicious as well.  Highly recommend to anyone looking for friendly quick affordable and delicious food
