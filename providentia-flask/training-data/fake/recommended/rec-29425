I've been downtown to the other places and had the steaks, the cutlets and the like.  Now I'm no Philly connoisseur and know all the intricacies of the gourmet cheesesteak, but I loved this one more than the others I have had.  First, there is a HUGE pile of meat both being cooked to keep up with demand and also on my sandwich when it arrived.   Not a luxurious place and certainly there for just the sandwiches.  Elbow to elbow at the bar.  Friendly staff and you can even down a beer over lunch if you're so inclined. Loved it.
