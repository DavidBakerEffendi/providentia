Best burger of all time.   I've been to Umami in LA too and the New York location takes the cake.  Bun is perfectly soft and the truffle oil makes the burger.  Meat was definitely seasoned well.  I got the hatch burger with green chiles my friend got the truffle burger.  Both were unbelievable.  The burger melts in your mouth and it almost melts in your hands as well (youll see what im talking about).  Got the truffle fries as well and although im not a shoestring fry guy they were perfectly crispy.  Cheese was great everythings great i dont have any other words im not that creative. Got some nice beers on tap but at $8 I'd rather go back to my apt and pregame on a friday or saturday night.  There was a 20 minute wait on a friday night which isnt terrible and we actually sat down in 15 minutes so you dont have to worry about getting low balled.  Service was excellent and we were able to get on with our lives in a mere thirty minutes.  Atmosphere is great but the place gets noisy.
