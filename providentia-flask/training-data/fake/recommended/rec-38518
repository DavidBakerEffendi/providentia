I'm not kidding, that Golden Tofu I had tonight was one of the greatest things I've ever eaten. It was just gooey enough and the tofu had a firm-ish texture. I don't know if I can eat another one because I'm scared it will never be as special. Props to the Chef with the black rim glasses and black chef's shirt. I'll always be a customer!
