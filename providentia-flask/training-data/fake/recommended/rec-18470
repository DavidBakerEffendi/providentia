This is a real treat.  Not your usual sushi spot, or just another sake bar.  The subterranean location is kinda fun, and when you get inside it feels like a special slice of Tokyo.  It's not typically romantic, but because it does feel like a special hideaway spot, I'd say it's appropriate for a first date, as well as a place to get together with friends or colleagues.  Service is consistently accommodating.  The sake menu is extensive and the evening can get expensive if you are looking to try several styles.  I always trust my waiters and they have never let me down.   Food is also very reliable.  Menu choices are outside standard sushi fare, so make the most of it.  Again, I trust the waiters on what to order and have never been disappointed.  Pork belly is great, but be sure to share as it is very rich.  Menu specials are also very intriguing and well executed. Overall, the experience here is memorable in a low-key and relaxed way.  We always love coming here.
