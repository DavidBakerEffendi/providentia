Big fan of Table 87's pizza.  I've gotten the large margharita several times for delivery and it is delish.  The ingredients are fresh and delicious.  They also make a fantastic arugula salad.  Have never dined in this place and probably won't considering I have Sottocasa right down the street and there's always Lucali if I'm not in a rush and don't mind a 30min wait.  But considering that neither of those places deliver, Table 87 is my "go to" for a rainy night when I don't feel like venturing out.
