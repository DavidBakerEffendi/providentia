Not your typical New Jersey diner but the food is worth it. They source local/organic ingredients and have a menu set for the season we're in. The burgers are great and the breakfast is bonkers. It's set up like three restaurant decors in one location. My only reason for not giving them 5 stars is I wish they had a more classic diner menu maybe for night owls..when you get those pork roll or disco fries cravings...and it's fancier then your average diner so the prices are a bit more. But there is a full bar and the food is always delicious. Definately come by if you're in the area.
