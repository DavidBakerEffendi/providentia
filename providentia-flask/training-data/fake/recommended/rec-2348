A friend of mine turned me onto Hanco's about a year ago.  Now I go through withdrawls if I dont have one at least once a week. It's little hole in the wall joint that does one thing really well. I have tried other Banh Mi throughout the city and use Hanco's as the benchmark.  This is without question my favorite place to grab this tasty little treat.   I have had cheaper versions but the quality has always suffered as a result.  This is a must have when in Park Slope. I recommend a classic with a Jasmine bubble tea.   Crusty Baguette, sweet cuts of pork, chili sauce, cilantro, and carrots = yummy in my tummy.
