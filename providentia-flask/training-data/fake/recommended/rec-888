I definitely did a Pat's vs Geno's challenge here and to be honest I was kind of disappointed with both. Pats is definitely far more low key than Geno's and to be honest I liked Pat's over Geno's although I find Jim's on south street to be my fav! Pat's felt a little big more cheesier and meatier. The service is super fast, know how to order, have your CASH (only!) up front and ready to go. As soon as you place your order is as soon as they will slap some cheese steaks down on the counter - it goes that quickly! Oh yeah, order your drinks and sides down the counter at a different cashier. Weird, Yes. But it keeps the line moving.
