American Flatbread is one of those places I have to stop by every time I'm in Burlington.  It's a drinking establishment, masquerading as a restaurant.  Come here to drink.  You won't be disappointed. I see there's a review stating that the bar is beer-only.  It was written about three weeks after the last time I was there, so I'm guessing that it was just a mistake.  At least I hope so.  Why do I say this?  It's because I always discover these rarely-seen liquors at American Flatbread.  This is the only place that I have ever seen Rogue Deadguy Whiskey.  This is the place that I discovered Root (made with all the same ingredients as Root Beer, yet 80 proof) at.  I love this about American Flatbread.  Every time I stop in, I get to try something I have never even seen before. Their beer is excellent.  All of the taps are handmade.  Old leather punches, hammers...it looks like they just raided their grandfather's toolbox.  Definitely impressive.  Their flatbread pizzas are also great.  However, the only other offering on the menu is a side salad.  This kind of turns me off.  I want other options.  This is why I call it a drinking establishment, masquerading as a restaurant. If you're in the area, you have to stop by American Flatbread.  Downtown Burlington has plenty to do, and this is a great place to stop for a few drinks.
