Yum.  Had dinner here Friday night and everything we ate was delicious, beginning with the Sangria, to the salad, the seared tuna (and side order of fries we got!), right down to the warm apple tart & brownies sundae.  Really, everything was delicious, atmosphere was fun, and service wasn't bad.  Only drawback was the large bill - $75 per person, including 2 drink pp.  $11 per glass of sangria is slightly steep, but this is NYC...
