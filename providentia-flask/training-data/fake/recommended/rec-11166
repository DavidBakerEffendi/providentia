I've been wanting to try this place for ages--but wasn't hungry enough, wasn't able to score one of the few tables, etc. Finally made it in tonight, and was duly impressed. Prices seem high ($6 for a dip with one pita, $11-$15 for appetizers, $18-$20 for entrees), but portions are huuuge. Two of us split the "Pikilia" (a  mixed mezze platter) and the stuffed eggplant special. The Pikilia consists of four dips, four stuffed grape leaves, olive and lemon garnish, which comes with two fresh pitas ($15; $1 each for extra pitas). The roasted eggplant one was great--the carp roe one was a bit salty though. The stuffed eggplant dish ($19) was delicious--the eggplant was sweet and tender, and the ground beef filling was perfect. It came with a side of rice and lentils as well as a small plate of greens ($6 if you buy it on its own). Service was friendly; water refills were frequent. Alas, I was completely stuffed and had no room for dessert ($4 each). The meal was remotely ruined by a table of drunken douchebags, and since the place is small, it turned into a bit of an ordeal.   I'll be back though, if I can manage to get a table again! Tip: There's take out and delivery here if you don't want to deal with the wait ($10 minimum for the latter).
