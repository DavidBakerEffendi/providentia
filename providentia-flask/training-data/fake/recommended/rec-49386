I remember being obsessed with sushi after first being introduced to it.  The initial obsession gave way to indifference and years of ho-hum midtown lunch avocado sushi every now and then until....I TASTED BEYOND SUSHI!  MY OBSESSION IS REVIVED!   The fiesta wrap awakened my love of this super tasty, compact and perfect food!  I feel like I'm 16 again!  The Fiesta Roll is very tasty.  The Veg Head hand-roll has a plain name, but WOWOWOW!  It was my favorite.  It somehow tasted like crab meat, and the cilantro, so fresh.  I can't wait to try EVERYTHING on the menu.  I thought the Green Machine was a little bland, but can't wait to try the spicy Mango.  Can't stop thinking about the Veg Head though.   The website has a nice interface and there are nice combo options.  You can also order online for delivery or pick-up.  Oh, and the best?  It's all guilt free!  DELICIOUS with HEALTHFUL ingredients.  YAY SUSHI!
