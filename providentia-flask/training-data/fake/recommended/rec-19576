Of course Sabrina's has great food, probably the best in town. If has one thing working against it, the manager. Insincere and conniving, this woman has quite the attitude. I've witnessed first-hand this woman making crude comments about the customers and screaming at her staff while they are at a table, I even overheard her making fun of my outfit once. How rude! If you can get past her desperate theatrics and vicious comments, it's a great place to eat. Great staff, great food, great service...hopefully the owner will hire a new manager soon!
