The thing that first drew me to this cafe was its look on the outside.  It has such a quaint feeling to it and so I had to check it out.   The espresso I got was good!  Dark roast, not bitter, and full of flavor.  No complaints about this.  I also got some food. I got a turkey panini.  I wasn't too happy with the fact that the panini wasn't toasted nor was the cheese melted, which is what I expect a panini to be.  It was more so just a sandwich.  It was good though!  Nothing special, but it was cheap and worth getting.  I would most likely get food from them again as a snack.   Overall, this seems like a wonderful place to hang out with friends or do some homework if you're in school, etc.  The lady working here was pleasant and told my friend and me about the open mic night they have.  I would have stayed to check it out, but I had to head back home to do laundry.  Perhaps worth checking out?   I recommend this place as a better alternative to the Starbucks down the street for sure.
