I've been dining at Pio Pio for 8 years now and they never drop the ball as far as I'm concerned. Â The service is speedy and great. The food is always fresh and delicious. The red Sangria is some of the best around, not juicy or watered down and sure to get your night going. Pio Pio is so reliable and it's now become a staple for me to bring guests and family because I can always count on great food, ambiance and a good time. I came here this past Saturday for my birthday dinner, clearly not my first time but a first for my picky parents and boy were they loving it here. When we first arrived it was quite packed (8pm on a Saturday) and were told that the wait would be 30-45 minutes. After a quick mention that it was my birthday and I was really excited to be there, the staff assured me that they would accomodate our party of 6 and immediately sat us in the main dining area. We sat, ordered a few pitchers of sangria for the table and apps. When the sangria was being served, a beer on the servers tray spilled onto my father. The staff was kind and apologetic and quickly cleaned up the mess. The manager came over and let us know that the next pitcher of sangria would be on the house! Sweet! Happy birthday to me. They saved the best surprise for last when they brought me out a huge birthday platter on the house! Normally they bring out your dessert of choice and it isn't free but that spill of the beer ended up being a blessing in disguise. The platter had all sorts of goodies. Standouts were their house flan, tres leches, chocolate cake and mocha ice cream. Once again, Pio Pio pulled out all the stops and created a great dining experience, even after our little hiccup in the beginning. My parents and other guests left raving and can't wait for us to return!
