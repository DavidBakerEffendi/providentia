Haven't been here since 2011, but this is probably my favorite restaurant ever for providing authentic Sichuan food on (at least at the time) somewhat of a secret menu. My most memorable experience here was taking someone here fairly late at night in the pouring rain, having been on the road for what seemed like an hour or more, and ultimately having everyone agree that the food was totally worthwhile. Before and after that we visited quite often, and sometimes got free stuff like milk tea and ice cream. May have been fried ice cream once. Regardless of whether that was free, it was very, very good. There was this one lovely waitress I really liked. The Dry Sautéed Sliced Fish Pot was incredible, robust and piquant and full of exotic spices. Sliced Fish with Soft Bean Curd was also excellent and oddly great when refrigerated. I liked the subtle sweetness of it, though the dish was obviously mostly spicy and savory. I keep ordering both of these things  in NYC and Boston, but it's never been nearly as good. My parents first had the Spicy Szechuan Sliced Tripe and the Sliced Beef Tendons here in 2008, and as with my experience with the fish dishes, they kept trying to replicate the experience elsewhere, but we ultimately realized our luck with these items had peaked here. It's too bad because I can't see myself ever being in the area again. Also had: Beef Wraps, Tea Smoked Duck, Cumin Lamb, Sauteed Zucchini, Chinese Style Kung Pao Chicken. All good, though not peak level.
