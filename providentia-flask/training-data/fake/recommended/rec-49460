Me and my boyfriend was walking yesterday to find a noodle shop until we saw this one. They offer noodle soup too so we decided to eat here so my boyfriend can eat sushi instead (cause he doesnt eat noodles). I ordered a spicy soba which is really perfect for winter! My boyfriend is into healthy eating thats why it was so perfect cause everything is vegan. We enjoyed our time here!
