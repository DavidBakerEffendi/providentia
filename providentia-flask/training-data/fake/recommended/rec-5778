Cheap, loud, huge portions, delicious food, great specials, well-run considering the crowds, best calamari EVER... I could go on Their take-out can be hit or miss Cash only I don't particularly like their outdoor seating area Insider information: Â they take reservations for larger parties, i'm not sure how large though
