Great, except noise level. I was wandering around this part of town looking for dinner while here on a business trip. The menu looked interesting, so I gave it a try. Everything was great. I had a vegetarian meal, the chile relleno w/ quinoa, black beans, yucca fries. Good flavors, and very quick service (although the woman who brings out the plates of food could make a bit of effort on the hospitality side!). My server Aidan was terrific; he gave great suggestions and was also frank about the dishes he did not recommend. Sounds like others have not had the best meal here, but I will definitely go back when I'm in town. One warning: if you are looking for a quiet place to have a conversation, this isn't it. It was noisy, both inside and out.
