Sorry yelpers but I was misled. I thought this was Thai food not Chinese with coconut milk and a little extra spice. The food was fresh but had none of the complexity that Thai cuisine is famous for. Thai Food 101, if you will. Yes, the decor is very nice but the food and service are, at best, average. Much ado about nothing. It is unlikely that I'd return.
