I really have to rethink some of my previous ratings after our fantastic experience at Marc Forgione.  By comparison, some of my previous 4 and 5 ratings may need to be reconsidered.  The service was above and beyond expectation and the food was interesting and exquisite. Let's start with the service.  Our waitress was knowledgeable, personable, engaging, and patient with our many questions. But we needed more information about what was available and all things became known.   We had some questions about rye whiskey - a new experience for us. The bartender came over and spent about 10 minutes with use giving us background and then bringing over a couple of different rye's for us to sample.   We settled on the Templeton's.  The other mixed drinks were excellent and interesting. On to appetizers.  The lobster chili was succulent and the chili sauce had a nice bite - but also good flavor.  The tuna tartar was seasoned perfectly with just a little spiced edge to the flavor.   Main courses included chicken under a brick, Alaskan Cod, and Duck.  I am getting hungry again just thinking back on this meal.  Next time in NYC - I'll be back.
