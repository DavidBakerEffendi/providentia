This review is for the restaurant only. In one word it was unbelievable. We had a large group and had preordered a large family style dinner so we didn't have to do any ordering once we got there. There was  seven courses ranging from soft shell crab tempura to the best steak I've had in years. This was on par or better than a few hundred dollar sushi meal in any large city. We spent about two hours discussing  this meal after it was over because we simply couldn't believe how wonderful the food and the service was. Make a reservation and ask for some of everything! You won't be disappointed. Side note: they do have takeout but you should call several hours before you want to pick it up, such as the early afternoon, because the meals are elaborate and they need time to incorporate it into their dinner schedule.
