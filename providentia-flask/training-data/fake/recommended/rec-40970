I live in Park Slope but this place is definitely worth the short walk over! I really enjoy that the menu is diverse, offering up a lot of delicious options in addition to their wonderful sushi rolls. I am currently really obsessed with the unagi cup, the macrobiotic roll, and the kale and crab miso soup. They also always have specials and seasonal menu items, meaning I'll never have a "usual" order here as there seem to always be new things to try! I was very excited to hear about their recent addition of deliveries, so hopefully I don't live out of range! But even if I do this place is always a pleasure to visit as the staff is very friendly. Bottom line: there truly is something for every sushi lover whether you enjoy vegetarian, spicy, or just traditional and well executed Japanese fare. The space is small, but I've really enjoyed my meals on the (now enclosed and decorated with cute string lights) patio space.
