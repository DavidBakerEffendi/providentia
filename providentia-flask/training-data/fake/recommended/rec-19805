Blend on the water has great ambiance. .an excellent view of the NYC skyline and not to mention excellent cuisine. .The food was very flavorful.  We had the nachos tostones which was delicious.  Also , the peril which was very juicy but not as flavorful.  The drinks were on point! !! We had the henessy mojito and a pitcher of red sangria. ..very strong yet tasty. The service was great, never wanted for anything.  It's a great place to celebrate a birthday or any occasion for that matter.  I was very pleased and would come again.  One star off because the seating was a little too close for comfort.  However,  that wouldn't keep me from coming again.  Great experience! ! Try it!
