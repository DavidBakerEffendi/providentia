Amazing juicy frozen margaritas. Yummy tacos with high-quality ingredients. The best tortillas I've experienced in NYC tacos. Brisket and fried jalapeno and avocado are the very best. Avoid the al pastor. As other reviewers have mentioned, don't expect to have a leisurely sit-down dinner there, though.
