After reading the reviews, we decided to give this place a shot. It was just all right for us. The service was good. Atmosphere is warm. Quality and taste were not worth the $200 we dropped on this place. Ordered oyster on half shell, beef marrow, steamed flounder, duck breast. We dine all over NYC and this place is definitely a middle of the road. Won't come back because there isn't a reason to.
