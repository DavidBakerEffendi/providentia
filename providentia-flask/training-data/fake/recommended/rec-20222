Really nice and helpful people. Â It's a great option to have in the neighborhood. The food is very fresh and obviously lovingly made. I got the baked chicken and garlic rice, which really hit the spot. I would definitely go here for well made and fresh food. Am looking forward to trying the lumpia when they're not out of them.
