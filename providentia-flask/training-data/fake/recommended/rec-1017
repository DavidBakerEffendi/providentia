Being from San Diego, having the chance to have an authentic Philly Cheesesteak is something I've always wanted to do. Well, that day finally came. Looking at the reviews my wife & I saw that Genos & Pats were right across from each other. Might as well kill two birds with one stone. We'd get a cheesesteak from each and split them in half. Seeing that Genos had an overall lower score, we tried here 1st. This cheesesteak tasted like nothing I've had before. We ordered the Whiz Without. (cheese whiz, no onions). The steak was cut in nice thin slices instead of chopped like most places I've had. Cheese whiz instead of your typical cheese. Nice toasted bun. It was amazing. Pros: Easy to find Price Taste Speedy service Cons: Cash only (ATM across the street) Parking No bathroom Outside seating You know it's good when the cons don't affect the actual products they are selling. Genos (is greater than sign) Pats
