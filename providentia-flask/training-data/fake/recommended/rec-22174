Generally confused about what this place offers. Tapas are Spanish, but this place offers English, French, Italian, Scandinavian, Greek, Thai, American, and Latin American dishes. OK a little variety, fine. Tapas are small "taste" plates (at a correspondingly lower price) but this place either offers large plates or large prices (or both!). The food execution was solid, but did not leave us coming back for more (especially at this price point). Cute and small space in a decent location but the Yelpers are right that it is still under-staffed, resulting in slower service. While I love a good hidden gem, sharing the space with only one other couple during prime hours on a Saturday night was not a good sign - the people have spoken!
