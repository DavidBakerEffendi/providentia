Every single sandwich I've had here has been mindblowing.  The best sandwich in the world is the Fuego Sandwich.  So spicy.  So complex.  So good.  The Pork Belly is another favorite.  BLT goodbye hello Pork Belly BLT kicks BLT ass.  The chicken salad is unlike any chicken salad I've ever had in my life.  Is this heaven on earth sandwiches?  I think so.
