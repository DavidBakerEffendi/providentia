Very cool restaurant.  Food is unique -  can taste the mix of French and African influences.  Service was perfect - not bothersome, but immediately at your table before you needed something.  We had the mussels, the duck breast special, and the veal chop special - - the entrees were awesome.  We hope to be back.
