I came to Bouley for lunch and was thoroughly disappointed.  Many courses felt heavy-handed with garnish and flourish but weren't tasty.  Here's what I had: Oysters - these came with all the briney water poured out, with small slices of kiwi.  Perhaps others like this flavor profile but I found it to be off-putting. Corn & lobster soup - this was quite tasty Salmon - overcooked to the point of it being dry.  nearly inedible.  the fingerling potato mash they served as a side was excellent though. Molten chocolate - I'm sure this wasn't their name for it.  It had a burnt taste as if it has been in the oven a few mins too long. Something with strawberries - eh. The bread cart was very nice. One very customer service-y thing they do is give out small loafs when you leave - I really appreciated the gesture but my lemony loaf turned out to be extremely sticky sweet, I had one piece and threw it away. This meal was $300 (wine, prix fixe lunch, coffee) for 2 people and I was really disappointed.
