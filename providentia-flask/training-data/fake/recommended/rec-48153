I walked in with some trepidation based on some of the other reviews - so I will say I was most pleasantly surprised. The decor, as has been mentioned, was a mystifying love boat theme, and the glasses were indeed salvaged from some norwegian cruise line... however, I can state that we were immediately greeted, and the waitress was quite knowledgable. We needed time to decide, so order appetizers which came quite quickly - within 10 minutes - and they did not forget to take our entree orders! We had summer rolls and squid as appetizers - my companion had the rare beef bowl with beef ball extra, and I had the roasted pork. These arrived in a very timely fashion (our appetizers were still on the table, but this was no issue for me, at least). The table was lovely with the stalks of herbs to be placed in the soup, lime wedge, and bean sprouts. The soup was delicious - light - and the pork was delectable - my friend was pleased with his rare beef bowl, and loved the beef balls - they weren't so much to my taste, a little rubbery - but all in all this was an amazing meal. Perhaps timing was everything - we went on a Sunday afternoon, after walking under the Cherry Blossoms in branch brook - we were the only customers for the first 45 minutes. There was indeed the gentleman on his computer, but this was no issue for me. Â  I'd encourage anyone who may have been put off by the bad reviews to visit here and see for yourself - the food would have been well worth the aggravation of a wait, but we had none of that, and I am already looking for another opportunity to visit this restaurant.
