new favorite brunch place in nyc. ann and i went this morning and had a ridiculously delicious beginning to our sunday. i started with a glass of fresh squeezed oj and she had the coffee. the portions here are not that large (but by no means meager), so it was a good thing we ordered 3 entrees between the 2 of us. i had the spicy duck burger with a side of indian smoked bacon while she went with the calamari salad, and we split the blueberry and buckwheat pancakes. the duck burger here is amazing, distinct brunch fare that tastes nothing like the omelettes/benedicts that I have grown weary of eating. it came with the usual burger fixings of lettuce, tomatoes and onions, but also came with two slices of avocado. i added a few slices of the bacon (perfectly crispy and with just the right amount of fat) and the burger was complete. the calamari salad was surprisingly tasty, and the pancakes were just the right texture of pan cooked on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. when we had finished our entrees, we were prepared to head out full and happy, but one look at the dessert menu and we knew that we could not leave without sampling one of the desserts. we went with the waiter's suggestion of the banana hazelnut tart with milk jam and molasses ice cream. amazing. definitely looking forward to coming here for dinner sometime in the (near) future.
