Johnny Brenda's is the type of joint you go to for a daytime drunk:  eclectic wait-staff, dimly lit, and filled with strange tchotchkes.  Believe me, there's nothing better than a little Fishtown drunk while the sun is still shining.  The thing is, this isn't just a little hipster dive bar.  They really deliver with a varied menu.  We had burgers and sweet potato fries and a daily special of fried leaks.  Dessert factored into the equation.  Why not?  We're drunk and it's light outside! The thing is, while it may seem easy to do comfort food, it's actually very difficult.  One must achieve the perfect balance between greasy and sodden, delicious and mortifying  JB's does it good.  You end up wanting more food, even if you're not hungry.  Our server, an accented young man, kept the drinks coming, but didn't hover around us too much either.  As with everything else, balance is key.  The soundtrack was a great mix of Booker T and the MGs, Fleet Foxes, and Pony.  I never knew what was going to play, but I knew I was going to like it.  It's like your best friend from high school brought his IPod and was winging you around.   The best part is you're not mixing every liquor in your parents' cabinet to get a buzz.
