The food was amazing, they offer a very dynamic and unique menu that they change up a lot. You can tell they take a lot of pride in their food with great options, nice staff, and a very clean restaurant. They have a large small plate selection, so you can order several dishes to share to taste several items vs. just ordering one meal. Two people you should order 5-6 small plates. They also have a food truck around town...so if you ever see it and you are hungry I suggest you stop to try some of their tasty local food options. The only thing I would say is they are very pricey, if you go with two people, have one drink each, Â you will spend about $100 without tip.
