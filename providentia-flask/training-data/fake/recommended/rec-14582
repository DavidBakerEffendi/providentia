My three adjectives: hearty, amiable and solid (that's the food, the service, and the overall experience, respectively) We started with the buffalo milk cheese wrapped in smoked prosciutto. It's perfectly apportioned for two people and has a saltiness and smokiness that isn't overpowering. The cheese itself isn't particularly melty, but its creaminess plays nicely with the textured, chewier wrapping of prosciutto. Since it was a cold night and I was craving comfort food, I went with one of their specials of the evening: a homemade spaghetti with an oxtail bolognese-esque sauce. I enjoyed the noodles. They were toothsome, substantial and chewy. It was the sauce I was more at odds with. The bits of mild oxtail, which I'm a fan of in stews, felt a little out of place against the contrast of the sharp, sweet tomato sauce. We also ordered the branzino, which was treated delicately with a touch of lemon and olive oil. It came prettily filleted with mashed potatoes and a glistening heaping of steamed spinach on the side. The fish itself was mild in taste but hearty and made for a filling dish. Overall, it was a welcoming and solid place to be on a Friday night.
