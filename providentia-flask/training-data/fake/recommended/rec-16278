So in love with this place! I went for lunch on a weekday and ordered the 50/50 sandwich (pulled pork and brisket), roasted sweet potato wedges, and a Coke. The sandwich was heaven: moist and not too fatty brisket, tender pulled pork, a fresh toasted bun, and just a hint of sauce (PERFECT so that you can choose from the sauces they keep on the table - I chose the sweet/spicy and it was delicious). The sweet potatoes were a great side, and big enough to share, and each meal comes with crispy sweet coleslaw, a pickle, and a sweet little corn muffin. The Coke they serve from a fountain is Mexican Coke, made with real cane sugar, which is the kind of little touch I love in a BBQ place. Not pretentious, nothing stuffy, not touristy (cough Hill Country cough), just good ole BBQ. I'm only giving it 4 stars because they have a ridiculously extensive menu of fresh meat made to order and I only had a sandwich. I'll definitely be back to try out the other offerings. If they're anything like the 50/50, this is my new favorite BBQ place in New York.
