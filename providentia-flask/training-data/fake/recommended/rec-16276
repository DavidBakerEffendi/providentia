Can I just say delicious! Do not think twice of going to this place. Top notch service to compliment their awesome playlist of music to the suburb food they serve. I ordered the Re di Permo pizza which was delicious and my cousin ordered the tortellini. Let me tell you that once small bite of the tortellini, it took be back to Italy. The last time I went to Italy was over five years ago and the tortellini dish literally took me back, something that no other Italian dish has done thus far. The decor of the place is super cute, a rustic yet modern look. My only let down was the types of glass given for the wines. Not your typical wine glass rather a glass meant for what could been a beer sample flight. Other than that great place !!!!!!
