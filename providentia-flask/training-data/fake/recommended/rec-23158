Been coming here since the late 90s and always a must do whenever I am in central NJ. Drinks are excellent , the complimentary chips and salsa are outstanding. There are many excellent selections on the menu,but in memory of a dear friend I always order her favorite and mine, the Chicken Guadalajara is amazing. Its a generous portion of chicken blended in to a balanced party in your mouth. The biggest negative here and justifiably so is the long wait, expect on a Fri, Sat night to be wait 60-90 minutes. Parking can be tricky as well. The wait is so worth it though and best of all the prices are reasonable for the amount of food they give you. Â Also the Sangria is excellent and a must try.
