The service was awful and the food was... edible. The waitresses are rude and unattending. They hardly smiled and checked on us but seemed more entertained by their phones. It was even too much to feign interest in their guests. The other employees seemed to be engaged in idiotic antics by the pizza oven. No sense of professionalism. The front of the house looked like a mess because they used it for pizza assembly. The calimari was the worst I've ever had. Not even worth a second chance.
