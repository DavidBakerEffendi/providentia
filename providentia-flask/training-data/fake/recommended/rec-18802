I went to Riposo 72 last night to try something new in my neighborhood. The inside is cozy and cute, and the wine was good (I had a Malbec). The food; however, was a different story. My boyfriend and I both ordered the arugula salad to start - and although it was good, I could have made it myself for much cheaper. It was basically just arugula tossed with a smidge of dressing with some parmesan cheese sprinkled on top and with 4 tiny pieces of grapefruit - nothing special. Then, we shared the mushroom flatbread pizza for the main course. Had I know it would take light years to make, I would have just left and made one myself. 50 minutes later when our pizza finally came (mind you, the server never once apologized for the ridiculous wait), we were disappointed to find that it was just NOT GOOD. I think they made the crust with matza, and they must have bought the red onions/mushrooms at the street cart on 72nd because there was nothing gourmet about it at ALL. Again, I could have made this pizza at home for cheaper and in half the time! The worst part about this experience was the bill came to $80 - I would recommend that you go spend your $80 around the corner at Bin 71 instead of wasting it on bad pizza and un-interesting salads.
