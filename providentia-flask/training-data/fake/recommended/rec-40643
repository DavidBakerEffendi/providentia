What a gem! A friend of mine suggested trying Jones on my last visit to the city and I loved it!   We were seated by the fireplace (Why was the fireplace on in the middle of August???).  However, from where we were seated we had a good view of the restaurant. The decor is fun, with shag carpeting in part of the restaurant and 50's/60's style chairs. It is a fun atmosphere. Our waiter was extremely friendly and helpful when we asked for recommendations. I ordered the eggplant parmesan, which was the special and it was the best eggplant parmesan that I have had. It had large slices of eggplant sliced, breaded and fried on top of the spaghetti noodles and sauce. Delicious! I will definitely be making a stop here the next time I am in town.
