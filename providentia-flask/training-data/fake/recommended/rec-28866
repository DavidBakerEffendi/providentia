Disappointed. Very Disappointed. After scouring yelp for reasonable Italian I decided Malatesta was the way too go. Other Yelp'ers ratings were high, the menu looked good, and there was an outdoor area. My bf got the spinach gnocchi and I tried the spinach gnocchi and substituted the pink sauce. The gnocchi was fine. I've had better frozen gnocchi but my boyfriend enjoyed it. The big problem was the pink sauce. "Homemade" is definitely an exaggeration. This sauce was definitely out of a bottle/can. It was TERRIBLE. I was really disappointed with my meal. Did I mention it took almost an hour to get said meal? And that it wasn't crowded? And that no one gave us an update/apology/etc? We are not picky people but there gets to be a point where it was ridiculous. I'm not sure if it was the meal or the house wine but I definitely got sick as soon as I got home. Needless to say there is no chance that I would go back there.
