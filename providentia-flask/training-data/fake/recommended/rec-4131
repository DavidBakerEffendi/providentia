My friends and I were seated within 5 minutes of walking into the restaurant. The setting is your typical bar/restaurant, but with wooden table tops that look like someone just cut a tree from their backyard. I ordered Mexican corn (of course) and Seared Tuna Tacos. This was my first time trying Mexican corn and I was pretty excited. Both dishes came out pretty quickly, which was great because I was starving after watching a movie. The corn was pretty good. I really didn't know what to expect, but all of the flavors worked very well and the corn was charred nicely. The tacos, on the hand, didn't work out so well for me. First, the menu just listed 'Seared Tuna', not indicating it was a taco or burrito. I had thought it was just a seared tuna steak by itself. Second, it's supposed to be seared, the tuna pieces came out well done. They might as well have opened a can of albacore tuna and threw it in a tortilla. I'll have to give this place another shot. I like their concept of having Mexican and BBQ in the same place, especially if you can combine the two into one dish.
