This is amazing. I sit to write a review on a place that has already been Yelped over a thousand times. There isn't much I can add to what hasn't previously been said, but I had one of the best tasting Philadelphia Cheese Steaks ever. It's a local institution, late night gathering place and the rivalry between Geno's and Pat's just adds to the fun, the excitment and the competition over which street joint (yes, both of them are dive-y street joints), in Philadelphia, has the best Cheese Steak. Though I fear assassination from one of the follower's of Geno's, I'll have to cast my vote and lot with Pat's. I'm sure some of the one star ratings for Pat's are undercover Geno's fans and I'm sure that some of the one star rates for Geno's are likewise Pat's fans; but don't tell anybody I said so. I'm sure that no self respecting Yelpite would stoop to such cowardly low life tactics, but then again, this is Philadelphia, isn't it?
