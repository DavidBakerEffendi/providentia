Agree with pretty much everything Dave G. says below. Solid food but pricey for what it is. Had the chicken pesto and it was warm and melty on cold, rainy day. Service was friendly but it does take a minute or two to actually press the sandwich so I could see things getting backed up during busier times. All-in-all, worth checking out.
