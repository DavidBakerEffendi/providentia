The tapas were very good to excellent, but given the rave reviews from others, I expected much more.  My favorites from the evening included the artichoke heart salad, ham croquettes (please make them larger!), and a chicken liver mousse that was one of the evening's specials.  Preparation was spot on, and while I know these are tapas...the portions were itty bitty.  Service was very good--friendly and attentive. Of course, we went with a pitcher of sangria, which was just okay.  (It reminded me a bit of a spiked version of Minute Maid fruit punch.) Having arrived at 7:45 mid-week, we still wound up waiting for an hour (standing).  We wound up being seated at the bar (which by the way, is included in the wait for a seat to dine).  Not terrible, but not great given we were given a dose of cold air every time someone opened the front door. We were fortunate to be able to use my friend's Blackboard Eats discount, which docked the bill by 30% (yay interwebs again!). If not for the long standing-only wait and small portions this would be a 4-star.
