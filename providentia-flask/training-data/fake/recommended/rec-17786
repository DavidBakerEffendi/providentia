I was not impressed at all. They took forever to serve my food and when I finally got my meal it was cold. I told the waiter it was cold and he brought it back warmer but it was black. It looked like charcoal. The rice was also disgusting. And on top of everything my meal was very pricey. I've been sitting in here for 3 hours. I give this place a thumbs down. I will never come here again and I don't recommend anyone to come here.
