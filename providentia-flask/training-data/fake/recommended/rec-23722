Learned about this amazing spot from a friend. After yelping the amazing reviews, I had to give it a try. I was not disappointed! The place is small, so seating is limited. I've been here twice, and one time we were asked to share a table with two strangers. No big deal, it's totally worth it! The noodles are so yummy and chewy. The brisket broth is drool-inducing. Such lovely comfort food at such reasonable prices. If you're a fan of Pho, give this place a try and get your socks knocked off.
