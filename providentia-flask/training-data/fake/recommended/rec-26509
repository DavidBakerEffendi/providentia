I absolutely LOVE Vientiane Cafe--every experience has been fantastic! Vientiane is a tiny BYOB along Baltimore Ave. serving the best Thai/Laotian food in town.  Every bite is fresh and spicy.  The service is amazingly friendly.  On top of that, they have an incredible lunch special: soup, a side order, and an entree for $10--$11!  I HIGHLY recommend the red curry with chicken, along with coconut soup and crispy vegetable spring rolls.  Plus a glass of Thai ice coffee! You cannot go wrong with Vientiane.  The atmosphere is pleasant, with greenery in the storefront, soothing colors and calming pictures on the wall.  (Because of its small size and popularity, it can get a bit crowded--lunch is the best time.)  Vientiane would be ideal for casual dinner dates, for parents, for hanging out with anyone with a taste for curry or foreign cuisines.  But bring cash, because credit cards are not accepted!
