Found Tom's just by searching for pancakes. I must say. AMAZING. I ordered the cinnamon pancakes but got to taste the broccoli cheese and veggie omelette. They gave us 3 different flavored butters to try: cinnamon, pumpkin, and strawberry. My favorite was pumpkin. What made this experience so much better was the staff. Top notch, incredibly friendly, attentive and helpful. I will definitely come back and I highly recommend Tom's.
