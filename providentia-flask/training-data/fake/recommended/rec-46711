Scored a table without a reservation early on a Saturday evening. Mojitos were probably the best we have ever had. Started with mahi taco app which was delicious and was a generous portion. For dinner I had the paella which was prepared perfectly and creatively arranged over the shellfish. Wife ordered plantain encrusted tilapia which she enjoyed as well. Service was good. Will def go back to this place. Mojito is a MUST
