I really enjoyed dining at Room Service. Anytime I can get a filling meal at a clean and romantic restaurant with great service and not spend a lot I'm a happy man. The styling here is gorgeous, even the staff is dressed extremely well. Entrees are mostly $9-14, apps are $4-6 as are the desserts. In fact two people getting 3 courses each after tax and tip came out to $55. For a starter I got the Shrimp Parcels (about $6) which were five shrimp with a layer of chicken fried up and served with plum sake dipping sauce. I couldn't really taste or see much chicken but it was a tasty app. My entree was the Roadside Noodles with chicken (about $9). This was steamed rice noodles (also available with egg noodles) with scallions, bean sprouts, crushed peanuts, and a black bean sauce. The portion was big and the dish was delicious. The chicken wasn't overcooked and though the dish was a tad on the sweet side, I'd definitely order it again. To finish I got the Kaffir Lime Pie ($5) served with a berry sauce. I could have done without the berry sauce but the pie was delicious. It was much more dense than a regular Key Lime Pie, it was a little firmer than cheesecake. Either way it was tasty. I also got to try the Thai Pumpkin Flan. Keeping in mind Thai Pumpkin isn't the same as regular pumpkin it was still good. I wouldn't really call this dish flan though. It was a textured custard in a paper cup inside a bowl sitting on a plate with a chocolate drizzle. Not sure how you were supposed to incorporate the chocolate while eating the dessert but it had nice warm spiced fall flavors that went well with the season.
