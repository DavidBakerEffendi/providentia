Pretty amazing overall. Fantastic ambiance, nearly flawless service, and a bewildering array of flavors. The entry room has shelves lined with apples, filling the space with a sweet, welcoming aroma. The main dining room is absolutely beautiful, with vaulted ceilings and French country decor. We had the lunch tasters menu. Each course was beautifully plated and delivered by a small army of waiters who explained each dish in an enthusiastic, Â friendly way. The food was really excellent. Remarkable, un- expected combinations of flavors and textures, creatively combined to please the palate. The cheese foam under the asparagus was a first for me, as well as the ricotta sorbet accompanied by cold melon soup. Fascinating, like it or not. The only mild criticisms I can offer are that - the fish Carpaccio was a whirlwind of sauces and flavors, competing with the delectable raw fish. - the duck was a bit rare in spite of asking for it med well, and, while delicious, was not that interesting. - the army of waiters did not re- fold my napkin when I used the restroom, as they did for my dining companions. LOL. One of the highlights for me was the crab with truffle sauce. Fantastic flavors, generous portion. I did find one small chunk of shell, however. This dining experience was a near- perfect, rare treat for any foodie.
