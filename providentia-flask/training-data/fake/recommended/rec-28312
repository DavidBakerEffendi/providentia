Absolutely delicious burgers! Wonderful, friendly staff and cool, dark decor. Tasty fries and a pleasant atmosphere, will definitely be returning. The menu, however, is limited and I don't much care for pickles, so I feel I'm not Sweet Afton's target audience. Also not the most comfortable seating in the world, despite how great the place looks. Nevertheless, I think it's very good and look forward to trying their cocktails.
