I order from here quite frequently or stop in from time to time.  People are friendly, but the service can be sloooooow at times.  otherwise I have nothing but good things to say.  Prices are very reasonable.  I am neither vegan nor vegetarian, but still love it.  My top pick: start it off with the Chicken Salsa soup then Sloppy Joe with mozzarella cheese.  Yum.
