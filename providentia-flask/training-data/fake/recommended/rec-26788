This restaurant has rude owners, wait staff, and dirty bathrooms. The food here is average. If you are rude to my family and myself don't think about getting our business again. I would never have a wedding here since their banquet hall is run down, bathrooms are filthy, and their changing room is a closet. My mother in law insisted on getting a menu from them since her daughter got married there. May I add that these owners only give you the time of day if they think they will make money off of you? They never once looked me in the eye. Sorry but no thanks! Don't waste your money here. Q in Dynasty is across the street. Although decor isn't anything to rave about, the food is better.
