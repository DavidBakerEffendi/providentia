I was visiting New York after being out of the country for nearly a year and really wanted some solid Mexican food. Growing up in the Central Valley California I can claim I KNOW what good Mexican food is.   So... I read the reviews for Barrio Chino and thought, "yea baby, that is exactly what I need!" However, I knew I was in trouble as soon as I walked in the door.  The place was filled with SoHo hipsters and not one person of Mexican descent.  In fact the couple next to us ordered herbal tea with their meal... WHAT THE HELL!!? First rule of thumb for real Mexican food... if there aren't any Mexicans in the joint then it's not REAL Mexican... period! Anyway... I still gave the place a try.  I ordered the chicken tacos and my wife ordered the pork tacos.  The chicken tacos tasted more like a sloppy joe mixture and the pork tacos had pineapple mixed in with them.  The guacamole had very little flavor and the salsa wasn't even close to spicy. Can you say GRINGO? Damn... I guess I have to wait until I get back to San Francisco to get me some some real Mexican food.   If you're ever in SF and want to try the real thing, stop in at La Taqueria: yelp.com/biz/la-taqueria… or Nick's Crispy Tacos: yelp.com/biz/nicks-crisp….
