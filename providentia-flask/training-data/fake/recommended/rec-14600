Fantastic. I attend class at NYU and this place is just a two minute walk away. When I first got to the food stand, the owner, Thiru, greeted my friend and me and was very nice. We shared the number 3 and number 8 and had one samosa each. Amazing food food for a very reasonable price (the most expensive item on the menu is $6). He'll make everything just as spicy as you want and even the food that isn't spicy tastes great. Very filling and satisfying food. Lots of tasty options of dishes and sauces to choose from. Definitely the best Indian food I've had in a while and for the price, you can't beat it. Highly recommended. Another added bonus is that everything on the menu is vegan. Talk to Thiru! Great guy who loves what he does.
