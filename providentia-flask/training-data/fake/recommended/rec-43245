Summary: Awesome, consistent Italian standards with a great wine list, but friendly servers that seem to stand around the computer talking while you wish you had more water. One small pet peeve- good waiters come back to your table and ask you how your meal is MINUTES after they serve you, not when they bring the check and its too late to fix anything. (which may not apply here because their food cant be messed with)-but seriously, a little class would be nice with the waitstaff. I sometimes feel like the local neighborhood kids are working the floor, not professional waiters. I digress. Pros: Great Italian food, will satisfy all but the snobs. You are supporting a genuine neighborhood staple. Never had a bad meal here and I'm one step away from being a snob... Cons: I can't eat here every day! If I had to give a con, I'd say the service can be spotty. I've worked at fine dining places that use a team of waiters, but sometimes here since 5 people take care of you, you get forgotten- Not a big deal, just speak up! Just don't expect to be treated special...except for your stomach!!! But once you get your meal, you wouldnt care if they cursed at your dead mother. You will be in italian food heaven. I usually get the veal parm-I crave it at least once a week.... Bonus points for fried calamari staying crispy when I get takeout! BONUS TRIVIA/MENU EASTER EGG: Check out their "Daily specials"- All of the special items are EXACTLY the same as items on the regular menu, some just have different names, which I find really funny.
