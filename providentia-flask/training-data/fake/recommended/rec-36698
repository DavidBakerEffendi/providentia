After dropping off our luggage at the bell desk after arriving from LA at 7am, we decided to check out Penelope, which was a short walk from our hotel in ktown. Right when we got there, they didn't open yet so my friend went in and asked when exactly they would start breakfast service but the guy was incredibly rude to him.  I guess he didn't have his morning coffee yet.  We almost left because of that but decided to stay since we had heard good things about this place.  When they finally seated us, service was still spotty, but nevertheless we ordered our food and waited patiently. Since it was a Saturday, they had their brunch menu so I ended up going for the BBLT, which is double bacon, lettuce, tomato with black pepper balsamic mayo on sourdough and served with homemade french fries.  Honestly, there's nothing wrong with this sandwich.  It's bacon!  hahah but it really was tasty with the balsamic mayo, and I love how they fry up their fries.   The two girls in the group ended up ordering breakfast.  The Sam I Am, which is two farm fresh eggs scrambled with grilled asparagus and crumbled feta cheese.  The saltiness of feta worked really well.  The other was Salmon Wrapped Poached Eggs, which is two farm fresh eggs wrapped in smoked salmon on black toast with greens and dressing.  Nothing healthier than that haha.  I really like the way they wrapped the salmon around the eggs.  Delicious! My buddy ordered a la carte and got the Abuelo's Egg Sandwich.  Eggs, swiss cheese, grilled ham, and balsamic-mayo with black pepper on somun bread.   The freakin ham was amazing.  A little small for the price though. By the time we finished, the restaurant was packed and there was a line out the door.  If it wasn't for the spotty service, I would've given it a 5-star, but all-in-all, a good breakfast & brunch place!
