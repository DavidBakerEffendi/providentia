I have been to this delightful restaurant twice while visiting New York, and both times the food, service and atmosphere have been amazing.  I had the steak and lobster combination this time, just super delicious.  Located right by two Marriott hotels, this fine establishment is also conveniently close for travelers.  Of all the restaurants I have eaten at while in New York (and there are so, so many to choose from) this has to be one of my top favorites!   And I haven't even mentioned the great cocktail and wine  and dessert menus!
