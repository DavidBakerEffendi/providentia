So let me first start this review by letting you know this place does NOT deserve 5 stars. The people who have left 5 star reviews must have not ever been to a good restaurant before. The waitress was very rude and aloof. While we were waiting for our meal, she got into an argument with the head chef (who I think was her father) and she stormed out of the restaurant. Awkward? I think so! I was in the mood for chicken but they were out so I got the sausage sandwich, which was very dry. Overall, I was expecting a lot more based on the Yelp reviews and the prices of the items on their menu. Compared to other restaurants in the area, this would be my last choice.
