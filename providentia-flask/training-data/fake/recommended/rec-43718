One of the best burger joints in the city. Cheap, thick, delicious, juicy burgers. (They also have chicken sandwiches, grilled cheese, and shoestring fries.) Full bar, McSorley's on tap (light and dark). TVs and music. Great service. Drink while you wait in line for a table. Cash is king. (There's an ATM next to the bar, near kitchen.)
