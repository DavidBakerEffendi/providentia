Pizza. New York City. Leggo - Star 1: How was the service and atmosphere? Excellent. While I'm not certain, I think Da Mikele is somewhat new in town. Whether that slants their service towards the positive is up in the air, but the point is, the service is good. Servers and friendly and attentive, and a woman who appears to be the owner/manager does a great job making the rounds to ensure everything is okay. While the location isn't what I would call ideal considering this is New York City, the interior is both comfortable and accommodating. What more could you ask for? Star Granted. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost? $18 for a decent sized pie in NYC? That's fair folks. Have a look: yelp.com/user_local_photâ€¦ Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food? So, here it was, the "Weekly Special" pizza. The ingredients are simple enough - Mozzarella, Spicy Salami, Ham and Mushrooms. Unfortunately? The taste was just as simple. This pizza was merely a sum of its parts, and neither the crust, neither thick nor cracker thin, nor the sauce, bland, popped in a way that brought the pizza together. A solution here would be to liven up the sauce a bit or up the toppings, but as things currently stand, I can't say this was anything more than standard. Single Star Granted. Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could? There's better pizza in NYC. No Star Granted.
