Don't ask questions about this joint.  It's the bee's knees.  The cat's pajamas.   You smellin' what I'm steppin' in? Cosmi's deli is the place to be.  And if you can't be there, they'll come to you.  Best hoagies around, bar none.  And if you want a cheesesteak to top Jim's, Pat's or Geno's, get it here.   Italian quality has manifested itself in everything they touch.  Meat lovers unite.  This is our Mecca.
