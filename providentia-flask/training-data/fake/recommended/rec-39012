Great unpretentious spot (just down the block from the former hangout of John Gotti). Terrific friendly service and reasonable prices. And very tasty food. Vodka pizza was ultra thin and nicely scorched, coal-oven style. The sauce was spectacular. Â Delicious and delicate. Spinach pappardelle came with a wonderful clutch of mushrooms in a light cream sauce. My wife wanted just spaghetti with oil and garlic and it was divine. We ordered zeppole with nutella for dessert. Yum. Just an all-round pleasant experience.
