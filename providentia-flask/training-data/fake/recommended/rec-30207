Bayou is such a great restaurant, I've been here countless times I'm surprised I haven't written a review yet. Everything on their menu is amazing.. my favorite is the tuna, and the muscles. Seriously can't get enough. The space is small but very cozy and big enough that it's not uncomfortable. Decor is great.. Drinks are amazing! Strong but so so good.. Desserts are great as well. I really don't have anything bad to say about this restaurant except make sure you make reservations because it gets packed!! love this restaurant and will be going back soon for sure!
