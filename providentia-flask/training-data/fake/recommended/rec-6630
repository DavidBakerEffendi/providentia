Tagline - They have invested in everything else except for a chef... Pros : Plenty of parking Nice ambience Cons Bad food So, I was there last saturday with a few people. We went there because it looked new and had parking. Well, the fact that it had parking should have been our first clue.. But, we wanted to give this place a chance.. We opted for their buffet lunch. The buffet wasn't all that extensive.. Had the typical saag paneer, paneer chilly, lamb something, chicken something, dal makhani, etc.. They also had these dahi chat things for appetizers. And for dessert they had, gulab jamun, jello, some form of pudding and besan laddoo All the dishes seemed to have *something* missing. The only good things were the dahi chat appetizers and the gulab jamuns. The paneer chilly wasn't that bad, once they brought some fresh prepared servings out. I hate to give out bad reviews, but, for an indian establishment in NJ, I was very disappointed.
