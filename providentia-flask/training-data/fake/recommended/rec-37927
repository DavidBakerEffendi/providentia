Yum, yum, yum. Went here with a big group to celebrate a friend's birthday. The staff really handled the large group well (there were over 20 of us) and everyone enjoyed their food. The margaritas were excellent, the chips and salsa were endless, and my mahi mahi tacos were fresh and filling. It also wasn't that expensive at ALL (the pitcher of margarita was a very good investment). I also really enjoy the atmosphere and the fact that it's a short walk to North Bowl.
