What a cute place! Although it was crazy busy, since I was almost nine months pregnant they had rushed to seat us. Delicious food and affordable too. Love places such as this one. The decor and atmosphere here really helps make the place feel very welcoming. I highly recommend it specially not at rush hour. The only down fall is the wait, but it's worth it.
