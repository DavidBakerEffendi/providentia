Awesome place.  Got seated in the back outside area immediately.  Order the cheese plate and a margarita pizza with some type of pepperoni.  The cheese plate was generous and delicious.  The pizza crust was amazing.  My new favorite pizza place after Lombardi's.  Tip: Order the Frozen Drank if available.
