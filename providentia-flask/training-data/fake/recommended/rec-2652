I had a Thai craving and this was the place to satisfy it! I had the coconut soup (small portion) and the green curry, both very delicious. This was the first time I had green beans or as many bamboo shoots but it was good. I ordered mine "medium" spicy and it was spot on! The perfect combination of taste, spicy, and $$.
