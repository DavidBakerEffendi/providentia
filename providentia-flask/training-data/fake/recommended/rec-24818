Loved this place!  We stopped here after my friend's wedding in L.I.C. for a nightcap and some snacks. The crowd was laid back and gasp-we found a picnic bench table to seat our group. I ordered my go to flavored vodka drink, a white wine carafe, and some beers.  Tab was $ 72 before tip.  The groom bought some soft pretzels and french fries with dipping sauces.  I was near brown out from the open bar at the wedding but those fries and pretzel were some of the best I have ever had! There wasn't a cover which is awesome and the bouncer was friendly. Bar staff seemed a bit too cool for school and very hipster judgy but hey maybe it was just me ha.   I would go back for sure next time I am in town!
