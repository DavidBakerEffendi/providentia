Public Service Announcement: T.H.G. opened their first brick and mortar location on E 14th and 2nd Ave. Interestingly, I was the first in line to de-flower their new operations. Per usual, the same drunk-tastic combo chicken-lamb-rice platter with the familiar white and red sauce accoutrements. The space itself is in the basement--- is decently sized with 7 small tables, enough seating for about 15 max? They also have brand snacks (tates), a beverage cooler, and more importantly, freshly made baklava and other sweet pastries for 2$ a pop. (They also have healthy alternatives like packed-salads and such, but who wants that?) Long live the halal guys!
