I went there for dinner last night with 4 other people.  We all decided that food and service were great. Palo is adorable, housed in the bottom part of a brown stone. Really homey and welcoming as far as decor. Apparently the menu changes weekly, which I'm not sure I like or not. Part of me feels that practice makes perfect, but the other part of me likes the idea of pushing the food envelope and make food fun, tasty and interesting.   Four of us choose the prix fixe menu which consists of an app, a main course and dessert.  I got the Chayote Salad with blood oranges (super fresh and seasoned just right) , followed by pan seared king fish served with a "hot slaw" (peppery/spicy slaw made with purple cabbage and purple onion) and a grilled sweet plantain.  Really, really good. (I don't care of sweet plantains so I gave mine away to a co-diner who proceed to relish in it) Desert was a Mayard lemon tart. The lemon tart had just the right amount of sweetness and tartness.   I will so be back...
