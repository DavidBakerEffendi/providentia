YUUUUM!!!! Super cool inside, huge menu, everything was fantastic, cheap price!  Their drinks are delish!  I had this pinapple rum martini which was great!  The green dumplings were yummy and the veggie duck with peanut sauce was mouthwatering!  This may be my new fav Thai spot in Hell's Kitchen (don't tel YumYum!)
