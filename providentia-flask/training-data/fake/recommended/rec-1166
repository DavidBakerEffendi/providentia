I tried Nan Zhou hand drawn noodle house after passing by almost a dozen times. The atmosphere is ok - with a wide open non-descript seating area. It's all about the noodles. They are delicious. Exceptionally fresh and well seasoned without over powering flavor like so many other restaurants. It's what they do and they do it very well.
