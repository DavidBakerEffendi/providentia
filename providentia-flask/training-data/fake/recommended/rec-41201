Came in for a quick late dinner and was very satisfied. Â Delicious ramen and gyoza. I didn't think the egg was seasoned well, but maybe it's a NYC ramen thing since other places had the same bland tasting egg. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen which wasn't overly fatty or rich - just right for a cold day. Highly recommend.
