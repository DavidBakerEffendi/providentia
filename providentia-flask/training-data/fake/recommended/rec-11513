The food is fine, nothing amazing, but not awful. And the service once your seated is nice and quirky (in a good fun way). The host staff combined with the kitchen is hellish. They routinely make a cutoff that makes no sense for their posted hours. Went in at 9:30 one night only to be told they were closed. Went for brunch with no one waiting outside and 15 minutes till closing (written on the chalkboard out front) with a large number of open two tops to be told they couldn't seat us. The food's just not good enough to go through a last minute rush to get somewhere else over that kind of stupidity.
