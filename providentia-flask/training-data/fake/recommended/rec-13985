I've been meaning to try this place for awhile and finally got there this past weekend.   The design is the typical new restaurant/bar design that you see in Wmsburg/Brooklyn lately (think Clover Club, Walter Foods, Hotel Delmano, etc).   Very nice - i liked it. Hosts and waiters were very cordial.   The waiter came by enough but not annoyingly so.  good service. Appetizers were excellent.  they had a special fried zucchini which my wife enjoyed.  The batter was perfect - light and crispy (think of the tempura you get at a place like Matsugen).   I had the lobster bisque which was probably one of the best I've had.  I was hoping it wouldn't be too creamy and it wasn't.  had a touch of spiciness which i liked. Entrees were above average.   the meatloaf sandwich was a large portion and very good (not great).   My wife had the hanger steak which I thought was good but it wasn't cooked to her specifications.  I saw some other entrees that I am excited to try on my next visit. The chocolate cake and ice cream tasted just like what you would get at Daniel.   The coffee was good too. My only complaint was that one of the glasses of wine I ordered was obviously old (opened too long) and the waiter said that a lot of people say that and it's supposed to taste like that (or something to that effect).   I agree that some wines are  more acidic than others but this was clearly not the case the more I thought about it - especially since I was at that night's 1st seating and it was near the end of the bottle (there's no way that bottle was opened that night).   He graciously offered me another wine so it was no big deal. I give 4 stars because the food was excellent and the service was good.   One of the better places in Wmsburg.   It's a bit pricey for Wmsburg but worth it.  I'll definitely be back.
