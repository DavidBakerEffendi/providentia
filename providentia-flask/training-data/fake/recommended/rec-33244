1) brunch food was good quality. Spouse had eggs Benedict and said the hollandaise sauce was good. I had the frittata -it was pretty flavorful. 2) bottomless drinks were a fail. This is why I give them 3 stars. Bloody Mary's are awful. Basically v8 and vodka. They tried to add spice - it did nothing. No kick. Nada. Go to Maggie browns or head into ft greene/Clinton hill. I asked for a mimosa since I couldn't bare the thought of another BM - they said that wasn't allowed?! Same price.  Both bottomless?? Eventually they gave me the mimosa. 3) the vibe is very Williamsburg. Service was nonchalant and blasé. Seemed like employees were predominantly transplants and out of towners who were too sensitive to direct questions that are commonplace in NYC . 4) Country music was playing. 5) Due to 2-4 above, will most likely not return. Sad because we just bought our first home very close to dekalb. Olea remains as "our local spot".
