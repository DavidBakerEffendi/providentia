Unfortunately, my heartburn was acting up a lot by this time during my NY eating vacation, but I was able to somewhat consume a pork steamed bun. Nice, but not memorable. I wouldn't particularly desire to eat here again. I'm told that the dinner specials are a lot better. Shrug. I will note that they serve red rice beer with a very cutesy label featuring an owl. Points for kitsch but not much else.
