Cafecito is great.  I've been coming here for the past 3+ years and its definitely one of my favorite day-to-day places.   The food is tasty and reasonably priced.  The red sangria, chicken empanadas and pollo cafecito are all outstanding.   The atmosphere is laid back and it's a good place to take your significant other or go with a couple of friends.  Not the best place for a large group.   Note - no reservations and cash only.
