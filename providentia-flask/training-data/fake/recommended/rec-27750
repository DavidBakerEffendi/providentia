I am usually reluctant to give out 5 stars, but this place is certainly worthy.  Small, hidden gem in the West Village.  Some friends suggested we go and am I ever glad they did!  Overall the service, food and cocktails were fantastic.  Staff is knowledgeable and helpful (I understand that some come from Daniel, so no wonder).   We started with their amazing cocktails from the most amazing mixologist, Xavier  who presented and explained the drinks in detail.  One even incorporated homemade jam.  I can name some of the drinks, but seriously, just get what you like because you can't go wrong here.  Lucie Fare, Kon Tiki, The Dude and one (can't remember the name) came in a little sealed soda bottle with a house made shrub and it was awesome.  While the focus was certainly on cocktails, they do have a curated wine list that should not be overlooked. The food was equally as stellar.  The chef is doing a wonderful job here.  We began with Gazpacho which was beautifully presented, the Brebis with Eggplant and Chorizo, Market Salad and all were delicious.  Since there were four of us, we were able to get almost ever entree Sea Scallops, Loup de Mer, Barley Risotto and Pork Tenderloin.  Again, all amazing, maybe only slight issue was temperature food was served.  Not hot, but lukewarm.  But that's being nit picky. Despite the fact that we were full, we did indulge in the desserts and while none of them screamed out at me on the menu itself (I tend to like more sweet, dense desserts), I found them all to be pretty terrific.   I can't wait to go back again and see what they have on the next visit!
