Definitely not worth the price. Did they do like a massive wash for the restaurant? It smelled like chlorox. This may have affected my opinion of the place (no one wants to be smelling chlorox while eating) ... but probably not. The food was sub-par too: chicken was overcooked and could've been more moist. Waitress was MIA 3/4 the time. (Large portions though. But who cares, if the food ain't good.)
