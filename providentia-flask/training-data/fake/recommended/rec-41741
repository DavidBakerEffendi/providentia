The pizza is exceptional...definitely worth the dining experience.  It's a romantic, friendly, and spacious restaurant.  My only issue is the pricing...some of the pizzas are close to $20 and they really only serve one person.  It's just a little steep in my opinion.  I love the late-night happy hour though.  Always a fun crew of folks around for that.
