We came across Continental Midtown after we got into Philly late Friday night and took a chance.  Service was excellent!  The waiter was attentive without being overbearing.  The food was amazing.  We had the lobster curry, Turkish kabobs, lamb flat bread and lobster pad thai and each plate was delicious.  Dessert menu was fun and also very good.  The strawberries in the strawberry shortcake were a little too tart for us, though.  The drink menu was fun and the twizzle was strong and sweet!  Very reasonably priced.
