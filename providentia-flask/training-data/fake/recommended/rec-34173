I came here on Saturday afternoon. We sat at the bar and ordered our food. The place has a very nice ambience and elegant decor. They have a wide selection of locally sourced oysters. We ordered the various kinds, they were of decent size and good flavor. For food we had the lobster roll and the fish and chips. The fish and chips, included beer battered cod fish and fries. It was delicious. But I would say that there were too many fries and only three pieces of the fish. It was a very tasty fish. The lobster roll was very filling and sufficient amount. Overall it was a good place with fairly priced oysters.
