This is the ultimate burger joint in Queens. Â They serve burgers with a portion of beef that can feed a whole family. My bacon cheeseburger is always served with juice oozing out of it and it is always a challenge trying to figure out how to take the first bite. It makes the Whopper or other burgers look like sliders. I also love their freshly made milkshakes here. They did a great job with the decor and ambiance. It feels like you just stepped into the 1950s. You can actually select a song from the jukebox at each table and it would play for everyone to enjoy. Pretty cool place to have great burgers.
