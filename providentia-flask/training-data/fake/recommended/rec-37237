Food was absolutely delicious. I ordered the filet mignon and it couldn't really taste much better. Service was average. We sat at the bar and the waitress/bartender would check on us very infrequently. The customer service in general wasn't great. At one point my friend accidentally spilled his wine (which was still almost completely full) on his food, and the waitress/bartender did not replace his wine or the ruined food out of courtesy. She charged him for the replaced drink and did not replace his food. By all means you should try this place and I will definitely return, however, I just was not blown away by the customer service.
