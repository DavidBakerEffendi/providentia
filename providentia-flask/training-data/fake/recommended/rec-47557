Worst Caucasian-cooked Mexican food restaurant I have ever been to. Can't begin to explain what an hour and a half wait is like for only chips & dip, and no food ever to come out. Service is deplorable, and kitchen staff should all be fired. Only Mexican restaurant with a 60 minute turn around time on appetizers. After 90+ minutes, food still not having been served, the waitress came out and offered to deliver the food to our home if we lived close by.  If we agreed to those terms, they offered the food at 50% of the total charge.  Accepted and appreciated the gesture, but for the meals we ordered, the prepare time was not extensive.   They need to better accommodate demand, both from a waiter service and food service perspective, and encourage their employees to dress a tad more professional and presentable.  A man, who I assume worked there, was wearing a wrestling hicksville-styled t-shirt and looking generally unwashed, was rearranging all of the silverware on the tables. Certainly not a positive addition to an already objectionable and frustrating dining experience.
