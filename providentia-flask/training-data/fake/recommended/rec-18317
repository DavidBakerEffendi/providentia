Just stumbled across Slate while looking for a quaint little place for brunch on Sunday. Loved it! Possibly, the best Bloody Mary's ever! Spicy with a hint of sweetness. Apparently, the owner makes the mix himself and it's a closely guarded secret.I I have been in search for the best Bloody Mary Mix for years, and would pay for this perfect mix! The food was equally as good. I had Eggs Florentine, perfectly cooked. The eggs came with wonderful, tasty potatoes and a side salad. We had an early brunch so not overly crowded which was nice. I sensed that the people that were there, were regulars. Based on the Blood Mary's alone, it will be easy to become a regular at Slate. Looking forward to going back again soon!!
