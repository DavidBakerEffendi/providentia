warning: hummus is positively loaded with garlic. the farmhouse flatbread was delicious and cooked perfectly, even though i dislike bacon. it was a good starter. my ceasar salad was very good too, and my friend enjoyed her beet salad. overall not a bad experience. the space is warm and inviting, and i can see why people love this place. some of the other menu items sounded delicious but were a bit out of my price range.
