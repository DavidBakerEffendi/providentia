The wait time is ridiculous!!! My friend told me to go earlier and to put my name down because the wait can be really long. He neglected to tell me that by "really long", waiting for a table is basically getting lost in a wrinkle in time with no end to it. I'm sure I was sprouting white hairs just waiting. The bar area is soooo crowded. I sat down by the bar and had a glass of Six Point, which was delicious. I had a sip of my friend's sangria and it tasted funky. Like plastic fruits? Idk, it was a strange taste. For a table of 4, it was a 1.5hr wait. It's crazy how much hype this restaurant gets. I arrived at 7pm and wasn't seated till 8:45. Â By that time, my hunger had already disappeared. I liked my food a considerable amount. I got the spicy pork meatballs with spicy meat sauce on top of the salad. The salad itself was very good; fresh veggies, it was a good sized portion as well. Service was really good, they try really hard to accommodate everyone and to give suggestions on what to get. Will I be back? Maybe if I wasn't rushing to go anywhere afterwards? But the wait and hordes of people would probably deter me from going unless it was super early or super late....Imagine Moses leading the people out of Egypt or a Forever21 on a Saturday afternoon. MAYHEMMMM
