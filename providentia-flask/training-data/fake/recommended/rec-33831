I love this place.  i've had an array of cocktails here and they are always incredible.  The Sazerac is amazing and the pre-prohibition old fashioned are the best I've had in the city.  The bartenders are super-friendly and are not snobs about cocktails despite their superior mixing skills.  Appetizers are great. i've not had dinner here but the menu looks de-lish.
