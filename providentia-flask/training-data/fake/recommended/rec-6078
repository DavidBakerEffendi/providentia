I can only speak for daytime and brunch service as I've been to Mother's Ruin about 4 times now, but never at night.  The staff has been super friendly, especially when I brought my dog and sat outside.  The food is ok, typical bar food, but the veggie burger was surprisingly good.  I keep coming back because it's in my hood, the drinks are good, the service is very friendly, and the food is decent.
