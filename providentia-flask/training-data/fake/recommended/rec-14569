Damn... what can I say about champs? I live in Prospect Park South and REGULARLY make the 45-minute trek there via subway because of how friggen good this place is! They're listed as a bakery for some odd reason though... which is probably why I had never found them in my searches for a vegan restaurant. Yes, they may have amazing baked goods (Pumpkin Chai Cream Cake!? Yes pleaseeeee), but I would list them as a Diner. I say diner to describe the atmosphere mind u, because their food is OUT of THIS WORLD! I regularly order the "Drunken Cowgirl" which is basically a big ass bowl of Spiced Scrambled tofu, potato, beans, cheese, Avocado, and a few others that I cant remember at the moment... with Garlic bread on the top. Their Ruben is equally amazingly flavorful. The servers all always happy, smiling, and laughing with the customers, and they play great music =) I will be back again... and again... and again...
