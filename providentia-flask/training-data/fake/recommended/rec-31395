So I went here for dinner with my fiance and I was happy, but not really impressed. For the price, I think better food can be had. My overall ratings: Atmosphere: A- i think the look and the layout of the restaurant. Despite being crowded, I could easily hold a conversation, and there was enough space between tables that we didn't feel cramped. Service: A- Our waiter was very helpful and struck the right balance between taking care of us and letting us enjoy our dinner. Food: B Mixed on the food. To start I had a wild greens salad while my fiance had the lobster bisque. We also shared the chips with chedder cheese fondue which the server recommended. My salad was average, the lobster was great, and we though the chips were too salty and could have been better. For dinner I had the filet mignon while my fiance had the prime rib. I also had a side of mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was delicious, but we were both disappointed by our main meals. My meat was overcooked and even slightly tough (I asked for medium). My fiance's prime rib was ok, but certainly we've had better for the price. For desert we had the chocolate brownie sunday, which was very good. For a meal costing in this price range, I expect better. Then again... nothing was bad, and we had a nice evening!
