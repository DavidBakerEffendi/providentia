Little hidden sandwich shack located right in the middle of everything. I had the lobster roll - very delicious. The meat was very well cooked and seasoned. I would say don't come here with a massive appetite as a meal here is pretty expensive especially after adding sides and a drink but the dining room is cool and people are friendly. I see why Philly is the sandwich capital of the world now Food: 4/5 Service: 4/5 Location: 4/5
