Small neighborhood gem. The staff has great customer service and the food is amazing. Looking at the menu the fish ribs caught my attention as I've never seen that before. They were great although I would've preferred a mango sauce versus orange. Light flaky fish. Came with coconut rice which was good but would've preferred no scallions, doesn't go well. Â Had the flan for dessert and is was super soft. I prefer more firm but the flavors were great. Definitely will come again to try the lobster tacos I see other yelpers have mentioned.
