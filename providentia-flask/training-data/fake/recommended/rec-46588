I went there recently and the cashier was really rude. The food got a lot worse since I been there a couple of months ago. I guess this happens to many restaurants as the become famous they think that people will come back whether their food is good or not. And by bad I mean really bad food, the babaganoosh was so garlicky, and the manakeesh were wet and tasteless, and the falafels tasted like dog food it was really disgusting. We didn't finish our food and I didn't even bothered to tell them because at that point there was nothing they could do to better my experience. Im highly disappointed.
