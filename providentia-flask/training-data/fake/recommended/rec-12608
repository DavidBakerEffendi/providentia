Are you a college graduate, newfound Brooklyn resident, and need to reassure your parents that they didn't waste the security deposit they just loaned you? Take them to Chavelas! Not only will the pitcher of sangria (white and red are both amazing) temper their nerves, but the diverse and vibrant crowd tells you more about the neighborhood than the abandoned building next to your apartment ever will. That being said, it is also a prime location for a girls night out. The prices are great and the portions will fill you up. Don't miss the guacamole, and if you are really sensitive to spices- beware!
