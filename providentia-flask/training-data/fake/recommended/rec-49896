If you only have one day a week to break your diet do it here. This restaurant has amazing food and you absolutely can't beat the prices. This is small ,casual and if your walking by you may not even notice it however its totally worth checking out if your into middle eastern cuisine and don't feel like dressing up. The falafel is the best I've ever had and the fries are great.
