Popped in last night on our journey to Meat Hook for a quick drink and unexpected, out of this world, duck wings (my boyfriend's order) and octopus salad. DUCK wings. They were so delicious!! I know I can't eat them (the sauce seemed to be a take on chinese wings so I'm sure they had soy/gluten somewhere in there) but I had to have 1 bite because they were that good. My salad was also fresh and had a nice citrus quality to it that balanced all the components well. Not only was the food delicious and melted in our mouths, but the bartender was fun, funny and attentive. We loved the casual mood and energy this place had. We can't wait to go back and order more from the menu!
