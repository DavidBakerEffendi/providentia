Came here for dinner on a Friday night and had a great time! Caipirinhas are decent and service was pretty good despite the place being really crowded. We ordered the platano relleno for appetizer which was incredible and for main course the quesadillas de champi√±ones which were nothing special, but the churrasco was really good and easily serves 2 people!
