This is simply a good restaurant. It's probably my favorite place to go to in Brooklyn Heights area. I've been here for lunch and dinner multiple times with both my friends and my girlfriend. The ambiance is pretty nice, the service great, and the overall atmosphere comfortable. While obviously japanese, the restaurant doesn't have too many frills. The old woman who runs this place is really nice(they are Chinese though) and the sushi actually tends to be fresh. The restaurant tends to be packed at peak hours for good reason, locals have realized this is the go to place to eat even in an area with multiple japanese restaurants. As someone whose tried Ozu, Ani sushi, and a couple of the other sushi places near Iron Chef, I can say this is the best place for Japanese. Their lunch combos are a ton of food and in terms of recommendations, you can't go wrong with the monkey roll. Iron Chef is a neighborhood gem.
