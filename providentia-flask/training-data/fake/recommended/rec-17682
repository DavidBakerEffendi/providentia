Updating my previous review, I have had a chance to explore the menu and my recent experience ordering the soft shell crab special was special indeed! As a native of New Orleans I grew up eating all kinds of crab, and in the 22 years that I have lived in New Jersey I have ALWAYS been disappointed with the soft shell crab wherever I have ordered it. This includes several times at very good NYC dining experiences. The crab that I had at Imocha changed all that. Very crispy and delicious! I also tried the crispy whole fish a couple of months ago and it was superb! Dining at Imocha has become a regular experience for my wife and I and if you try them I'm sure you will agree!
