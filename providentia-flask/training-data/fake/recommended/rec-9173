I liked Tia Pol -- but I didn't love it the way a lot of other folks do. + portions are generous (with me, that's always a bonus) + the runner who brought our food was very warm and friendly + the manager was knowledgeable and also seemed very nice + the pork loin sandwich is banging! + they have more than 1 rose cava (you can never have too much rose bubbly in my book) - chorizo was ok - perhaps it's because I was hoping it would be Barcelona good, but I'm afraid it wasn't - seated at the bar, which is always a favorite of mine to do, but the bartendar who was serving us was alright but kinda stiff / cold (I'm not expecting her to be my best friend, but a smile here and there would help) What we ordered: -the spicy potatoes - yum -the octopus - also yum, tender -the white asparagus - my friend loves this but she's Japanese & it has this mayo / caviar topping - I think that's why she likes it so much -pork loin sandwich (see above) -chorizo (see above) -bottle of pinot noir rose cava - excellent -almond tort dessert - good, not fabulous The food was very good - some dishes much better than others.  The place is tiny and has a really cute vibe.  For the food above & the bottle of cava it came to $60/person with tip.  Love that part of Chelsea -- I would say definitely check it out...
