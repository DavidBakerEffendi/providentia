unique but over hyped. I got a chicken tikki roll and a shami kabab roll ( lamb). The chicken tikki roll was flavorful but was pretty dry and salty. Their water cups were tiny as hell and my thirst couldn't be quenched.  The shami kabab was a bit better about being not dry but once again was very salty.    I probably walked out of there gaining more weight from water than food.
