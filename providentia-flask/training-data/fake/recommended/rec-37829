Where does one begin to adequately yelp about the Fogo experience?  How about categories? Food -- Amazing!  Filet is not something I prepare at home and rarely get when I dine out unless I'm at a place that does steak right.  Be prepared to have gauchos at your beckon call with their skewers of perfect delicious meat.  And if you make reference to wanting meat at a temperature they don't have on their skewer, they will get it for you.  Don't forget to sample the garlic mashed taters, polenta and fried plantains the gauchos bring to the table.  Try 'em, but don't over do it.  The salad bar is really good, but don't overdo it.  The roasted red peppers are awesome as is the Caesar salad.  Save yourself for the meat.  Get the bacon wrapped anything and, if you're not anti pork, try the pork sausage and Parmesan crusted pork chop.   Service -- hands down, awesome and incredible.  Never once did we need to ask for anything. Drinks were refilled and the taters, polenta, fried plantains and cheese bread were replenished without anyone asking.  As long as our cards were green, the gauchos were all over us teasing us with their fine cuts of perfectly cooked meats.   Drinks were awesome -- get the house speciality ... It's like a mojito minus the mint.  Really refreshing and tasty.
