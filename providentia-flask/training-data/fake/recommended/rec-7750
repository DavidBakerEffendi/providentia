Sadly this is a case where disorganized service was to the detriment of the meal.   The actually food here is not bad, the flavors are well done, and I feel like I would recommend the Da Mikele pizza.   However, it is a little annoying to order food and then have the server snidely repeat back to you in an Italian accent, "Oh you mean the..."  Imagine how annoying it would be to go to a chinese restaurant where they would roll their eyes at you, when you butcher their language.   It was also a  little annoying to eat a lot of salty food and spend the entire night staring at my empty glasses of water because they were never refilled. I think the clincher for me was when the person asked me at the end whether I wanted to box up the rest of my pasta, and I was like "umm... sure," and she proceeded to pick up all the napkins and crap on the table and throw it into the plate which she was planned to pack up.  I was just like, "Er..." and then stared at her, to which she at least said, "oops..."  However, she was still nice enough to pack it up for me, but I decided it was probably best to just leave it there.
