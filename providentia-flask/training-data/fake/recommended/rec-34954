Dont be deceived by the front appearance. Once you walk in its like you're somewhere else. The staff is very polite and welcoming. The food is fresh, made on the spot. Not a large menu which clearly means the food is made when ordered. There is always a special dish for the day whether its for brunch or Dinner. The burgers are great, the chicken sandwich are great, shell crap sandwich delish, the Mac and Cheese is to die for, french fries amazing, pancakes very yummy. They pickle their own pickles and coleslaw they make themselves as well. Like I said everything is freshly made. And so far everything I have tried I was not disappointed. Everyone we recommend this place to they come out saying it was amazing. If you have not tried it GO FOR IT! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.
