Ordered beef tataka , scallion roll, dragon roll, spicy salmon roll, and green tea ice cream. It was all good, but we've had better scallion rolls elsewhere. The beef tataka was great, good amount of spice and a good portion. The udon was tasty but might have been a little sauce heavy. the menu said there was a beer and wine menu by request, but it's an error and the restaurant is byob as other reviews state.
