My husband and I were on our way back to Virginia and decided to stop in Philadelphia for lunch. My husband has never been! When in Philly you must get a Philly cheese steak right?! The plan was to take him to Pat's or Geno's, the most famous places to go to. However, we were near the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall so I wanted to go somewhere relatively close. After looking on Yelp I found that Sonny's was the next best thing compared to Pat's or Geno's and within walking distance. I have to say Sonny's was just that, the next best thing. If you have time, go to Pat's or Geno's.
