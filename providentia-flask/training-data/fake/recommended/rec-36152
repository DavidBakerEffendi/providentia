I always enjoy a dinner at Balthazar...this time we tried breakfast on a Saturday morning.   Limited breakfast menu...but that's okay.    The four of us all had something different, and all four of us really enjoyed our choices.   It's a little expensive for breakfast...but it's Balthazar and you get what you pay for.  It was all very well prepared and hearty.
