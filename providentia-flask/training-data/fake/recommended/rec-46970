Man, my first time here was quite the doozy but I'll get to that later. First off, I'm biased because this bar is a five minute walk for me, but I wouldn't mind walking 25 minutes to be completely honest. Very cozy downstairs and still retains that borderline dive-bar (albeit classy) atmosphere. The beer selection is rotating and always exceptional, and their citywide is my new favorite (Naragansett pounder + shot of Powers = $5 - sure, have some). The food is terrific, too. Had fries, onion rings and a bangin-ass pulled pork sandwich. I hear from friends that pretty much everything is on-point foodwise. Now, here's my real reason for loving this place: the jukebox incident. I appreciate any establishment that doesn't settle for those crappy internet jukeboxes where any schmo-hawk can request anything they want. No, no, I demand a bar show me their taste and give me a selection of hand-picked CDs. In this particular go-around, I made my usual selections and, to my delight, saw that they carry Suicide's self-titled '77 debut album ( a true classic!). Now, I decided to pick a song called "Frankie Teardrop" thinking it was their more upbeat song "Cheree". In actuality, "Frankie Teardrop" is a 10-minute long song about a father's descent into insanity. Needless to say by the time Alan Vega started his murderous screaming, the entire bar (filled with at least one elderly couple) was confused and probably a little scared. The bar quickly shut it off and the manager was apologizing to various patrons. I was beyond embarrassed. I later apologized to our waiter and explained I thought I was picking "Cheree." He laughed and reassured me it was no big deal. However, he informed the manager that I was actually the one who picked the song and the manager ended up comping my most expensive drink simply for owning up to it. This is when I knew that Sardine was safely on my favorite bars list. Just tread softly when you're at the jukebox.
