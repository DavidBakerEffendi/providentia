My date's and my idea of spontaneously picking a restaurant consisted of getting off the train and consulting our Yelp app for the highest rated place within a 4 block radius. All stars pointed to Juniper, but I was skeptical due to diner atmosphere I gathered from the reviews. But a tiny, cozy restaurant happily greeted me with a friendly waitress and a head chef mingling with the other late night patrons. In an attempt to order healthily, I chose the evening's special Cajun shrimp salad, though my date's burger and spicy fries stole the show. For being a special, and not necessarily cheap, I expected more for my salad. My precisely counted 6 shrimp lay on a boring bed of what seemed like your average bag of greens. The dressing was too spicy (hot, not flavor) and the only mix ins (mango and tomato) were sparse and offered little to the dish. Could have done for a more thoughtful recipe. Despite the mediocre salad, the comfort food was great and the environment was perfect for a winter evening. And hey, BYOB.
