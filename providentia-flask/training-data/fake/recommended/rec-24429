I went to Soco last night and was happy with the overall experience.  I started off with a drink, the cucumber cooler and it was definitely a refreshing drink.  For an appetizer we had the mussels with the habanero broth.  It had just the right amount of spicyness to it, I enjoyed every bite. I had to go for the chicken n' waffles since it was highly recommended and I was overjoyed.  The chicken had just the right amount of crispiness to it and it wasn't drenched in oil. The waffles man o man were they good.  The service was amazing, everyone was very attentive and friendly. Would definitely go back her again to try other dishes.
