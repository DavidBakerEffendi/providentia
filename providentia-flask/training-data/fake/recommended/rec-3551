I came here specifically for their special pad thai but it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. The curry puffs and coconut calamari tempura were alright but there were Â nothing really special about it. As for their mojito, they added too many mint leaves that made it too minty. Overall, I may go back again but not anytime soon.
