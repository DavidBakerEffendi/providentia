Came here twice so far Time: Sunday; About 3:30pm Location: Isolated Price: Expensive. Food: Forgot what I had but both times I loved it. Its a Portuguese/Spaniard restaurant. Â  Drinks: Sangria, Mojito & Caipirinha. All were fantastic Music: None Interior Design: Very nice, it had an old country type Spanish look. Wish I knew more about architecture to explain the name of the style :/ Pros: Huge food portions, fantastic drinks, great food & great place to bring a date/girlfriend/wife Cons: The location and price but its worth trying it at least once to find out for yourself.
