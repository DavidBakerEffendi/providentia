I have no idea how this has an average 4-star review.  Maybe if you need gluten free your options are limited.  Or maybe their food other than pizza is good.  But the pizzette's are at best two stars, especially in a town with great pizza.  I got the polpette, which is advertized as having meatballs, buffalo mozzarella, sauce, basil and parmesan cheese.  The crust was a cheap, thin, frozen crust, complete with those little holes on the bottom that the frozen crusts sometimes have.  It was like something out of the freezer section of Gristedes.  There's no way the mozzarella was buffalo mozz.  It was a thick layer of plain old mozzarella, just like you'd get on a frozen pizza.  It had very little sauce, and I saw no sign of basil (but then it was such a thick layer of cheese, I don't think I would have).   Again, if you're hard up for gluten free, maybe this place is awesome, or maybe it's just not a pizza place.  But no restaurant can serve that for pizza and get 4 stars.
