A bunch of mixed reviews on here (really high and low) Pros: 1.  Eaten here twice, lunch and dinner on travels.  Both times I thought the food was awesome.  I stuck with the large plates, apparently people have some bad vibes on the small stuff. 2.  Bar/wine selection is solid if you want to try new things you can get a few things to enjoy. 3.  Staff is super friendly.  Both times people talked, made suggestions, etc...   Cons: 1.  Wait staff is pretty laid back.  Common thing I get in french places run by french people.  If you wave someone down they don't seem to have a problem but they always appear busy and not running to tables like at a normal place.  I wouldn't go here in a bind for time.
