Ask a non-Philadelphian where to go in Philly to get a cheesesteak, they'll tell you to hit Pat's or Geno's. Wrong. Sometimes they'll say try Jim's. Wrong! Well, alright, Jim's is decent. Someone who knows the landscape should send you here. It's off the beaten path, but totally worth it. Dallesandro's provides the right meat (diced variety, if that matters to you ) and bread combination. Meat is plentiful, as it should be, but not TOO abundant to overwhelm. Many toppings are available - I tend to go standard with onions (perfectly caramelized), but a friend always gets his with marinara, which is amazing. Addition of beer in the past few years was a major upgrade - but for all interested, this is a good place to get your Black Cherry Wishniak fix, somewhat hard to come by! If you come at major mealtimes, expect to wait - lunch and dinnertime during the week can take upwards of 30min-1hr. Come on a Saturday, where you'll get in and eating quickly at most times. Service is always honest and quick, as you'd expect from a small place. So sad that this type of sandwich can't be replicated in Boston, but one of these will cover my fix for months.
