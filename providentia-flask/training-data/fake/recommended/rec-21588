Hmmm...  so many good reviews.   I was being treated for my birthday (and she would not be this kind)...  so we had a reservation and were seated immediately, was going to be seated at one of the two tops along the back and they were packed pretty close, so they moved us to one of the high tops near the bar...  service was great, drinks were good...   The appetizer was the assorted, I think it was three of their selections and it was okay but nothing special...  one was good, the others were so so...  my dinner was not bad, Prime Rib...  but again nothing special and not much of it...  thin piece of meat with a lot of fat...  she on the other hand had lamb and it was the driest overdone flavorless piece of meat ever...  I tasted it because she couldn't eat it and it was pretty bad...   Was too bad the food was so disappointing because the ambiance was nice...  price was a little up there for 4 drinks, an appetizer and dinner put us close to $200 (with tip)...  that wouldn't be bad for an outstanding meal...  in this case it wasn't.
