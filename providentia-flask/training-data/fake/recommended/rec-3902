I ordered out from this place the other day. The noodles were definitely like something I had never tried before. You can hear the guy banging a log-like roll of dough in the back so you know its made to order on the spot. I got the knife-cute noodles with chicken in a broth. The broth was tasty, the spinach that accompanied the broth was very fresh and it all mixed well with the flavors of the broth. I also tried their beef pan-fried noodles, which were a bit too greasy for me but they were still very good. Next time I might venture to try a thinner noodle since the knife-cut noodles were a bit thicker than I had expected.
