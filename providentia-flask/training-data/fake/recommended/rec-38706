This was our first time eating here and we were very impressed. Just like what I had read in previous reviews, when we walked in the owner greeted us and introduced himself. The atmosphere is cool and although there isn't a huge seating area... it was quite nice. We had the "free yelp" egg rolls along with the wontons for our app. Both were outstanding. The egg rolls are fried perfectly and are not too greasy with just the right crispness. For lunch I had general tso's chicken and my husband had the tofu version. Both were very good. Overall this place was great and it's nice to have a local good chinese place so close to home. I can't wait until we eat there again so I can try something else on the menu :-) HIghly recommended!
