OH MY GOD! That's what I said to myself after a bite of my chori burger. Ok, on my reviews, I don't normally jump into describing the food, but the chori burger was just amazing! Let me explain what a chori burger is. The patty of a chori burger is a combination of beef and longganisa on challah bread. Filipinos are known for liking burgers, but I love the uniqueness of a longganisa and beef patty on challah bread. It was superb!!! So now, I shall verbalize my thoughts on the restaurant. From the outside, there are multiple signs in the window and if you read the signs, you'll definitely know its a Filipino restaurant. When you walk in, there's a bar, and a few tables on the side and some more in the back. They serve Philippine and other asian beers which is good, however, I find the beers a little pricey. This place is NOT your ordinary Filipino restaurant. Everything is Filipino but there's a certain twist and uniqueness to what they offer. Just like the beers, the food is a little pricey, but the portions are huge! So be sure to come hungry. I really like the atmostphere of the place, its cozy and ideal for youngsters like me. I would definitely bring friends here - Filipino and non-Filipino. By the way, they have BALUT!!!!! :)
