I went here for the bo ssäm with a group of 8 people.  We were seated at a table that was very tight and we had to wait for another table to leave before we were able to get one of our guests a stool.  There were no backs to the stools, so our bags and winter coats were literally on the floor or in our laps...extremely uncomfortable and inconvenient.   We ordered a few appetizers and drinks.  The pork buns aren't really my thing because I find the pork belly at ssäm to be too fatty and greasy, and though many enjoy the melt-in-your-mouth aspect, I do not.  I didn't try the tripe, though I was told it was very tasty.  The country ham was good, but nothing special.  The wine was nice, though I would have liked it to be kept on ice.  The bo ssäm was good, and there was plenty of it, but I have had better.  Honestly, I couldn't tell if I was enjoying the bo ssäm or the sriracha more.   At $200 the bo ssäm itself is affordable for a large group.  However, if you plan on ordering drinks and apps, the tab will run you a lot more.  Ours came to about $600 (after about 2 drinks per person) which isn't bad, but in my opinion it wasn't really worth it.  For that money I'd rather sit comfortably in a chair and leisurely eat/drink something more interesting.  The bottom line is that I don't really regret going, but I wouldn't do it again.
