Every time I leave Lucali's, my stomach is happy.  I would put it at almost the same level as DiFara's, but it's a totally different ambiance and experience. Never go with party larger than 6 people. The largest table seats 6, and there's only one six-person table.  If you do go with 6 people, get 2 pizzas and a large calzone.  It will be just enough food to satisfy all of you.  Really, it's best to go as a party of two. It's BYOB, with a $5 corkage fee.  There's a bodega on the corner, if you want beer. There's a bench outside to sit and wait. I've never waited more than an hour for a table.   The last few times it was a little bit "off" but an off night at Lucali's is still twice as good as any other other pizza place.  Totally amazing pizza, go!!
