One of my favorite places in the entire city. Insanely huge portions for the money and the half-a-chicken is perfection itself. The wine is good, the water is freezing cold and the tostones are my favorite appetizer. There's a huge fridge of Goya juices (just like you used to drink as a kid!) and sodas. Everything is delicious because it's homemade. Highly recommended.
