I want to love you PYT... but your bar sort of feels like a hallway and I'd rather a comfortable distance between myself and all of the hipsters you draw in. Four stars because the $10 milkshakes are unbelievable and any place that's known to bump MJ deserves a little love. I've been there twice but never stayed long the outdoor seating I feel is a saving grace. Don't love it but the milkshakes will probably keep me coming back.
