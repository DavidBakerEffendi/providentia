Such a great little spot to enjoy a dosa in the park! Quick, fresh, delicious. The man making the dosa was super friendly. The samosas are pretty big, and so is the dosa. Hats off to anyone who can finish both. I like my food really spicy, and while the dosa was flavorful, it didn't pack much of heat. Everything else being as good as it was, I highly recommend!
