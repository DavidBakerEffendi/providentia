i chose this restaurant because of its proximity to sleep no more. that's it. i can't believe what a lucky find it was! the staff were friendly and fast (and our waitress was argentinian and so proud of the food she was serving, for good reason). and speaking of the food, it was nothing short of awesome. so delicious, perfectly portioned, and so different from the typical food i eat. i really, really enjoyed this meal. the restaurant itself is really nice inside as well. i could see it being a perfect date spot even though i went with a friend. order the calamari salad. yum! the best part: the price.
