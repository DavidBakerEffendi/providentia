Man, Â not sure what the bad reviews were about. First off, the place was hopping and lively which was nice. We got seated right away. The service was 5 star excellent all the way through. We had a great waiter who was knowledgeable and friendly. I am gluten free and they had a WONDERFUL gluten free menu, and the regular menu had tons of choices. BBQ wings were delicious, as was both burgers. I left happy and full. I had a delicious lemonade vodka drink that was awesome too. So many people compare to Prime 16 (who has a great burger) but they are forgetting that for some, New Haven is a bit of a hike and also parking there is pretty labor intensive as well. So this is a great option. Listen, Stratford/Milford/Orange is an area where new businesses to have a nice meal and to properly socialize are always welcome in my book. Boosts the economy in the area and makes for a varied social scene. This place was great. I didn't give five stars for two reasons-1. no drink menu (your server explains what drinks they have) and 2. was slightly overpriced for what you get. Slightly.
