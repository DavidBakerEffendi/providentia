I love this place. Very chill atmosphere and even though they have a small menu, it has all the necessities. I'm very fond of their fries. then again who isn't? Their beer selection is very large and diverse. If you're in Astoria and looking for a cool place for a first date or to have a drink with your buddies after work, come here :)
