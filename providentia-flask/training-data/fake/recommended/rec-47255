going for a saturday/sunday brunch? this place is worth the wait! So i had heard about Penelope and really wanted to try it out. On saturday morning, my boyfriend and I decided we will make the trip to murray hill to try Penelope out. We got there at 11:45 am, and the wait was about an hour and half. I really wanted to try it so we thought, fine, we'll wait! since it is only a block east of Park avenue we decided to walk around on Park until we get a text from the restaurant. about an hour later, they texted us to let us know our table is ready (wohoo, ahead of schedule!) and we should come in within 5 minutes. We made it back, got seated and a very cheerful and pleasant waitress served us. I hade the poached eggs and smoked salmon and it was absolutely delicious, very flavorful, and the pre-fix brunch for $15 comes with a free drink. So we got our mimosas and enjoyed the brunch very much, i will definitely come back, and recommend this place very much.
