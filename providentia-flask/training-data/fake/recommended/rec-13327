After hearing this place had some of the best pancakes and french toast in the city we had to try it.  We arrived right at 9am and there was a line waiting for the place to open.  It's a very small place and they do pack everyone in there - but it's worth it!  We had the chocolate chip pancakes and the french toast with pecans and caramelized bananas.  We thought the pancakes were good, but the french toast was amazing.  We also had the sugar cured bacon and the sweet potato fries.  The bacon is awesome, but I would avoid the sweet potato fries as those were a bit undercooked.  Definitely add to your list of can't miss breakfast spots!  We will for sure go back again!
