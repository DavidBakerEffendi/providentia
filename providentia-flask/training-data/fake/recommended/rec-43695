When you walk into Balaboosta you feel like your going to be spending the evening not in New York City, but at a relatives house in the countryside. The entire restaurant feels like you are are eating in someone's dining room and is very welcoming. We started with three small plates: the House Pickles- which I felt bad even eating because it was one of the best looking plates of food I've ever seen. The Hummus- a very large serving for a small plate and is nice to be able to mix to your own consistency. Then the Crispy Cauliflower- this is one of the best appetizers I have ever had, ever. Chicken Under a Brick- this was recommended to me and I'm glad I got it, very interesting flavors, and the chicken is cooked perfectly. Familiar couscous but still great tasting. Seared Bass- a nice refreshing dish, only had a bite but it looked great. The wine list is well priced and offers something for everyone. If you are looking to have a nice dinner where you can have a conversation and feel at home, this is a great place to be.
