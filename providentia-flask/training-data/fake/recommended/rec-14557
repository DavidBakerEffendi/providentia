How is this place so good? Not like the actual place, which is a tightly packed, difficult to navigate bodega, but rather the incredible variety, flavor, and value of the 6-9$ protein packed and delicious sandwiches? I usually get the Pho#2 which comes with basically 4 delicious proteins and has the size and ingredient count of 2 sandwiches, but explore the many great and intermediately politically based options.
