There's usually a wait here but we were quickly seated without a reservation since it was a Monday night. We ordered a couple jalapeno margaritas, shrimp & chorizo skewers, seared sea scallops, brussel sprouts, seared sea scallops and pork belly. Judging from the photos, it seems like some of the tapas are served differently depending on the chef and which night you happen to go. The pork belly was served sliced with a dark purple sauce, but I later saw a photo of the same dish unsliced and served with a yellow sauce which looked more appetizing. The pork belly was dry and not juicy at all. They seemed to be trying to recreate bo ssam (steamed pork belly) into a fancier, roasted dish, but having had lots of homemade bo ssam as well as all types of pork belly, this dish definitely was lacking in the flavor and tender department. Our seared scallops were little scallops that didn't have much flavor and weren't seared too well, but the sauce was slightly earthy and pleasant. The shrimp & chorizo skewers are recommendable, not to mention the avocado mousse that comes with is delicious (although a bit on the expensive side for four shrimp and what seemed like one slice of chorizo just shredded into four pieces). Brussel sprouts were expensive at $12 but definitely cooked well and I'd probably order them again. The service was alright but not commendable. Bill for two was over $90 before tip.
