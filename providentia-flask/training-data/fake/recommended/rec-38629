So I never had any sort of cheesesteak before becoming vegetarian so I have no idea how authentic or not they are, but I thought it was okay, not the best food I've ever eaten.  I have been to Govinda's twice now and didn't have anything I would go back for, except the ice cream, which they do not have anymore, since they had a fight with their unreliable NYC supplier.  This is sad, as the vegan kosher ice cream they had the first time I went was amazing.  No one I went with either time had anything that was worth returning for either.  I want to like and support vegetarian places, but I also like eating yummy food, and if I can get that at a non-veg only place then I will.  I may try going back for the vegan buffet, but maybe not.
