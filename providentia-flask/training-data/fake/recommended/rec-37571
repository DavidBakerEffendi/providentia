This place in my opinion was OK.  The chicken was decent, although the breading was a little more like KFC's- kind of thick, but not as thick as KFC.  It was seasoned well- and the "hot" isn't as spicy as some say...or maybe my spice tolerance is a little higher, but I don't think I have that much of a tolerance for spice.  Mac and cheese was okay as well...corn bread- i didnt really like as it was a little on the crumbly side.  Overall, the only word that sticks out in my mind to describe this place is "OK"
