Go here for breakfast.  I had the fruit waffles with maple butter.  Best waffles ever.  When you get fruit on top of a waffle you don't expect much, but even the fruit was fantastic.   My girlfriend got the eggs benedict.  Also amazing.  The biscuit they used for the eggs benedict is amazing, as is the sauce. This place is rather small and there can be a line. Next time I'm in new york I am _definitely_ going here for breakfast.
