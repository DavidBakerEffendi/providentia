OMG, Beer, Beer, Beer! First time I went here was after a show at MSG.  Just far enough away to avoid the crunch of post-show bars in the area.  I came in and saw the beer list...then saw Dogfishhead 90 minute IPA on tap...SOLD!.  I go back anytime i'm in the neighborhood. Any beer lover will find plenty of options on tap.  The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the neighborhood. Midtown is not a fun place to be most times, but if i have to be there...at least there is an oasis like R&H.
