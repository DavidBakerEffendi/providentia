We tried this place during its first week of operation so maybe they have some things to iron out, i.e. the seasoning of the food.  We started off with the spaghetti with calamari, cockles and lobster.  Pasta was homemade, the sauce was flavorful and light, however the dish was oversalted!  For dinner we had the duck breast and the rack of lamb.  The duck and lamb were cooked perfectly.  The problem was that their accompanying sides were tooo salty.  Someone in the kitchen was going overboard with the salt shaker!  Has definite potential, and the food is good, however at these prices, we will continue to try other places in the city as opposed to returning anytime soon.
