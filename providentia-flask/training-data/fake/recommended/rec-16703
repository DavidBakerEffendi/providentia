The food at The Grocery is top notch.  Even with high expectations going in from reading reviews and praises, it surpassed them with flying colors. The atmosphere was pleasant/classy but not stuffy.  Service was prompt and great, not snooty at all.  The head chef/owner comes out and chats with each table briefly and brings samples of various dishes (soup, croquettes, sorbet) for you to try, which is always nice. The wife and I ordered the following: Roasted Beets w/ Goat Cheese Ravioli Fried Artichokes Grilled Halibut Grilled Loin Chop of Lamb All 4 dishes were ridiculously good.  Great flavor and perfectly balanced.  The lamb was hands down the best lamb dish I've ever had.  I dream about going back for more.  Just awesome!  Good amount quantity wise too. We got the panna cotta for dessert and my wife thought it was great.  I didn't like it as much as it was made from buttermilk and had a yogurty taste to it which I don't enjoy too much.  Not their fault of course. Wife and I both agree that it was the best meal we've had since going to Babbo a year ago.  We would definitely go back again!
