Yes the cocktails here kill it. Fresh infusions of herbs and fruits instead of pre-mixed; I have been here a number of times and while the crowd at times seems to think they are perhaps filming an Indie movie instead of hanging out at a bar in New Haven, Connecticut: the place rises above that nonsense because of their dedication to quality ingredients. My martini loving friends claim theirs is the best in the city...I do know from personal experience that they have The Best Rum In The World, Flor de Cana (thank you Nicaragua) when they have it. And they make their own pate. I understand why some people hate this place I"m not big on pretending I'm at Nobu or Buddakan or whatever trendy NYC place when I'm in fact in New Haven, CT, but if you can get past the occasional vibe of that and just enjoy yourself with your friends, you will really enjoy this place IF you enjoy unique food and drinks made with fresh ingredients in inspired combinations. The weekend DJ adds a nice touch. Also their bar is amazing it is made of Onyx and lights up from the inside. Bring a date here because you'll have conversation topics and icebreakers galore and look super classy to boot.
