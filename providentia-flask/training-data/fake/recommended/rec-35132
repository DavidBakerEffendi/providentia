I was looking for a nice spot for me and my son to eat breakfast. I found home sweet Harlem and decided to give it a go.      The place was really empty, but I was greeted by the waiter, and we sat down.     I ordered salmon cakes, grits w cheese, grilled potatoes, organic eggs and toast w some type of organic jelly. The grits were good my son really loved them, organic eggs are very tasty, the salmon cakes were a bit dry but mixed with everything else it was okay.  Place is a little pricey the food ok, and kind of inspires you to eat healthy.
