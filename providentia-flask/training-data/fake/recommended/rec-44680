After being told the wait at Serendipity down the street was an hour and a half, my group of seven decided to hang out in Central Park until our table was ready. Well guess what, we never made it to Central Park because we were drawn in by the allure of The Bar Room. The decor was upscale and felt old in that trendy rosy-recollection-of-the-good-old-times-of-Â­yesteryear sort of way, yet didn't feel the least bit pretentious. The long bar is made of rich, dark wood, which gives the space a warm, yet elegant feeling. The music (Sam Cooke, Ella Fitzgerald, et al) was a refreshing change from the typical noise pumped into most NYC bars/eateries. Our group only sampled the drinks, so I can't attest to the quality of the food, but from what I observed on the menu, the dishes appeared to be inventive and lively. Our group sampled the following drinks: mimosa, bellini, Salty Dog, screwdriver, and the best Old Fashioned I've ever had. All drinks were wonderful and carefully prepared by the bartender, who was extremely friendly and personable. I'd recommend the bar room for anyone looking for a nice place to get a drink in a relaxed, yet upscale, setting. Also, definitely try the classic Old Fashioned. It is remarkably perfect in a simple way that allows for the drink's main flavors to shine.
