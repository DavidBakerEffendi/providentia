Very disappointed. I've heard it so many times and had expected it to be nice and zen. Turned out it's a cheap lousy place for students to hang out. When we tried to reserve, they rudely denied; when we talked in, we were blocked to wait outside. When we sat down, we were told there's no afternoon tea service. There is a very limited menu. Desserts are too sweet and some are just grocery store quality. In the end, it's cash only, and we felt like ripped off for what being offered there. Don't go, period.
