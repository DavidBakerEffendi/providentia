Despite long line, we did not wait longer than 20 min before we got our table. The only problem was the table was downstairs, less nicer area than upstairs and the air conditioning is crazy cold. It took another 30min for pizza to arrive which was worth it. Very thin crust with the toppings of your choice. Tomato sauce was really good. Even though it looked like an overrated touristy spot the pizza was really good. Cash only place.
