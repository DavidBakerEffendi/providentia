Good food, if small portions. Slightly annoyed that main courses do not come with rice and beans and had to order them separately. That said, the mezcal cocktail was interesting and the short rob enchiladas were tasty. I was expecting more of a red or green sauce on top, but the salsa and fresh cheese was surprisingly refreshing.
