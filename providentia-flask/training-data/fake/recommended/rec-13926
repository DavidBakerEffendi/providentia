The pizza here is not that great. My husband and I expected a lot bc of all the great reviews and were really looking forward to trying this place. The pizza was thin but it was soggy in the middle. The dough and crust was really good. It was salty and the tomato sauce was tasty. The cheese however was just kinda funky and not good. I love pizza and I must say the cheese on this pizza was just kinda gross. I picked it off all the slices I ate. It kinda reminded me of a Â plastic cheese- not like a high quality cheese. It looked good when it came out but I just did not care for the taste. I added mushrooms to half of the pizza and that caused it to be pretty soggy which was also not too appetizing. I have to come here again to meet up for the scotts pizza tour my husband and I signed up for but we are gonna pass on the free slice of pizza that we get with the tour.
