This place had some positives to it: clean look, attentive service (at least for us, but I did see a woman wait a good 20 minutes to get her bill), and the food was qualitatively good. We didn't try any of the rejuvenating cocktails. I was, personally, put off by the lack of beers on draft combined with a high price for cheap beer (viz., Yuengling at $5 or $6). This was lunch. The chicken/bacon sandwich tasted like all the stuff in it was of good quality. However, it just lacked flavor. There was pesto too. I could barely taste any of the ingredients. Perhaps, my palate has been burnt from the crudeness of Five Guys and the like but I doubt it. Likewise, the fish tacos. First off, they were bare. They looked lonely. I did not try any but my eating companion noted the same lack of flavor even though the food quality was good. I don't know what to say. I don't think you have to worry about bad food here but I think they need to work out something in the kitchen. Maybe it was just us. I like the name and the concept.
