I was left dissatisfied! After being born & raised in Israel, and eating Falafel quite often, this place here was a disappointment. I've been in the U.S. 4yrs now, mainly between Chicago & Atlanta, I've had fantastic falafels in both those cities. But my Philly experience didn't quite make the cut. After searching for the best Falafel in town, I came up on this place. DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE! The sandwich was dry, the falafel balls are dry and lack flavor, and the salads need some hint of lemon juice like authentic Israeli salads. I asked for spicy, and I'm 100% there was nothing spicy on my sandwich. Over all, not a good experience, would never recommend it to others!!! If ever in Atlanta, try Pita Palace! They have all the authentic Israeli salads made fresh daily! They also have schwarma & schnitzel! And is run by israelis....YUMMY!
