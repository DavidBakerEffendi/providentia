Absolutely Terrible Service... Stopped by for a bagel.  They were not busy and I was the only one at the counter. I waited 10 minutes to be served and then left out of frustration. Of the 3 staff members I saw working, only 1 was helping customers.  One was doing some with the coffee machines and chatting with the person making sandwiches, and the other one was talking with his friends.  They didn't care I was there.  No one even acknowledge I was standing there.  A simple 'Hello, we'll be with you in one minute" would have made all the difference...but it was like I wasn't even there. So what good does a quality product do, when the staff is rude and they don't help their customers? This is the first yelp review I've written.  I found this experience so frustrating that I had to share it.  I actually go into the Bagel Market fairly frequently and the service has consistently been problematic...but this really is a whole new level of bad.
