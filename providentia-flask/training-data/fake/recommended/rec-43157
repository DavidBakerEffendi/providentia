Service is good here, but most of the food isn't. The only thing I liked was the fried goat cheese with lavender infused honey. My boyfriend and I also had the sliders, the pork empanadas, the wings, the lamb meatballs and the "specialty of the house" according to the waitress, which was the brussels sprouts. Everything but the last one was just eatable. The brussels sprouts were terrible. I ate one and it tasted like it was burned, and I have the feeling that even when it's not burned, that's probably not good at all. I told the waitress that and she took it out of our bill. I only gave two stars because the staff was nice, and most things were "eatable", but I would never go back there to eat. They accept cash and amex only.
