I tried this place out over this past weekend. I had always heard about Red Hook Lobster Pound and finally found myself to be in the neighborhood. I went with fellow lobster lovers and we all enjoyed it. I had the lobster roll and enjoyed every bite. They offer 2 variations - cold and hot. I got the cold one but tried a piece if the hot one from a friend. The hot version was greatly spiced but I think I'd prefer sticking with the cold. I've never been to Maine for it's famous lobsters and lobster rolls but if it tastes anything like this I can't wait to make the trip. A great place for anyone that enjoys lobsters. They also had this great tasting homemade iced tea. I'll definitely be making a trip out there more often.
