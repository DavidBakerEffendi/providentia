We went to the Meatball Shop on a Saturday night, and while it was crowded, our total wait time before being seated was only 10 minutes.  I also think that was because we came towards the early part of the night, around 6, I saw that there was a longer line by the time we left.  We were seated at the big communal table, and even though I would've preferred sitting at a stand-alone table, it didn't affect our dining experience at all. For dinner we got: the naked beef balls with a spicy tomato sauce and rigatoni, a spicy pork slider with creamy parmesan sauce, the special meatball slider (they have daily specials), which happened to be a buffalo chicken slider with Frank's hot sauce and blue cheese dressing, and mashed potatoes.  All of the above were YUM.  The meatballs are pretty sizable, so getting 3-4 is more than enough to fill you up.  The rigatoni was al dente, and the mashed potatoes were divine.  I might have liked the creamy mashed potatoes more than the meatballs, actually.  Our favorite out of the meatballs we ordered was the buffalo chicken, which tasted exactly like buffalo wings in meatball form.  But since it was a daily special, I'm not sure how often they put it on the menu. We worried it might be too little food since sliders are pretty small, but it turned out to be a good amount (though we probably could've added an extra slider or two if we were starving).  We ordered the ice cream sandwich as well, and the good thing about it is that you can get two different cookies for the top and bottom.  The peanut butter cookie was soft and peanut buttery.  All in all, it was a delicious way to cap off the savory dinner. Will definitely come back, especially if we are in the area again.  All of our food came out to around $30 (meatball entree, 2 sides, 2 sliders, dessert, 1 drink), which you can't beat.
