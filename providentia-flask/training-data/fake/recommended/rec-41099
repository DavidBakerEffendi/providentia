Long story short, this might be the best meal I've had all year. Food: 5 stars. Every single dish was amazing Ambience: 4.5 stars. Cozy.  Nice and open in the front, garden seating in the back. Service: 4.5 stars.  Friendly and helpful.  Nothing crazy. Stopped in here on a beautiful summer day, just looking for a decent place to grab a quick bite.  I hadn't heard about this place opening and it looked cute enough. The order... -Burrata with speck, figs, and hazelnuts -Roasted beets with pistachios and horseradish yogurt -Garganelli with peakytoe crab, salted roe, and saffron broth I've had meals that do some, or most, dishes well.  This was one of those rare moments where everything came together.  Every single dish was amazing. The burrata was flavorful and the speck and figs complimented it nicely.  The roasted beets were the most surprising.  So simple, but so delicious.  I barely knew what I was eating, but I loved it. The final dish was the perfect combination of seafood and pasta.  Baker & Co is reasonably priced so I expected a mediocre showing here.  They exceeded my expectations.  This pasta was better than many of the more expensive restaurants in the area.  Would come back just for this dish. Go here now. You won't regret it.
