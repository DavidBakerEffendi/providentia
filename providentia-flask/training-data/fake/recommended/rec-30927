Where do I begin? So by now it is clear that I am greedy. I have been planning this meal forever with my homie Ava E. I have read soooo many good things about the chicken that I could not wait to try it. I was very disappointed. The chicken (mild) was completely devoid of flavor. Completely. The skin was crunchy and had some black pepper but the chicken itself was bland. I had to look around. Was I in a soulfood spot? Didi they run out of Lawry's? WTH???? My collard greens and mac were both lukewarm and no big deal. The highlight of the meal was the half and half (Tiger Woods) and the bourbon brown butter cake. I also had a crab cake which was just ok but the salad was delicious. Sad to say I will not be returning....damn I hate being let down!
