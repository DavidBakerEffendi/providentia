Can man survive on just brunch? Can a restaurant? I made the insanely rookie mistake of coming here based on the 4 star Yelp average after getting quoted a 2 hour wait at Root and Bone. What kind of garbage are you eating in your daily life that this is a 4 star restaurant? Demand more for yourselves, people. First of all, we walk in and the manager immediately starts her elevator pitch of "everything is made fresh to order", which all sounded somewhat compelling until you realize, hey, this is not Applebee's, why wouldn't everything be made fresh to order? Is this not a restaurant? It feels like a sterile imitation of a collection of popular cliches like the brick stone oven, "market to table", mason jars, etc. etc. Until you get to the cocktail menu, and you realize you may have made a terrible terrible mistake when you see names like, "cool & sexy" and "One hot mama". Everything was unremarkable, bland, to bad. We ordered corn fritters (dry and bland), beets and carrots (a giant bowl of roughage), mac and cheese (flavorless), pumpkin ravioli (just oily and dry), pizza (bland), and a burger. I found the bread to be inedible and the pizza to be one of the most disappointing rendition of brick oven pizza. The only decent item was the burger, which was unfortunately accompanied by some of the saddest looking fries ever (like the serving was a collection of the leftover scraps from other servings). To top this off, the waitress was hot and cold - never finishing her sentence at the table, she is always halfway across the room by the time she finishes a sentence directly addressed to you; keep in mind that we were one of 4 tables seated at the entire restaurant. After we finished our meal, I realized that the 4 star rating is the result of brunch feens. Of course, of course. When are you going to stop being so basic?
