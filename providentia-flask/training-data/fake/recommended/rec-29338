This neighborhood place serves "Italian diner food". It is similar to nearby Tarantella's in Clark, with an extensive menu of soups, salads, dinner entr√©es, pastas including homemade raviolis, hot & cold subs, and various size pizzas cooked in gas-fired steel ovens. The side salad was run-of-the-mill, but the special house balsamic dressing was tasty. Margarhita pizza was topped with a very good tomato sauce, but needed more cheese, and the crust was like something that you would buy in the supermarket. The cavatelli with broccoli and diced tomatoes was bland and gummy. Chicken Murphy was OK. There was a good balance between the bell peppers, hot peppers, and onions, but the sliced potatoes were overcooked. The side of linguini was likewise overcooked and lifeless, and the marinara was not as robust as the pizza sauce. They have table tents with photos of the desserts, so, as the first reviewer noted, those items are obviously bought in. I noticed a lot of very large people eating here, and taking doggie bags home to boot. Not sure what that says about this place, other than that portions are generous. Prices were reasonable, and service was fine, but I wouldn't bother to eat here again.
