There's nothing spectacular about SayCheese except the truck staff. The owner is a major dbag that stalks and talks smack about the other vendors. If he spent more time on developing a better consistent product and less time checking out the Drexel girls and talking smack, maybe the food would be better... It's average at best but his stuff doesn't compete anywhere near Mac Mart, Â and the cheesesteak is just a cheesesteak... Staff excellent! Owner makes the experience never wanting me to visit again.., there are better trucks at 33rd n Arch than this one...
