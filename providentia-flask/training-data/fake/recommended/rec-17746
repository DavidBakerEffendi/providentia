Sunday brunch at Winberie's has long been a favourite of mine!  i used to get so excited when i was younger and my parents suggested going here for brunch, i mean as a little kid it felt like there were a million choices and OMG you could make your own waffles!!  so awesome!! not too much has changed over the years, except you can't make your own waffles anymore.  but they do make omelettes for you, so i guess that is still cool but not as cool as making your own waffle.  however, the rest of the brunch choices are just as delicious as they used to be!  my favourite is the applewood smoked bacon that is sooooo good and just the right side of crispy.  they also have mini belgian waffles and french toast sticks with toppings of blueberry compote, warmed maple syrup, chocolate chips, walnuts, and fresh whipped cream.   there are the regular breakfast items like eggs and sausage and fried potatoes, but then there is also the omelette station and a carvery station, and cold salads and smoked fish and huge trays of fresh fruit and hot lunch items that change every week.  i'm literally overwhelmed by the choice and have to have a little spoonful of everything available!  and then it's time for dessert....  mini everything!!  my particular favourite is the mini cannolis mmmmmmmm. it's a bit pricey at $20 a person, but this includes unlimited visits to the food stations and drinks like tea, coffee, soda, or juice.  so if you can make enough visits then you can guarantee your money's worth!  i'm definitely a fan of Winberie's sunday brunch but i can't comment on much else as it's been years since i've had any other meal here.  but sunday brunch AMAZING!!!
