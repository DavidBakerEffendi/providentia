It was a beautiful afternoon and thought sushi etc. would be nice on an outdoor deck, which is available at Sakura Garden. The service was poor. First of all, they had a person fixing the door to the outside using a drill. I had to request that they stop this because of the noise. I ordered Sushi first and then Pad Thai to be served after the sushi so that we could enjoy the Pad Thai hot. Didn't happen. It was all served at the same time. When the Pad Thai became cold, as expected, I had to get up from my seat and go inside and find the waitress to have her warm it up. The food tasted good but the service put a damper on what could have been a great dining experience. Plan B, the burger restaurant next door, had a packed deck, unlike Sakura Garden. The name of the the Burger restaurant is very appropriate considering the service that we got next door. * * *
