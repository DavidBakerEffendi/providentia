We really enjoyed our experience here. We got our meal to go and then sat out on the cafe tables in front  of the shop. You can get waiter service here as well. I had chicken meatballs with parmesan cream sauce over creamy polenta and it was delish. In fact, I loved it. Hubby had beef meatballs with spicy tomato sauce over spaghetti and we split a side  of daily greens. Hubby liked his meal too. I could not finish my meal but hubby  ate what I could not. He was not a fan of the polenta, said it tasted like cream of wheat. We returned later for ice cream and espresso. Yummo. I would eat here again!
