Hmmm... I am split as I write this review. The food, especially the Chicken Wings (Soy Garlic) were the best.wings I've had. There is a little magic in the wings, they are light, & unlike regular wings, just the right Â amount of sauce. I am curious to see how this place is in a few months time once it gets more established.
