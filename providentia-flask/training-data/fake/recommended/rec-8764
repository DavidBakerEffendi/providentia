I love their tuna tartare. I think it's because of the addicting peanut sauce drizzled all around everything and the fresh tortilla chips. Came here for a quick birthday dinner before hitting the bars/clubs. The food came out really fast, which was a little weird because it seemed like "fast food". Two of us ordered their sugary cocktails, something "delight" and "room with a view"? (I don't remember the names). They were both really sugary and not very good. We all liked our food and the service was very prompt. Love the ambiance and decor.
