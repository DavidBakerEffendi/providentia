We parked across the street in a 30 min zone, so time was a bit of an issue. I normally don't like to eat and run, but finding parking in Chinatown is a pain, so I pulled into the first spot I found. Â We didn't originally have this place in mind, but since we were short on time and nearby decided to give it a try ( I recognized the name from Yelp). As soon as we entered, we were greeted and seated immediately, and put in our order within 5 min. However, unsure that 25 min was enough time for the food to be served and for us to finish concerned me. After another short 5 -ish min, just as soon as I thought I should move my car, the food came out. We had 20 min to enjoy every last spoonful of the hot, fresh, hand drawn noodles, and we did. The broth was warm and soothing on the cold winter day and seasoned well with cilantro, green onion and spinach- all fresh. The meat we ordered, duck and ox tail paired well with the soup, but after reading the reviews on the brisket, decided that's a must for next time and there WILL be a next time! We grabbed a to-go menu and noticed that you can add an egg for an addtn'l $0.50. That will also be on our order for next time. I can't wait to go back!
