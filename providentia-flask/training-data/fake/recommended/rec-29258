Food was delicious. Steak sub was huge. I had to wrap half up and take it to go. It was a very good price as well. The woman behind the counter was a gem. I'm definitely going there if I am in the area again.  Awesome that this place is open late.  Keep in mind that this is cash only place.  Chubby's is across the street and frankly, I choose this place every time over them.  Seating is fairly limited.  I have only been there in the winter time so I am not sure if they do outdoor seating but I think they might.
