Started with a sashimi appetizer:  Very fresh with acute slices of various fish you'd expect. Vegetables ordered:  Zucchini and okra; both very good (but how does one ruin veggies from a grill anyway?) Seafood:  Salmon, hamachi and hotate all were very, very fresh Meat:  Chicken breast, very juicy.  Kobe beef; like a bite of heaven. I wanted to keep ordering but I simply could not eat more. Needless to say, the service was also very friendly too.
