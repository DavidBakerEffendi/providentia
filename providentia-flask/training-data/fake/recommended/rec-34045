This place was raved about, and I have been meaning to check it out for the past three years since I have lived in Burlington.  I FINALLY made it there last night and, for the most part, was greatly satisfied.  I was pumped for the mock eel because so many people had suggested it and said it was not to be missed.  Now as a lover of salt (think salt on pizza kind of into salt) I was surprised that even I was turned off by the saltiness of the dish.  It was a totally sodium overload, and I could only eat a few pieces before putting down my chopsticks.  But after the initial disappointment, the rest of the meal proved to be extremely yummy.  The meat bun, although the simplest of our order was actually the best.  It was made to perfection!  I would definitely return to try out some of the other items we weren't able to taste this time around!
