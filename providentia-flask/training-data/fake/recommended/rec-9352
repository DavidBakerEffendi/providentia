Overall, good! I'm satisfied with my food, service is good, staff seems to hv fun here, the environment is clean and hippie. They hv a full bar with two TVs, happy hr from 3-6pm I think. I wish I don't hv class so that I could try their drinks! I had the duck burger, very different but good! The sweet potato fries are good. And they hv the Mexican coke products.
