Come here for the sushi! I don't know why everyone else is talking about their ramen; I tried it once and was not happy. Their sushi is great for the price. I love the King Kong. The miso is delicious. Fried ice cream is a little soggy. This is pretty much the only place I get sushi in Burlington because their prices are very reasonable and there is virtually no waiting involved. Also delicious: the shrimp gyoza.
