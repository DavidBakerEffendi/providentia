After all the talk I've heard about El Rey, I finally went, only to be slightly disappointed. The inside is pretty cool - dark and loud and trendy. I went with a group of friends and we shared a pitcher of guava margarita. The pitcher is meant for a group of four, but the waiter offered to stretch it so that all five of our party could enjoy. This was a thoughtful gesture. Nevertheless, the margarita underwhelmed me by its oversubtlety of guava flavoring. For food, we had a guacamole appetizer which was pretty good. The chips tasted fresh and had a satisfying crunch and the guacamole was smooth and tasty. For my meal, I ordered the carnitas tacos. For $8, you get three tacos the size of your palm (and I have small hands), so definitely consider the portions if you are hungry. Even with a squeeze of lime over them, I thought the tacos were a little dry and without too much flavor. I admit I would probably indulge in them again if I were there for their $1 tacos happy hour. My one friend who decided not to get tacos seemed to enjoy his enchiladas and side of $4 rice. So I can't speak for their entire menu since our table was dominated by tacos of all meats, but I wasn't inspired to go back and explore the rest of the menu.
