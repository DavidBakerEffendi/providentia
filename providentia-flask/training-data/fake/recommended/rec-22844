A quaint but stylish establishment with a cool vibe and good playlist of background music to drive home the hipness. Our party started with some of the best spring rolls ever, everyone in agreement. Ordered the @9 mixed puffs, the round puff being the best of the trio. Entrees included Pad Thai with chicken, Panang curry, and lava chicken (served flaming). All were great choices with the Panang being the standout selection. Had our party been larger there were other options that we would liked to have sampled, so a return visit is a must. Whether an out of town visitor or local, put At Nine on your must try Thai establishments.
