Is it possible for Batali to have at least one mediocre place... instead of fantastic? This is another culinary delight. Even the most plain sounding dish is incredible. It's like reading a Calvino novel where the most mundane becomes the most elaborate and the flavors all work... almost too good. Just some favorites: sardines, baccala, linguine & clams.
