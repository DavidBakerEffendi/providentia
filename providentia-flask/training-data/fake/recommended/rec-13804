My friend who moved to NYC introduced me to this place and I go there when I visit the city. There are several similar food carts in the area, but only this one has long lines. When I visited it recently, they had two carts on each side of the avenue. It was dinner time and lots of people were sitting around eating rice bowls or walking away with yellow to-go bags. It was very spicy. I thought it was the sauce, but it was the meat. The rice was delicious. Thanks to Yelp, I learned there's a cart a little closer to home in Austin.
