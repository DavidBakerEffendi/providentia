**WARNING it's cash only. AND one of the servers will scam you if you're foreign!! We were seated next to a couple of women who were tourists and English was not their first language. Their server was Natasha. Somehow they had gratuity added to their bill. It wasn't added to our party of 4!!! They had figured out that gratuity was added to their bill $45 total and put down $60 cash then their server Natasha asked if they wanted change...and they were thrown off and she just went "no? Ok" didn't even give them much of a chance to respond or benefit of the doubt. It seemed super obvious to us she was trying to take advantage of the fact that they didn't speak English and added gratuity to their bill and was trying to scam them for more!! The poor ladies looked so confused and then the one with more English spoke up as Natasha was walking away and said "oh change yes." And then when she brought back the change one of the ladies picked up the bill and showed Natasha the line that said "gratuity" and said "tip right?" And Natasha said "yes." Close call there for those ladies about to tip an additional $15 dollars on top of the gratuity they already paid. Which shouldn't have been added to their bill! First of all, as a former server, you just don't ask if someone needs change, it's tacky. Especially if they're foreign and barely speak English you just bring freaking change! If they mention they don't need change while you're taking the bill that's fine. But you don't just assume, so tacky. But we really think she was scamming them. Food: I got the blueberry pancakes- what makes them special is the maple butter syrup on the side. It's not really syrupy or super sweet more like maple flavored melted butter. But good. The biscuit was AMAZING with raspberry preserves. The best biscuit I've ever had. Potato latkes were really good too with the apple sauce.
