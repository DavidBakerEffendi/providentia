I went back for dinner at Chatni. And I ordered the same exact entrees as my previous visit. And it was excellent!!!!! Â The chicken Karahi was tasty and spicy (as I requested). The chicken tikka masala was creamy and flavorful. The garlic nan and rice were as expected. I will definitely be back again. The service was superb. No complaints.
