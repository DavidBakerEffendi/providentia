Not just another cafe. First off, I've been here like a bazillion times, and that must say something for the place, huh?  Well of course I can crawl out of bed and walk there in a minute, but still. It's across the street from the supermarket at 23rd and South Street, so yeah, there is little to no parking if you are driving there, especially on weekends.   It's cozy inside, haha, yeah meaning its kinda small, but it works.  Counter seating in the front, some tables with bench seating in the middle, more counter seats in the rear, and then a patio with a few tables as well.  In warmer weather you can't beat the patio, but it fills up fast. The menu is pretty good, something for most.  Things I get a lot are the creme brulee french toast, the dill scrambled eggs, and the egg, ham and brie sandwich (a gooey mess that's so worth it). Oh yeah almost forgot the smoked salmon BLT and the sweet potato fries, mmm.   The staff is very friendly, even when this place is very busy.  This is key first thing in the morning when you just don't want to deal with shit! Coffee, breakfast, brunch, whatever, this place fits right in!
