This place was ok. It's clean, the food is decent, the drinks are pretty good. But was VERY overpriced for the quality of food you get. I don't mind dropping $120 for a fabulous meal, but it bothers me when what I get would cost me $75 anywhere else. I had the fresh Mozzarella and tomatoes which were just that. No balsamic, no basil. The tomatoes were tasteless and the Mozzarella was sloppily sliced, so the slices were too thick and not as good as they could have been. At $10 for the plate, I'd expect it to at least be done better. We got Calamari, it was ok. Not the best I've ever had, but not the worst either. My husband got the Gnocchi and it was very good. It was just an OK meal. Nothing exciting. DEFINITELY not worth the price.
