I am going to go with Red Hook Lobster Pound over Luke's. This place is a bit far to get to but there's a wide variety of goodness at this little spot. For starters, you can go with the Maine or Connecticut style. Cold with mayo or hot with butter. Both choices are great so I usually get one of each. The buns here are toasty and so buttery inside. If you're going with a group, have one person hold the seating down. There's a separate dining room next door you can chow down at. If it's your first time, try one of each. The lobster mac and cheese here is pretty darn good. Pasta shells with lots of melted cheese (they use 4 types) and tender chunks of robster. The bisques and chowder are pretty good too. Steve's Key Lime Pie, just the right size to finish the lobster fest. P.S. - Really random but the Tuna Melt here is off the chain.
