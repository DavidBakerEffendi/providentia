Trying the Mighty Mashroom roll was like eating the freshest forest ever--what an amazing experience! The rolls are very colorful and tasty. You must try this vegan place even if you are avid meat-eater. I was visiting for a week, and found myself eating more than once here. The juices are also a must try. Will definitely go back when I visit again.
