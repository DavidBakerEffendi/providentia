I have to say I had the best diners there. Even better than many Manhattan establishments(... at little italy)!!!!!! +great food   recommend    eggplant rollatini   potato croquets   fried calamari   sicilian/square pizza   spumomi  ..... of course tiramisu   salad platter- it's huge +good for family +roomy outdoor seating, which is fun in the summer, especially for kids   +/- long wait near dinner hours but worth it!!!!!!!!!!!! -tight indoor seating
