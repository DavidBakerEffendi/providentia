I was at the Newark Airport and looking for something to eat. Ruby Tuesday was completely packed so I decided to come here. I was in the mood for seafood so it worked out. Wanted to start with the New England Clam Chowder but they said they had been out for awhile. I hate this excuse. If you are out of something, take it off the menu, especially if its been out "for awhile". I decided to have the Cream of Clam soup which was ok but nothing special. I would pass. I then decided to have the crab cake with fried shrimp, mashed potatoes and waffle fries. It was all really really good. It was a bit pricey but you are getting crab cakes which is always a bit more.
