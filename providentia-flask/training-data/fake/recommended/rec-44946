An excellent late night meal in a great space. We had a late dinner (seated at 11:15pm) at Locanda Verde and it was still quite busy but we got a table right away. The space is big, interesting and comfortable, but not too loud or crowded. The service was overall good, with a friendly and knowledgeable staff. There was a bit of team service "server switching" which I find a bit annoying, but nothing was messed up so it wasn't that big of a deal. My martini was unfortunately watery, which is something that doesn't surprise me, but does annoy me when I'm paying $15 a cocktail and ask for it to be stirred. But the food made up for the cocktail shortcoming. The pasta was really fantastic. I had "grandma's ravioli" and it was delicious. A very classic meat filling wrapped in fresh, excellent pasta in an equally classic and extremely well executed light tomato sauce. The ricotta is also great. Overall a nice space and reasonably priced menu with excellent food. Certainly a place to visit again.
