This is my first review on yelp Went to il pittore for NYE Loved it Bread & Butter were great, especially the focaccia Lamb Sausage app was awesome Favorite paste was the pappardelle The suckling pig was out of this world Also loved the prosciutto wrapped Monkfish Wine list was extensive and the waiter we had was friendly and in the mood to joke around which I like a lot Very pricey definitely go there Would like to experience eating at the counter as well
