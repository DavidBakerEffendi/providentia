Finally had a chance to eat here last night and the good AND bad of it is that now I will want it all the time. Good pasta just makes me happy. We ordered the Mista salad (fresh and delicious), calamari (nice and crunchy with amazing marinara), minestrone soup (all fresh ingredients and sooooooo delicious) and the best for last was the pasta - Penne Il Porto (shrimp, asparagus and vodka sauce). Accompanied by 2 glasses of white wine sangria and our bill was only $60. Hello? I found Nirvana. I want to try the other soups. I can tell they put a lot of effort into the minestrone, so I bet the others are delicious as well. And of course I want to try the pizza. Yum!!
