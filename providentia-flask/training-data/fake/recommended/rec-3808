The awning for the new Chavella's on Franklin had been up for months and months before it opened. On a stretch of restaurants without any Mexican, it certainly was a site for sore eyes. But there it sat, close to the public, waiting for something. Rumors flew about the possible reasons for the delay. Liquor license? Access for the disabled? New York City bureaucracy? I don't have the answer to this question, but I did eat there. Similar to Chavella's other location, the food here is adequate. Nothing mind blowing, nothing awful. Decent. The guacamole still comes with the option of tostada-sized chips or mini-tortillas. The elotes were hot and sweet. The tacos tasted slightly dry, but fairly tasty. And I liked the idea of a Manhattan made with tequila, but the taste was a little bit weird. Again, like the original, the pace is a bit frantic. And while the waitstaff is new, they're handling it pretty well, a few kinks aside. It's a decent spot for food, and always convenient, but not necessarily the best.
