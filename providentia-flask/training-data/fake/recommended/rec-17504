From start to finish, this restaurant was perfect. We started with the Garlic Bread, then Gambas Al Ajillo (Shrimp with Garlic Sauce), and for dinner, myself and 2 other people from our party ordered ordered Paella Valenciana (With Red Sauce), it had shellfish, rice, chicken, and sausage. It was to die for. It was so tasty. The portions are HUGE! It is recommended to share or take the left overs home! Our waiter Alex was EXCELLENT. He was very knowledgeable, funny, polite and helpful.
