I would definitely recommend this spot for anyone searching for outstanding Cuban food! I ate here twice within two weeks (rare for me) and I could definitely see it being a weekly stop if I lived in the area. The food is intoxicatingly good. Both times I ordered fish dishes, rice and peas, and plantains. They have an appetizer of chicken lollipops that are definitely more delicious than they sound! The ambiance is a direct throwback to old Cuba. Gorgeous. The courtyard is especially beautiful at night. The second trip I took my 6yr old and was very pleased when a hostess engaged him in a bit of conversation. Always a plus when establishments treat kids as people too. The only reason I am leaving 4 out of 5 stars is because the noise level is too loud to carry on conversation. Not great for getting to know someone on a date or a relaxing evening. But I am definitely a fan and will continue to go!
