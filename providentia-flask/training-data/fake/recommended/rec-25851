This is my ideal Italian place!!  Unpretentious, cozy, and absolutely delicious, spot on food.  I would've come in just for the garlic bread, which is crispy, soft, and loaded with fresh roasted garlic.  Your breath will stank but it's okay. The food itself is a bit heavy though, it reminds me of my grandma's home cooking.  I had the goat cheese ravioli, bf had the lasagna.  Everything is impeccably cooked, best ravioli I've ever had (sorry grandma!).   After filling up on garlic bread I wasn't feeling too hungry, but the ravioli disappeared a lot faster than I would've liked.  I stared at my plate sadly then stole some of my bf's lasagna (also deeeelish). In the middle of our meal, the waiters started singing happy birthday to one of the patrons, and the entire restaurant joined in and applauded.  The tables are so close that you can't help but chat up the people next to you.  The woman next to me got the linguini with meatballs, biggest friggin meatballs I've ever seen in my life!  Insert sexual joke here.  I really like the vibe, it's homey and inviting.  Make reservations though!!  My bf and I had to wait with reservations, and it was packed the entire time we were there.  I can't imagine how long it would take to get a table without one.
