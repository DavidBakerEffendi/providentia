I came here for a beer while we were waiting for another restaurant to open. The beer ran out so we got one beer for free (it wasn't very good anyways). We sat at the bar and I felt gum underneath the counter, which was kind of gross. I was glad we went to Izakaya Ten afterwards. Maybe we didn't order the right beverage, but we wanted the cheapest and weren't planning on staying for long. I would give it another chance if I'm in the area.
