Been here before, decent enough ramen. But their customer service sucks. Going in at 257pm today, I still expect to be able to order something quick. For takeout if necessary. But no, they says they're closed, I walk out and notice the sign says closed at 3pm.  So I walk back in and say the sign says 3pm, but they say the kitchen is closed. piss-poor way to run a business.  I've been part of enough restaurants, and I still work in retail.
