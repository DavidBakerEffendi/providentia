I've done the tasting (Monday nights in the basement) twice and it is a blast. They just keep bringing more and more food to share family style. If you don't like spicy, don't show up. But if you do you'll get some awesome food for a great price ($25) and not too mention some funny stories / banter from Han himself. I will definitely be back.
