Wow! Â One of the best Greek places ever. You know a place is good when it's absolutely full on a Wednesday night in the 'burbs. We started with Taramosalata, the caviar dip. Decadent and delicious, it was served with a warm, almost buttery-tasting pita. I could have eaten that for dinner and been satisfied. For dinner I had the Arni Kokkinisto, lamb in tomato sauce with orzo. It was out of this world! I was in absolute heaven. My dining companion ordered a rib-eye steak, which seemed odd when looking at the rest of the menu specialties, but it was quite good. He had it with the lemon potatoes. Dessert was Greek coffee and Loukomades. I enjoyed this place so much that when I got home I immediately made a list of all the friends who need to know about this place. It's that good. Even though they were very crowded (and there was a party) the service was attentive. I can't wait to go back.
