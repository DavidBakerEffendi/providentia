I'm going to throw caution to the wind and give Johnny Brenda's five stars based off one visit.  Maybe I still haven't come down from seeing Langhorne Slim there last night* but I can't imagine a better venue.  The stage is visible from most areas (with projectors displaying a low-res version on the walls behind the stage to accommodate any blind spots plus a pretty good set-up with the lights), there's a bar with great local drafts on every floor, the balcony is chill.  I'm told the food is good, though I haven't had the chance to test that for myself.  Definitely coming back here. * A performance that could accurately be called "a rollicking good time."
