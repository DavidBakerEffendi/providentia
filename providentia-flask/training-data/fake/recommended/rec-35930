Soft shell crab.  Good?  Mostly.  Great?  No.  The food at this place is pretty good, mostly standard for a Thai place, I'd say, minus a few of its dishes.  While I appreciate some authority and originality, it just wasn't quite there for me. Like the Jane, this place seems to ride a little more off hype than merit.  The swanky "fun" interior was a bit much as far as enjoyability goes.  Not to sound grumpy, but it just didn't jive with the big picture.  While that's a more superficial quality, it definitely impedes my overall judgment of the place. It's at least and easy place to come eat, despite getting pretty busy, but I don't think we'll be back here again.
