The Umami Burger in NYC is just as great as the ones in LA food-wise - and maybe even better from an ambiance & drinks point of view. The burgers are all fantastic. In a city with so many burger places, Umami offers more variety/ originality than the classics, e.g. the duck burger or the tuna burger. Plus all the classics with downpours of truffle cheese and bacon. I was sitting upstairs at the bar and I really liked the vibe there, including the zinfandel the bartender recommended and the bourbon-based cocktail. Rock on.
