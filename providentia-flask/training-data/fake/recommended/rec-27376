Overrated. Desserts and drinks were very good. But that's where it ends. The entrees were underwhelming and not very flavorful. But I'd go back for drinks and dessert. 11/12/13 Edit So about two months ago, I went back to SoCo, at the request of one of my friends. This time we went for BRUNCH. Well, let me say, my brunch experience was totally different from my dinner experience. I really enjoyed it. I had some type of eggs benedict with a crab and fish cake. It was delicious. My friend and I ordered a mac n cheese to share. It was delicious. But SUPER heavy!!! Anyway, my verdict is this. Would def go again for brunch, but would say No to dinner.
