Coming all the way from California on a red eye, with our flights messed up we wanted something delish to start our trip (and our morning) off right.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the wait BUT I am sooooo glad we waited. I love their system of taking your mobile number and texting you when your table is ready. That allowed us to walk around and find a Dunkin Donuts where we had coffee and planned more of our trip. There were 4 of us and not a complaint about the food.  We all sampled some of each other's food and I have to say I am impressed. I had the eggs Benedict with salmon and a side of cheesy grits. I have to say it is in the top 3 meals I've eaten in my life! I wish I could eat like that all of the time!
