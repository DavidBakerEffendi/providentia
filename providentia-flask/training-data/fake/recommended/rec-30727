Hearth is great -- I'd say it offers the best combination of exquisite food and great service in the East Village. The ambience is comfortable and cozy -- refined but casual, in keeping with its East Village location. The menu veers away from the familiar, tried-and-true, but the chef's experiments rarely go awry, and the staff does a great job of keeping up with a menu that changes often to keep up with local, even obscure, offerings and menu items based on the latest from the farmer's market.  The full menu is available at the bar, should you (like me) occasionally wander by without a reservation. Our dinner was great, from the lentil soup to the fava bean salad to the gnocchi and the grapefruit cheesecake.  I should come here more often!
