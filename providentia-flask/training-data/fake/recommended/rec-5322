I came here for dinner with my husband last week when we were in town for a business trip. Immediately upon entering, our eyes were drawn upwards to the large, decorative light and the swinging basket seats on the second level. From the furniture to the outfits the waitresses were wearing, we felt like we were thrown back to the '70s and thought it was kinda cool! Definitely something you don't get to experience often. We chose the restaurant based upon its proximity to our hotel and because of a recommendation from a coworker. That said, we had no idea what type of food was served. After looking over the menu and speaking with our waitress (who appeared to be in training), we ordered 3 items to share - Thai Rock Shrimp Tacos, Grilled Thai Chicken Skewers, and Chopped Mexican Salad. It took a while for our food to come out and since it's an open kitchen we only received one dish at a time, not to mention one of our orders got messed up. Despite the slower than expected service, the food was good. The shrimp tacos were tasty, but could have used a few more pieces of shrimp. The chicken skewers had a nice marinade. And the salad had chunks of avocado, corn, and jalape√±os which gave it a nice kick. My husband was still hungry so he ordered the Beer Battered Shrimp & Calamari. Again, good but not out of this word. All in all, it was a fun experience but for the price I'd recommend going somewhere else. It would be fun to go with a group after work or for a happy hour (they had a good looking drink menu!), but wasn't my favorite dinner experience.
