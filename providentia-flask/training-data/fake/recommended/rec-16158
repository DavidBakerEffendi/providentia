A regular favorite of our interns, I decided to 'tag along' one day and acquaint myself with what I'd been missing out on. Not immediately evident from the road side vantage point, this place is deceptively spacious inside. The meals are simple and well priced. Following a lovely lunch with my work team, I took my Australian family here while they were in town. My father almost fell off his chair when he spied the perceived bargain in the form of the poached eggs on toast and coffee combo. I didn't want to dampen his excitement by converting the 'bargain' to Aussie dollars - but it was still a good price nonetheless. Overall, Cafe Orlin has a very casual feel and is a perfect respite for a relaxed brunch - provided you can get a seat!
