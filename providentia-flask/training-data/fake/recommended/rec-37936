Finally ventured down to Tashan for an early dinner.  We were seated in the wine room which for us worked out since much quieter then the front of the restaurant.  Waiter was very helpful in explaining how the menu works.  Food comes out as it is ready.  We started with Tandoori Shrimp and raw oysters.  It seemed a little odd after the explanation  of how the kitchen works that we were finished eating the shrimp before the oysters arrived - hmmmm -  raw vs. cooked.  We then ordered a small plate of creamed spinach - lamb shank and crispy duck  for large plates.  I have to say everything was great but the best dish of the night was the creamed spinach.  Both meat dishes had great flavor but the lamb was very chewy and the duck was very tough - even hard to cut with the knives provided.  The overall experience was enjoyable and I know we will go back to try again.  Only other oddity is on open table it list it as $$ which is certainly not the case - Our dinner with one glass of wine and dessert was $145 before tip.
