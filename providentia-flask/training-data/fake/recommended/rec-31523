Every review I read lately I think everyone tries to be a critic... trying to break down every dish they have and run home to their Mac and log onto Yelp, it takes away from the experience guys..  It's like people  break down the sauce that was served on the ravioli's like they are writing for Saveur Magazine.  "The sauce was creamy, rich, but delicate and spicy with a ting of lemon zest that  left my tongue craving for more" Give it a rest. ... I just say, "shit was good and I couldn't stop eating it" Osteria is good,  real good, not great.  No misses on anything I ate and I have been here a few times.  Last night was the old mans birthday dinner.  We had a few pizzas, the antipasti, and pasta.  The food is very spot on and in my opinion this place is as good as Vetri(see my review) for about 1/3 of the price.  Service is better at Vetri but I like how there is a bar here. Bottom line, high end Italian that is not cheap but prob top 3 Italian restaurants in the city.
