A solid Thai joint in Hells Kitchen.  I particularly like this spot, because you can slightly impress your out-of-town guests without spending a lot of dough.  The interior of the restaurant is funky and trendy.  The food presentation is top notch as well.  Not many complaints when you get a bill for $11 for dinner (sans alcohol).  The portions are huge as well.  They offer some creative takes on traditional Thai food.  Their menu is pretty extensive and they offer imitation duck as a veggie option.  Service is great and the girls always look really cute in their mini hat headbands. The mojitos are yummy, served in a rather large glass and are reasonably priced to boot. And I love that when you order tofu and veggie curry, there's quite possibly every type of vegetable found in the dish -- eggplant, peppers, carrots, mushrooms, bok choy, bamboo shoots, mini corn, string beans, etc.
