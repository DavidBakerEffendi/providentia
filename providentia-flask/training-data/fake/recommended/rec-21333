Lunch here is great. I always look forward to the lamb sandwich which is incredible. Unfortunately we just got back from dinner here and it was abysmal. Everyone raves about the eggplant dip and rightly so. It was the Â highlight of the meal. The octopus was absolutely disgusting. I knew we made a mistake the moment the plate was put in front of us. Totally unappetizing presentation and I truly almost gagged as I bit into it. It tasted and smelled like cat food. I love octopus. This was an abomination. We left and grabbed some ice cream around the corner just to get rid of the taste in our mouths. Seriously what are they thinking with that dish??
