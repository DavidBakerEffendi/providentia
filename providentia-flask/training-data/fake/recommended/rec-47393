Their hot sauce ALWAYS gives me the hiccups, but one of my best friends loves it. I eat spicy, hot, african/carribbean spice all the time, so not sure why I get that reaction. Anyway, I never thought there was anything that amazing about these guys that warranted the ridiculous lines they always have. I'm just glad we were all over them before they got hot. Doubt I would go back now.... Unless I time travel back to my early 20s and embark on another classic 4am food conquest...
