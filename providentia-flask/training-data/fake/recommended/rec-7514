This place was great. Loved the ambiance and d√©cor. I felt like a child looking up and down and around, at all the decorations, beautiful paintings, pictures, the ceiling, even the bathroom had my eyes wide open. The cozy love seat/sofa we sat on was adorable. I had a glass of reisling while my friend had malbec. For appetizers we got the meatballs and vegetarian spring rolls. Very good but didn't like the sauces the rolls came with. Portions were pretty small so I was pleasantly surprised. (hate overeating) For dinner I ordered scallops with mashed potatoes, and asparagus wrapped in bacon. Absolutely delicious. Nothing left on my plate. My friend ordered fried cod and French fries, which I tasted. The fries were ok, the cod was good! I would definitely go back. :)
