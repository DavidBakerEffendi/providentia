Loved this place! We were not disapointed by the ratings here. Very cozy place with delicious food. We ordered some wine and fish, which was well made and had some sensational taste! I also enjoyed the free bread and olive oil with sea salt in it, they give you to each meal. Tasted really nice. the good thing is they also serve quite late. we went there on a weeknight at 11pm.
