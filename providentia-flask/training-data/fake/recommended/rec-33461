Pork bun! 4**** I got the pork bun and the Akamaru Modern. First bite of pork bun raised my expectation so high that I was disappointed with the Akamaru Modern. I'm sorry to say but it's not worth my waiting (45-60mins for 1 seat) if I'm gonna get the ramen only. It's way too salty and oh yeah, they don't take to-go order *pout* I hate waiting to be seated (eventhough I went there alone to avoid the waiting time... but still have to wait for 45 mins??! Crazy); I hate waiting for my glass to be filled; I hate waiting for my check to come...; I hate this place cause it's too noisy for a lazy dinner but what to do?? The pork bun is to-die for although it's expensive. $8 for 2 pork buns? And no to-go?? So that means I have to encounter all my hatreds for the waiting and place just to get my pork bun? Unfortunately, I'll say yes, I'm going to wait again and come to this place although I hate it. I'll do this just for you pork bun-sama. Just for you!
