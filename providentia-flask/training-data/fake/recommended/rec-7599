Good bar food, decent drink specials. Haven't been there for live music, which i hear is worth checking out, but I did go to watch a football game on a monday night, and it was packed. Loud, fun, and great atmosphere. People of all ages were really enjoying themselves. College kids, locals, and older crowds. Will be returning soon to see live music because if a game night was this much fun, I can only imagine how a night with a live band will be.
