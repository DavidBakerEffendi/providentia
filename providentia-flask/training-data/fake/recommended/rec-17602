I happened to be there that same night the others were there 3/6/10.   There are ALWAYS two side to each story.  They failed to mention how the "husband" who was much bigger than the manager tried to fight the manager.  The "husband" followed the manager into the restaurant trying to pick a fight. I would get into more details but find it sad that people who claim to be customers for 2 years never rated it until they had a complaint.   But anyways..  Cuban Pete's is now one of my favorite places.  The food is great, the place is fun and lively.
