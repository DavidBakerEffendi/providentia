LOVE City Fish. While I normally shy away from fried foods to stay on a healthy eating plan, my splurge is always City Fish -- the fish and chips, shrimp, scallop and oysters dinners are always awesome...never over greasy...fried just right in the right amount of batter/breading. The Fish taco wrap is also new and on the "healthier" food choices..I ordered the grilled fish and it was so tasty. I have never been disappointed with the market fish OR the restaurant fish at City Fish. Always clean, always kind employees...just the best! :)
