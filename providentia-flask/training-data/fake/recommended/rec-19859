Fried Chicken was very nice. I had the hot (mild) fried chicken with mash potatoes and my friend had blackened chicken with mac and cheese. Both were very tasty. The heat of hot fried chicken was perfect for me but my friend almost died, the chef had to bring him a glass of milk. SO if your cant handle heat order the regular friend chicken. The mash was damn near perfect and the corn bread tasted like home. The bill felt right...did not feel like we were overcharged at all. I would def return. We went on a Wednesday night and waited for 30 mins. If you're with droll company or by yourself this time may annoy you especially if you're hungry but my company kept me entertained so i didn't feel it and we were chowing down in no time.
