Four stars for a date place, five stars if you are looking for a place to take kids, but still want a nice place. It's very cozy and the staff is very friendly, and service quick and attentive. The menu has god variety dinner salads, burgers and sandwiches, and then a variety of entrees that you pivoting own protien sauce and sides, this intrigues me, but I never end up going with it,Otho k o want the chef to be the expert and make the choices, this is why 4 for a date. The variety is a 5 for families, you can take all types of eaters and they will find something Last time I went my husband got the 596 burger, it was solid, juicy flavorful, good burger, the showering fries were not too my liking,but my 4 year old gobbled them up! I got the Mexican salad, it was big and fresh and tasty,but I could have made it myself at home, I got it to share the beans and cheese with my 14 mo old, I would have loved to get the beets and goat cheese salad yum! I think the prices are fair, with salad, burger and 20pecent tip we were at 27 so that is a win for me... Last note, my son loves the couch side of the tables! Its a warm casual atmosphere
