Can you say diamond in the rough?! This place is everything you could want in a Portuguese restaurant. The waiters were courteous, the food was delicious, and the wine was plentiful. The hubby and I came here after some retail therapy at Jersey Gardens and couldn't be happier we did. We ordered up the clams stuffed with crab and bacon for an app ($9.50), a pitcher of wine ($11) (which was much more than enough for the 2 of us), the filet mignon served raw with a cooking stone ($23) (the filet was like butter, so tender and moist, they give you two huge pieces, and you cook it yourself to your liking), and the seafood with rice ($16). We have no complaints about anything, the food portions were huge and their menu is very large, there are enough choices to please any taste buds.
