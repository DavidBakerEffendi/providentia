WOW! Really good bagels, I love that they are baked in the brick oven! When you get them warm they are soft and chewy (not to chewy) and they make real egg sandwiches which is awesome. I usually get a breakfast sandwich or sesame with butter. Meyers came recommended to me by a friend, I didn't even know they were on Pine street until then. Â Myers is nice and tucked away, it's quiet and the staff is friendly.
