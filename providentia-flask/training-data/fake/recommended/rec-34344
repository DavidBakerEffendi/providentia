I really, really wanted to like Red Eye Cafe as I love patronizing local coffee places.  But unfortunately based on my experience today I can't recommend it.  If a coffee shop can't make espresso drinks better than I can at home, then I don't see a reason to patronize it. My test (and favorite coffee drink) is the macchiato.  At its best, a macchiato will have the strong essence of espresso infused into the foam.  Here, it was just a bland espresso shot with some poor foam (not really micro foam; just seemed like whipped milk) on top.  Really bland -- the coffee didn't seem fresh at all.  Again, if it's no better than I can do at home, then why bother?  Also, seemed like it was just one shot of espresso, yet they charged $3.25 for this, which seems high to me. My companion ordered a caramel latte; granted, this is not a gourmet drink, but his just tasted completely like sugar without any subtlety at all. Now, in addition to the meh coffee, the service was poor too.  Took a long time to order, then took a long time (10+ min) for the barista to make the coffee (I kid you not -- he was standing behind the counter eating a waffle while we were waiting for him to make our drinks).  Finally after getting my coffee, it took me 5+ min to get someone's attention so I could pay.  It really seemed disorganized behind the counter. As I said up front, I really hoped this place would be better; I'd love for them to succeed  and it would be great for the neighborhood. But if they continue like today, I'm afraid they won't be around long.
