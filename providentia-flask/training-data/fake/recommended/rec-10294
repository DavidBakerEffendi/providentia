After seeing the yelp reviews for this place, my husband and I decided to give this place a try. I am so glad we did! The restaurant was packed and we sat at the bar. Our waitress was very friendly. The food was excellent and the waitress sent us home with a bag of biscotti's. We will be back! A nice break from the restaurants in WeHa.
