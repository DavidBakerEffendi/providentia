Some food is really good, some mediocre, and some not so good. All of the food/ ingredients are fresh and well made. The place is extremely small and staff is nice. Biggest downfall: very limited menu. It's worth going to if you live near by or are looking for a reasonably priced unpretentious Italian restaurant in the area. I would suggest giving it a try, unless you have a very large group and don't want to rent the whole place (which would be worth it if you did).
