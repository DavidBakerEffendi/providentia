I liked my lychee mojito and was impressed by interesting decor. I thought it was gonna be a little too much, but once my alcohol kicked in, the decor didn't matter. I ordered Spicy Squid Ink Spaghetti. If I see squid ink on the menu, I usually get it. This time though, I was not that impressed. The food was good, but lacked flavor, and was a bit cold and pasta was over cooked. I should have ordered Thai food. Oh well. My dinner companions liked their food a lot, so I am mostly satisfied.
