Okay, I DEFINITELY like Geno's better than Pat's. I feel like people are in favour of Pat's because they are not flashy, but let's just face it-- the meat at Geno's is more flavorful, cheese is better, and the bread is not flaky and PERFECT. Geno's tastes much more fresh that Pat's and the service is SOOOO much better than at Pat's. Hands down my favorite in Philly! And yes, I've tried Jim's too... I am just a fan of Geno's, and that's that.
