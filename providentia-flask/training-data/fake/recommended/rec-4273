So I'll start by saying that I am probably the most indecisive person when it comes to eating. For my 22nd birthday I wanted to go somewhere fun for a group, preferably at a BYOB. Normally BYOBs are super crammed and noisy but it was a Tuesday night so I wasn't worried. I also do not like Italian food but when I looked at the menu it looked wonderful. I called Monday to make a reservation for Tuesday but they are closed on Mondays, so I left a message. They called me back Tuesday afternoon with a spot open for 9 people at 8pm. I was a little upset because their online menu is a little different, so what I thought I would order was not available. To start, I ordered the mussels and they were definitely the best I have had in the city (and my favorite food is seafood). For my main dish I ordered the Filetto Al Pepe Verde. I ordered my filet mignon medium rare and it was just that. It was perfectly cooked and for 9 orders, we received our food very quickly. After we were done eating we still wanted to hang out and drink (we brought 7 bottles of wine). We stayed over an hour after we were already finished our meals. The service was great even long after we were finished with our meals. I would recommend going on a week night, you'll definitely get your moneys worth.
