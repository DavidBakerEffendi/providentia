The food was OK, but I had a shock at the end when I learned that they don't take credit cards, and they don't provide printed receipts.  This was a bit of a problem as my dinner and desert came out to $31.  I had the cash but had to stop by the ATM on the way back to my hotel.  If I was paying for two I wouldn't have had enough money.  A restaurant with $20 entrees should not be cash-only.
