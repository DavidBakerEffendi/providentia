So I went to Syracuse which means I braved the often 1-2 hour wait at the original Dino BBQ several times. Then I came back home and see they opened one here which means I really have no reason to visit that frozen wasteland ever again! Ahem. The problem I had with this place is the ribs: the ribs at the Syracuse location? amazing. fall of the bone. to die for. The ribs at this location? tough. dry. flavorless. Three stars for the pulled pork, cole slaw and Mac and cheese and great service but horrible ribs is unacceptable.
