The food was really nice and delicious. But the service was a bit off from the level of food quality. The receptionist was nowhere to be found for a while (they stationed only one person for Sunday night) and the server forgot to bring what we requested. No big deal but still it was sthg that I wish we could have avoided to make our dinner perfect. But, again the food was pretty good. I will come back again.
