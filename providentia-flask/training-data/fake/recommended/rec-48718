Thankfully we got there early.  This place gets crowded on a Saturday night. The service was excellent.  The staff, including the manager were attentive.  I even had a Yelp check in for a free glass of sangria and they decided to give us a free pitcher of sangria and glasses for everyone in our party.  The view is beautiful and we enjoyed our food.  Will be back, but only in the day or early evening to avoid the crowds and long wait times.
