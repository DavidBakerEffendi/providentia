We stopped in for lunch today. The sun was shining and there was ample shade on their patio. The entire restaurant has been nicely renovated from the previous Taqueria Tavern (RIP my fave margarita). It was pretty empty, I think we were one of three parties eating. It was myself, my husband and our 7mo old daughter. We sat outside and ordered two beers of a very nice draft beer list. I had the arugula salad with chicken and my husband the tuna wrap. We both enjoyed our meals. Â The food was fresh, nicely portioned and tasty. Will definitely be coming back. We noticed their Happy Hours deals looked great. I also grabbed a to-go menu for those nights when takeout is on the menu.
