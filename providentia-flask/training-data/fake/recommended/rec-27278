This is my favorite restaurant in Astoria. I have had every crostini on the menu that does not feature egg salad (Sorry egg salad, I hate you) and they are all above average to amazing. The standouts are the spicy avocado & goat cheese, mushroom truffle butter & dirty chips & Parmesan, and the goat cheese & honey & rosemary oil. They have a different soup special every day - I have had at least 10 varieties and they are all wonderful. Any of their soups involving butternut squash or potato warrants an immediate extra order of soup to eat for lunch tomorrow. I literally high-fived my girlfriend over the table the second I heard "The soup of the day today is butternut-" All of the staff here are extremely friendly and helpful - this on top of the food being reasonably priced and ridiculously delicious makes it very easy to become a regular here. Il Bambino, I love you.
