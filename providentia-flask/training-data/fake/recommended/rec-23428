Big crush on this bar, it's awesome. Well-priced. It's great no matter what mood I'm in. Easy to make friends in the patio when I'm feeling friendly. Nobody bothers me at the counter when I feel like reading alone by candlelight with some drinks. Â Bartenders and waitresses have always been super nice to me, love it.
