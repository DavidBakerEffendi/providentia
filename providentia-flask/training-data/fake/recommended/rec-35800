We found street parking fairly quickly behind Osteria. We were seated in their nice sun room which I enjoyed. Our waiter brought out lots of salted bread and bread sticks and always made sure our basket and drinks were full :) We chose the Lamb belly appetizer which was a special of the night and was not on the actual menu. I recommend you try these! Very flavorful and savory. I'll be back for these. We ordered the Rib-eye steak for two (32oz). We were warned about the 40 minute cooking time before placing our order. We didn't mind the wait. I don't think it took that long anyway. The steak was then brought out to us. For verification? I don't understand. Then it was returned to the kitchen to be cut and plated. We immediately fell in love with the flavor. Mouth watering, perfectly cooked steak. What else could you ask for? We chose to take it to full throttle and order dessert. I had the Nutella tart which was good but nothing special. Steve had a trio of Chocolate Cannoli's with ice cream filling. Now those had the "special" I was looking for. As expected, the staff was very nice and knowledgeable. We can't wait to go back to Osteria and try other Marc Vetri restaurants as well.
