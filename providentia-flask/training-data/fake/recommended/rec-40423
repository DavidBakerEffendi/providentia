Not really a review, so much as a comment. After looking at the pics of the food on Yelp!, I took my gf to Laetus for dinner around 10:30 (we're from Manhattan. We don't eat dinner at 6pm) this past Friday night. Unfortunately, it was very much in"lounge" mode at that point. The music was way oo loud to sit inside for dinne and it was too cold to sit outsid. Also, the menu seemed very limited in options compared to what's shown in the pics on Yelp! Too bad, because Hartford area REALLY needs some dining options that stay open later than 10pm. As someone else said here, too bad because it has great potential as a restaurant.
