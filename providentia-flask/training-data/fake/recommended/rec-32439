The pho here is excellent. The broth is nice and clear, the cuts of beef are not fatty, and the vegetables are delicious. They are generous with the Hoisin sauce and Siracha, and the food comes quick. Would have given 5 stars, but didnt like having to pick random chop sticks out of the pot o' sticks on the table.
