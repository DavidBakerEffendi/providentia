So delicious and so much fun to eat. The only think I wish is that there was more more more Food..more more more Square Footage in the room and less less less people who knew about it - but I also hate waiting for a seat in the freezing cold (since there is nowhere to stand inside) but that may just be me. Food - My gang started with the Potato croquettes where were ok Â but not very memorable to to tiny in portion for the price that they cost. I wouldn't get it again. The star was the Pork kimchee dip soba. I love the display and the playfulness of the dish, not to mention it is absolutely delicious. I will say though that this is my first time having Soba so I have nothing to compare it to (eeeeeh that might be important) Service - Our waitress was wearing a grey sweatshirt with a hoodie and it felt like she was in and IDGAF mode because she didn't come around very often, the wait for the appetizer was pretty long ( about 30 min for something very small). I mean, can you not wear gym cloths as you serve food, just saying. Also I felt like i was rushed to leave, there was no room to relax or talk to friends. If it weren't for her, the disorganization, and frantic feel of the room, I would give this place 4 stars Scene - Contemporary and minimalist - no especially coo vibe, the food is definately the only star of the show Biggest pro - The taste and nuance of the food. Biggest Cons - Cash Only, Little room and the feeling of being rushed
