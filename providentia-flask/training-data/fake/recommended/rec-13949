We ate dinner at the bar at Barbuzzo, walking in without a reservation.  I only reserve five-star reviews if the place gave me the experience of a lifetime, and Barbuzzo gave me two: the best pork loin I've ever had and the best swordfish I've ever had.  In both cases, nowhere else has even come close.   Maybe the most amazing thing we had though was the budino with salted caramel.  We ordered it after the people next to us ordered it during their meal.  They seemed to be enjoying it so much, we had to order it too.  We weren't disappointed.  In fact, we may have even enjoyed it more than they did. We also had bread with sheep's milk cheese and dates and an apple crisp, both of which were okay, but we'll probably forget them while we'll be talking about the pork loin and budino for months.   The drinks were well-made too...I had an outstanding Sazerac and the beer selection is great, with craft brews from all over the world and locally.  This is the best meal I've ever had in this city, without question.  The atmosphere is really cool too, and we struck up a conversation with the cooks and our waitress was really attentive and helpful.
