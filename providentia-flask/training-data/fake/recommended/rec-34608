I've been craving Kati Rolls for as long as I can remember, but every time I get from the street carts it just doesn't seem to satisfy. If your looking for delish kati rolls filled with flavor this is the spot! The chicken tikka roll and the unda chicken roll are amazing! Well seasoned, filled with the right amount of everything, and very fulfilling. It is a small store front but don't go by its interior otherwise you will regret it! It seemed quite busy with every one that kept coming in and out, but quickly space turned up irregardless of it being a Saturday evening. Can't wait to go back to try the others on the menu!
