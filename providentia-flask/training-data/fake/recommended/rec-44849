Had a lovely dinner for two with my sister for her birthday at this fine establishment. We left it a bit late to get a reservation but was able to sneak one in through the use of a concierge service. The place had a lovely vibe and we were lucky enough to get a cosy corner table next to the window. I had the fish special which was tuna with ponzu sauce, and my sister had the cod. Both fish dishes were spectacular. Every bite was followed by a wide-eyed look of disbelief, followed with a hearty "MMmmmmmm". We shared the panna cotta for dessert which was light, not too sweet and they got the texture just right. One minor complaint however, the place did get a little loud and we found ourselves shouting at each other at times. But it was quite understandable I guess, seeing as they have a pretty small dining room filled with many happy dinner guests. After paying the bill, I left a note in their comment book along the lines of kidnapping their chef on our next visit. So I guess they'd better keep a good eye on him.
