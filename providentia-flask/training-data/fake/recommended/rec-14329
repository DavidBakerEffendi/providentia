This place is perfect!  The fried chicken is crispy and delicious.  The waffles are off the charts (I am partial to the original).  The drinks are fun (although a bit pricey).  The decor is fits well.  Decent size place so I have not had trouble getting a table.  Nice bar area.  A steady flow of solid hip hop coming through the speakers.  Servers have always been really nice as well. I can see people saying it is a bit pricey for what it is I guess, but I am fully on board!
