I went with a friend and we had wine, the calamari and salmon ceviche. The wine list had a solid selection of choices and the salmon ceviche was good. The calamari tasted fresh and was accompanied by a very tasty salsa roja. I only wish we had been hungrier. Pio Pio is much bigger than it looks and the inside is beautiful but dark. Since it was a gorgeous day we sat outside.The waitstaff was also good. I would go back.
