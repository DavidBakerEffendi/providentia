Super impressed with the amazing selection of vegan sushi and hand rolls. Not your standard veg sushi fare aka boring cucumber and avocado, love the spicy mango roll and spicy kimchi hand roll. Have also tried the chelsea market location, but prefer this one for presentation and location in the East Village.
