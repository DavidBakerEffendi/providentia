When you walk into Despana, you will automatically feel as if you've been transported to a quaint gourmet food shop in Spain.  They have the most amazing selection of fresh cheeses and meats - heavenly!  Their shelves are so neatly organized and are stocked with the highest quality olive oils, vinegars, olives, rice and other wonderful delights imported from Spain.  This is definitely the place to come if you are hosting a wine & cheese party - you can stock up on some of the most delicious cheeses, meats, olives and olive oils to serve!  The prices here are a bit steep, but you get what you are paying for - top quality!  On my recent visit here, I picked up a 17 ounce bottle of "Castillo De Canena" olive oil at $30, a 500 gram bag of "Bomba" rice (one of the finest and rarest grains of rice in all the world) for $8.50 and a 250 ml bottle of "Paez Morilla" Reserva sherry vinegar for $11 -  All worth every cent. This fabulous little shop is warm, inviting and wonderfully stocked with the finest items from Spain.  The service is equally as fine.  Next time you're in the neighborhood, be sure to stop in and experience all this little gem has to offer!
