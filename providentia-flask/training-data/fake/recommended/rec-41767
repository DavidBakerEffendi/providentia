I thought the atmosphere was decent.  Seemed very busy tonight and our waitress seemed stressed with all of the tables.  Food was pretty good, but a little lacking in flavor.  We ate roasted beet salad, mushroom crostini, and the spinach and ricotta tortellini.  The salad was well dressed and delicious.  The crostini could have used more seasoning or flavor, though the mushrooms were fresh.  For the tortellini, the pasta filling was a little lacking but the sauce was excellent.  Overall, a good experience, but not the best Italian food I've ever had.
