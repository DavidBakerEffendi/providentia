It's rather difficult to write a review for a spectacular restaraunt, and Market Table could easily be my favorite spot in new york right now. I have enjoyed meals here for dates and birthdays and have yet to be disappointed in food or service. Winning Dishes - Braised Duck: You NEED to get this. We missed out the first time and saw the table next to us devouring it. The british women said their trip to new york was made by this dish and that they had never had food that good. We obviously had to try it the next time (way too full the first) and completely see where they were coming from. - Beef Carpaccio: It's good and large enough to get around a large table. - Crispy Clams: I've had two different experiences with these, and I preferred the time they came with less batter. Overall good though -- what makes the dish is the pesto aioli dipping sauce (get extra!). - Branzino: I was disappointed that it was not on the menu last time. This is the best I've had, and the fried eggplant tastes so much better than eggplant has the right to. Other mains - Veal and pork shoulder. Winning Sides / Desserts - Cauliflower: sauteed with raisins and pine nuts. Honestly the best cauliflower I have ever had. I don't know what else they add, but by far out of this world in flavor. - Old bay fries: I love fries. I love old bay seasoning. And these did not fall short. - Apple pie: Typically a fan of apple pie and they have the right ratio of apple to crust. Definitely difficult saving room for dessert though. The only problem I've had is meal spacing. It sounds a little ridiculous, but I was in and out in ~1 hour (appetizer / entrees), and while the staff was courteous and the food was great, I still left feeling a little unfulfilled for the cost of meal. This is a stark contrast to 3+ hours meals I've had there so won't hold it against their 5-star rating.
