A solid pizza.  One of the best I've had in NY. For Italian American style (NY style) it's the quintessential pie but a bit on the "heavy" side. I also find that they used to be slightly better.  Not sure if they changed or if I just grew to like a few other places...  But it's a great great, classic, historic pizza place!
