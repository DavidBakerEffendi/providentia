We went here with another couple a few weeks ago. Here's the lowdown: The good: Buffalo calamari - so simple and yet addicting! Scallops - delicious, perfectly seared, but I wanted more! The okay: I had the pistachio crusted rainbow trout. I've had something similar at another restaurant and it was SO amazing that I was hoping this restaurant would do it justice. Unfortunately, it did not compare. The biggest mistake you can make with fish is underseasoning, and when I have to keep adding salt you know that's bad. The bad: Sweet mashed potatoes were just not good. Not sure why. Next time I would get the garlic mashed. All in all, nice BYOB in Princeton but I've had better fish elsewhere!
