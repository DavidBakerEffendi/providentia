This place is beautiful.  Food was on par with what to expect from Colicchio's restaurants.  My family took my mother here for a milestone birthday and had a lovely experience.  Since we were a bigger group they arranged a family style menu for us.  They were very accommodating and quick to remedy the situation when it came to a small food allergy.  In the end there was so much food we actually left with doggy bags.   However one thing that's a little awkward is having all of the pictures I took on my phone, tag our location as at Bellevue Hospital.  Oh, who am I kidding?  It's hilarious.
