The cheesesteak was okay, but uber expensive for what it was. The special was a glass of certain beers and a cheesesteak for $13. The fries were on a happy hour special, so we had the bacon cheese fries. One basket had a wimpy skimpy topping and the other had a respectable amount of topping. The waitress could not seem to get it together. If you want separate checks, you're going to blow her mind. She didn't know what anyone had. She had to go around and ask each of us, but then there were unpaid items that she had to get another waitress to help her figure out. If you have to, you can, but there has to be better spots for after-work drinks and noshin's. It was REALLY loud (I had a headache when I got home) and we were kind of crammed in the booth and not everyone had a seat (we had a group from work).
