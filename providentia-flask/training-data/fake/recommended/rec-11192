The best restaurant in town! Â We really like it and come pretty often-always had a great time. Both pasta and meat dishes are superb. They take reservation on weekdays but on weekends be sure either to come early or to be willing to wait up to an hour. Starters cost around 10$, pasta ~ 15$, meat 25$.
