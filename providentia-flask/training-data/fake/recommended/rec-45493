I've long envied towns like Edison, Colonia, and New Brunswick for having authentic delicious Thai food so readily available to them. So, Â I'd suck it up, get in my car, and drive the 45 minutes for my pad Thai or yellow curry. Well, FINALLY the drive and search for delicious, affordable Thai food has come to an end. When you walk into Ploy Thai you are blown away by the decor, cleanliness, and the layout. The owner even shared that many of the decorative items were brought in from Thailand, which creates a really beautiful restaurant. Between the fountain, skylight, and dark woods I didn't feel like I was in Robbinsville... a restaurant like this belongs in either Philly or NYC. Ok, so a restaurant can look good, but how about the food? Spot on. Every single dish (and believe me we ordered like 6 because we were so excited) was delicious. Between homemade sauces (delicious plum sauce!) to tom kha kai that was the best I've ever had to yellow curry that I forced me to lick my plate clean. Dish after dish we were impressed by the fresh ingredients and spot on recipes that Ploy Siam had to offer. In terms of service, we went on the day of opening and were the only diners for a half hour or so. So, at multiple times the wait staff would come over and talk with us and make sure we were happy. While most people would be annoyed, I understood their need to make sure everything was perfect. Overall, this place is not just great... its great great. PS-It's BYOB... even better!
