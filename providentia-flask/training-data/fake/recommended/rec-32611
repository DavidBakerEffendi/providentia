Great food, relatively inexpensive for Midtown lunch, and as I found out today, impeccable customer service. My vegetarian coworker had been raving about Crisp as the best veggie burger she'd ever had for a few weeks before I had a lunch date with another veggie friend and we decided to try it. The Godfather portabella burger is unbelievably good--so good even a carnivore like myself has zero interest in trying it with a beef patty, because why mess with perfection? Perfectly cooked mushroom, delicious pesto sauce, all-around droolworthy, and *almost* feels healthy if you forgo the waffle fries (which are delicious, but definitely sharing-sized). [pro tip: delicious as this burger is, I make a huge mess of myself every time I eat it, so keep napkins handy.] Tried the chicken backyard burger last week and it was also quite tasty, though nothing can measure up to the Godfather for me. Service in the store is quick but not super quick- be prepared to wait for them to make your food fresh to order for you. There is seating in-store, and though there's not much of it, most people just grab and go so you can generally find a seat if you want to eat there. And management is great-- my delivery order got mixed up today and they bent over backwards to fix it. If the Godfather hadn't already made this my go-to work lunch place, the customer service cinched it. Great job, Crisp! Keep it up!
