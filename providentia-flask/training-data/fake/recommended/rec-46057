Meh. I just don't get it. Is everyone else putting some special sauce in their food? And, can i get some? Cuz they all seem to be lapping it up and writing glowing reviews. But if it always tastes anything like what I ordered, I am not impressed. And I ordered a good variety. The seating: no reservations right? Ok, but when I asked for one of the many available tables, I was told those tables are unavailable. But not to the couple that came in right behind us. Forced to sit on hard uncomfortable bar stools. I've sat on subway benches that were more comfortable. Food: oysters- inconsistent, average at best. Some were flavorful with the mignonette sauce, some were just bland. Pork bun- like whatever, tolerable once soaking in sriracha sauce. Sriracha saves the day. Shanghai noodles- seriously foul. Noodles were pasty, like cooked yesterday and put in the fridge, had a glue like film, yum. With a dollop of roe on top, big deal. Soft shell crab- battered to death. If there was a soft shell underneath, I couldn't tell. More like a stale crab corndog. Flat iron steak- large chunks, no steak knife, it must be really tender, right?. Nope, not so lucky. Couldn't leave quick enough, if we hurry, we might still be able to get in one of our regular spots. Ps- One extra star for water, always topped off.
