Pesto pasta with chicken = yes please. While my heart was set on trying the Bronte Burger, I couldn't take my eyes off of the pasta dish that the lady beside me (communal tables people...communal tables) was eating. She just seemed to be enjoying it so thoroughly. Occasionally she would make Rachael Ray-esque noises ("Yum-o!" or "Mmmm...me likey!") to her eating partner, and then would continue snarfing her pasta dish. Needless to say, this overt display of gluttony changed my mind. This pasta was a must. Let's just say this: my eating sounds were not much different than the sounds that the aforementioned woman made, and for good reason. The pasta was nutty, warm and delicious. The chicken and cheese scattered across the top of the pasta paired perfectly with the pesto that adorned the al dente noodles in my bowl. It was truly a little piece of heaven. Luckily, my dining partner got the Bronte Burger (mainly because I convinced her that since I couldn't get it, that she should and that I would eat half). It was pretty great, as well. However, my heart belongs to the pesto pasta. Â If man-pasta marriages were allowed in this country, it would be on like Donkey Kong.
