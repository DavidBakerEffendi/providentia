People have been raving about this spot since it opened up, but after my experience on Saturday I'm really not sure why.  I mean i get it, its a cool space that's said to have delicious fried chicken, but in actuality, it was the worst fried chicken I've ever had.  The skin was ok, but the chicken itself was stringy and rubbery at the same time.  My "gulf shrimp" and grits were sub-par (definitely did not taste the way a delicious gulf shrimp should taste, they were cold, slimy, and possibly thawed out while I ate my appetizer and tossed into the grits without even seeing any form of heat.) My husband had the meat-loaf which he enjoyed, and we shared the gooey-spoon corn bread, which was good, because who doesn't like under-cooked corn bread? All in all, it was ok, but I don't see us going back there again.   PS, maybe next time time its 30 degrees outside, the restaurant could turn on the heat?  It was freezing in there
