Amazing place. Kitchen is open late (until 1am). We were recommended this restaurant by a friend. Heard phenomenal reviews from friends about the burritos and tacos. I went with the tortilla salad and it was delicious. Thank you to the Yelp recommender. The waiter was great. I ordered the La Apasionada and didn't realize it was made with habenero. Needless to say, it wasn't a pleasant experience. The waiter understood and offered to switch out my drink-definitely a first for me. Â  All in all, I definitely plan on coming back. Btw: the music is solid. It's enough not to distract u from conversations your date.
