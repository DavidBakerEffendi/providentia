I used to live a block away from this place and I went consistently every week since they opened a couple years ago. I've never had Peruvian chicken before I came here and after trying their chicken, I was hooked! I have been to other Peruvian joints since I moved out of the city last year, but so far, this place is still the best! Their sauce/marinade is so tasty, the meat is so tender that I came at least 1-2x a week. I literally did not stray from the chicken and did not try anything else on their menu. Their lunch special was $10 that came with two pieces of chicken, salad and soda which I thought was a great deal. I wasn't really into their green dipping sauce that normally comes with the chicken because it was a little bland, so instead I used their salad dressing to slather my meal with. I also really liked their plantains, though sometimes I wished it was a little more cooked because the more it's cooked the more it caramelizes. Yes, the decor is amazing. It does get a little too dark sometimes but that's the city for you.
