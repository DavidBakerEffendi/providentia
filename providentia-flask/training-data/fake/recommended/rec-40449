I don't understand why this place is so popular. Came here for dinner with my 11-year-old daughter. She had a burger and said it was nothing special. I had the reuben and thought the same. My water glass was so filled with ice cubes that after three sips, it was empty. Server kept disappearing. Wouldn't even consider going back.
