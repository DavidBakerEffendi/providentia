I thought my ramen was alright.  It's my first time having authentic Japanese ramen so I'm not really sure but are the noodles supposed to by semi crunchy?  The broth was nice, light and flavorful and the pork buns were delicious.  We also got the samurai ribs or something like that which came with an orange sauce and was plated beautifully.   I definitely would recommend going here with someone you don't like listening to.  It is super loud with the waiters/waitresses yelling crunchy ramen orders and only God-knows-what-else.  I understand it's all part of the authentic Japanese experience but honestly it was getting on my nerves.  I can almost swear that the non-Japanese servers were screaming gibberish half the time.   In conclusion, wasn't a great experience but it's a place I'll keep in mind when I'm forced to go out with someone obnoxious.
