The pork buns were pretty awesome... tons of juicy fat oozing from each bite, I'm not surprised it's such a popular appetizer.  The ramen, on the other hand, isn't anything spectacular.  I feel like buying a packet of instant noodles like ichiban or shin ramyun, throwing in some egg, scallions, onions, would've actually tasted better.  The service was great though...friendly staff who served food promptly.  liked the decor of the restaurant as well.  Just don't see the big hype of this place.
