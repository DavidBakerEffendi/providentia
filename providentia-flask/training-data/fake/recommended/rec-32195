Dined there with a small group of colleagues from out of town and all of us enjoyed our meals.  Salads were exceptional.  Wine list was also exceptionally well received by the guests (particularly those from Europe).   I had the grilled octopus salad and then the arctic char - would probably order both again as they were well prepared and quite tasty.   Portions are perfectly sized.   One of the best Philadelphia restaurants in this price class.   Only downside is that those with car must valet.
