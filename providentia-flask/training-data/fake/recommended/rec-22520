Nice coffee and vibe, relaxed and friendly. But I'm disappointed that the internet doesn't work and they can't/won't do anything to fix it (like try to reset router), getting a coffee to do some work is now just waiting till I finish my coffee so I can go find somewhere else. Writing this in the coffee shop on my phone. Â I live locally and this is my first time here. Won't come back.
