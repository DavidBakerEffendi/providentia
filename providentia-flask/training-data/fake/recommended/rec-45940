This was was ok. Nothing exceptional about it. It's a hole in the wall sushi place that'd you'd miss if you weren't specifically looking for it or knew it was there (entrance is in the back, where parking lot is). They serve alcohol which is a bummer bc I'd much rather BYO. Servers are nice but sushi just so-so.
