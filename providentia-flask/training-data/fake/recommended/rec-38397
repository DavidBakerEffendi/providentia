This place is incredible. I got the ribs and four sides: Caribbean rice, lima beans, collard greens and potato salad. The Caribbean rice was amazing, as were the lima beans and potato salad. The collard greens were a little sweet for me, but I think most people love them like that. My girlfriend got the fried chicken and I have never had better friend chicken in my life. Moist and crispy! Also they give you free cornbread which is phenomenal. I can't wait to come back!
