The vibe upon walking into Dish is very classy. At least at night - and I have not been during the day, so I can't speak to what it looks like when the lights are brighter. Definitely chic. Their menu is equally sleek. Make sure you start with the house-made chips. Really. This is a pile of kettle-cooked chips and cheddar fondue that is like eating air. You may regret it later - or just pretend you are eating air and don't even worry about it. There are loads of other items on the menu that sound amazing (sweet tea fried chicken?), but I actually opted for the winter salad, since a: it was winter and b: I had just eaten the better part of that ginormous pile of chips by myself. The salad was just about as awesome as it sounded. The brussels and squash went perfectly with the cheese and cranberry, and the bacon dressing topped it all off and made the whole thing come together just right. Unfortunately, we were right next to the window, which normally would be a good thing. Since Dish is situated right next to what looks like less than ideal housing, it's not. In this case, I would have rather been elsewhere - the bright lights and questionable characters lurking around trying to avoid said lights made for a less than mood-setting environment, Â you know? Other than that, spot-on.
