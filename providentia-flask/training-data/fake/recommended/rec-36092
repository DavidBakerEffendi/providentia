First let me say that I truly love Balthazar.  We visit New York every year around our anniversary and we reserve here first thing.  They always remember our anniversary with a delicious candled dessert and sometimes even with an aperitif!.   The nice thing about Balthazar is that you have to ask for your check and the table is usually yours for as long as you like - very much like France.   However, Balthazar is more reminiscent of a quintessential bistro than most in Paris; and the food here is better.  This year we had escargots (same as always) but I ordered the corn and lobster agnolotti (instead of my usual chicken liver and foie gras mousse), which was really wonderful!    The sweetness of the corn mixed with the lobster was a perfect combination.  I would go back  for that dish alone!!   Next we had grilled dourade which was so good my husband didn't want to share and I had the duck confit - also great.   The service is always efficient and very friendly.  Servers here know their stuff! You can't ask for more from a restaurant!
