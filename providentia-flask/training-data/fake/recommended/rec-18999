Still madly in love with this spot. I always brag about it and have told every friend I have that it is my absolute favourite place in New York. We've been back a handful of times and the service is always quite good, the wine is great and the menu is just impecable. And it's one of the only places I know that doesnt mind when my french pals dictate the music and have an impromptu '60's chanson sing-a-long haha. Really perfect!
