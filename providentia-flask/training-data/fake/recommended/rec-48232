Where do I start the soup was great the beef was tender and the price was excellent. Prior to going my friend recommended that I get a marinated egg in the soup and was he ever correct wow. The noodles were pretty good nothing that I would write home about but nothing that I would complain about either. Â  I do think they're better than Ramen. This place is definitely a go in Chinatown and I'll return
