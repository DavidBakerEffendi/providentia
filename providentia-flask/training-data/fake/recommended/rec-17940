The key word with Sripraphai is "authentic."  Really, there isn't a more authentic Thai eatery in New York City.  With that said, it's not the best Thai I've eaten. The original Jaiya Thai in Elmhurst was much better overall, especially when it came to soups and noodle dishes.  Sripraphai's soups and noodle dishes--especially the Pad Thai--aren't as "clean-tasting" as what Jaiya had.  Nevertheless, their curries and more complex dishes are still superior to most of the Thai you'll find in the city right now. Either way, this place is a must if you're a fan of Thai food.  It's exceptional, but not "oh my god, this is amazing."  It's good, "home-cooked" food.
