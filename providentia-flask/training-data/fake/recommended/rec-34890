For lunch: Yes to warm brie & green apple sandwich.  Yes to veggie burger.  Yes to fries.  The side salad is pretty good, but I feel like the lettuce often isn't that crisp.  It's not bad though. For brunch: Yes to basically everything, especially the pumpkin pancakes.  It might sound a bit much with the dried cranberries, walnuts, apple butter and papaya, but it's perfect, really.  The papaya is a nice and refreshing touch to the dish.
