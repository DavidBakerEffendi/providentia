I went here last week with my fiance and another couple. I have been meaning to try it for a while. We went on a Saturday during restaurant week, and it was nice that Mercato honored the Restaurant Week deal and we were able to get an app, entree, and dessert for $35 - definitely worth it! I got the bruschetta appetizer, which came with three different types of bruschetta. It was very tasty. The star of the meal though was my entree, which was the special of the night - a crispy skinned striped bass. The flavors used to cook the fish (capers, olives, olive oil) were absolutely delicious. The fish was cooked to perfection. I had a nice berry sorbet to finish. Everyone else's food was also delicious. We all went home happy and full. The only downside to Mercato is it's size. It is definitely "cozy" and if you don't like eating right next to the people next to you, then this is not the place for you. There is not a single table in this restaurant that is even remotely private. Mercato is also BYOB, which the other reviewers have mentioned. I'd say this would also be a good place to try in the summer or if the weather is warm enough to wait outside because there is absolutely no waiting room and I felt bad for any of the diners who had tables near the door because they had people with big bulky coats basically on top of them while they were trying to eat. All in all though, one of Philadelphia's best italian BYOBs!
