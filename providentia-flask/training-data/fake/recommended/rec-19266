Bufad is a great place to grab a slice of pizza or a whole pie.  They have a great decor going on. It's nice and cozy/hipster-y.  I like to swing by and grab one of their slices which they leave at room temperature italian-style.  You can also ask for them to heat it up if you so desire.  Depending on the time of day, sometimes they don't have many options available (1 or 2).   Definitely go on a Sunday, when you buy a pie and get another pie free.  You can eat a pie per person for a great deal that way.
