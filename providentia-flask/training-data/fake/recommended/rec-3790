I normally get take out from here but I have never been disappointed by the food here. Â The prices are reasonable and the portions are more than reasonable. I've never had a bad dish here and there are always left overs. The restaurant portion is very nice too. Good place to bring a date. Just be sure that you've been dating a while because if you order anything w/ garlic, you're going to have garlic breath for days! Also their spanish potatoes (the chips) are de-lish!
