Get the Artichoke slice. Period. The most unique slice of pizza in NYC. I haven't stopped craving it since I've first tasted it a few years ago. Small shop with long lines most nights/weekends, but they move through it quickly, kind of adds to the appeal in my opinion. They are definitely trying to address that concern though with a dining area next door & a beautiful new location (with a full bar) near Chelsea.
