I went here the other night and must say it is a pretty good place to get some middle eastern food. At first look I thought that it was going to be mediocre at best. The exterior looked a little too.....nice, like they were going to have some sort of watered down version of middle eastern. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw a nice spit of shwarma roasting behind the counter. The line was pretty long and it seems very popular. After placing my order, I had to wait again but the wait was worth it. I ordered the shwarma platter and a Turkish coffee while my wife got the falafel platter. The shwarma was very good and nicely seasoned. I saw many posts on here complaining about the hummus but I loved it (do not expect the stuff you get at the supermarket). The pits were soft and warm. My wife's falafel was nice and crispy while nicely spiced. My Turkish coffee was probably the best part of my already great meal. Just bitter enough to be good but not too bitter as to be off putting. If ,or when, I live in this area I will be a frequent visitor
