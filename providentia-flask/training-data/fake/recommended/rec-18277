Admittedly my experience with this restaurant is limited... but ever since my brother brought home their cheese steak sandwiches I have been a fan ever since. Â  I'm talking real deal steak, not Steak Umm!! Steak that is well seasoned or quite possibly marinated, grilled onions and then there's the oh-so-melty cheese and the ever fresh roll. Impressed me so much I posted a pic on FB!! I'm told there is an extensive array of other dishes to choose from, including a linguine and clam sauce that was raved over; me, I will stick to their delicious CHEESESTEAK! Blue collar and white collar folks alike seem to agree that Playball is a winner. Thanks to the Ironbound for another hit restaurant.
