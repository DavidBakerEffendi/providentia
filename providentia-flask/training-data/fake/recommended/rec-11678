The food exceeded my expectations, in spite of the hype, and really enjoyed the celery gimlet (if you like cucumber drinks, which I do, you'll love it)! The atmosphere and service were both great... they accommodated our request to switch tables and that we were a bit late for the reservation. Next time I want to try for a booth downstairs, which looked really cozy and intimate. It's nice when a restaurant actually lives up to the hype! A splurge meal but worth every penny.
