I'm glad that I'm within their delivery zone. The delivery guys are courteous but here are a few dishes I would not recommend - 1. Stay away from the Pad Thai noodle dish. I guess it's impossible to make an authentic Pad Thai without fish sauce but Zen House please don't replace the savory dish with vinegar and TONS OF SUGAR ! Â I almost choke to death after first bite and thought I had accidentally ordered a dessert noodle plate. 2. I would not order the General Tso or Sweet and Sour dish. Maybe it's just me but if you like SUGAR sauce in your dinner plate then these dishes will serve you well. So what are the reasons for giving them 3 stars as opposed to 2 or 1? 1. Fast delivery & Great manner. 2. Cheaper price (and faster delivery) than Dao palate. 3. Stir fry dishes taste pretty good and Thank Goodness no thick and shiny and gluey sauce. 4. Good portion size. 5. Love their fried appetizers - chicken nuggets and Salt & Pepper chicken (It's fried. What's not to love ? ) Will I order from Zen regularly? Well, I'm not a vegetarian but I'll order from them when I 1) am really hungry, 2) am lazy to cook, and 3) really want to save another live chicken for the day !
