The shop itself is pretty overpriced, and I don't love it. This is a review for the cafe. The sandwiches are great (my favorite is #1 on sourdough -- roasted red peppers, brie, smoked turkey, deeeelicious). The coffee and service are both also good. But really, I go for the sandwiches. When I used to live around the corner, I would sit in the cafe and read/write/whatever. Which was really pleasant. But I also like it to go.
