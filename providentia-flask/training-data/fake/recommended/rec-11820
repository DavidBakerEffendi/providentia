Possibly the best pizza in the world?  Try it and find out why you'll think so too.  Tell me somewhere better, I dare you.  Seriously tell me, I want to try. This place is the most OG place i've ever been to.  Grandpa making pizza, who prolly learned from his Dad, and (I think) his son, helping make the pizza.  And the tradition probably goes deeper than that; maybe his dad's from italy who learned from his dad and so on and so on... We got two pizza's, one cheeze and the other one sausage I think?  It was awhile ago, forgive me.  I also got some grape soda.   Some of the edges of the pizza were burnt, but i think they need to be burnt so the rest of the pizza could be perfect or something.   Anyways whatever criticisms you may have will fade away once you take a bite.
