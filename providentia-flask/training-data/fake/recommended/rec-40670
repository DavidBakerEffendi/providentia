What a great place! After touring Eastern State Penitentiary, we were famished. Thanks to ESP's posting of local places to eat, we headed down the street and spotted Rybread. It was just what we were looking for: good food, quick service and something local. I had the Charlotte: real turkey (not that deli crap most places serve), Cheddar cheese, a soft roll, ripe tomatoes (so many sandwiches are ruined by unripe tomatoes), pickles and honey mustard. So yummy! The dining companion had the Savannah and loved it as well. She even loved the whole grain bread, though she's usually a white bread person. The seating area inside is small but cute and the outdoor patio was lovely on a fall day. I could see how it could be crowded during breakfast/lunch rushes, but we were a bit past lunchtime, so we had no problems. The staff couldn't have been nicer to two new visitors. I'll definitely return next time I'm in Philly
