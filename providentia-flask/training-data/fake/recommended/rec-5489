I LOVE this place. Stopped here for a quick bite with the boyfriend. We were seated immediately. Our server was SUPER nice and friendly. We ordered the beer brewed mussels (delicious!!) and thoroughly enjoyed them. We also had a cocktail each. Bf ordered the Country Club Cocktail, but the waiter accidentally brought him the sangria instead. My bf didn't even care because the sangria was so delicious, but the waiter quickly realized his mistake and didn't charge us for it. He brought out the correct cocktail and was very apologetic. I ordered the lychee mojito - I just can't say no to lychee anything - and it was superb. I don't really get why other yelpers are complaining about the size of the place - yes, it is small, but it's not THAT small. It was intimate and romantic and we really loved that. For our entree we split the salmon zento square sushi. I described it to my boyfriend as "sex in my mouth" but not the kind you'd find in pornography. No, it was more like sweet, passionate love making in my mouth. The salmon was delicate, very fresh and the sauce on top just pushed it over the top. Yes, it's expensive here. You wouldn't want to eat here for sushi every week, there are other places for that, but as a special occasion place, Zento kicks ass.
