Favorite bar in West Hartford. Pretty large, and has a great beer and drink selection. Always seems to be full of a pretty youthful crowd looking to have fun. Live music is cool, and you may catch a glimpse of Scott Van Pelt or other ESPN personalities who are known to frequent here. Prices are reasonable, especially compared to other local establishments. Another review said it right: definitely fills a void in West Hartford by being the go-to place to let your hair down and relax.
