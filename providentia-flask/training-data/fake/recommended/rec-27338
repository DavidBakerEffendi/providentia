Ummmm...this place REALLY is "Woohoo! As good as it gets!"   I thought I had died and gone to heaven when I walked in and the place was BUMPING 2 Chainz.  Yes--a mexican restaurant--playing hip hop music--and loud (but not too loud). The place is super cute, service was great, and the food was yum, especially the guac.  But the best part was definitely the music.  I inquired about whether or not they always played hip hop, and was informed that the music is bartenders choice.  So you might not be so lucky, if a different bartender is working.  On my way out I made sure to tell the bartender that his playlist was AMAZE.  He smiled graciously, and said that it was good to hear, as normally everyone complains about the music--so that being said, if you don't like hip hop, then you MIGHT not love the restaurant as much as I now do. The ONLY downfall is that they do not take reservations.
