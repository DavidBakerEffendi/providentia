They were busy this past Sunday, but Cheryl, herself made sure that people waiting, were accounted for. A lot of the reviews here speak of poor service but I guess I have been lucky. If a place is busy, the food must be good. If the wait staff is "taxed" that is because they are busy and cannot give you all the special attention that you may require after a long night. Try going to Grandma's house if you want that warm and fuzzy feeling. Eat at Cherly's if you want a great meal in the neighborhood.
