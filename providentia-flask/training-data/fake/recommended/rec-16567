HAVE to have at least 2 and a half crepes Â whenever we come here... One savory - one sweet - half of my husband's...... Yum yum.... Husband alwez gets the du Nord...... I have tried the one with the chicken... Salmon...pork...egg..... I think I've have all of them!!! For the sweet one try the 'midnight something' one n d one which has the white chocolate...... Ok I just realized that this is my most vague review ever :S ......
