What's the big deal? Perhaps after waiting 2-3 hours for a burger, people's taste buds become biased - you just waited 2-3 hours for this damn burger so it better be good, right?? Wrong. Thankfully, I only waited 20 minutes for a table. The truffle burger was so oily and fatty. The meat was very loosely packed that it fell apart while I was eating it. Some ppl may argue that is because the burger is juicy. No. FAT and OIL dripping down my arm does not equal juicy! The famous truffle fries - the fries were too thin and flimsy to hold up to the heft of the melted cheese. The sauces that accompanied it were just eh. Their umami ketchup was pretty good though, and prob the best part of my meal.
