Being that this place is so NYC famous and it has a pretty good Yelp rating, I just HAD to check it out.  I made a special trip into the city on a Sunday, just to try the meatballs. Now, I am an Italian and am used to a good effin meatball, so right off the bat, it is going to take a lot to knock me off my feet.  The ball will need to be moist, filled with cheese, seasoned and cooked to perfection and mouth-watering goodness that is almost orgasmic.  The ball has to be better than my mom's because that woman can cook the crap out of a meatball.  Basically, I had high expectations. We get there and there is no place to park so I wait in the car while the hubs goes to fetch us some balls.  He ordered me the 4 beef balls with focaccia bread and spicy meat sauce.  He was in and out pretty quickly, so A+ for service. I took my time opening the lid, to savor the experience.  As the steam from the hot balls wafted onto my face, I took in the first smells of what I imagined would be a religious experience.  I took my fork, stabbed a ball and rammed it into my salivating mouth.  Chew, chew, chew.... No orgasm. The balls were good, but definitely not what my mom makes.  Epic disappointment.  The sauce, however, OMG!  They put little sprinkles of gold in that sauce, I am convinced of it.  Spicy, but not overpowering and just the right flavor to compliment the balls.  The sauce MADE that experience for me.  In fact, it was so delish that I literally poured it down my throat like a soup and licked every last drop off of the bottom of that container and shed a tiny tear when it was finished. So, hooray to you, Meatball Shop, for knocking me over with your delicious sauce making skills.  However, you have a lot of work to do if you want to impress me with your balls. I'm just sayin'
