So this is good . . . Philly and I are not long time friends.  We met a few months ago when I moved here from lands far, far away.  Upon my arrival in the broken bell city, I was instantly struck by two stark realities.  First, everywhere offers cheap eats and drinks.  Fact: This place is easy on the wallet.  Second, Philly is chocked full of great spots to see music.  Johnny Brenda's tops my list of spots to check out a show.   First off, I'm a bit of a music junkey.   Given the choice, I would rather burn my hard earned pay watching some crooner bellow out his or her latest tunes than booze my way through the latest pop ditties queued up on a new swanky macbook.  With that said, Johnny Brenda's walks the line between bar and venue nicely and so tops my list of places to spend a fine evening.     First, the intimacy of the venue is fantastic.  I had the pleasure of checking out Jessica Lea Mayfield and I was struck by how available the artists seemed.  Besides the tiny stage, the whole lay out is reminiscent of someone's basement, giving it a backyard jam session feel.  However, where the house-party bar setup can, in some cases, seem over-hyped and cliche, Johnny Brenda's accomplishes it without sacrificing credibility.  This balance feeds heavily into the experience.   Second, the beer list is killer.  The offerings rotate regularly and suited my tastes well.  Like many local watering holes, the beers were mostly philly locals and priced to move.  I dig it for sure. All and sundry, well worth a visit.
