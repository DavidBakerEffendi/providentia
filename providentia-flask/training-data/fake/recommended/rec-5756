I am a huge fan of Almaz Cafe. Great Ethiopian food.  My favorite is the vegetarian sampler although you cannot go wrong by anything on the menu.  Don't be fooled by the exterior - it looks like an ice cream parlor.  Once you're inside and observe the diners, you'll understand. Also the owners are some of the best people around.
