I've lived here for two years and this is by far the best diner hands down. The service staff is good, the food is consistently tasty and the prices are fair. I've never had the Italian buffet at the Bayonne Diner (same owner) but I hear it is worth it. My favorite dinner is the spicy meatball platter and their breakfast is spot on. You may read a bad comment or two but every Restaurant has their bad day and winey customers you can't please. I would give it six stars if I could! This is also open 24 hours so great when you need that drunk food!
