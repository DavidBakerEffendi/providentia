I've been to this place twice now.  The first time, I would have given it 4 or 4.5 stars so, naturally, I returned.  This time, however, my experience was far from positive.   It started off great - the Sangria came promptly and was as yummy as I remembered it.  Then, it started going downhill...The avocado salad looked scrumptious so I took a few bites and in the midst of all that deliciousness, I started chewing on something, well, unchewable.  It turned out to be a HAIR BAND (and no, it wasn't mine).  The waitress was very apologetic and brought us a new salad and gave us dessert on the house but my appetite had been ruined. The rest of the meal was pretty uneventful - the taquitos de carne were also as good as I had remembered them but I would skip the coconut shrimp.  Something in the food had a ridiculous amount of garlic and/or onion such that for the rest of the night and the whole next day, my dining partner and I felt like fire dragons.  If that was the only problem, this would have gotten 3, maybe 4 stars.  As hard as I tried, though, no amount of sangria could wash away the memory of a half-chewed salad-drenched hair band.
