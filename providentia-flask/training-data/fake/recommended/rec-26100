Like Dan S., My 2 stars is principally based on the design work and the bartender from Arundel, Maine who was extremely friendly. In fact, in I were to base it solely on those factors, Spritzenhaus would get 5 stars. Unfortunately, it doesn't work out that way. My party of three made it's way over to the new beer hall this passed Saturday afternoon based on the misinformation that 100 taps=100 beers...boy were we wrong! Spritzenhaus does have 100 taps, but it's 4 of each of the 25 beers, most of which are mediocre at best. Feeling a little let down, we still proceeded to order our beers, all priced at Manhattan scale. The only difference is instead of getting a Manhattan pint your getting a 14 oz glass for the same price. Not cool. Rather than go with a mediocre beer selection for her second drink, my girlfriend decided to order a mixed drink to go with the weather, so she went with a margarita, which came in a tumbler. As far as we could tell, there was nothing special about the drink rather than it might have had a bit more sour mix than expected. Apparently in was more special than we thought, because it ended up costing 11 bucks. Why would anybody pay 11 bucks for a margarita in a tumbler in Greenpoint? Lastly was the clientele. Since when was there a tunnel built from Murray Hill to Greenpoint. I saw more pink polo shirts and workout pants in one hour than I can ever recall seeing around Bedford Avenue in the last 5 years. I guess I can't really say I'm surprised seeing that one of the owners is associated with the newly-closed, date-rape shitstorm known as Mason-Dixon. Like any other new bar, it desrves more than one chance. Hopefully the management can work out the kinks by the time they get a decent menu. Until then, I'll be getting my decently priced LITERS of great German beer at Radegast.
