5 star rating because this is the best lobster roll in NYC. The Red Hook Lobster Pound is awesome! They offer 3 styles of rolls. First is the Maine style ($16), which is the cold mayo filled lobster roll, second is CT style($16), warm and buttery and third is the lobster BLT($10), good but served with a smaller amount of lobster. All lobster rolls are stuffed with a lot of lobster meat! The New England Chowder is pretty good as well. Rich and full of meaty pieces of seafood. They also offer lobster mac and cheese($10) and a lobster dinner ($25). The lobster dinner is $20 on Wednesday nights. First buy your roll then take it next door to the picnic tables and enjoy!
