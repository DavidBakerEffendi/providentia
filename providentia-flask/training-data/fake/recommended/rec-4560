Today I called S'wings to place an order for my boyfriend, but of course no one answered(according to my bf they never answer!! Why have a phone?!). Therefore, I ended up taking a short walk here and honestly it was warmer outside than inside. When I got there I saw that the phone was right next to the woman who was filling dressing containers -- guess the dressing is more important than the potential business calling to place an order. Anyways, I ordered tenders and fries to the woman at the counter who didn't even greet me. As it was my first time here I didn't know you had to choose a sauce, therefore I was super confused when she rudely started yelling "sauce" and rolled her eyes at me. Sorry, maybe I'd understand if you would just speak a tad bit politely -- I promise you it's not that hard. That being said I will never pick up food for him from here again. Worst establishment.
