If you want clean, organic, high-quality, nicely presented food, then this place isn't for you. But this place is every bit as good as the long line indicates.  It just hits the spot. I always get the mixed chicken / gyro.  It's $6, but you can give them $8 and they pack it to the very edge of the container. A real NY treasure, I eat here several times a month. Tip: the one across the street is the same exact food, shorter line.  Make DAMN SURE that you don't get it from a knockoff cart.  There's one just down the street on 52nd.
