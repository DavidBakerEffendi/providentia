I really want to like Village Whiskey, Â local establishment with a star chef in a sea of ever growing chains, with a business model focusing on whiskey. The interior is well designed, a little modern but unmistakably a whiskey bar. However, it's popularity and proximity to Rittenhouse nightspots means it's almost always crowded, often with folks who clearly have had their limit at other establishments. The menu is typical gastropub with a few surprises, including a small dish of those tater tots you remember from high school, but likely paid less than $5 for a few. That said, I've been here 3 times, and there's been nothing that won me over to make it a favorite spot, like the accompanying line to a 2 star review states, "Meh."
