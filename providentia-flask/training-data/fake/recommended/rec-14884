I would love to mock this place, but unfortunately it appeals to me so strongly that I could actually see myself eating here every day.   What I love about this place:  they use REAL vegetables.  My mom has a thing against salads; she believes in cooked vegetables like broccoli, or kale, or squash, not because she cooks them until they become un-vegetable-like, but because when you cook them asian-style, like we usually do, you begin to recognize that they are vegetables with real body, that are richer and more filling than salad greens.  I think that Pure Fare does an excellent job of making use of that inherent body to cooking-vegetables.  It's the way I would cook vegetables if I still cooked, and it tastes so good!   What I don't like about this place: They claim to serve blue bottle coffee!!!!  And yet the soy latte I got here fell so tragically short of Blue Bottle Coffee!!  Not the same rich flavor, the perfectly executed mixture of milk and espresso, that I was expecting from Blue Bottle.  It was just mediocre.  LIES!!!  TWO STAR coffee rating.  Three stars for "taste of coffee," one for "meeting of expectations," which averages to two.   What I mock about this place: well, you know, it's pure, right?  It's a place for people who need to feel 'pure' when they eat, like women and hipsters, especially women-hipsters.  And while they seem to be all about sustainability, everything is served in throw-away take-out containers (albeit the most environmentally friendly ones).  So: mock, mock, mock.   But it's true; eating this kind of food does make me feel more pure.  And it's yummy.
