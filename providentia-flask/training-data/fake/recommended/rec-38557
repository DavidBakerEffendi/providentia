Ok, I've read so many reviews & raves about Govinda's Chicken Cheesesteak, I had to try it out myself.  Sunday afternoon 8.26.12 I headed down, ordered Chicken Cheesesteak w Vegan Mayo & Mozzarella on a Wheat roll....... My goodness, Wow!  The BEST SANDWICH I've EVER had in my life!  I was truly amazed & in heaven, REALLY.  Most things never live up to the hype but Wow, wow, wow!  Soft, juicy, hot, well-seasoned & the chicken, peppers really shined.  I ate one half as-is the other half with ketchup, either way is incredible. As Harvey, the cook said to me "the main ingredient is LOVE!"  I concur.  My new favorite sandwich shop... see pictures.
