I'd say a 2.5 stars.  It wasn't totally meh but it isn't a-ok either.  I order a panini and so did my friends.  The sandwich didn't come with any sides, and the bread was pressed to an inch of it's death.  The panini flavor combination were great but it didn't come with any sides. From the outside it seemed like the space would be cuter on the insdie -but it felt very dinerseque.
