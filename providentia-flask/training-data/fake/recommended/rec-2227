Due to the fact that I am mainly a Pescetarian it is rare that I am eating meat unless I am looking for the perfect BBQ experience -- and I am not talking about hot dogs and hamburgers but the real BBQ world of pulled pork, ribs, and brisket. So... if I am eating a hamburger I am doing it to really see what is going on with the claims around the fame. To me Five Guys is a hit. I liked it a lot better than In-N-Out in California and perhaps that had a lot to do with going for the bacon cheeseburger as opposed to the cheeseburger (with) for In-N-Out. What makes Five Guys an even bigger winner are the fries. I think the only place that beats them is Thrashers fires along the board walks of DE and MD and that is saying A LOT! It is good advice to go small on the fries unless you are sharing with a friend as their portions are very large!
