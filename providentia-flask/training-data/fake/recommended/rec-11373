Hands down one of the best noodle bowl restaurants in all of Philadelphia. You can look in the back and watch them draw the noodles- as their name implies. Request extra thin or broad noodles. I go for the beef brisket with a fried egg. Two people eat for under $14. Cash only so come prepared. This place is awesome!
