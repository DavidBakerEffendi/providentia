This is such a wonderful place.  The atmosphere is cozy and inviting.  The bartendars mix up refreshing drinks.  The food is outstanding.  I've gone to a couple of their family style dinners - the fried chicken was moist and properly seasoned.  One night they started with a tomato soup with grilled cheese croutons that was out of this world and typically I am afraid to try tomato soup as it is either filled with tomato chunks or too much dill.  This soup was perfect.  The desserts were equally outstanding.  It isn't doing it justice to call it comfort food but to eat this deliciousness that is prepared with such care is to be comforted. They open for regular dinner service  next week and everyone should go.  Just do it.
