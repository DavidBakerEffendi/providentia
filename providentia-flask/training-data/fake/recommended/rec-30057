I've had John's, Lombardi's, Nunzio's, Patsy's, yeah, all the places people say is the best pizza in NY, and thus, arguably, the world. (OK Naples, Rome, and Italy, not counting you guys, then again, you don't do pizza like your emigrants here have taught us to do.) Grimaldi's is still probably the best, up there with Lombardi's (which is also really good in Philadelphia too, by Rittenhouse Square.) Let's say this place is so good, my girlfriend, who hates pizza, liked this place. Biggest drawback are the huge lines, but, I love the vibe and service. I mean, the place is jam packed, there are always tons of people in there, people are all loving the food, and if you're a loud group, sitting next to another loud group, makes you feel like you're at a neighborhood bar. One time I was standing around, waiting to get to the bathroom, and one of the owners looked at me with that old Italian mysterious squint of his, called me over and told me to follow him without telling me what was going on, (honestly I thought I was in trouble, I had no idea) past the kitchen, to another bathroom no one was using. He smiled, let me in with a flourish of the arm and pat on the back. Man, I miss those good old days when everybody used to know your name.
