This place would get 4 or 5 stars if they had adequate seating. I heard this place burned down last year so I don't know if they had reopened or not.  it is quite cramped and it is next to impossible to get seating on the weekends at any time.  That said, this is a great place to get vegetarian, non-veg, and Indian drinks.  My favorites were the dosa stand, the place where you could get masala chai and cold drinks like falooda and lassi and most of the other places were also great to try- punjabi express (?) had decent non-veg platters.  Be sure to bring cash though there is an ATM on the premises.
