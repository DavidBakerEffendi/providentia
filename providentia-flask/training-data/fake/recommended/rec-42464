This place made me love falafel. And I never did before because the spices are usually overpowering. The falafel has a lovely citrus lemon flavor. So delish! Plus their hummus is the silkiest, creamiest hummus you will ever eat. Took my friend here who just had stomach surgery and even she could eat the hummus with pita. This place is spot on.
