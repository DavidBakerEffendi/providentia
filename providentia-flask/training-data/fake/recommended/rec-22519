We went for dinner on a Thursday evening at 7 pm. The service was attentive. The menu was short but this meant that the food that we received was excellent and delicious. The space is lovely as the restaurant is on a corner and gets light from two sides. We were also able to hear ourselves when we talked. If you are looking for a place where the noise is overwhelming, which seems to be the goal for many restaurants these days, then Brooklyn Commune is not for you. We avoid such restaurants ourselves. We actually relaxed over our meal, which is the sign of a real restaurant rather than a restaurant that is trying to be a scene. As you can BYOB, the meal was also very reasonably priced.
