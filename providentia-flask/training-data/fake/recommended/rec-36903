Close, but not good enough. The place was decorated in that way that Asian fusion restaurants are typically designed, but it was definitely a Japanese place. I thought the bricks of dry ramen at the bar were very cute. Now the food... I thought the broth was decent, but the noodles weren't good. Portions were alright... meh. Just okay overall.
