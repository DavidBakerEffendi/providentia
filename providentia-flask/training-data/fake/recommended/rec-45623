Get the Papparadelle Tartufate! ---- I used to go here pretty regularly a few years back, before they moved to their (much larger) current location - so I was completely lost when Yelp told me to head to Rittenhouse Square.  But on the plus side, it's no longer the cramped / smoky / aggravatingly long wait that it used to be.  They still don't take reservations, but now that the dining area has almost tripled in size, it doesn't seem like it will be much of an issue any longer. After weeks of taking pot shots at Olive Garden, I decided to take my GF here to show her amazing Italian/Tuscan fare. Overall, it was a very good experience, as shown below.  I would love to give it 5 stars, but that would encourage it to rest on its laurels rather than continuously strive for excellence. Bread: B-, because it was cold and hard.   Crispy smelt fries: B+, very interesting. Sauce was unique. Antipasti of shrimp, cannelini beans, squid on a bed of baby spinach: A-, a very light and citrusy option. A hit with both of us.     ***Papradelle tartufate: A+, just like I remember it!. Freshly made pasta cooked al dente, savory mushrooms, topped with pecorino cheese. A carnivore such as myself would regularly order this without hesitation.    It was so good, I found myself licking the plate afterwards.*** Grilled lamb chop two ways (special): B, the grilled chop was good, but the simmered chop was not simmered enough (a bit too tough) Goat's milk geese and raspberry (special): B-, as I wasn't much of a fan of its gritty texture. Even the confectioner's sugar and raspberry couldn't salvage it. Service: B, even though our waitress was friendly, she was rather unattentive and completely forgot that I asked for a cocktail napkin to get rid of my gum (I'm too old to stick it under the table).  On the plus side, she never rushed us out, even though they were cleaning up and getting ready to close. Minor quirks notwithstanding, we will definitely be back next time.
