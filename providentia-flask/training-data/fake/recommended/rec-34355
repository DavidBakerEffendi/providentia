My husband & I have been eating at the Mediterranean Grill for about three years. Waited to write review to make sure review is real and accurate. We keep going back because the food taste like my grandmother cooked. The restaurant manager Tom is caring and professional & the wait staff respectful & well trained. whenever we feel like home made Italian we head on down but this is not the only reason we enjoy the Mediterranean Grill, the ambiance feels like family.
