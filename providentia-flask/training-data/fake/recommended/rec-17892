OMG - Got meat? The Rodizio is completely worth the trip to the bowels of Newark.  A little salty but not complaining.  Appetizers, sangria - wonderful.  Salad bar just OK.  They have a parking lot and the inside is really very nice.  There were 18 of us for a Christmas family get-together and they absolutely know how to take care of a big table of people.  No doubt we will go back here!
