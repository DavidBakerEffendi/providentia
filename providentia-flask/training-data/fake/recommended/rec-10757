Talk About local and fresh? Talk about great service? Taste a wine before you buy? Flavors right off the farm? This is the place. I love market table. Salads are great, but make sure you order all the sides. they are so yummy from mint and almond green beans, to some of the best corn off the Cobb you will want to savor them all. Main courses you can't go wrong no matter what you choose. Great fish chicken and beef. I had a lemon pound cake with fresh cherries and it was a hit.
