I came in on a Saturday morning about a month or so ago, seized with the desire to dine on my own.  Piccoli's decor was tasteful and the music was the right type for a lazy morning.  Since it was only around 11:30, there were only two other parties there besides me, and the lone waiter seemed to be having a wonderful banter with all of them.  He introduced himself and seated me by the window (where I was able to watch the snow fall) and presented me with a nice selection of teas.   I wanted something simple and light for brunch, so I ordered the waffles with fresh fruit along with a side of scrambled eggs.  The waffles had this deliciously light spongecake-like quality to them, and if that wasn't enough, the waiter came back with some mascarpone, advising me that it would add another level to the waffles...and it did!  It's really hard to mess up scrambled eggs, so on that end, the eggs were yummy. Solo brunch was a success and the service was great.  I am definitely coming again!
