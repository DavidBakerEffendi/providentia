1 Hirata Buns (pork) 9.00 1 Shiromaru Hakata Classic 14.00 1 Akamaru Modern 14.00 1 Bakudan Ippudo Spicy Paste 2.00 Piping hot, rich and savory...both, the classic and modern were pretty darn good. The service alone makes this establishment an automatic 3.5-star rating (superb attention to detail). I am sure you can find better ramen in Japan for 1/3 of the cost, but it's definitely worth a visit in the Big Apple.
