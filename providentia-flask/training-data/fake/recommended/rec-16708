A refreshing surprise. While the menu doesn't have any surprises or bold shocking cuisine statements, this is where you go when you'd like a great meal in a more casual atmosphere. Â Although the dining space is a bit cramped and the furnishings are a bit lackluster. Service is impeccable and the food is quite tasty. Salmon tartare on garlic herb toast - amazingly fresh salmon (great portions) on perfectly toasted peasant loaf Crab toast with lemon aioli - shredded lump crab on warm toast Chicken Liver toast - very healthy portions and quite tasty 9" pizza - spicy calabrese meatballs, habanero tomato sauce & ricotta - amazing artisan pizza with dough that could rival Jim Lahey (of Sullivan St bakery & his pizzeria Co. fame). The spice in the sauce was perfection. While the restaurant is credited to Jean-Georges V, Chef Dan Kluger is one to watch.
