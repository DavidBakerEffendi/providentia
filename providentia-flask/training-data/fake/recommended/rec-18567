I went here for the first time today (just a couple blocks from the office!) based on reviews from others and I'd say the ones I read were accurate. Price - about the same as anything else I find in the area Environment - very clean, open, and the signs/trim/lamps all have a good color scheme that is very refreshing. I also sat upstairs and the seats were comfortable. Food - I've only had one dish so far, the BiBimBap and it was better than most deli versions. The rice was hot, aaaand they threw an egg on there! Outside of restaurants, I'm usually egg-less. So that was a plus.
