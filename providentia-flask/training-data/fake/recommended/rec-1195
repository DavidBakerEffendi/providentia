Good food. Everything my table ordered turned out well. The veal Milanese was great! Their brussel sprouts left a little to be desired. Good meatballs, great service. We had a reservation and got there on the dot for it but it still took them almost half an hour to seat us. That was the only drawback that took this from a 5 to a 4. Oh and cash only (bummer).
