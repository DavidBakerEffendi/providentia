My boyfriend and I had a great meal during their "pizza" hours (Thursday, Friday, Saturday from 5:30-9). We got the roasted olives which were delightfully salty and we also ordered the "Jessica" pizza which is potatoes, rosemary, basil, olive oil, and seat salt. Everything was great! The place is super small and intimate--very cute! Definitely a great date spot. The portions aren't huge so you don't leave feeling overly full. Overall we had a wonderful dinner with great service and delicious food!
