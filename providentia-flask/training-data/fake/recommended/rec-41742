Spicy lamb sandwich. Get it. I really don't know how you can put that much flavor into something but they fucking did it. If you order anything else on the food menu, you're a damn fool and you can't be saved. They pour a good Guinness here, too. Beers are $7-$8, but they're all 20 oz pours. Didn't notice whether the staff was friendly, didn't care about the atmosphere. I was too busy eating that damn sandwich.
