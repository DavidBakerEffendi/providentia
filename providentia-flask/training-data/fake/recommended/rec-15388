Burger was alright. I am currently on a burger find but have still yet to find a burger that really blows me away. The one that has come close is PJ Clarke's. This burger was ordered ad a medium rare and it was cooked on the spot. The taste was juicy but lacked the basic savory flavor that normally comes with a good burger. Watching the guy cook burgers when you wait in line explains a lot. There is a lot of shifting but most of all I think he even "smooshed" a couple of the patty's which kind of turned me off a little. A little turned off but I tried it anyways. The fries were slightly overdone; however, crispy fries never hurt anyone. Coke was actually pretty flat, but it tasted like coke on tap which is pretty normal. I didn't want to write much because it really want much to write home about. It was a burger. And to be honest that is all that it was..
