Light glinting and tableware sparking across the house was enough for us to check out the new place on the block. the new restaurant/wine bar had a soft opening and so we sat down on 'real' wood slab tables and chairs to try it out. Deviled eggs tapa style - so 1950s,so quaint appeared to be a hit on other diners' tables including our neighbors who also had swooped in to the place as well. And, yes, very very good and especially so at $2.00 for a tapa size bite and filling. Topped with roast beef and herbs , it was silky, divine and surprisingly good. I hope they keep on the menu because it was a hit. And the price... .stays as is. The wines were delicious, we tried the priciest red at $14/glass which was quite decent. The others are priced $7-10 on the average from a simple, tailored selection. Next week comes brunch so we can't wait!
