this is for the bar/downstairs situation only, music venue is a whole 'nother story: went here to join a friend, realized pretty fast it was not really my kind of vibe. i'm a brokeass 20something so bars with a musical reputation in nolibs/fishtown are actually supposed to "my scene" or something, but a) i cannot. afford. the drinks. here. and b) this place was so packed with south jersey moms and yuppies i could smell the 401ks. it was weird bc the people at the table behind us were talking about how much they liked "dive bars" and i just wanted to turn around and gently shake their shoulders and say "son you have dental insurance you need to outgrow the concept of dive bars." anyway, a dive bar this is not, but it's aiming for the polished version of that "neighborhood spot" aesthetic and whatever, if you are in your thirties and want to leave the toddlers at home and try to relive your carefree youth for a night out, this seems to be the place to go. if you are my age and broke, there are better places to dump your wallet.
