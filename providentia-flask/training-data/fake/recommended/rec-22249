Came on monday at 4, right at closing.  Didn't experience any rudeness and the recommended Hershey's across the way for a nice Reuben sandwich.   Came the next day with gf and we split a pork/prov/rabe and it certainly was delicious, just a great balance on delicious bread and the rabe gives it just the right of peppery niceness.   I hadn't heard that this was THE BEST SANDWICH in the US and when you put it against that standard, meh, I can't say i agree.  esp if you consider that its $10.
