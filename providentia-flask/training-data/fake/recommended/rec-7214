oy, so good. I had several dishes, I was amazed at the deliciousness of what came out of that tiny kitchen. My only regret was that I was by myself that night and didn't get to try more dishes. Â I'll be back with a crew. Excellent, excellent food, one of those places you kind of drift out of feeling like you were totally satisfied by the experience.
