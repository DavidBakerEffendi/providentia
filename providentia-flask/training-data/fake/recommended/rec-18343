Had some friends in from out-of-town this weekend (first Philly visit) and of course the cheesesteak was one of the main attractions.  I have taken loads of people to the historic King of Steaks, and they always love it - and so do I.  I have enjoyed this local icon countless times, in countless varieties.  Yesterday I had a mushroom steak, whiz wit - tasted as good as ever. The argument is old as time.  Some will say Pat's, some will say Geno's, Tony Luke's, Rick's, Jim's, or any of the lesser know neighborhood spots throughout the city.  In reality, you'll get a good cheesesteak at any of these fine establishments.  But in the end, if you're in it for the experience it's got to be Pat's or Geno's.  I make this statement with the tourist in mind.  My local friends and I rarely visit these landmarks unless it's to indulge an out-of-town guest.  But I must say, explaining how to order, and the mystique that surrounds someone's first trip to the birthplace of the steak sandwich gives me a nostalgic feel.   Although I've enjoyed more Pat's steaks than I can count, I get a special feeling when I approach the front of the line to order one of the greatest, most famed culinary creations in the world.
