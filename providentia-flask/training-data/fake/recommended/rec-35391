I knew as I walked through the door that the food was going to be good. This place is very popular amongst the Japanese population, so I knew it was going to be good and traditional. Started with the Wasabi Octopus appetizer. Which was not to my liking, a little too out there. Not that it was not good, just not what I expected. It was raw octopus, kinda slimy so we did not eat much of that. Drank some great cold Saki for a great price, also Kirin Ichiban was a good price. For entree we had the Pork Tenderloin Katsu with Miso Sauce and Scallions, which was fantastic, as well as the King Salmon Katsu which was good, but fried Salmon kind of loses some of the greatness of Salmon. But it was still good. When you mix the flavors of the Katsu and the fresh ground Sesame seeds and special sauce it is great. If you are looking for a reasonably priced Japanese dinner that is not sushi then this is a great place.
