my first lobster roll EVARRR! (@ madison square eats) $16 for a tiny tiny roll. Squeezed about 8 bites out of the roll...making each bite cost $2 -__- but the first words to come out of my mouth after my first bite: WORTH IT. yup. no regrets! found a nice little slice of pickle under the roll. scoooooore.
