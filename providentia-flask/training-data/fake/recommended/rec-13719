Barely passable. First of all, the crowd. Times Sq. Enough said. The food. Eh. Frankly my random local diner has better penne a la vodka. And there are children running EVERYWHERE. And not in the cute way. In the holy crap, I'm about to break my neck if one more kid runs into my knees way. I noticed upstairs seems more sedated, but it may be reserved for private parties.
