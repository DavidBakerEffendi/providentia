Barbuto is a wonderful restaurant for these beautiful spring evenings when the restaurant can open up it's garage-like glass doors to the street.  The atmosphere is decidedly sophisticated while maintaining a young, hip vibe.  As a result, it's never that easy to get a table, but if you go at the right time, there's a great chance that you can slide into a table. Their chicken is fantastic and I highly recommend it, but stay away from the cheese - the portions are smaller than tiny!
