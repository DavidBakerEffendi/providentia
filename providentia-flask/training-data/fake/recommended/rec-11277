I've been wanting to go to Frankford Hall so long that summer came and went. Good news: it's still awesome in the colder months. We stopped in Frankford Hall for a beer before dinner and it was surprisingly empty for 7:30pm on a Friday. We ordered half liters (I got the Franziskaner Hefeweitzen and the bf got something hoppy). I can't imaging wanting a liter of beer when a half liter is exactly half the price, which saves you from warm beer, but it's a nice novelty and probably convenient for some. The bartender gave us our beers, we paid up and that was that. No more chit chat about do we want to order food, etc. which was refreshing. We were left to drink in peace. They have the heat lamps on outdoors so the whole place is still in full swing. The ability to play ping pong is awesome (even more points for having a jar of extra balls--this sounds bad I know--on hand for when you inevitably lose yours). Even the foosball table was free, and it struck me that open table games like these are a great way to meet people. This is pretty much the ideal place for groups: big communal tables and no separating checks. If I lived in Northern Liberties this would be my regular place to grab a beer. I can't wait to come back to try their food.
