Being rushed throughout our entire stay at Saigon Shack, our meal for 4 people only lasted 40 minutes. Apparently, it was not quick enough for this certain waitress, Asian chick with long black hair, that she felt it was deserving to "accidentally" spill food on me. She saw me and she definitely heard me when this happened. She walked away without doing anything or saying anything. WHAT THE HELL. Those type of people don't belong in service industries...
