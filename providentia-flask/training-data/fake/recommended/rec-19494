I had a dessert crepe... apple, honey, and walnuts I believe. It was cool, I would've liked it more if the apples were sliced thinner and EVEN MORE if they were baked or stewed. A chutney steak crepe would be off the meter. Anyway, I always thought these guys were rude. Eh whatever, I went just that one time.
