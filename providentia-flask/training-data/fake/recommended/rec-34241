Dinner began with a playful twist from the chef that will bring you back here again and again. The bread is baked & served in clay flowerpots.  It was delicious and sliced just so it looks like leaves of a plant.   The rest of the meal was not as quirky and I'm glad because this food is seriously  amazing. The octopus was so tender and perfect.  The chicken was beautiful.  The  bronzino had skin so crisp that it didn't need more than the couscous beneath to complete it.   Anyone who has reviewed this place and didn't like it because of an attitude...maybe you should have checked yours at the door.  Our server was polite attentive and pleasant. Dessert well...I could have skipped the olive oil cake...it wasn't terrible but just not as good as the rest of the meal.
