I fee like the only time I go on yelp is to write negative reviews (being angry does motivate people) but I want to start writing positive reviews for businesses I frequent that deserve it. This is my first. Park Tavern is a staple of the community and a family owned bar and restaurant.  I think by now I have ordered almost everything on the menu and weather you are eating at the bar, at the bar tables, or the restaurant in the back, the food has always been fresh and delicious. The thin crust pizza is pretty good and the calamari and mussels are always great.   The waitstaff and the bartenders are all friendly and attentive which for me is very important since I believe service quality can make or break any business. They have a full 360 degree bar and a decent selection. The bar is large and round, plenty of seating, there are also lots of bar tables as well. Its a great place to meet and drink or drink and meet. They have plenty of large screens for watching sporting events, or even multiple sports events at once, and free WiFi internet access. They have 5 or 10 beers on tap (I guess I'll count next time) and plenty of bottles. The liquor selection is pretty complete. I know they have wine but I don't drink wine frequently there so I can't comment on the selection. They have event spaces but I have only been to one event hosted there so It wouldn't be fair for me to comment on that aspect of the place. Overall I'm glad there is a nice reasonably price place in the neighborhood. Whenever I'm waiting for a train or coming back from NY I usually stop in. This is is why I give them 5 stars.
