Not sure why this place has such bad reviews. The only reason I took off a star was because they are cash only. The parking sucks here but you can double park in front of a driveway and you'll be gone before the owners have a chance to complain. The service is super fast here. The staff is rude but when you have a line of customers down the street, you have to keep people moving. I had a cheese steak with whiz and onions. Never had a steak with whiz before but it was the best way to go. My friends had steaks with other kinds of cheese but the whiz was the best, hands down. This place is open 24/7 and has outside tables. Probably too cold to sit outside in the winter. IT was bearable to sit outside in June for us. But I admit, I was sweating from just sitting and munching because it was so hot. Bring cash. No credit cards accepted here. If you never had a steak in Philly, go here. Get it with Whiz!
