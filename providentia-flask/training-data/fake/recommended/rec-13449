I visited Sugar Freak on a Saturday night. Only a 5-10 minute wait at the bar. DRINKS: It was obvious that the guy behind the bar was in training, which can be forgiven since the spot is new. But when my boyfriend (a bartender himself) commented about there being tax on drinks, the bartender said, "yeah, its a new law in NY." :) My BF was polite, smiled and let it go. Drinks SUCKED, watered down kool-aid. I strongly advise NOT ordering the Hurricane or Watermelon Punch, unless you are NOT a drinker. We then ordered a Mint Julep because there's nothing but booze in a Mint Julep. It was so awful, we didn't finish one of them between us. FOOD: We had a mac & cheese to start. Eh. Just ok. A little dry, definitely not enough cheese. My boyfriend had the blackened catfish, which was good, not great. Very small sides. Â I had the buttermilk fried chicken. This could have been frozen from a box. Side was sweet potato fries, undercooked. They should have called this SALT Freak because the food was SO salty I could only eat a small amount. Needless to say we passed on dessert. The best thing a bout this whole place was the decor, which was really adorable...and our server HOLLY, who was off the hook. We made it a point to tell the manager how great she was. I didn't even have the heart to tell her the food sucked because she was so positive and eager to please. Which is why I'm even giving it 2 stars. We'll go back again after it has been open for a while and have a chance to work out the kinks. Especially since it's one of the few non-Greek eateries that has popped up in the hood.
