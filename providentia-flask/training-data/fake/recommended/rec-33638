Brunch with your boyfriend's ex and her new husband?  Go here. Sit on the patio and order Bloody Marys and a side of fruit  (if you're that kind of girl). Wanna get back together with the man you broke up with 7 months ago?  Wear a small dress and big heels, then order the oysters.  Let him pick up the tab. This place is versatile, to say the least.  Cocktails are strong enough for any kind of awkward situation or any thing requiring liquid courage in a private and stylish setting.
