I talk about the Walter Foods shrimp cocktail. A lot. I don't even like shrimp--mostly just cocktail sauce--but these shrimp are always particularly plump and fresh in a way that makes me feel oddly naughty. And you know, I also don't like filet mignon. It's a lean cut and not what you'd call robustly flavored. But here? It is of the gods. Best I've ever had. And my parents loved them some filet mignon when I was growing up. The cocktails are pretty decent, too, and the cute, overall atmosphere makes it one of the more prime spots in Williamsburg. In my opinion. I will say that I've never been exactly thrilled by the desserts. But I'm usually full after my DIY surf and turf anyway.
