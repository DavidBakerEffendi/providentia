Last minute assisted my best friend's girlfriend in throwing a birthday dinner. Happened to find Marrakesh on Yelp looking for something eclectic and accommodating to large parties. We made the reservation, adding to our party up to the hour of dinner, they were very accommodating. We also added the belly dancer (which was a great addition!). There were 12 of us total and I think I can say we all has a GREAT time! You ring a door bell to a enter a very friendly but dark restaurant. The ambiance seems authentic, the food was magnificent and lots of it, the owner who tended to our table all night was very pleasant, and need I say more about the belly dancer... she was very good, beautiful, funny, was teaching us how to belly dance and danced for about 4 songs... was very tasteful. Now it is communal food so be wary of that, however, they do the whole hand washing thing. Was also very dark. Would be great for intimate evening or large party like we had. It was also about 6 courses, so be sure to pace yourself. The only downside, the waitress bringing our drinks and water did not have much of a personality, but maybe that was all part of the authentic atmosphere! Highly recommend this restaurant if you are in to something a little different. Also, they only accept cash and they may only accept reservations, but am unsure of this.
