So so so so so delicious.  This place is amazing.  The third time I went here I was meeting a friend who was nearly an hour late.  Which sucked.  But the owners gave me lots of free slices of oranges (which they hand out to everyone in line), as many free coffees as I wanted while I waited at the bar area, and even came around with the most delicious lemony sausage samples I've ever had!  Then my yummy, cheesy, delicious omelette came to the table and the bill was only around $8 for my share!  Not including coffee! Tom's is the BEST.
