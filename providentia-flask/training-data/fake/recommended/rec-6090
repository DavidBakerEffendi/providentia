You know the rating system is weird when Pylos is rated higher than Desnuda, just down the street. I had the worst restaurant experience of my life, courtesy of Pylos. In fact, I've never had a bad restaurant experience in NYC so it really takes something big to turn me into a hot potato. If you're into the waitress pouring wine from one glass into another - this is the spot. If you like waitresses to speak rudely to you - this is the spot. If you like the waiter to tell you to 'fuck off' when you want to keep the pita bread - this is the spot. If you like the waitress to literally throw your plate on to the table - this is the spot. And the food...well-done lamb instead of medium-rare and soggy pasta with even soggier scallops on top... And the piece de resistance? Having the manager send her friends to call us 'dicks.' It was pretty funny by then though. Well, I'll just be ambling along to Desnuda next time. And if you see a guy outside the oh-so-romantic window sticking his middle finger at the manager...that'll be me!
