I went for my birthday last week and was really excited to try it. For the most part everything was okay but I do think this is way over-hyped. We went upstairs for a drink while we were waiting for a table. It was a typical upscale bar staff: attractive twenty-something's who specialize in over pouring drinks. I was excited to see one of my favorite drinks, a Last Word, on the menu. It's a particularly delicate cocktail with a lot if ingredients that can be overpowering if not mixed correctly. The bartender was free pouring and over poured maraschino liqueur which made the drink taste overly medicinal. A few sips in we were seated and looked over the menu. I noticed the service was slow and somewhat dispassionate. It didn't really fit with the price point of the restaurant. The food was all incredible-- this was really the highlight of the meal. Everything we had was amazing and in perfect shareable portions. At the end of the meal they brought out an extra dessert with a sparkler, which was nice but maybe they should have brought it out before we ordered dessert because we wouldn't have ordered so much. The server also mistakenly described the desserts as one bite. I would like to meet this person who's eating those things in one bite because they're at least four to five normal sized bites.
