This place is dope. I've only been twice, and I don't remember what I got either time, so that's not helpful at all. The first time I'm pretty sure I was still hammered from a tequila binge, and the second time was the night after my birthday so I was definitely still hammered from a binge of everything. I came here to get a juice to kill my inevitable hangover because it's a much better fix than Tylenol, McDonalds, and water. The juices were awesome both times, but the service was what stood out. The second time I came I got there about 45 minutes before they opened, but as I was walking away a guy who I'm assuming was the owner opened up the door and told me to come in. He asked what I was looking for, I mentioned I wanted a juice but didn't mind coming back when they opened. I don't know if I looked that terrible or if he just has exceptional customer service, but regardless, he definitely didn't have to let me in and help me an hour before they opened. I told him to make me whatever was easiest for him, and he threw in some magic hangover powder as well. I don't know what it was, but it was delicious and effective! I'll definitely be returning here to try out more juices that I can actually review!
