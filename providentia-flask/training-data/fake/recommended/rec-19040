I order take out and have gone to Il Porto twice. The food is always awesome. Salads are fresh, not over dressed, very sizable, and great combo of ingredients. The chicken Tortalini soup is so good that I still order it when it's 90 degrees out. All the pizzas I've had there are awesome, but my current obsession is the margarita pizza. Sauce, cheese, basil, crust..... It's perfect. To top it all off, the service is excellent.  Our server was very nice, knowledgeable, professional and knew the steps of proper service.  The manager (pretty sure he's the owner) is always there and making sure everyone is happy. I had a pretty obnoxious request last time I was there, and I felt really bad asking, but the live band was really loud and I couldn't hear my bf on the other side of the table. Between our server and the manager/owner, they had the band to take a 15 minute break and turn down the volume on their amps when they came back.  I was trying to apologize to the staff for making a rude request, but they were so nice about it, they just kept insisting that they wanted us to have the best experience possible and would do what it took to make us happy.  And we definitely were.
