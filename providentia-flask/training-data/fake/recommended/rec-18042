For once this very impatient person (me) can say that a restaurant was worth the wait. This was my first time brunching and well, Hawthorne's certainly delivered. When we first arrived there, we had a 45-50 minute wait. I am not sure how long we waited, but because there was just the two of us, we were seated pretty quickly considering the crowd. Our server was super friendly, told us about the specials and kept the water and the coffee coming. The coffee is $2.50 but it was endless, which is awesome and it was One Village Coffee, which is even better. My partner and I ordered separate dishes--her, the South of the Border and me, the House Baked French Toast. Both were fantastic and the French toast was so abundant, that I got a box to take some home for the next morning. I can't wait to go back again and maybe try some of their select beers or try lunch!
