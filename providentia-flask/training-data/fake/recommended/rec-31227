Didn't realize putting a bunch of chandeliers would attract so much attention and very long waits. The food here is pretty good but there are so many Thai options in the neighborhood that are equally as good and doesn't have a hoard of people. One time I ordered a curry dish that left a rather disgusting aftertaste...like some sort of cleaning solution.
