I have lived in South Williamsburg 1 week. I have eaten at Pies n Thighs 2 times. We were disgusting and ordered delivery even though we live 4 blocks away. Chicken box, BBQ sandwich, peanut butter chocolate pie were amazing. Next we went to breakfast. We were the first people there at about 8:00 am so it was empty and nice. The food is gross in a good way. Their coffee is really good as well.
