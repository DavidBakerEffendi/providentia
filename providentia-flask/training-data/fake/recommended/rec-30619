This place has a great story.  It started out as a bar but the owners had a dream to make it a restaurant and boy, did they make that happen.  A true gem. The Redhead is hands down one of the best restaurants in the neighborhood, maybe even the city when you consider food, ambience, price, and service. The food is upscale Southern fare - it's even better than 'real' southern cooking but still stays true to its roots.  I've had a lot of their menu and my favorites are the buttermilk fried chicken (deliciously tasty crispy outside and moist tender inside) and the shrimp and grits.  Nothing I've had here was bad.  The bacon peanut brittle isn't really brittle so don't expect too much - it's good salted peanuts.  Oh, and their desserts are great too - I recommend the banana pudding or banana creme brulee if they're offering it.  They always give you cookies or brownies with the check too! Their cocktails are also superb, which is good, because unless you come on a Monday or Tuesday early, you're going to have to wait. Be prepared to wait, especially on the busy nights, but the line usually moves pretty fast and once you do sit down, service is quick, but not too quick. I've also come here for their (annual I think) crawfish boil.  On a Saturday, it's a huge multi-course meal of oysters, crawfish, cornbread, and a big pot of crawfish.  Best crawfish I've had outside of New Orleans.
