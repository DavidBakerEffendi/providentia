What's to be said that hasn't already been said?  So I'm just going to stick to a few key points: 1. Soup Dumplings:  Seriously, get these. 2. Love the Pork:  if you can't eat pork, you're out of luck.  The "crab" dumplings have crab meat, but the base is still pork. 3. Cash only. 4. Come early!  6-7pm.  After 7, the lines become ridiculous. 5. Don't forget the other dishes!  They make a lot of good other stuff too.  Scallion pancakes, turnip pancakes (a different form from what I'm used to, but just as tasty), etc. Bottom line, you can't beat this place for really good food at very affordable prices.
