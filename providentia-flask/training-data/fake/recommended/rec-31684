So, I decided to finally give this place a try since it's local to me. First, I will start out with the good. I like the decor. That's it. Now, this is a very small place that doesn't serve any liquor. When we got seated we didn't get any bread, chips nothing. The food I ordered was mediocre, I ordered ropa vieja. I expected it to be so good. But, it was hard, thick, dry meat with no veggies just juice. The rice and frijoles were fine. They only served 2 little pieces of fried plantains and they were cold. My husband ordered the yellow rice with chicken & chorizo. It was a big dish, and he said it was good for $16. We ordered the chocolate cake for desert it was $6 and It looked like a sample so small with like half an ice cream scoop. I think the prices for spanish food are very high. I can go into one of my Dominican Passaic restaurants and get a lunch for $5 and its way better. I wouldn't go back, and then on top of that they added a 18% gratuity on bill. It was $72 for 2 adults and one child. Their regular drinks were $3. It's obsurd, I've eaten at way better spanish restaurants for half the price. All I got was flatulence. I was very disappointed.
