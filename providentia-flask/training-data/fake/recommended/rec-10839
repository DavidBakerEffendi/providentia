This is a pretty popular spot around the midtown west. A few quick points: 1- I have the tendency to over-order.. the menu does not look pricey but I always end up paying $40-50 per pax. 2- Extremely high chance having to deal with looooooong wait times. 3- Dark lighting and it's easy to miss this spot when walking pass. 4- Try the Sake Tunataro (tuna steak), it's huge and delicious. Stop eating pad thai goddamit. 5- Music is kinda meh, either change a station and turn it up or turn it off completely. Overall a pretty cool and chic looking place. Menu is pretty creative, should cater to American tastes. I would say it's a 3.5 star to 4.0 stars rating.
