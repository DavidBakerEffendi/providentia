I don't get it. Why is this place rated so highly? I found the service to be rushed, inattentive and sloppy. The food is patently mediocre. Apparently the chef ran out of time to cook our rice all the way so I crunched through an already disappointing massaman curry. This is place is the standard NYC restaurant/mill: move 'em in, move 'em out. Â Can't really say I recommend it if there are other options in the area.
