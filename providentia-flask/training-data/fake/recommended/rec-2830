It wasn't that busy when I went but definitely had potential to be a great place. The staff was friendly and the drinks were decent prices. They had an outdoor patio that is great when the weather was nice. It rained slightly when we arrived but the table had umbrellas so we were shaded. Â The only complaint I had was that the yager bombs that we ordered we very small.
