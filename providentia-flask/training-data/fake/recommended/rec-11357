Liters of beer, being able to sit outdoors in a light-canopied garden even in the winter, fire pits and s'mores while you sip your tasty brews, smelling like camp fire for the rest of the evening while trekking around the city = AMAZING. The pretzel and fries were tasty too. I love this place. Love!
