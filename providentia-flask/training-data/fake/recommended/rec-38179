Where to begin?? So much praise to offer Yorkside. Coming from Brooklyn, I initially hated Yorkside pizza, but I must admit it has grown on me. If you're passing through New Haven this is NOT the place to have the legendary NHV pizza (try Modern, or PePe's, or Sally's, or Bar). However, if you have more time in the area, Yorkside is a wonderfully greasy late night treat. Things to try: pizza (hot, cheesey, oozey, gooey, greasy), cheesy garlic bread (see description of pizza), milkshakes. Also their Greek salad is a hidden gem--soooo good, but be sure to ask for dressing on the side (unless you want Greek salad soup).
