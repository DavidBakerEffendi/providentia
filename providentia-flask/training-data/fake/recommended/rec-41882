This place was great! I went at the beginning of December with a large group of about 10 people to celebrate a birthday. We were seated at the large table near the kitchen so you could see the chefs preparing the meals. We all ordered the chef's tasting. Which was I think 4 or 5 courses. I was a little confused on when one course ended and the next began.   At first they were bringing out the first 2 courses I would say  and I felt like we were not getting enough food. It seemed like if I was there on a date with just 1 other person they were giving us for 3-5 of us to share.. but I think its because I was not sure how the chefs tasting worked... and I wasn't sure of what each course contained... by the time we were to the main dishes I did not feel the way was feeling at the beginning of the meal. They made sure we all had enough to eat... asked us if there was anything else we wanted more of and I was almost too full to finish my dessert. The service was great. The food was amazing. The price a little high for my normal dinner budget but I feel like we got what we paid for. My only complaint is that I think the drinks were priced too high. The place is swanky, the dishes were some of the best indian inspired foods I have ever eaten. I plan to go back again to do the chefs tasting again! It was a great experience.
