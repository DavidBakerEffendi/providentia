I came here during lunch time and sat at the bar;  I must say all the staff were nothing but attentive to me and my husband.  While we were definitely overwhelmed with the three menus presented to us (one for the regular dining selection, one for the specials of the day, and the final for the lunch specials), there was surely no lack of selection.  Upon ordering, we were given bread, olives, and the torta of the day, all free of charge.   I would highly recommend the Caldo Gallego, a regional Spanish tomato-based soup with kale, white beans, and chorizo!  Absolutely delicious on a nice, fall day.  But to be honest, anything you order is top shelf!  The food is tasty and the atmosphere is relaxed.  Everything needed to enjoy a nice lunch.   But remember, whatever you decide, don't forget the sangria!!
