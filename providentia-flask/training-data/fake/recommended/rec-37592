Had heard a lot about 'Tequilas'. It certainly lived up to its reputation. Each and every thing we ordered were tasteful and quite generous. One must try the Brazilian cane rum Cachaca. It has a distinctive flavor unlike the West Indian or (East) Indian cane rums. I prefered it straight vs. in their speciality cocktail with Cachaca. Some of their drinks were spectacular and the way they are served was quite a display in itself. Memorables were the Ostiones Cancun (oysters), flautas for starters, mole was outstanding as was the Carne a la Trenza (actually looks like a braid). The signature dish, Salsa Tequila (we took the Grouper) was as described. Finally, not enough can be said of the Churros. Simply outstanding. Crisp on the outside, soft and not too sweet on the inside. Viva Tequila! Will certainly be back.
