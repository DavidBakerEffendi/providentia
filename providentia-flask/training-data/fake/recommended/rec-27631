im a relatively recent new york transplant but i think ive gotten the hang of quite a few city things: rents / $12 bud lite / $8 cereal no longer shock me, i do brunch, i walk crosstown and i never ever ever wait for the G. but i still can't believe my new yorker friend (and some yelpers too it seems) recommended Barrio Chino as a cheap mexican eat. hell no! hell no! no matter how frou frou new york you are, you cannot call this a cheap mexican place. in that category i'd put my perennial fave, el grullense (yelp.com/biz/el-grullens…) or even that vegan yuppy haven, papalote (yelp.com/biz/papalote-me…). i am yet to find their equivalents in NYC.
