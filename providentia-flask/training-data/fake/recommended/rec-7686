Totto Ramen rocks and yes, the long wait is worth it. I usually put down my name on the list and mosey on over to Kyotofu to grab some gluten free Japanese baked goods. My usual is the vegetable ramen: Konbu seaweed and shiitake mushroom based soup, topped with seasoned avocado, seasonal vegetables, spicy Yuzu paste, sesame oil, salted kelp and lime. Nothing quite satisfies the soul on a cold NYC night. And I love the Japanese chefs, super sweet especially the one I always catch crooning along to reggae. Cutie. A few months ago they changed their noodle maker who couldn't quite replicate the taste of the noodles, I hope they've since rectified the issue!
