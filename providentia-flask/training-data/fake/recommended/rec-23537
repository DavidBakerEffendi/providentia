Took our daughter and two friends for dinner Saturday night It was parents weekend, so it was packed. We had to wait 45 minutes for our table, and the hostess had a bit of an attitude, but everything went uphill from there. Our waitress was great, she brought our drinks and took an appetizer order right away. We had motz sticks and nachos to start. They brought the motz sticks right out and told us the nachos would be a few minutes. The manager came over (unprompted by us), told us the nachos had been over cooked and that a new order would be right out. We thanked her for keeping us informed. She noticed that my beer was empty and brought me a new one on the house. For dinner we had a steak and fries, a burger, a salad, wings and a steak and cheese sub. Everyone loved their dinner.
