When I think about all of the meals (expensive or cheap) that I've had in the New York area, Blue Ribbon always comes first. The service was great and the food was perfect. That particular trip to NYC was very stressful for me, and my experience with this place really made me feel better. I read a lot of people saying it's overpriced. I disagree. For the type of service and food you're getting at a white cloth joint, this place is a bargain. I ordered an appetizer, glass of wine, lobster dinner, and dessert for under $50. I can't speak for the other meals, but the lobster was prepared perfectly and they definitely knew a thing or two about serving and chilling a delicate white wine. The atmosphere was good and straightforward. No stupid themes or unergonomic trendy furniture. I will go out of my way to dine here again!
