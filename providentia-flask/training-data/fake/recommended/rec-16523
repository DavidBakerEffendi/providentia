I went to this place two years ago and the food was pretty decent..went again last wk to take my partner for a birthday surprise for high end experimental food.This experiment went highly wrong... and it almost ruined the date...we ordered the lychee drink and the fruit was rancid.The watermelon feta salad was at best o.k.sliced; watermelon, feta, and slushed mint....the paneer was disgusting, all heat but no flavor..the spinach tasted bitter, and left a film in your mouth.The skate was greasy, like it was sitting in old oil or it wasnt heated highly enough before put in to cook..the duck dish was dry like leftover shredded chicken..the only good tapa was the scallops...three bites of good food...90 bucks wasted on four tiny plates of food..I was so embarrassed...we ended up going to a nearby rrestaurant to eat a good meal after....never ever again....
