Umami is amazing. I got the Truffle Burger -- beef with roasted garlic aioli, house truffle cheese, and truffle glaze -- and it was delicious. My friend is a tater tot connoisseur and he noticed them on our way in, but we didn't see them on the menu. We asked about them and were able to get them. They, too, were delicious. I always describe them as fluffy potato clouds. I've never had tots like them. Umami has some cool "inspired cocktails," too. On top of a cool atmosphere and friendly, quick service, this place won me over. I will absolutely be going back... to try every single burger on the menu.
