Came here on Saturday morning for brunch, we had to wait for about 45 minutes because we wanted to check out the patio, it was worth the wait! I was happy with the food and the service, although I wished they had more selection on the menu. I ordered The Eggs Norwegian and it was delicious! I would come back here again, plus the little garden is just too cute. I'm sold. Side note, it's cash only, but they have ATM inside.
