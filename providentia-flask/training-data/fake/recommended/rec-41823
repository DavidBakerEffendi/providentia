Really glad I went, but prolly wouldn't go back considering how many great places there are in South Williamsburg. The atmosphere is good, the fried chicken is good and the collard greens and biscuits are great, but everything else is a serious meh, especially the mac n' cheese and the pies. We had the concord grape and banana cream pie and both of them were eminently skippable. In addition to the fried chicken, we also got the pulled pork box, but it was average at best -- and absolutely incomparable to Fette Sau and most especially Fatty Cue. However, this place is better than The Commodore, which is incredibly annoying with its overly hipstery vibe. Definitely give this place a go -- because it's fun (oh, and the mint limeade is awesome) -- it's great if you're hankering for some greasy southern, but there are some far more superior places in the area.
