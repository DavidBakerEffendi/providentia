I had the roast pork with provolone and broccolini.  The market has so much and at the middle is Tommy DiNics.  The line can get really long during lunch but if you come a little before or after the noon rush you can normally get a sandwich without to much of a wait. The sandwich itself was good nothing mind blowing in my opinion.  I guess since you are there you have to get the sandwich which is famous.   Since its at the market and you can walk around the kitchen it was really cool watching this and every other place prepare the food for your meal.  Definitely worth the try but don't expect to have your socks knocked off.
