I can hardly contain myself for all the love I have for this gem. Jeepney not only hits the spot but takes the beauty of Filipino flavor to new heights. The Kamayan Dinner (held Wednesdays and Thursdays - email jeepneykamayan@gmail.com to make a reservation and pre-order your menu) is a delightful feast that makes you regret not arriving hungrier.  We ordered Lumpiang Shanghai and Banana Ketchup Ribs for Kamayan Pulutan. For Kamayan Ulam: Menudo, Inasal Na Manok, Adobong Hipon, and Garlic Rice. The prix fix menu includes longsanisa, ensalada and halo halo and comes with your order. There are also generous beverage packages. My grandma or mom would probably frown upon how much I frequent Jeepney; lets just say my cooking skills are limited to silog and adobo when it comes to Filipino food. Having grown up near National City (San Diego) - a Little Manilatown in its own right - I have to say the very thought of Filipino food not being dirt cheap (3 items with rice $8) and/or in the form of a buffet comes as a shock. I can't explain how Jeepney does it because you really must come for the experience yourself.  (Maybe its magic?)
