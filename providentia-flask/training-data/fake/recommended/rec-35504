Creative, yes - filling, no. Arrive hungry and you'll leave hungry (or broke).   Portions, while nicely designed and displayed are insultingly small considering the price tag.  The wine list also leaves something to be desired as most bottles are far too expensive for restaurant standards. The ambiance is smooth, chic, and reminds me of East Village yuppie spillover.  Until their cost drops or portions increase, I recommend other nearby restaurants of similar caliber (Mesa Coyoacan comes to mind) where you can find value.
