I must admit this review is unfortunately based off a memory of Luna.  Perhaps even now a shadow of it's former former self even then. It's been a long time since the days of "Looney Louie" as certain folk who knew him affectionately called him.  And I daresay that's perhaps a shame. One of the original pizza trifecta in the area, (the other's being Harry, and probably Park Lane Pizza for what it's NOT worth...) Luna Pizza was a front runner in terms of pushing the pizza envelope as far as I was concerned. Their sauce was sweet and their crust was crispy and thin though not in the same way that Harry's ever was, it was sweeter and at times a bit doughy.  He used only fresh whole mozzarella never shredded and proceeded to put a blend of Italian herbs on each cheese pizza that you ordered and if I remember correctly there wasn't much else. That was then.  Further on down the trail it seemed things got sloppy as the years went by.  Who knows... too much expansion too quickly?  I can recall the days of many a Luna Pizza Parlor in many an area Northhampton, MA for one!  And as time moved on it seemed like so did the people who truly knew the original format for making a pizza at Luna.  Some went on to open their own pizza shops and eventually pizza in the Farmington Valley turned into an amalgamation of Harry's + Luna = whatever happened to be opening that year be it Naples or Joey Garlic's etc. But there was once a time when I couldn't wait to sink my teeth and tastebuds into a hot steaming slice of cheese pizza a la Luna.  And though it's been years, I'd certainly give them a shot again.
