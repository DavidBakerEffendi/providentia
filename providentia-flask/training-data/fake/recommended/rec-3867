Worth the wait! Went on a Saturday night with 4 friends. Was told the wait would be an hour and a half, only waited an hour, drank in the meantime. HUGE portions, cheap cheap CHEEEAP prices. Food came fast. Service was prompt an polite. Ended up staying past closing time, no pressure to hurry and leave. Love love love. Thank you Song!!
