Excellent food for brunch - simplicity displayed elegantly.  The menu has just a few options, and they are all pretty easy, classic brunch options, but they are done very well and presented beautifully for a great price. They are cash only, and it isn't advertised or posted in a visible location, so be prepared for that.  It's my only barrier to returning often.
