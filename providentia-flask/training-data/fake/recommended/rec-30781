After a second visit to Xunta, I had to write a review. If you are a fan of Spanish tapas, this place is great! The food has been so delicious each time, the service is quick and wait staff is very good. The atmosphere is modern and clean with Spanish influences. Highly recommend the chorizo with caramelized onions, the skirt steak with chimichurri, garlic prawns, spicy potatoes, grilled octopus and churros filled with dolce de leche for dessert! It's also BYO so you can't go wrong. It is very noisy and on nights they have live entertainment which includes a Spanish guitar player and Flamenco dancer. It's really loud but very entertaining!
