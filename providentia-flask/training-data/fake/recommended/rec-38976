Walked in without a reservation on a Saturday night at 10:00 and the place was packed. We were greeted pleasantly and seated within fifteen minutes. Our waiter quickly appeared with water, a basket of excellent bread, a warm smile and the kind of professional manner that immediately tells you you are in good hands. Needless to say that the service was topnotch throughout the meal. An appetizer of salmon tartare and one of a delicately sauced chicken were elegant and delicious. Entrees of the lamb shank, Â and duckleg confit and breast were beautifully plated and delicious. Bread pudding and the Odeon Super Sundae were on an excellent par with the rest of the meal. The ambience and attitude of the Odeon gives diners the sense of being truly welcome guests, which is not always the case in busy New York restaurants. I can think of more good things to say about Odeon, but let me sum it all up by describing this place as a perfect example of a top New York restaurant that is serious about maintaining its reputation for excellence by consistently serving great food with the kind of assurance and genuine warmth that keeps patrons coming back again and again for years. Bravo for real professionalism from a restaurant that keeps happily stays at the top of their game. Love this place.
