Came here with a friend for lunch. We started with the clams appetizer and ricotta/truffle oil app with bread. The clams reminded me of a casino-small littlenecks that were absolutely delish. The ricotta app was even better though! We both had burgers. They were pretty good- but I like the burgers at Caseus better. The service (as other yelpers described) was off. I saw a few people waving servers down, and we eventually had to do so for condiments. I really don't like feeling like we are bothering people, and that's how it felt-like they were put out by waiting on the table. For the prices, we have had better....
