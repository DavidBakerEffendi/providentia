We made a return trip to Burlington and once again returned to Sweetwaters. It was our second choice in the Church Street District as out first choice had an hour wait. We were seated promptly at Sweetwaters and asked for our drink orders. Â The staff was attentive but not over the top. The burger that I ordered was flavorful and cooked as ordered. There are better choices in the Church Street District, but Sweetwaters is a good backup.
