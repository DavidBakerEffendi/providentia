My childhood neighbor and friend brought my sister and I here for brunch and it was really good! The beinettes (sp?) were amazing. I'd like to take a bath in that raspberry sauce! My only complaint was lack of space but I mean that's New York for you. Also, my neighbor said that they don't take reservations but when we showed up, they were like "Oh we have a few reservations..." Hmm odd but whatever they were very accommodating and nice so I'm not complaining just worth mentioning that there's some miscommunication on that front.
