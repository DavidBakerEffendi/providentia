I came here tonight ( a Saturday night) with no reservations and tried to beat the dinner crowd by going at 6. However, there were no availability for 30 minutes. I have to say, the front host/hostess seemed a bit flustered but the bartender more than made up for it. We ended up sitting at the bar and ordering our food there and our bartender was the sweetest. In the beginning he only spoke Spanish which was a little intimidating but he was attentive, flirtatious, and fun. The food was great but we knew that coming in because it wasn't our first time. Great Peruvian food & service!
