This is the first hand pulled noodle place I went to in the city after I moved here so for that I'll always hold a special place in my stomach for Tasty's. The noodles were the best I've had at the time until I discovered Lam zhou's - after trying out the 3 main manhattan handpulled noodle spots - this is my final ranking: 1 Lam Zhou's Handpulled Noodles 2. Tasty Hand-pulled Noodles 3. Super Taste From a noodle standpoint - Lam Zhou's is better all around - handpulled and knife peeled. And Tasty's is slightly better on the handpulled noodles than Super Taste (it's a bit thinner) and Super Taste is better on the knife peeled than Tastys which has gotten soggier over the last few times I've been there. I still prefer Tasty's beef broth over all the others - it's lighter/milder and I like the fresh cilantro taste, though Lam zhou's pork bone broth is pretty good. If only I could somehow combine Lam zhou's noodles with Tasty's beef broth - now that would truly be perfection. Try the cucumber appetizer too - very good and a nice side dish with the noodles. They serve a limited selection of bottled asian beers as well. Never had to be seated downstairs yet but from the reaction of a few people that have gone - I'm not sure if I want to venture into there.
