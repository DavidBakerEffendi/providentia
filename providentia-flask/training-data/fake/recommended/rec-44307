Yelp reviews narrowed our dinner choices on this side of Manhattan to a small group of 4 star, $$ restaurants and we ended up at Penelope.  I am glad we did.  Nice starters, humus plate and artichoke dip which was my favorite.  Very good cup of chicken soup followed by tasty arugala salad with white beans.  Lots of variety on the menu including a number of vegetarian selections. Good service.  I'm a fan and will be back.
