Brooklyn Commune has the luxury of being the only show in town. If you have the unfortunate experience of stopping by here in the morning you'll be able to find 1 lone individual trying to single handedly staff a coffee bar counter, cook, wait tables, bus tables, and do dishes. It is a disaster! Sometimes you will even find the ill fitted owners hiding deep in the back of the kitchen While a line forms out the door, (remember, it's the only convenient coffee shop for many citizens and the location is amazing.) While the owner cowers in the depths of the kitchen potential and irritated customers turn and walk out. The owners don't seem to care or lack the ability to face, help, and interact with patrons in their customer service based proprietorship. The coffee is good, the food if you're careful is nice. Emphasis on the careful, at times it feels as if an 8 year old was given free range with the spice rack. Â  My biggest gripe, the severe lack of employees, and the mentality to stand and watch and do nothing as customers walk out the door by the owners. Once a competitor opens up, I think this place will shutter.
