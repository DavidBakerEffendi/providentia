A friend invited me to breakfast, suggesting Lunita's. Â Now, I live right down the block from Lunita's but for the months that it has been open, I have not stepped in once. I'm an Outpost regular, so that was part of it. But also, the building that houses Lunita's just doesn't really catch the eye. I pass it by every single day on my way to the subway to go to work. I said to my friend, "Why not Outpost?" She replied that she liked Outpost and Lunita's both - that it wasn't a competition between the two. Now, having met her there for breakfast, I see exactly what she means. Lunita's is *wonderful* - the owners and staff are friendly. The coffee is strong and delicious. And best of all, they offer what Outpost doesn't and seemingly never will - cooked food. Namely, EGGS. Egg sandwiches, egg plates. That's a game-changer. Plus, let's face it. We love Outpost but sometimes it's a goddamn cluster. I think if you're looking for a quiet heart-to-heart with someone, Lunita's might be a better option. (Have to say, though, if it's Oatmeal you're looking for, stick to Outpost. They are the kings and queens of that particular breakfast item.) All in all, I'm very glad to have popped into Lunita's that one time, because I've done it since then, and will continue to.
