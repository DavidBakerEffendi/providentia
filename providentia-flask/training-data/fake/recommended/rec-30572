I visited this wonderful place last Saturday night with a friend, who had been raving about it for a few months. To start, the place is tiny which struck me the minute I walked in.  However, a charming greeting by the bartendar and skillful attentive service by the server Rafael, immediately calmed my nerves.  I cannot say enough about the service.  Efficient, friendly, but just enough without being intrusive.  We began our meal around 7:30 and left after midnight.   We had almost everything on the menu.  Some standouts included the heirloom tomatoes, brandade, sundried tomato tartine, and the duck rillette.  I would also say the cheeses are of a nice selection, even if they were all American which I did not expect to see here.  It was nice to see this and even nicer to sample them. The wine selection was impressive as well.  The options were numerous enough to always invite another glass, but without being too overwhelming.  Their quirky map on the wall was a nice touch. I realize the cutlery is small (ok, very small), but it adds to the charm of the place.  The food is well worth the price.  I would highly recommend this place for a romantic evening who someone you actually enjoy talking to or catching up with a close friend.
