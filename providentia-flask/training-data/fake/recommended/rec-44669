Hmmm $8-10 for cheese on bread. Oh wait- they give you a little cup of tomato soup with it- were all good! The place is cute, and the food's good (for a "gourmet" grilled cheese), but almost everything on the menu is overpriced. And last time I went the entire place smelled like something was being badly burned- the whole time.
