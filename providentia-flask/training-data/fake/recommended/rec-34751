Went on a Friday night. Was really busy but got our food in a decent amount of time.  Not much seating, but was kinda expecting that.  Kati Rolls . . . great selection, especially vegetarian, which we are.  Out of the 5 we tried, the the chana masala was my fave.  Thought the egg (unda) would be plain egg for our anti-spice 4 year old, but alas, there were onions and a bit of other toppings so if you're picky about something, make sure you ask what's on your selection. Not as greasy as the ones we'd get in Nepal (in that respect, not quite as good), BUT, on the upside, I could finally eat Indian street food without fearing for a gastro-reaction.   It hit the spot.
