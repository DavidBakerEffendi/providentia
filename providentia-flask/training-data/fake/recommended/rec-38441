In a region dotted with non-descript diners and dozens of Dunkin Donuts, The Pantry is a refreshing option for a tasty and reliable morning meal--the stuff of which good days are made. The brief menu isn't exactly filled with innovations: a half-dozen or so variations on eggs benedict, omelets, pancakes, waffles, french toast and the like. A short list of rotating specials adds a little pizzazz with such items as the signature cinnamon roll pancakes for the sugar obsessed ("the taste of cinnamon and sugar baked right in"... with frosting, too!), a special benedict, grapefruit brûlée, and an uncharacteristically disappointing jerk tofu scramble. To some extent, breakfast is breakfast is breakfast. Unless it's brunch, which The Pantry mercifully isn't. Whatever it is you like to eat before noon, you'll likely find a deftly-executed version here and there will be plenty of it. For example, as a recent side of fresh fruit I elected bananas and the portion was, well, bananas. At least two, maybe three all sliced up in a heap. One does not go hungry here, especially when every other party is enjoying a sinful additional "table entrée" to share. What really sets the restaurant apart, though, is its affable service--a rarity in a town that is not exactly recognized for the effusive charm of its residents. Modifications and substitutions are accommodated ungrumpily, which has come in handy when I want egg whites only or to trade the fabulous home fries for something kinder to the waistline but not the tastebuds. With a dining room soundtrack that perfectly complements the jazz festival posters that adorn The Pantry's walls, a music analogy seems unnecessary. But this place really makes a morning sing--and the only scat you'll find here is piped over the speakers, not served up on your plate.
