All hype. Rude and abrasive staff... this is coming from a New Yorker! The bread was boring, steak cut too thick to chew through, cheese was optional and was just cheese whiz. I drove down from NYC just to try this hyped up joint since so many people recommended it, only to be disappointed. The local Kennedy's Fried Chicken in the ghetto neighborhoods can put together a better sandwich. Don't waste your time.
