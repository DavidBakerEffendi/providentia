Okay where to start. Let me start off by telling you how I feel about Newark, NJ.  Unless I'm flying out somewhere, I have zero interest in being there.  After following an invitation to join a lovely family-style lunch at The Monk Room, I now have another reason. Classic Italian cuisine using simple ingredients but packed with flavor.  After trying a few slices from different options, Clamboni and 14 1/2 were my favorites. SO GOOD.  Not a meatball sub fan at all in life. Monk Room changed my mind.   Topped it off with desserts- Melted Budino was heaven in my mouth. Best family-style lunch I've had.  City folks- this place is worth a day trip out to Dirty Jersey :)
