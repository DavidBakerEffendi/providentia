***MEATBALL SHOP MEETS VEGETARIAN'S MEAT CRAVING*** It was 16 degrees outside, and I was DYING for comfort food--specifically meatloaf with mashed potatoes.  AND I'm vegetarian.  Who knew that my meat craving would meet an incredible vegetarian option just blocks from my apartment.  So bummed that I have lived down the street for over a year, and never knew what I was missing.   Ordered the Vegetarian "Meatballs" over Mashed Potatoes topped with Mushroom Gravy.  I wanted to do the Snoopy Dance after the first bite but it was a packed house.  Now I know why.  My meal was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! I savored every meat-free bite. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU Meatball Shop for creating an incredible product to cater to us non-meat eating peeps!!!! LOVED the rockin' ambiance and cute bartender. Oh, and homemade ice cream sandwiches are a must! VERY EXCITED to be a regular! Big kiss!
