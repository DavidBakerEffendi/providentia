So visiting Philly, you can't leave without eating a Philly sandwich.  So we checked out Sonnys and we literally had a variety of them to try out.  Out of all of the choices the one with cheez whiz was awesome.  I was actually surprised but YUM!  Now the others with the other cheeses were bland.  I didn't notice with the cheez whiz one, but the meat was not seasoned at all.  Nothing, no salt or pepper.  Just plain meat.  Of course the meat was tender and cooked great, just so bland. Of course I can't compare this to any other place in Philly but in comparison to ones I've had elsewhere in texas, it was avg, so they get 3 stars So next time if we go to Philly we will order cheez whiz philly sandwich. Btw service was great, they forgot our order from a call in and quickly made them so we didn't wait forever with the HUGE line they had.
