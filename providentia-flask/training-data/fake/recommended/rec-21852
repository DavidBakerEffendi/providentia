First of all - our waiter was one of the best waiters we've ever had. We made it clear this was our first time there (but had been recommended by many friends) and that we were excited to have a meal of exploring new tastes! The cocktail menus is great - tried something called "Widow's last caress" and it was amazing. They have lots of flavor infused alcohols with make for cocktails I'd never even thought of before. Next we had a Charcuterie and Cheese small plates. Local cheese and creative meats like Lamb Pastrami - very good. Partnered with house made mustards and a beet cream cheese spread. Wonderful for this time of year! Short ribs and all the flavors of greens and such that come with it were wonderful. Our waiter suggested a glass of red that complimented perfectly. My beau had the duck - very tender and meaty. The mix of cabbage and mushrooms was the only part lacked taste. Â  Dessert - shared the Pumpkin Bread Pudding - such a seasonal treat! Earlier in the meal we tried a Apple cocktail (with cinnamon in fusion) which I think would have partnered much better for dessert. Over all - the service was awesome, the food creative and fun. A little pricey, but totally worth it for a meal you want to take your inner "foodie" to!
