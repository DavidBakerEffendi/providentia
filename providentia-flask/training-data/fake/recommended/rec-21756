I hosted a bridal shower brunch here for my sister and I cannot say enough great things about it!  I live out of state and only communicated with Matthieu via email.  He was so helpful and accommodating.   The place is great inside, pretty decor with a small bar area.  The food was absolutely delicious and so reasonably priced.  I would recommend the pancake with fresh fruit very highly.  They also made us one of the loveliest cakes ever.  It was a mousse like lemon cake with a chocolate glaze frosting, beautifully decorated.  Absolutely perfect location for a casual brunch or a larger get together.
