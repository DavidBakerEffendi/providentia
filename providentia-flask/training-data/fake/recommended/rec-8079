The service was great, very attentive.  However there seemed to be a little disorganization the day I was there.  Servers had trouble figuring out where dishes were going. I got the spring onion soup and it was very yummy, best creamy onion soup I've had.  I also got a burger, and it was nicely prepared but extremely bland, even adding salt didn't save it.  I looked at a few of the other dishes coming out and they did look good and I was listening to positive comments from other customers so that's encouraging and I might come back.
