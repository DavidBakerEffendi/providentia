I grew up in Princeton and Hoagie Haven was the place to gather late Friday nights with the gang and scarf down cheese steaks that were out of this world. My folks still live there, so I get back frequently and every time I do, I stop by the Haven, order one of those cheese steaks loaded with fried onions, lettuce, tomatoes and more and am instantly transported right back to high school right from the first bite. Hoagie Haven is virtually an institution in Princeton, and the lines still from out the door for their amazing food. Wish they'd open an outpost in Santa Fe....
