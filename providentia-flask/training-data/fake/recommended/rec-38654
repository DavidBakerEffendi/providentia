My favorite sushi spot in town. the decor is bright and cheery, but the lights are dim, creating a great sushi atmosphere. as others have said, it's a tight fit most of the time. the reasons i love this place start with its location. it happens to be just around the corner from my apartment. but that's not all. they have a good selection of vegetarian sushi options, which works well for weirdos like me that like sushi but don't eat fish. the wait staff are friendly and helpful, and the chefs will make stuff not on the menu if you ask nicely (not common among locals). the prices are about average for a decent sushi place, though the vegetarian tempura is a little pricey, but i can't resist. it's my favorite. they put a spicy mayo on it that is just the right amount of zing for me. the menu has a huge variety of "fusion" options in addition to standard sushi fare. they've even added a vegetarian option to the fusion menu, which i like to think was the result of my continuous efforts to get them to expand their veggie options. In short, if you're in the neighborhood and like sushi, eat here.
