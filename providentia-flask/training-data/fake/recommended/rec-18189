Most recent meal was a major let down.  On a quiet weekend evening, they tried to stick our party of 7 next to the kitchen door.  When we insisted on moving to a lower traffic/noise location in the restaurant, the response was less than gracious.   This set the tone for surly service that persisted throughout the meal.  The food was also far below the standard we have come to expect from D&L's.  My sausage cacciatore was bland and greasy.  A couple of  better dishes around the table broke the otherwise complete sense of disappointment.  One couple we were reintroducing to one of our favorite spots won't be going back. Maybe summertime vacation schedules are to blame?  Hope so....
