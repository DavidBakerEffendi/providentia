have only been for lunch so can't comment on dinners.i have had the tilapia lunch entree on several occasions and while good the portions i think are small. a friend of mine once ordered the tortellini entree  and was shocked at the tiny bit of food that was offered as an entree. she left still hungry. now for the positives--- the bread served at mickeys is very good but have to ask for butter or you will not receive it as an option to the olive oil on the table. but here is the best bet--- my friends and i have taken to ordering their soup for lunch since the portion there is enormous and usually very filling. the price is right too. soup and maybe splitting a sandwich with your lunch companion would be plenty. the entrees as i have stated are really not worth it because of the high prices and small portions, as for desserts we have ordered       the apple tart dessert which again is small and pricey but very tasty.
