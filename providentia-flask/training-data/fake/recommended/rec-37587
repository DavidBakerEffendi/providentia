I went here due to a suggestion by Anthony Bourdain, and the siren songs of a sardine sandwich filled with boiled egg, onion, and black pepper would make any man jump off the deck. South Philly and in particular the region where American Sardine Bar is located is going through something of a renovation in recent years due to its direct line of sight to center city. If this continues I anticipate places like this, and others around it will have its rent increase and either evolve in to something yuppie or hipster like, or cease to exist. Which is sad, because this place is truly something great in terms of a neighborhood bar, it is the place where you could go and sit around all day long without a care in the world about whats happening outside. Or even whats happening outside of your 2 feet border. I also discovered the wonders of the Narrgansett beer, and it is something amazing to be sure.
