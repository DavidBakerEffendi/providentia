Large group dinners are not generally on my list of things to do on a Friday night, but Kefi managed to surprise and please me.  For a party of about 15 we had limited menu options but there was still plenty unique and tasty options.  With the wine continuing to flow and the most tasty dumplings, I left a happy lady.
