Continued excellence! I stole a Tuesday morning with my husband and we had a delightfully quiet breakfast together. If you don't care for the weekend fuss make an effort to come by during the week. Regulars are hanging around getting their usual and the atmosphere is very calm. I don't need to mention the food is phenomenal!
