I am sad to say I was completely underwhelmed by the supposed originator of the cheesesteak.  The employees were too interested in their own conversation about the bars they had hit the night before to pay me any mind.  The cheese was so generic to almost be insulting and the steak was anything but lean. I felt an obligation to try a cheesesteak from here so long as I was in town, and I can honestly say my visit to Philadelphia would have been better had I skipped this bland, unexciting stop for dining.
