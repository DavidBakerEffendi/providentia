We have eaten here on a previous trip to NYC and enjoyed the food and service (4 stars). On this trip, we tried to go twice. Once on Thursday at 10:45 and once on Monday at 9am. On Thursday, they were between breakfast and lunch service and were only serving drinks. On Monday (Columbus Day) they were not open for breakfast and were not going to be opening until 10:30 for brunch. Sigh. We ended up at Chelsea market both days. You might make sure they are open and serving when you want to go.
