checked in at room service on my walk home, we spotted a lovely table outside and decided it would be a waste if we didn't sit down for 1 drink. We took a glance at their (affordable) wine list and went with the pinot grigio. I wish I remembered the name because I really liked the fish sitting on the beach chair. We also proceeded to order the Asian Fritters, a combo platter of fried tofu, dumplings and spring rolls. Yum. Was the perfecting ending to a perfect evening.
