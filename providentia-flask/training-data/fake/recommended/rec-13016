Great service and great food. This place is a hole in the wall. When I got there, I was literally standing in front of the restaurant before realizing it was the actual restaurant. The inside of the restaurant is really small with probably 10 seats in total. I got a warm greeting from the guy behind the counter and the cook (owner) when I walked in. They were extremely friendly and helpful with what to order. However, I already knew what I wanted when i walked in from reviewing yelp prior to my entrance. I ordered the chicken biscuit sandwich, and my, was it one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. It was also the best restaurant I went to on my 5 day trip in NY. The biscuit was freshly made with freshly cooked chicken. It also had some coleslaw with some flavorful sauce drizzled inside. Just talking about it still makes me salivate. It was so good that I came back two hours later and tried the beef sandwich. That was also amazing! After each of the meal, the server gives you free dessert that is made fresh as well. I LOVED this place. I would highly recommend this place to anyone that lives in NY or visits NY!
