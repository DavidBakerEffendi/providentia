How can this place not have 5 stars????? Diner and Marlow have changed my standards for restaurants, and I basically compare every place I go to these two spots.  I never want to not eat family style, seasonal, changing menus again.  Simple, rustic, fresh, and absolutely delicious.  This is how food should be. Yes, the waits can be insane.  So I don't go on Fri and Sat nights.  The atmospheres (I'm wriitng about both restos here, because they are so similar and I love them equally) are near perfect (if you're okay sharing tables, or having very little space between you and your neighbors).  The drinks are good.  And they care about what's important. I go to both as frequently as possible (they are my favorite spots in nyc), and occassionally have something that's not completely amazing.  but it's rare. Thank you, dear Andrew, for opening these spots.
