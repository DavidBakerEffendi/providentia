A top choice in Flatiron and likely best Greek / Mediterranean in the city. I rarely drop by the area, but when there I definitely make the effort to eat at quality places. ilili is phenomenal beyond just food; the trendy, dim-lit ambiance and personable staff are the complements that make the entire dining experience there so great. The menu is packed with great options, sometimes even a bit overwhelming. If you come with a group of 2-4, I highly recommend the royal feast which is a dozen of the most popular dishes (plus it solves your potential anxiety of just not knowing what to pick). Most definitely my favorite dish (not included in the feast) is the duck shawarma (see pictures) - the duck itself is well prepared and the sauce / vegetable pairings that its wrapped with go down superbly. The candy bar seems to the be the most popular dessert, and it sure is great if you have room. Price is reasonable and portions are generous. Highly recommended!
