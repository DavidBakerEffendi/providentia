I'm going to add some moderation to this noodle house partay. Went on a Sunday & there was no wait for the table, which is always good. Had a cafeteria vibe, which I was expecting thanks to Yelp. We ordered the pig ear/beef/beef tendon platter, lamb with shaved noodle, and sliced beef with shaved noodle. I was surprised at how mediocre it all was. I won't comment on the meat platter other than to say it was incredibly fatty. The sauce/oil was delish, but not enough to make me ignore the weight gain that would ensue if I actually ate that stuff. I also cannot recommend the experience of chewing on animal body parts - guess I'm not a fan of cartilage! The soups by themselves are really a base that you need to add your own seasoning to. I didn't want to get too crazy with the seasoning lest it all become inedible, so I ended up with a bland bowl & my guy ended up with a way too spicy bowl. The lamb was mostly bones, although the beef was fine (but unseasoned). I definitely left feeling very full, but not very satisfied. I also don't think it's super healthy to eat so much at once. I often find myself serving as a voice of dissent mixing things up here on Yelp, so here we go again: I wouldn't go back.
