Went to the smaller Dmitri's in Queen's village with my boyfriend for his birthday. It was still early, and there were plenty of seats, but the waitress tried to sit us elbow to elbow at some table where other people were already sitting. Mind you, the bar area was completely EMPTY! So, we told her we didn't wanna sit next to people and were finally able to get a seat at the bar. Waitress was kind of snoody as well, which kind of ruined our initial vibe. Oysters were WAAAYY too salty and they didn't even offer the spicy shrimp special! I recommend the Dmitri's on 23rd and Pine 100x over this little craphole!!!
