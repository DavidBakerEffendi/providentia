Inspired by the NYTimes piece describing the impending massive expansion pan by these guys, who have join forces with the people behind Five Guys rapid ascension from the DC suburbs, I decided it was time to weight in on this much hyped halal cart.  I definitely think it is just a tad overrated, and probably not even in the top ten of such carts I have sampled.  That being said the lamb is quite tasty, and both the generously applied white sauce and pita above average, and the price is always nice.  I found the chicken actually a bit nasty however, and no matter what I have ordered I have always received a rapid and harsh one-two punch to the stomach soon afterwards and wound up regretting the meal for the greater remaining part of the day, a common occurrence where street-meat is concerned.
