Decided to try this place after yelping. The host tried to seat us right at the door (boo!)     We finally got a decent seat in the little greenhouse room. Both of us ordered burgers with cheddar. Cooked to our specifications. The food was good.   We are not beer drinkers, so we just ordered soda. They had run out of root beer so kinda disappointed about that. Service was ok....server forgot to ask for my id as I request my I'd be checked since I recently had my wallet stolen. Average rating is what is deserved here.
