Room Service? Yes please! You can hang that 'do not disturb' sign on my back because now that I'm here I have no intention of worrying about a damn thing. I'm here to be pampered. Super duper attendant servers and waitstaff, Our glasses were never half empty, and the food was DELICIOUS for a very reasonable price. Â  And pampered we were. Walked in to find our hostess decked out in a black tutu dress and we walked past the swanky bar, on the checkered tiles, past the multiple Buddha statues, and into a seat right across from the beautiful chandelier in the middle of the restaurant. Had a great time relaxing with the ambient music, taste-ay food, and fabulous decor. I'll be checking in again SOON...
