Four of us hit up The Redhead for a late dinner after seeing a movie in Union Square. The atmosphere is well put together, but relaxed, which was exactly what we were looking for. The service was helpful, friendly and attentive. We all had a difficult time ordering because of the array of great menu options. Apps: We ended up ordering the peanut and bacon peanut brittle, pretzels and mustard, and the wild mushroom flat bread. All three were good, but the flat bread was the best of the three. (I liked the peanuts but was a little underwhelmed after all the raving reviews about them). Entrees: I had a hard time deciding between the shrimp and grits and the duck gumbo, but ended up ordering the duck gumbo based on the suggestion from the waitress. It was good, but just a little too spicy than I would have liked. Others ordered the potato gnocchi and the pork schnitzel; everyone else was happy with their entrees. The sides we ordered with the entrees stood out more than the entrees themselves, the acorn squash was awesome, the tater tots were very good, and the corn muffins were delicious. When we got the bill, I was amazed by the price! $145 for three apps, four entrees, three extra sides, four beers and two glasses of wine. It would be a safe bet to say you are not going to find a better price for that quality of meal anywhere in NYC. We had a great dinner at The Redhead. It is a restaurant that carries itself very well, delivers good food, and refrains from being pretentious.
