4.5 stars Great restaurant. The decor was nice and the food was delicious. The drink special was okay. For $11 I expected a little more - the bartender had to remake it because he didn't make enough the first time. BUT overall, it was a great experience. My friend and I split the Plato Don Pescado, which was perfect. We started off sharing a tostada and for what we paid, it was worth it. The drink was the only exception. Sticking to beers might be the best way to go.
