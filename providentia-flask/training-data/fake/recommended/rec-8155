I can't believe I've lived in West Philly this long and just now came here. I have Thai food/iced coffee 5 blocks from my apartment! My boyfriend and I split some crab dumplings, which were nothing spectacular but still pretty good. I ordered a Thai iced coffee which was friggin' phenomenal as well as pineapple fried rice which would have been PERFECT except the pineapple wasn't ripe yet. The boy ordered some curry coconut chicken deal which was a little sweet for me, but he loved it. He also drank this enormous green drink which I found repulsive and sugary, but he seemed to really enjoy it. I look forward to trying some coconut soup and papaya salad. :] -1 star for the not-quite-ripe pineapple and sub par dumplings.
