Bill's has been consistently amazing for over 10 years since my days at Rutgers Newark. Today was no different. I had my usual, Chicken Slouvaki, and it was absolutely delicious. The chicken is prepared fresh with nice vegetables on a warm pita with homemade Tzatki sauce. Amazing and a steal! This healthy lunch for $5? Unheard of! Give it a try. You will be happy.
