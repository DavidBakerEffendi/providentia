I second the BLT recommendation; one of the best sandwiches I've had in a while. The yucca chips and pickled veggies that came with it were also stellar. They serve Stumptown coffee (hooray!) and have a great variety of prepared food and sides. Also, they're vegan friendly! Wonderful ambiance in a spacious, well laid out cafe. A great addition to the neighborhood.
