I live in the neighborhood and was excited for a new restaurant. The staff is very nice, the service is good and the atmosphere is nice as well. The food is ok - I wouldn't say great, but ok. I've most definitely been to better restaurants that serve this type of cuisine (as some other yelpers have noted). I will also say this place is pretty expensive (we had four drinks and two entrees and our bill was $130). Not many others have noted this, and I'm wondering if that's just indicative of a lot of the newer, more moneyed people moving into the zipcode. Regardless, I'm glad I tried it but am Â in no rush to go back. If I were to go back I'd have a drink at the front bar and eat elsewhere.
