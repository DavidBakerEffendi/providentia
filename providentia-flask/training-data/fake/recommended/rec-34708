My review is based on reality vs. expectations given the hype around this truck. Anyone walking or driving by 53rd & 6th after 2pm will notice the ridicolously large line for this food truck. My friends who are also quite familiar with NY late night dining also raved about the food here. After waiting in the line, which honestly isn't bad as the guys are very effecient, I have tried the food and the best word to describe it is... average. Yes, it does the trick and fulfills your hunger but I would never describe it spectacular nor would come here regularly. The white sauce is quite decent but cannot offset the poor ratio of rice to meat. I would come here again & give this place another shot but my recommendation to anyone eating here would be to definitely temper your expectations and you should have a good meal here!
