We came here a bit late in the night.  I just got of a plane, into a cab and directly to Salt Bar which turned out to be 1.) TOTALLY EMPTY (b/c the stereo system was out; 2.)  Totally quiet (b/c the stereo system was out); and 3.) No longer serving food (b/c the cook was out).  So i regrouped and left. After walking a few blocks (w/ overnight bag in tow) i pushed through the doors of Jadis.  Warm and dark with a sprinkling of people (around midnight on weds) I sat down at the bar and ordered a ham panni.  It was simple and delicious with a sweet balsamic vinaigrette salad accompaniment (which I stuffed into the panni and happily devoured.) HMMMM.... The had a good variety of wine, not too much to overwhelm but enough to keep you happy.  Around one the food service shut down but they had a nice array of bit size quiches, charcuterie and cheese plates to hold you over (if you ordered in time and if they didn't run out of bread - but again, it was 1 am on a Weds. - can't expect that much.) I'd definitely come back and am sure that the homey country library (complete with chess board) would make for a great and easy evening out with friends, at least as a starting point.
