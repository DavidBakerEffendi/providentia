Times must be tough here... I asked to sub shallots for bacon, well we can do that but there is an up charge... Really?!?! Bacon is more expensive then shallots... My friend orders a chicken sandwich, can I have more aioli? They respond, you have some on your sandwich.  Yes but I'd like more, well there is an up charge.  On the positive side the burger was done to temperature, but considering there is an up charge for everything save your money; I'd rather go to Royal.
