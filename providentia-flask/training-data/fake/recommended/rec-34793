This place is more of a 4.5 for me, but I'm rounding up because overall, it was a great place. I was meeting my cousin here for a late dinner, and really didn't know what to expect. I read coffee in the name, so was pretty weary of what food and beer would be like here. I ordered grilled cheese and french fries (healthy, I know), and got the pilsner beer as well. It came out to about $14, not too bad for a New York meal. The reason why I give this place 4.5 stars is because, once I went back for a second beer, I realized the beer itself is $6. Not extremely expensive, but I really hate paying that much for beer. The food was great, and OMG - the portions were huge. I literally must have had 8 potatoes' worth of fries, and I am not complaining. I also like the fact that you can seat yourself. That leads to 2 pros - not having a waiter to tip (can you tell yet that I am a cheapass?) and not feeling pressure to rush through a meal. In fact, we sat there for a while after we ate, and no one said anything. Overall, a really good experience. It's a unique place with some unique employees, but I loved it. I would definitely go
