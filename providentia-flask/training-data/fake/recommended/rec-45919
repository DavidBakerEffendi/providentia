GREAT EXPERIENCE! Not sure if John is the manager but he along with the others provided excellent service and were very attentive. I had the vegetable and shrimp tempura as an appetizer (included sweet potatoes) which was very good. Then for dinner I had the King of the Sea which included lobster, scallops, and shrimp with rice,veggies and a butter dipping sauce. They also had drink specials which my friends and I enjoyed the Zombie and Pineapple Bombs. Next time I am in town I plan on going back.
