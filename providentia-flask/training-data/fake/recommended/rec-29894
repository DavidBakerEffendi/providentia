Everything about Riverpark was phenomenal. The food, the wine, the atmosphere, the view. The best word I could use to describe the food is...exciting. Everything we tried surprised us, in the best way possible. The wine our server recommended was perfect. In fact, if I had to pick something that was just okay, it would probably be the dessert, but only because I'm comparing it to the amazing food. We also ended up not ordering their popular cereal & milk dessert, and we sort of regretted that. I can't wait to come back here again.
