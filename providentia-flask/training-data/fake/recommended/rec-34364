I have been going to Calandra Mediterranean Grill since its inception; I've never been disappointed with the high quality of food, the authentic flavors and wonderful presentations. Last night I had the Lemon Sole with homemade fettucini special; the combination of fresh seafood homemade pasta and incredible lemon sauce was out of this world. Their Pizza's, Pasta's, Beef and Seafood is all excellent. I live in Florida but travel on business and I am frequently in the Fairfield area and make it a point to have a great meal at Calandras each time I'm here
