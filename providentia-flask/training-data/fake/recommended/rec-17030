So far I have only had their pizza and garlic knots. Â The pizza was a 3. (very good, but nothing special) The garlic knots were a 5+!!! Unlike typical garlic knots, these had cheese in them, but not so much that one would feel stuffed or sick after eating them. They had a perfect balanced of garlic, basil, and whatever other seasonings they use. I live in Lodi (Heights border) and sometimes go here just for the knots, as sadly I am out of their delivery mileage. I plan on trying some other items in the near future, but in the meantime definitely try them and do yourself a favor and get the knots!!!
