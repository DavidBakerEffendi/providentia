Let me start by saying I'd been to Lupa about a year ago and thought it was excellent.  My boyfriend and I recently visited NYC and I was RAVING about Lupa.  I called a month in advance to make sure we could secure a spot at this restaurant while we were in town.  My, my how things have changed. Let's start with the good: *Sommelier made a great wine recommendation at a very affordable price point *Romantic and cozy atmosphere *Very friendly/knowledgeable waitress Now, on to the bad: *THE MUSIC.  I know this seems strange, but the music choice was SO bizarre that it ruined the atmosphere.  We're talking the song "Stacy's Mom" was played.  Seriously?? *The tuna & cannelini bean starter.  For $10, we received a tiny ramekin containing red onion, cannelini beans, and the most rancid tuna I think I've ever had.  I almost couldn't continue with the meal it was so repulsive. *The pasta.  This has gone so far downhill, I was in shock.  We ordered the gnocchi with sausage (which was just okay) and the "signature dish" of Bucatini All' Amatriciana (which tasted on par with Chef Boyardee). On top of all of this, the prices increased significantly since the last time I was there.  I was extremely disappointed in my experience at Lupa - a restaurant I would have considered one of my top 10 just one short year ago. Side note:  I later read in New York Magazine that many of Batali's staff members are filing wage violation lawsuits against the celebrity chef, causing him to visit his restaurants very infrequently.  Perhaps his lack of oversight has caused this major decline in quality...
