essentially 2 places. #1 great beer place. large beer menu, rotating specials, happy hour 7 days a week.....food is across the board an eh. uninspiring at best ok. sad really, this is so close to being a great restaurant.....ambience, the website implies that the staff is young caucasian aryan looking women wearing traditional garb. reality is 2 asian women wearing black t shirts and jeans and a grubby bearded white guy white guy behind the bar....they are not what they purport themsekves to be.........brauhaus schmitz has a great beer list excellent food staff dressed in traditional german garb oompah music. you get the real thing. .....so bottom line have your beer here but get your food somewhere else. there 2 many other excellent food places nearby to accept such poor execution on the food......schnitzel, mashed potatos, ghoulash are terrible, pretzels and potato pancakes are just ok, the knockwurst was pretty good...should be better
