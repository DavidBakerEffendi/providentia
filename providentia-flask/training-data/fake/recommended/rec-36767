What luck that we stepped into this cute, cozy place during our gallery romp in Chelsea. The bonus was that artist Enrique Chagoya was sitting at a table only a few seats away, so we joined him for lunch. Everything on the menu looked so good it was hard to decide. People were getting their meals around us and you heard little gasps of delight because the portions were HUGE.  I had the ravioli in pesto sauce- I sucked it down in two minutes, and used the bread to mop up every last morsel. On the way to the restroom I saw that there was a secret room in the back (Other yelpers mentioned a garden).  I can't wait to return to New York and eat here again.
