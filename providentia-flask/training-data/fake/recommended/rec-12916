The food is great and addicting, and you get a crap load of it for only $6. I like the mixed chicken and lamb. You are guaranteed that the food is fresh because of the sheer amount of people ordering it-- they are constantly cooking new batches of meat and rice. However, the serving size is so huge that it's easy for me to want to vomit as I scrape the last few bites out of the foil bowl. I overdid it and ate this two weeks in a row, so now I can only stomach this once every few months.
