This place was phenomenal!  Annual trip to NYC with friends, and we were craving some good authentic Italian food, only to stumble into UVA since we happened to be close by.  And let me tell you, all 4 of our dishes were A-MAZING.  Not to mention the ambience... We sat on the garden patio and it just felt like we were in Italy.  UVA will definitely be a "must" when we return to NY again.  I'm only disappointed we didn't stumble upon it sooner!
