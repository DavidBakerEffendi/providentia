Lil Burgers is where its at!!! I walked into Lil Burgers today just because I saw it and was hungry. I met Pattie at the counter and told her I had no clue what this place was about. Pattie is sweet as cotton candy! She explained everything about the menu to me and I made my decision to get some Chilli Cheese Lil Burgers. THEY WERE AWESOME!!!! Sliders on Potato Rolls is something a single guy would do for dinner (as I am) but it was so great!! They also have Funnel Cake Fries (which are also AWESOME!) which I will be having all anytime I get the taste for funnel cake and there is no carnival or fair around. All in all I found this place to be awesome from the service and taste sides. There is also Veggie Burgers and full size Chicken & Philly Cheese (Steak & Chicken) Sandwiches. I also saw disco fries on the menu, Which we know is a NJ staple food!! Why are you still reading me ramble, go there now!!!!
