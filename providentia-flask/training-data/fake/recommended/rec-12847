I love this place but it's worth the wait sometimes. This time, I waited 2hrs to be seated. The hostess wrote my number down and told me she will text me when my table was ready in 2hrs. When I didn't get a text 2hrs later, I went to the hostess and she told me I had to wait another 30 min. At the point, I wanted to give up, but noticed there were several tables open and asked if we could sit there. She finally said yes we could sit and didn't realized seats were open. We always order various things to share and normally we order blueberry pancakes, banana walnut pancakes, cheese grits, biscuits, and rosemary sausages, but this time we want to try something different so instead of the blueberry pancakes, we ordered the eggs Benedict with ham. The eggs Benedict was awful. I like poached eggs to be soft so when you cut the egg, the yolk comes out. The eggs were overlooked and yolk inside was hard. We should of the ordered the same thing... When you go to Clinton Baking Co, order the pancakes and the sausages. They are my favorite! The pancakes are big and very fluffy. The syrup that they serve with the pancakes is small, so you need to ask for extra. As for the biscuits, I love it but make sure you don't order it in the afternoon because they were a little hard to eat.
