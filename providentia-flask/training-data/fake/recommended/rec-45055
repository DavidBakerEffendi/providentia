I drove by the store by accident the other day after shopping at the nearby Fairway Market. My gf and I shared a lobster roll and it made me thanked God for giving me such crappy sense of direction!   I've rarely had lobster meat so tender and delicate, and the light dressing (very little mayo, lemon, and either old-bay or paprika powder) serves the lobster just right.  The lobster is accompanied by scallions and shredded lettuce that provide a nice texture and contrast. Last but not least is the pan-buttered hot-dog bun that all sandwich bread should aspire to. It's slightly toasty, buttery but not greasy.   There's really no space to stand and eat (we ate in the car), but one can down one of these rolls in just a few minutes.  I feel it's entirely worth the 14 bucks and hope to go again soon!
