This review is for JB's Brunch specifically. Though I'm sure my review of their bar/music scene would be positive as well. First off, our waitress was great. Totally sweet and attentive. Even when she corrected my pronunciation of the menu board's "Chiquilles"...I'm actually not even sure if I spelled that right. My dining buddy and I had the: oyster stew, whiskey donut, chiquilles, pork belly & grits, and a side of spinach. It sounds like a lot of food because it was a lot of food. I'm proud to say we held our own though. The oyster stew was very good, not too creamy. The whiskey donut was cute (yep) and you don't feel like they've robbed you of the middle hole like those thieves at Dunkin Donuts and every other donut establishment in the world. It truly tastes like whiskey, and that little munchkin donut hole tastes like a straight shot. It's a rather clever concept. Our brunch entrees were great, the pork belly dish being the better of the two. Chiquilles is like Hueveos rancheros with a ton of tortilla layers. Good day after drinking dish I'd say. I would definitely come back here for brunch. I like that their menu deviates from the traditional Benedict & french toast theme.
