Came here with a friend Saturday night. There were many empty tables open and the hostess gave us a hard time about being late. She sat us down but it definitely wasn't a nice first impression. My friend and I started with the burrata which was the highlight of the meal. Perfectly creamy. I had the grilled salmon for my entree though which was pretty bland and undercooked. My friend had the short rib pasta which she didn't love. Although the food was okay, I wouldn't come back.
