First place im writing a review of via yelp..service was a little slow and the place was not busy...food is well seasoned and feels authentic--large order of spare ribs and 2 sides with a cold glass of sweet tea and bread pudding for dessert--all for $20...I dont normally eat in Connecticut, but when I do...I prefer Cast Iron Soul:)
