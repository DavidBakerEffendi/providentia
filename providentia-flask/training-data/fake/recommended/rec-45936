Horrible food. Not fit for any real Mexican foodies or native Californians like myself.  Decor is tacky.  Tacos are yucky. Salsa tastes like it's from a jar...probaby made in New York City ;)  I've tried it 3x hoping I had a bad day but nope...I have had 3 bad days there.  Sorry guys I LOVE my Mexican food and this is by far one of the worst!
