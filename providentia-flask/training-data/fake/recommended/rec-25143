Let me start this by saying tacos are my favorite food in the world. While nothing tops mom's, the tacos at Taqueria Diana left me satisfied and overwhelmingly happy. The al pastor was amazing and the corn tortillas were the perfect vehicle for the protein heavy goodness. If you're looking for veggies, keep moving - no lettuce or tomato here. This is a great place to stop in for a quick eat and head on your way. Very happy and will be returning.
