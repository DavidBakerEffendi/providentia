This is place is awesome!  My favorite coffee shop in the Girard Ave/No Libs area.  It seems like every breakfast sandwich in the area is made by microwaving the eggs - which is gross - not here!!  Milk Crate uses an actual pan and stove to cook their awesome egg n cheeses, which are very reasonably priced and taste great!  And they will lovingly apply your choice of condiment in a thin spread on BOTH HALVES of your bun of choice.  Amazing.  Staff is super nice and very peaceful/chill atmostphere in general... they have a GIGANTIC iced coffee for only 3 bucks... One Shot kiss my ASS!
