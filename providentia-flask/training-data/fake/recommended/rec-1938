I might just be a tourist that doesn't know any better but Geno's tasted damn good to me.  I got the wit whiz and it was way better than any other place in the US I've been.  There hot sauce was surprising a lot hotter than I thought so I had to brush it off to not ruin my yummy cheese steak.   I've heard that some locals hate this place due to political reasons and health consciousness.  With this in my mind I still had a good time and delicious meal.  A must try if you are visiting Philly.
