Pretty cool old school bar. But the Bistro Burger is at $8.75 and it's pretty small. Really good, but it's very similar to the burger at New Park Tavern, which is larger, comes with fries, and only $7. The drink prices seem good, until you get your drink. They're the same 10 oz mugs you get at Green Rock's happy hour. I'd stop by if I were in the area, but A Salt and Battery is right down the street and still on my to do list.
