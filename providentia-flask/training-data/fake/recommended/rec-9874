Ohhhh, disappointment! Anytime there's a place with a huge line, you need to ready yourself for disappointment because the hype can kill an otherwise good burger. My friend and I strolled into Umami burger on a weekend and found no line. (This was still the summer) We were seated within 20 minutes. We ordered the truffle burger and the duck burger, along with truffle fries and tator tots. The tots were good and the truffle fries too but for the duck burger, I felt it was missing a little flavor. The meat was cooked rare, but the apricot was missing just a little bit. I wish there was more. On the bites that I had an even amount of patty, spread and toppings, it was good but I just wish there was more. The truffle burger knocked it outta the joint though! I'm talking winning gold stars everywhere! Bottom line, everything I tried was okay, but only the truffle burger won me over!
