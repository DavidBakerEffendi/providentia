We went to Rucola on the recommendation of two separate friends for an anniversary dinner.  After being told it would be 60 to 90 minute wait, we grabbed a seat at the bar to try the cocktails knowing it would be a long wait.  The host came over within minutes to seat us, and maybe that should have been a sign.  The service was VERY rushed - the waitress was behind the host asking for our dinner order within seconds of being seated at our table. We were granted a few minutes, and placed our order while enjoying the appetizer we ordered at the bar.  Our dinner plates were out about 5 minutes later, when we were hardly through our appetizer.  The risotto was fine, but the fusilli was a beige mush.  The cocktails were delicious, and the setting was charming.  I hope it was just an off-night, but unfortunately for them, I won't go back to find out.
