Great place to grab a beer and have a few appetizers. I made the mistake of ordering scallops for lunch (who orders scallops for lunch right?). But my boyfriend had the chicken chimichurri with bacon which was tastier, 7 out of 10. I would return due to their nice beer selection but would stick to fail proof food options.
