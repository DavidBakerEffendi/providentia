Let me keep this short and sweet. Being in the service industry myself I know how annoying customers can be. I showed up with my sister a few minutes before lunch closed and we couldn't find a restaurant anywhere for an hour. The gracious staff here took our lunch order despite the time and were super friendly!!! They made me want to be a better server / bartender just by the excellent customer service they provided. I hated to be that customer coming in when the kitchen closes but they assured we were no bother !! Amazing food as well good god!!!! Thank you so much!!!!
