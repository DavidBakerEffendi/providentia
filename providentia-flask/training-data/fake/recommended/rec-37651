Just had a horrible experience here - have been a fan since it opened but the guy running it last night was either high of has totally lost sight of what's important when running a business. The problem mostly came down to service - they never came back to ask about more drinks; we asked for some tahini to mellow out the insanely salty food which never came; and my friend's plate was literally removed midbite (he was holding on to a dripping kebab sandwich when the plate was snatched without asking). We told the waiter in the nicest possible way that'd we'd had a not-great experience and listed the reasons. And the admittedly nice waiter, who seemed to actually care about our crappy experience, came back to tell us after talking with the manager, "I can't do anything right now, I'm really sorry." I really wasn't expecting anything other than the manager checking in with us, or maybe offering us another round of drinks. But nada. With its club-level music and nonchalant attitude, I know this place thinks it's "fun," and there may be a very few people who agree, but trust me, that's not going to last. This place went in one night from a neighborhood gem to something I'm not sure I'll try again. And to the waiter who was nice - sorry about your unconsiderate, twitchy, constantly nose-wiping manager. That must suck.
