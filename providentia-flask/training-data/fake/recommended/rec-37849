BACK AGAIN for the first time since opening night. The dude who sliced up my meat promised they'd gotten better at cooking brisket since the last time I was there. "Impossible" I said. Passing through NY for a business trip from Philly, I didn't have time but had to stop in anyway. These guys just nail it! And I hear they're openig another location on the highline. Perfect for the concept. Dan Delaney is on the rise. Mad appreciation.
