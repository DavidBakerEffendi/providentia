Woorijip is another of my favorite places in K-town.  Not only do they have a buffet (with a pretty good variety of options), but they also offer pre-made hot and cold food items that are very inexpensive.  When I'm in the neighborhood, I will usually stop by and pick up kimchi fried rice and japchae to bring home and eat throughout the week.  If I have to kill some time in midtown, I sometimes go there and do the buffet and just sit and eat there (ample seating).  They also have beverages and some dessert-type things.  Plus, it's open super late so you can get your late night Korean food fix!
