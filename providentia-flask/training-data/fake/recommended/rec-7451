Let me preface this by saying that this review is really more like a 4.5 My friend and I came here to catch after our original plans for eating at Ippudo were squashed by the almost 2 hour wait. I'm glad we ended up coming here though. Overall the food was really good and the atmosphere lively, but not too loud (for me at least). Over the course of our dinner we had the fried oysters (a special for the evening), market veggies (bok choy in oyster sauce), khao soi (a tiny bit too salty for my liking, but overall really good), and a side of rice. Everything was tasty. As there was a long wait time between the oysters and khao soi, they even bought out a place plate of curried cod, which also tasted great. I can't wait to come back and try the chickpeas, pickled cabbage, and fried fish (whole fish in a stew like broth). Positive note: They are very willing to adapt menu items per dietary restrictions. Although we ended up ordering the special instead, I indicated that I really wanted to try the mussels, but that I don't eat any red meat (the mussels are cooked with a pork sausage). They said that they had no problems cooking the dish without the sausage, should I want to have it the next time I come in. My only real 2 critiques would be the description of the size of the dishes and the minimal dessert options (I really love dessert). There is a huge disparity between what qualified as a snack, small dish, or large dish. Some small dishes seemed like snacks, while others were more like large dishes rather than small. Not a huge issue, but confusing when going there for the first time. As for the dessert options, there are only 2. One of which is halo-halo (awesome). Can't remember the other. While not bad, I think one more option would be perfect. Overall though, I came. I ate. I left happy. (and plan to return soon)
