Delicious, cheap and out-of-control portions! I've never been to Thailand (I'm working on that) so I have no idea how authentic Joya's food is, but what I do know is that it is very, very tasty and the quality-to-price-to-quantity ratio is excellent. Weekday evenings are pretty chill and it's easy to get a table--weekends can be a bit off the hook with the djs and the crowds and the noise, so be prepared for a scene.
