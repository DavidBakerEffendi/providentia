Reading through the reviews and it seems like the bad ones come from people expecting to find NY $1 pizza in this establishment called "Brazilian Pizza"... open your minds people. Brazilian pizza is pretty much a meal on a pizza and then you put ketchup and mayo on it and eat it with a fork and knife. Legit. I am Brazilian and this is 100% authentic. I came here with my boyfriend (Russian... loved it) and ordered "O rei da pizza"... ham, olives, catupiri cheese, heart of palm, and other delicious things. It was SOOOOOOO tasty. Not only that, but the service was great. The people who work there were drinking "chimarrao", an herba mate from Southern Brazil told me about it and about the neighborhood. Don't expect trendy. Expect authentic and family-oriented. Also don't be alarmed by the random people coming in trying to sell burned copies of DVD's... this just adds to the authenticity. Highly recommend it :)
