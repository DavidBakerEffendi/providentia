My husband and I had just gotten married the day before we went to Jimmy's diner. We checked out of our hotel (which had a nice continental breakfast, but we just got MARRIED, damn it, and we were going to have a REAL breakfast!), and walked over to Jimmy's. We were greeted the moment we walked in, as if this guy invited us to his house for breakfast (in other words, so warmly and friendly). We took a seat and got to looking at the menu. I was dying for some chicken and waffles, so that's what I ordered, and the meal was delicious. My husband got the huevos rancheros and they looked mighty tasty (he confirmed). The service remained excellent throughout. The waiter was chatty (with us and everyone else) and had the most endearing hiccup-y clown laugh (I don't know how else to describe it). From reading the other reviews, I'm wondering if we were so thrilled with Jimmy's because we had just gotten married (we eloped), but I really don't think that's it.
