3.5 stars... Best mojito in CT (Connecticut magazine agrees) Try the fresh guacamole...other places in town try to duplicate it but there's nowhere that even comes close. Â Im not a huge seafood fan...so i haven't worked my way around the menu...but i will say the service at the bar was OUTSTANDING!
