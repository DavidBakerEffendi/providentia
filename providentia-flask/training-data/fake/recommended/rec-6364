We strolled in on a Sunday about 4 pm so it wasn't crowded at all and there were plenty of tables. Service was fair but not great, they messed up our order of tapas, never brought one and then charged us for it. Then brought us one we didn't order and the wait person was almost arguing with us that we had. We straightened it out but both women serving were spacey and kind of attitudinal. Food was nice but not fabulous, really nothing special just decently prepared tapas. We had the potatoes bravas which were delish but really what could be bad about roasted hot potatoes drizzled with mayonnaise which is essentially what they are. We also had the chorizo and deviled eggs. The chorizo was once again good but not in any way special, just sliced sausage sauteed in quite a lot of oil. The deviled eggs were ok, too cold and overly smokey. I would not return with all the great tapas places in the city to chose from and felt it was very run of the mill.
