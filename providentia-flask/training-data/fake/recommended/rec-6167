Since moving here a year ago from NJ, I had yet to find an Italian sandwich shop that I liked (the clowns on Wooster Street have no idea what they are doing...and they have an attitude to boot). Stopped by Vito's today and had a delicious sub. Ingredients were of the highest quality, and the sub was huge. Love the lady who runs the register, she's fantastic.
