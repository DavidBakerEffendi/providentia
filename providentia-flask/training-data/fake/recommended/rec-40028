Service: attentive, friendly, helpful Atmosphere: cool, relaxed Drinks: nice menu of beer and other things drinkable.  Tried 3 different beers and enjoyed them all. The snacks: wings were good and not overdone as is often the case with wings. Crab cake sandwich was tasty and filling with a good crust and a decently thick filling, bread roll was fresh.  Sandwich and wing veggies (onion, lettuce, tomato, celery, carrot) all freshly cut, I.e. none of that stuff cut up earlier and sitting around which is something a lot of places do.  Food Presentation, for what it was, was also ok (I.e. food was not just thrown on the plate). All in all: a cool meeting place with a good vibe and friendly people working there. I went for dinner/snacks/a couple of drinks and most people seemed not to be eating and just having drinks. It was loud too which doesn't bother me one bit but could inhibit conversation. I'm a tourist and this was pretty much exactly what I wanted for a casual dinner/drinks.
