I discovered this great Lebanese restaurant last year when a friend of mine was visiting New York. It was a great find. I'm now going on a regular basis with my best friend. The bar section is very cozy and welcoming. The happy hour is a great deal and the bar food super tasty. We wind up staying at the bar and the staff is very professional and friendly. I love good food and I am always on the lookout for a good, yet affordable, restaurant. Illili is definitely one of them. I strongly recommend it.
