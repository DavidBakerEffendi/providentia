Loved my anniversary dinner in the garden at Uva! Nice atmosphere and space..got a little crowded towards the end of our meal. Only complaint was that we were seated between 2 other tables and asked if we could move to the corner table (more space/intimate), but were told that there was a large party coming in so that corner was reserved. Couple of minutes later a party of 2 was seated there...annoying but didn't ruin the meal. We started with the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella & the meatballs...both delicious! BF got the braised short ribs with potato cake which was really good! Tender and flavorful. I order the ricotta gnocchi with black truffle and chive cream sauce - AMAZING! I could've gotten and devoured another bowl it was so good. Had a nice bottle of white wine as well..can't remember the name. Will definitely come back to try other items. The crostinis and meat/cheese plates looked awesome.
