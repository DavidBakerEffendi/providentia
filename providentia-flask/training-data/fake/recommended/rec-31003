their mahi mahi tacos are so good.  i want them now.  the sea bass tacos are really good too with just a little bit of sweet potato puree on them.  love the queso fundido with mushrooms and truffles.  cheesey deliciousness.  guac rocks too. we drank a pitcher of sangria and didn't catch a buzz. get the jamaica margaritas.  yum.
