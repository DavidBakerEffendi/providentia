It's Friday, and for many couples, a date night. Alexander & I are hungry and cold from walking around Chelsea's art galleries, so we decide to check with our trusty iPhone Zagat app to guide us to a tasty & cheap restaurant. (I LOVE the customer reviews/quotes that randomly pop up during search: "Prices looked like telephone numbers" & "His food tasted better on TV". Lol!!!) Behold - Tia Pol, a  Spanish import on 8 Ave, btw 22 & 23  St. Knowing Alexander, he will sway towards anything Spanish, especially if it's close to the Basque Country, so our fate was sealed. We trot happily to the restaurant, and upon arrival got a lovely table...by the bathrooms. Yikes! We promptly switch to bar seating and order a few classic Spanish tapas: sweetbreads, tongue, tripe, chorizo, and some other vegetable dishes no one usually remembers after tasting the meat. Oh my, the last time I had all this awesomeness together in one sitting was in Uruguay, on a vacation to Punta Del Este (paradise!) Tia Pol was a gem to come across - the service was nice & friendly, the food was satisfying, and the wine was flowing! I don't care if my ulcer didn't like the hot chorizo, I liked it plenty. (I don't know for sure that I even have an ulcer, but I guess I do from all the wedding planning stress!)
