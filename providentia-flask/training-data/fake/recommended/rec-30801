ive tried this place twice now. there is no host, or waiter. expect to wait awhile in the foyer. i love the whole idea of a completely organic restaurant, so i just had to try it as soon as it opened. had the pumpkin pancakes, portion size was ridiculously small but it tasted to good! it was literally two silver dollar sized pancakes, and two chicken nugget sized pieces of turkey sausage and a few blue berries. husband had turkey burger, was small and bland. the wait was atleast 30 mins. went back recently to try it again, and i decided on a vegan oriental stew dish. it was just tofu, veggies, maybe some braggs aminos instead of soy sauce. portion was a little better this time but wasnt anything special. my son had the apple sauce quinoa cakes, now those were AMAZING! its beautiful inside but i think they mostly do take out.
