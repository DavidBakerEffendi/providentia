My family is in from Florida - and they were craving burgers and fries.  I immediately thought to bring them here.  It was around 3:20 p.m. on Saturday afternoon.  Their doors indicate they open at 11:30 a.m. on Saturdays - but both doors were locked!  The waitress inside signaled to us that they opened at 4:00 p.m.  We weren't feeling like sticking around Hartford for another 40 minutes so we left.   I'll never understand why they don't open the doors for potential customers.  A table of 4? I'd never turn that away.  BOO!
