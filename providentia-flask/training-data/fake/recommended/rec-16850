We heard of this place through a friend and decided to check it out.. We are huge fans of indo chinese food, but having not found decent indo chinese around wer we stay.. We did not expect much. We ordered fried baby corn and paneer chilly as appetizers.. It was pleasantly delicious.. Also the thai basil fried rice we ordered, which was recommended by the manager was v tasty as well!if you like the way indian and Chinese cuisines blend together.. You can pay a visit for sure!
