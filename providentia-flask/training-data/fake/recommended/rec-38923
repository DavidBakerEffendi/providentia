The long wait is not worth it. Hop on the bus or get in your car and head over to Winooski to Pho Pasteur. The food is pretty good, probably about 4 stars. Portions are fine. They don't have as much selection as I'd like, though. OK, actually, I just want Bun Bo Hue, and it's not on their menu. But the things they do have are good. The service, though, is terrible. I don't think this is the fault of any particular server, just a perfect storm of the place being over-hyped and under-staffed. I had one particularly bad experience when 2 people who arrived after my party of 2 were seated before us, and then ordered before us... only to order the last 2 spring rolls, which we had (of course) wanted. We then had to sit next to them and watch them eat them (at a distance of about 10 inches because it's so crowded in there).
