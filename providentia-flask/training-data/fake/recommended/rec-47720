After years of suggesting 116 Crown to others this evening was my time to try it.  I sat at the cool bar and Sean/Shawn made suggestions and made my tequila mixed drink (Jack Rudy).  He's a nice guy and the drink was complex and enjoyable.  The bar was fairly busy and noisy when I arrived but was a bit more relaxed before I left.  My biggest issue was that I generally felt ignored/invisible to any other staff.  Even sitting right at the bar and just 2 feet away from Team 116 no one ever made eye contact or said hello.  No one asked if I wanted to order food; no one offered to refill my water or get me another drink.  I will return soon but it did not really live up to my expectations on my first visit.
