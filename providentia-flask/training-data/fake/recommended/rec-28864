Went here in the summer so they had a lot of outdoor seating, which fits perfectly in with the other spots at The Piazza (which is awesome in itself). The inside has a fun, 50's-esqu atmosphere with plenty of light and good music. The waiters and bartenders were super nice and very attentive (and very fast with getting us our drinks, which was a main concern). A few of my friends ordered food and they said it was delicious! Definitely going back!! I did notice a long line outside to get seating and they don't take reservations, so I would suggest getting there a bit earlier than you had planned.
