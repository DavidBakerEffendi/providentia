The gold standard for Thai food in the Bloomfield area. Have been going there since before they expanded the current location.  The food is great, the service is good and the appearance of the place is about average for a Thai restaurant. Only real complaint is that the vegetarian soup uses a very light  chicken consomme.  Therefore, if your allergic to chicken beware.  Otherwise, I would have given them 5 stars.
