Love it.  The crepes are authentic and absolutely delicious.  Normande and Sultan are out of this world delicious.  Atmosphere is pure southern France with delightful tables inside built around comfy cushions while outside dining also nice.  Staff (and likely owners) are charming.  Pates is in the name and quite good as well as are the cheeses.  And dessert crepes and more a winner for the little ones.  Service can be a bit slow but relax for once.
