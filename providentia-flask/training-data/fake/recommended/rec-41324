I came here by myself last week, on a cold, rainy night. The waiting area was predictably slam-packed with people, so I approached the host's table with trepidation. Me: "May I put my name on the list for one?" Host: "You may, but we actually have a seat available right now." Me: **speechless** Actually, I wasn't speechless. I think I started singing, or maybe that was the ramen gods alighting my ears with a song of victory and power? I threw up a peace sign to the weary masses, as I strutted from the waiting area to the dining room. If ever there was a time for swagger, this was it! Things got even better in the dining room, as I was seated at a table where I could see the kitchen (I love watching cooks at work). I highly recommend the Akamaru Modern ramen, which comes topped with miso paste, though next time I'll go for something more spicy. Hype aside, this a solid, albeit wildly overpriced Ramen joint. Get some in your belly today.
