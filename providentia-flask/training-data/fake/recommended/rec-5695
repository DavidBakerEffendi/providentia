I almost went to an LA Umami Burger a few months back, but was foiled by an upset stomach, so I was especially excited to learn that they were opening up an NYC outpost. We came in on a Friday evening around 5 PM for an early bite, in hopes of avoiding the long wait for a table. Mission successful! We were seated immediately, and had our food and drinks within five minutes of ordering (FYI, the cocktails are surprisingly yummy considering they're certainly not the star of the show here).   We shared: House pickle plate, truffle fries, an original burger and a truffle burger. Everything was really, really good -- the truffle cheese on the fries and truffle burger is AMAZING. The house pickle plate had a lot of spice and offered a nice alternative to an ordinary salad. Umami's fries are quite thin, which is my favorite kind of fry, and come with a selection of flavorful house-made dipping sauces. I preferred the truffle burger to the original, but both were pretty damn great. The staff keeps it moving, collecting plates as soon as they're emptied of food, without  making you feel rushed. Good thing, as the line for a table was out the door by the time we headed out, around 5:45. Prices are a little high for what you're getting, but given the hype, not surprising.
