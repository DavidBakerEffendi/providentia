A 5-star cafe not necessarily for anything awesome in itself, but moreso for the oasis feel the place gives. I was the only customer on a day when nearby Starbucks and Stumptown were overflowing. Really friendly cashier, casual atmosphere, and great (clean!) counterspace with power for some work. And free, speedy wifi! Great place to work while other cafes are cracking down on laptop usage. My latte was good, but not great. Music could use some work, but that's about it. I'm surprised to one of only a few reviews ... go check out this place!
