Briciola, or as we like to call it "The Crumb" is one of those small little havens in Manhattan that is so amazing that you only tell the people you love about, and because I love all of YOU! I'm sharing my secret with you ;) This Italian wine bar is second to none, it's small and intimate and the bartenders really know how to step up your experience from "Yay! I'm a Fan" to "Woohoo! As good as it gets!" They really make sure you get what you are looking for in both the wine and the food.   I've tried several different types of reds there and have never been disappointed. As you sit down enjoying your wine, the atmosphere, the company and the service; you will begin to smell the magical aroma of Italy simmering in the background and that my friends is the kicker.  Their Italian style menu will leave you wishing you fasted an entire week in preparation for your meal at Briciola.  We enjoyed the house made sausages, the eggplant and one of their homemade pastas.  Everything was perfectly prepared and presented with amazing detail.   Briciola is the reason I'm not buying $1,500.00 tickets to Italy every other week.
