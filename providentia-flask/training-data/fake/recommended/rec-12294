I am so glad my hubby found this place! When we asked the waiter what we should order he suggested the blueberry pancakes, salmon eggs Benedict and a side of sugar bacon. So, that is exactly what we ordered. We did start with the spiked peppermint hot chocolate and the hot buttered cider. Both were great! I am not usually a pancake orderer but the blueberry pancakes were AMAZING!! The syrup was pure perfection and the cakes were fluffy goodness. The biscuit that came with the Benedict was also delicious!
