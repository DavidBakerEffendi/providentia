i'm a lazy peruvian, so ever since i moved to north jersey, i didn't make much of an effort to seek out peruvian eateries.  however, after taking my husband on his first trip to peru, where he became a convert to the cuisine, i've been on a quest, and this is the first place i found in the area serving up authentic peruvian food (we'd been to costanera, which i feel waters down the flavors significantly).  i actually had one of the mexican dishes (mushroom quesadilla -- which was pretty good) as my entree, but we shared a few things, and the husband had lomo saltado -- everything was excellent!  chatted with the owner, who was awesome and friendly, and he gave me all kinds of sauces to try on my food when i told him about my love for spicy anything, and especially for huacatay (ask him for some with your meal -- it's a black mint with aji, and delicious!).  we haven't been back yet because we are still exploring other places for the first time, but it is on our to-return list.
