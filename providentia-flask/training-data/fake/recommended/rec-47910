A few years back before these Halal Guys became all the rage, they were producing quality stuff. Â As their popularity soared, the quality went downhill. The chicken is dry. The lamb is good, but I wouldn't say tasty. The white sauce really ties everything in together. I've tried other spots around the city, and they've definitely been a lot more delicious than the 53rd & 6th Carts. On the upside, their prices haven't changed in the last 3 years ($6/platter)!
