I went here with my sweetheart on a miserable rainy day.  He was discouraged by the trek (massive puddles, caffeine deprivation) and we ended up eating elsewhere.  We then went to Clinton St. for dessert and coffee.  The berry scone was pretty good, very large and offered with homemade jam.  The coffee was good, too.  Our waitress was attentive. The place is extremely small and there is basically no privacy.  Some of the groups tend to linger making the tables harder to get.  I can picture the place during busy periods and can't imagine waiting for this experience....best to go off-peak and take your chances.  If you take a date here, have a back up plan in case of a long queue.
