Went to the bar last night with a friend and had some great snacks and awesome cocktails. We started with the fromage blanc & kumquats on toast - creamy and delicious. Then the diver scallops came out with some orange and a jalepeno puree - such great and fresh flavors, and I'm not usually a raw scallops person. Then came the warm ricotta with swiss chard and pine nuts - too, too good. Such a good plate for the cold weather. As for dessert, we had the roasted date cake and the chocolate dessert which were both too heavenly. The cocktails were equally great and I loved how the bartender made sure to pair each according to which course we were having next. Great night and can't wait to make it a weekly spot.
