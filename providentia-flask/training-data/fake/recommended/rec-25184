Can't say much that isnt said in the over 2000+ reviews but if you're visiting or a reg def have to try this place. For cheap eats its right up there with a plate of rice and your choice of gyro or chicken for about 6 bucks. The line starts early but they have two back up carts on that block to service everyone pretty quickly. I got the mix plate of chicken and gyro to try both out. Both were great. Moist and flavorful. Definitely listen to the other post and get the white sauce. There are no drinks at the cart but you can easily buy them at the other carts near there. Theres not a lot of seating around the carts maybe 1 or 2 islands so if you're with someone have them scout out seats while you buy, unless you're taking it to-go
