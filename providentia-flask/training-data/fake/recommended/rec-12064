Being from a neighborhood where this style of food is readily available for me is perhaps biasing my review but I'd say the food was average and not very flavorful. Our whole party thought everything was mediocre and lacking spice. Much of the food was distinctly Indian and not particularly Nepalese. The momo were more like Chinese dumplings. Avoid the mango lassi. I didn't think a mango lassi could be bad but it was painfully obvious that they are adding water to it to water it down. It was thin and watery and was the worst lassi I've ever had. I have no idea why seven days thinks this place is so great... Maybe they don't get out of Vermont very often? Anyway, food was average to sub par and the prices were high compared to the quality of the food.
