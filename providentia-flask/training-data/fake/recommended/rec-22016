Ate dinner here last night....very impressed.  Got immediate seating on back patio and the waitress, Jenny, was awesome!  I wanted something light, she recommended their Caesar Salad with Cajun Grilled salmon.  It was great and hit the spot!  I will definitely come back if I'm ever in the Burlington area again.
