The menu is well rounded and perfectly situated in the heart of Church Street. As far as the service, our drink order took far too long to reach our table, and one of the drinks served had sour milk!!! But overall, our server was very attentive and friendly throughout. My veggie burger was heavy on the black bean ingredient, so it was a bit potent. If they added a beet mixture to the patty, it would of been a more flavorful recipe. My sister in law ordered the Mac-n-cheese and was a bit unsure of the cheese flavoring vs the actual noodles. A little heavy on the cream. The other entrees were a hit at the table such as the burgers and the fresh turkey on the sandwiches. A good option for brunch or lunch, especially if you can get a table outside in the sunshine!
