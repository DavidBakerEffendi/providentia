Came here for New Year's Eve with a party of 3. Called ahead to see about reservations but they said to just come in. They were right. Very kind people all around. The wait was 30 to 40 minutes and they let us run to the bar around the corner and called us when it was ready. They were a bit abrupt on the phone but hey it's new years eve and you have to expect a little frustration. The food was awesome! The beef jerkey was one of the best things I have ever eaten. You need to get it. I'm a Polish girl, we are meat conissuers and this was some of the best. The ambiance was pretty good. Cute, little place. The tables were kind of rickity but who really cares. This place really made our new years great and we will definetly be back soon.
