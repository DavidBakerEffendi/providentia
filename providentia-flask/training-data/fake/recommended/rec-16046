Great spot for people-watching.  Spacious outdoor seating, street-side. Wasn't feeling too hungry so I ordered one of their daily specials - baby red and golden beat salad with goat cheese, pears and sesame dressing, $11.  Fairly decent sized salad, I feared it would be too small but they didn't skimp on the beats or goat cheese.  Also concerned there would be too many flavor profiles going on with the sweetness of the beats and the sharpness of the cheese, but it was all perfectly balanced and just the right amount for a light dinner.  Wait staff was friendly, but nothing unusual.   Will definitely come back to try other things on the menu, but probably more of a stop-over place than a destination in itself.
