Disclaimer: We are mostly vegetarians. So we decided to eat some meat while in Philly. You can't go to Philly and not have a cheesesteak at one of the famous local joints can you? We checked out both Geno's and Pat's to compare :) We got a cheesesteak with onions and wiz and fries from both places. The flavor of the meat and the bread was better at Pat's, and possibly the fries. But to the overall package was a bit better at Geno's. Very little seating.
