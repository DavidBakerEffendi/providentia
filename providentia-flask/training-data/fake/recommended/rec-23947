I went to this establishment a few months ago with my friend, as he has been a few times and enjoyed it. Besides, any place with a "Shame Burger" seems right up my hardened arterial alley. Admittedly, the food was quite tasty. I got an order of calamari as an appetizer and a shame burger as my entree. Here is where things get nasty. I take a bite into my calamari, chew, and swallow. When I swallow, I feel something sharp in my throat. Not sure what it was that I just swallowed, I excused myself to the mens room, where I proceeded to make myself sick to bring up the offending material. I got to fish out a small barb of metal, about 1/4" long and thin as a wire. Upset, I asked to see a manager and told them what I found. The manager took the piece of metal to the back, came back and said "Oh yeah, that's a part of a brillo pad. Sorry about that." and said he would take care of us on the check. Well, that meant just giving us the appetizer for free, which it was happy hour so it was already half off. Now, mistakes happen, and the food was tasty otherwise. Here is where my REAL issues with this place take off. There were a handful of other people in the building, maybe 5 tops. The waitstaff could not be pulled away from watching Jeopardy to refill our drinks, or see if we wanted more. I had to, quite literally, wave at our server, say excuse me 3 or 4 times, and eventually walk to the bar and request another drink. Not saying I deserve extra special treatment, but when someone ends up coughing up blood because of something YOU served them, it might be in your best interest to bring them a drink. TL;DR Version: Good food, but if you get a shard of metal in it, don't be surprised and don't expect anyone to give a crap about it, especially if Jeopardy is on. The answer: Places I'm never going to go to again. The question? What is The Wishing Well
