This is an exquisite and wonderfully run little Italian restaurant of consummate professionalism and serving grace.   We met here for lunch and were greeted by kind men who helped my disabled father down the few steps into the restaurant. The space is narrow, but bright. The design is modern, clean, with a row of wines housed in glass cabinets. We were served a basket of excellent crusty bread, a dish of olives, and bruschetta (tomatoes on toasted bread).  We looked over the menu, and were delighted with the $16.95 Prix Fixe lunch menu that included two courses, plus coffee or tea. I ordered carrot soup and a delicious ravioli with wild mushrooms in a cream sauce. For dessert, I had three flavored gelati in a glass goblet. Other dishes at our table included expertly prepared grilled salmon, potato gnocchi in tomato sauce, and grilled scallops on a bed of mixed greens. The dessert menu could have come from Rome with a selection of Italian liqueurs, dessert wines and coffees.   At the end of the meal, the managers and servers shook our hands and thanked us for dining there. I found their gratitude real, and there efforts heartfelt and highly skilled. This is a place I would return to again and again.
