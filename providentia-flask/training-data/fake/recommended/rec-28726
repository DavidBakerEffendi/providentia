This is a much-needed lively causal gastropub in Murray Hill - a tad more mature than other joints in the hood. The best item was the tuna tartare starter marinated in an oil/vinegar with loads of fresh whole cranberries. The veggie burger with side salad and cheese burger were also really good. And we had $6 glasses of wine during happy hour, which ends at 8pm.
