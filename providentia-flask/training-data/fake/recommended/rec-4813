We ordered a paltry sneeze of greens and tentacles scattered across a plate and called an appetizer.  We allotted the tiny ration of squid amongst ourselves like cooperative prisoners of war ("The youngest eats first; she has so much life left to live!").  Entrées were Italian and typical.  One of us ordered a Caesar salad for dinner and this invoked an undisguised sneer of disdain from our waiter.  He's lucky tip was included in the total.
