Ivy noodle's Chinese cuisine is a great substitute for American fast food. The dishes arrive to your table just as fast but are far more tasty. The service leaves something to be desired, but customers shouldn't take the curt demeanor of the staff personally. They're working pretty hard to keep up with an insane volume of orders.
