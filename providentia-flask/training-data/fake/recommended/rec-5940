no offense to the vegetarians out there, but complaining about the lack of veg. options here is like going to harmony restaurant and complaining about the lack of meat! i do not recommend going here unless you love meat as servers carrying large slabs of it on sticks will be hovering around your face the entire evening. (this just so happens to be a PLUS for me...) now, on to the review. i have been here twice. once on a date and another time with a group. both were a really good time! the "salad bar" is like nothing i've ever seen. it is so much more than salad! it's very tempting to eat up all the yumminess here, but be warned: you need to save room. LOTS of room. you are given a coaster, one side is red, one side is green. green means "bring on the meat" and this alerts the servers to come up to your table with endless arrays of delicious meats from filet to porkchops to sausage... it's ridiculous (in a very good way) red means stop (go figure) and the servers will leave you alone to enjoy what you have on your plate. you can flip back to green at any time if you dare to eat more. like i said, if you love meat, this is a great time. but do not make plans for after dinner because you will soon be overcome by a powerful food coma!
