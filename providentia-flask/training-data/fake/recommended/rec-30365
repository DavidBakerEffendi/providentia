This was the second time I went there and the food was delicious as the first time. Our waitress was the bar tender when I took my daughter there the first time. We didn't have a table and ate at the bar. She was very fabulous! Friendly, very knowledgeable of her wines and menus. Great service! BTW I had quail as appetizer both time and was very delis!
