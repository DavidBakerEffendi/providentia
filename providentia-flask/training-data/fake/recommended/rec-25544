We went to brunch here and they tried to charge us $2.50 extra for each glass of orange juice.  The service was terrible, and the owner was rude.  They accidentally overcharged us by adding additional people to our bill and I would not recommend this place to anyone.  They are very unprofessional and the food is way over priced.
