Banging crepes in the neighborhood? I could get used to this. Plus they also offer savory crepes! Even better. Now it's not like it's a knock-out of a place but for being a resident of Woodside for the past four years and noticing the types of restaurants that have been opening up Suki Shabu, Katmandu Spice, Fresca.. I can totally tell that this neighborhood is Â on the up and up. It's very exciting-plus I can enjoy a beautifully made banana and nutella crepe while I'm at it? You just can't beat that!
