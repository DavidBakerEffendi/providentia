Monday Happy Hour, yeah, this is the place. I've been having a taste for oysters and having never been here, I decided to give it a try at their 6 for $6 happy hour.  What a Win all around. I sat at the bar and the bartender with the handlebar mustache was charming as much as he was efficient. While I waited for my oysters, I tried the hummus and it was fabulous, served with a house made salty flat bread. I had to make my self stop eating it. A dozen (east coast) paired with a glass of prosecco was all that I needed before the commute home.   I'll be back again real soon. You can't beat that deal!
