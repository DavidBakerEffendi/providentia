Best Mediterranean I have had in a long time. We sat at the bar to have our dinner and the bartender got our drinks and food to us fairly quickly for a packed Saturday night! Atmosphere is nice and relaxed, and food was flavorful and relatively affordable for Williamsburg. I would recommend this restaurant to any vegan or vegetarian because they had so many animal free dishes! Can't wait to go back!!
