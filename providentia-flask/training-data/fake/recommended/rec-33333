Shanghai Asian Manor is a great place to go if you want to demolish some soup dumplings without demolishing your wallet. Will power is key if you don't want to completely burn your mouth, as I definitely suggest waiting a few minutes after the xiao long bao come out of the steamer as to not burn your little tastebuds (easier said than done, those things are delicious!). Other fare is really good too; the spring rolls are crispy on the outside and the filling on the inside isn't dried out, which I find to be a common problem with spring rolls. One quip I had is broth in my rice cake soup wasn't very flaforful--I knew I should have gotten the stir-fried version but was trying to be "healthier" after downing eight soup dumplings. The service is attentive here. Waitstaff is constantly refilling your water and checking in. The waitress even made sure my boyfriend knew that his beef noodle soup came with tendon (which he loves, so no problem there). The decor is typical Chinatown, which means not that spectacular. But, that's kind of the norm in this part of town, so I can't really gripe too much about it. And seriously, wait a minute before you get into those soup dumplings! My mouth was super burnt all weekend!
