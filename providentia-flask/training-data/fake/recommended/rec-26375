This place is a gem and I wish the owners would adopt me. If we lived in Montclair, we'd go at least once a month. I love Ethiopian food, and Mesob is one of the best. Our go-to favorites are any of the vegetarian dishes (veggie sampler is a great way to go!), the ingudai tibs (portabella mushroom), and the shrimp tibs. So good. They also serve a special brunch every last Saturday of the month. That's also great and worth a try at least once. I still prefer their regular entree dishes just because they can't be beat. It sounds like people have had so-so experiences with the servers, but personally I'm a fan. They're very patient, helpful, and are always smiling. I also love the warm atmosphere of the restaurant, the wood detailing, the Ethiopian decor, and the delicious smell of spices that greets you whenever you first walk in. Love this place.
