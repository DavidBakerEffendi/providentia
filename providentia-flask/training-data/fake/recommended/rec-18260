I had passed this restaurant numerous times and finally decided to try it when my family visited a few weeks ago. We arrived at the very end of their lunch window, but they welcomed us into the restaurant. The food was delicious. My Mom and I ordered Â Sauerbraten (with spaetzle and red cabbage) and my sister ordered chicken on a bed of greens. We also ordered a delicious potato appetizer. We couldn't have been happier with the food, ambiance and service. So glad to find this place, and I can't wait to go again.
