What a great find this place is.  Our friends made early reservations for us, as we were attending a concert later.  A high chair for their baby was already in place when we arrived.  We ordered an extensive selection of tapas and larger portions, as well as a pitcher and a half of their terrific pomegranate champagne sangria.  The food came out in waves, so we would be finishing 1-2 items by the time the next round arrived.  Basically everything we ordered was a winner - meatballs, jamon, the usual tapas etc. -- all nicely done. The baby even ate some octopus!  The service was so attentive and thoughtful.  And we could not believe how tiny the bill was, considering everything we ordered - an incredible value for the money.  We left just as the Flamenco was being set up, so that entails a return trip.  All in all, a must the next time we are in the neighborhood.
