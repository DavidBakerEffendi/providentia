Had the Super Cub Classic along with a vietnamese ice coffee.  I've had a lot of vietnamese sandwiches.  Xe May Super Cub to me is a more refined sandwich.  You can taste the quality in the ingredients.  It's a great sandwich, I could've had 2 of them.  Too bad I have to watch my weight.  I hope the quality remain the same for a long long time and I look forward to going  back again.
