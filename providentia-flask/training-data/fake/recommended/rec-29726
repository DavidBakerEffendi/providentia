I went here recently, February 2009, with my father and girlfriend and we all concluded that this was a very bad choice.  We ordered an appetizer of grilled portabello mushrooms, but when it came, it was over fried, soaking with oil and was black because it was so burned.  The bread they served was decent quality but since they keep it in the refridgerator and heat it up when you ask for it, ours came to the table still cold on the inside... real classy!  I ordered the Salmon for dinner, which was mediocre.  The sauce tasted canned and it was served with this fried mozeralla stick which tasted like it was frozen and heated up.  My father ordered the veal, which wasn't fantastic either.   I also agree with the person who said the wait was long.  We had to wait 45 minutes after our appetizer was taken away to receive the main course.  When we asked why it was taking so long, the waiter said "it is our policy to serve the main course after the appetizer all together"  I replied "Well your policy may be the reason no one is here except us... and I don't think we will be coming back.
