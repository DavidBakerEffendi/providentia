I have been to this P.F. Chang's several times. I took a friend, (who has never been there or to any P.F. Chang's), to lunch today and boy, do I regret it!!!! The food was extremely salty. I had the Pad Thai Noodle with shrimp which I have had twice in the past 3 months because I really liked it before. The manager informed me that they changed the recipe. It was so salty. As I can see from reading other reviews, that is not the only salty dish. The banana's foster with ice cream was also disappointing. It arrived mostly melted and the banana's were soggy and mushy as if microwaved. Looked as if they tried to put in the freezer because our forks, yes forks, were ice cold. The waitress (we started out with a waiter) who took over our table for dessert never told us that she was taking over for our previous waiter. He just disappeared. We asked for spoons and she said they don't serve spoons anymore with dessert. What?? So here we are trying to eat this melted ice cream with a huge dinner fork. I knew I should have requested Danielle. She was our waitress the past couple of times and we had no problems at all. She is friendly and outgoing. Service aside, the food was so lousy and salty. EVERYTHING SALTY!!! Never again!!!! I left totally embarassed by my choice to eat here!
