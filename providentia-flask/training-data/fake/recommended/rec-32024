IMPORTANT PRO TIP: The week-day lunch special is a good deal, and ends at 4pm when happy hour begins. So come at 3:45 and order, then when your food comes start ordering drinks. If you're still hungry you can get $2.00 happy hour tacos. Breakfast is GREAT and comes with these pastries but it's BUSY. For dinner: Order Elotes Callajeros (corn w. chipolte mayo and conjita cheese) appetizer, and Pescado a la Veracruzana. You will be eat the best corn you've ever had (that doesn't come from an food truck in Redhook). Then you'll eat a main course of the most delicious fish you've ever had, wrapped in a banana leaf, smothered in a rice and vegetable medley where every single ingredient melts into the other in a savory caramelized dream sauce, and you can't figure out what is in your mouth, but you can't stop putting it in your mouth. It is almost... creamy. Eating that food is like eating food after smoking pot but you're not actually high. How do they do that.
