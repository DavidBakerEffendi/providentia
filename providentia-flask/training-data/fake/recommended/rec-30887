I work in Rock Plaza and it's been our tradition to go to the Halal Guys once a week for a mixed platter. I'm not gonna tell you how freaking awesome and cheap this place is because chances are you already know it. Instead, I will tell you one fact to keep in mind: during the day, the halal guys actually have 2 carts: one on the 53rd and east side of the 6th and another one on 52nd and west side 6th. Be careful not to buy from the guys on 53rd and 6th (west side). They are not that bad, but I can't stand the fact that they are so shady that they even copied the colors and imitated the logo of the real Halal Guys. And they are a dollar more:) Stay alert and buy from the REAL HALAL GUYS! lol
