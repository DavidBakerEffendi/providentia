Came here on the eve of July 4th. It was raining cats and dogs so I did not bother to make a reservation. Bad idea. The wait was about 30 minutes, so note to self...make a reservation. It is a very dark and small restaurant. The tables are closely positioned next to each other, so you will probably hear your neighbors conversation. I had a difficult time trying to decide what to get on the antipasti menu because everything sounded good, but nothing sounded orgasmic. Our waiter, who happened to be the owner was extremely helpful and recommended Fior de Latte Mozzarella, because our main course were seafood dishes. It was nothing mind blowing. The dish was simple and consisted of fresh mozzarella with roasted butternut squash and mushrooms. It contained some of my favorite ingredients on a plate, but did not leave me wanting more. Black spaghetti with crab - It sounds a lot fancier on the menu but my poor memory cannot recall and the online menu isn't up to date. For some reason I was hoping for some squid ink pasta when I ordered this, but it wasn't and I wasn't disappointed. It was very good, wish it was cooked a little bit more al dente. The flavors were rich and you will not be disappointed by the generous servings of crab meat Dessert - I had the olive oil sponge cake. Very interesting flavor. I recommend it, not because it is amazing, but because it is very interesting. Their montepulciano wine was delicious. I wish I wasn't driving so that I could order a bottle. Andres, the owner provided impeccable service. He took his time to answer my questions, recommended dishes and explain to me what they were in detail. We also had a very nice conversation about his background and how he came to open up his restaurants. I cannot wait to try his sister restaurant, where he promises me that the pasta will be cooked al dente.
