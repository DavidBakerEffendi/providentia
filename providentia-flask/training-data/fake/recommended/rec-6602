This place is really awesome! The wait was an hour and a half on a Wednesday night but I think it was well worth it. It also helps the time go by faster when you are grabbing drinks next door with a group of friends. The ambiance is really fun and you get to check off what you want from the menu with a marker - after waiting so long I was kind of starving and ordered one portion of meatballs and split a 2nd with a friend - this turned out to be way too much food. The balls are a good size and pretty delicious. I went for the ice cream sandwich afterwards bc it looked so damn good but was a bit disappointed. The cookie was great but the ice cream was nothing impressive. in fact, I kind of wish I passed on the dessert - wasn't worth the calories but now I know.
