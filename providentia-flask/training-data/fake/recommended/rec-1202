Every time someone finds out I am from Philadelphia... I get the question. "Pat's or Geno's" My canned answer is neither. See my review for Pagano's. and I go on and on about Pagano's being better and such. I had the pleasure of taking an impromptu trip to Philadelphia from Baltimore at 2 in the morning and unfortunately Pat's and Geno's were the only places that were open at 3:30 when we arrived. I can honestly say that due to the fact that I grew up on the other side of the city it wasn't until I was an adult that I ever ate at Pats' or Geno's. But I digress, I decided to be fair and I got a steak from both Pat's and Geno's and I will attest that I liked the steak from Geno's better. But, that is my opinion. Is this the best in the City though? NOT AT ALL by far. Do yourself a favor and look up Pagano's get yourself a real cheesesteak. Bottom Line: I will not eat here unless I am in a similar situation and my friends and I decide to take a road trip again at 2 in the morning.
