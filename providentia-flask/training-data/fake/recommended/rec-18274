Tell me this doesn't tickle your pickle: eating pancakes while getting absurdly drunk. C'mon that's awesome. And should you want to do that, you can come to Galaxy Diner. Now check this out: Most diners serve waffles. And most diners serve fried chicken. But most diners don't offer waffles with fried chicken, made famous by Harlem and other areas of the country. Galaxy Diner does. And it was awesome. With syrup and hot sauce in hand, I just celebrated my birthday eating chicken and waffles. All thanks to Galaxy. So if you want to either get drunk and eat breakfast foods and/or have waffles and fried chicken, I can assume that if you live in the area, Galaxy is where you'll go.
