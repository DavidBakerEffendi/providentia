This is one of my favorite pizza places in the city. The pizza has light flavors, the sauce is tangy and the toppings are generous. Get the thick, pepperoni pizza; it's great. Why not 5 stars? Because a great pizza has not only light flavors, but it's supposed to blow your mind with them. This one didn't for me, but it's good pizza. I'll keep returning for more. I found the staff friendly enough. They speak Spanish (apart from English) and are willing to chat with you and help you. The owner speaks Spanish too if you'd like to test your skills. They remember the regulars so if you visit often enough, they'll remember you.
