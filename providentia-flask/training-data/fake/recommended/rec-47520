My birthday was in November and I did not have a chance to meet with one of my favorite aunts so she sent me a list of places to pick from to have a post b-day dinner. I chose this place  for the convenience to my job and because i have not had crepes in over a year or more and wanted some really good ones. Boy was I impressed! I actually enter on Stone street through the Smorgas Cafe which is connected  to the restaurant and serves the same plates.   My aunt and I both chose the Herb Chicken and Ratatouille Crepe. The joy I felt when i cut into it and took a bite was like no other.  Seriously! The amount of Ricotta cheese was on point,  the onions and tomatoes were perfect and the chicken was delightful.  When they say savory they mean it. No conversation was present the entire meal.   We were undecided about dessert at first but when we looked over the menu again we knew it had to be done. One Nutella and Banana Crepe with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and one Dulce de leche crepe later I was floating on air. The food is not overpowering nor overfilling and just tastes amazingly fresh. Being in the other side of the restaurant made all the difference.  It was quiet and a little tight but very chill.  It definitely made the dining experience. Service was great and I cannot wait to go back and try the Braised Short Ribs!!
