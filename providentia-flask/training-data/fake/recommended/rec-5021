Bringing shame to the delivery game, since (at least) 2014! Morgan's does not know what they have available, which, as it turns out, is very little. It took them 20 minutes after my delivery order before they called to tell me that the 1st of 2 entrees we ordered - pork ribs - was not available . Ok, what about beef ribs? No? What about fatty brisket? No? Fine, I'll settle for the lean brisket (which I know from previous experience to be bland, but figured I'd drown it in bbq sauce). Then another 10 minutes before they call to tell me that the 2nd of 2 entrees we ordered - chicken - was unavailable. Giggles and a tepid apology from the other end of the phone. I'll probably go back because I'm weak willed and unprincipled. I may even order delivery again, because I make mistakes in my life. But it's not too late for you!
