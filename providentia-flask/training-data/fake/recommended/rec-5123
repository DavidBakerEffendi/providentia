every time friends and family come to nyc, i take them to breakfast or brunch at clinton street baking company. we purposely wake up early so that we can get here before the wait. the pancakes, the farmers breakfast, and the bacon are wonderful. the servers are friendly, and the food comes out pretty fast. it's a tight restaurant because there are many patrons. Â regardless, we always come back here.
