French fry are good, BUT they don't know how to call a CLUB SANDWICH the Cash register was douche not pleasant at all, the club sandwich is served as as chicken bacon sandwich,,,,,where I come from the club sandwich is THREE SLICES OF BREAD,BACON,LETTUCE TOMATO AND MAYO cut into angle to make 4 triangles. That's the right way and the way I have always had it..... Otherwise NOT done this way it's a SANDWICH WITH BACON........AND the lay out ordering station,sucks because take one order make another line.  Malt Vinegar is the preferable. Not white vinegar for salad dressing.   Label the bottles with what is inside. We thought it was cleaning solution.......
