Not quite 5 stars, but very very close.  Out of the three restaurants (formerly Melograno's first digs, and then Meme) I have frequented over the years at this location, this is my favorite. Atmosphere, coziness, tables by the walls of windows, open kitchen, clean, attractive crowd, professional servers, they've got it all.  And add to it the food, creative and wonderful. Appetizers: Barnegat Light scallops (the menu has it plural but only a singular was served, I am sure that is a culinary school thing) with black pudding, celery root puree, pear & celeriac remoulade.  If you don't know what Black Pudding is, as I didn't, look it up ;-)  This was fabulous, as was my choice of the soup of the day, a butternut squash and bosc pear, silky smooth, a nice fruity tang, rich full flavor without being heavy.  This was not your boring, everyday butternut squash soup I will tell you that. My friend and I split a pasta as we couldn't keep the description on the menu from tempting our tongues.  This had to be one of the most flavor-rounded pasta dishes I've had in the city.  Saffron spaghetti alla Chitarra with peekytoe crab, trout roe, sea urchin butter, that's all you need to know.  Heavenly! Entrees: Two fish dishes to delight you with taste, texture and appropriate accompaniments. That was the line caught New Jersey Fluke and the Rhode Island Skate.    On a menu with only 5 entrees listed, including these two fish choices, there was no chance of hiding, and these entrees did not, they stood out.  Fantastic. Dessert: The Bergamot pots de creme was a perfect split, not real sweet, just perfect.   This is one of my favorites, a good foodie destination, a tots pleasant experience.
