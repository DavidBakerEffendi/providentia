For those who haven't been initiated to the Blue Ribbon menu, it's hardly changed over the past 15 or 20 years it's been open. The oysters are to die for. The prawns and the lobster were great. The fact that we didn't start our dinner until 2am and they maintained the high quality food and service is very impressive. I used to wait tables in college at a couple of fine dining restaurants. I can appreciate good service. It goes a long way when you're spending good money at a restaurant. The service at Blue Ribbon was one of the best I've had in my life. Our waiter made the perfect selection of dishes (which were delicious) and drinks and desert that made the experience that much more enjoyable.
