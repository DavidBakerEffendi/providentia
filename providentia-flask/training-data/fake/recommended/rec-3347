New place within walking distance from our house - truly a great addition to Lyndhurst! The inside is similar to the pizza place that formerly inhabitated the space, but a few Colombian touches make it cozy. Definitely a casual spot. Eat in, take out or delivery. 5 stars for food. Delicious and authentic. We had the empanadas, churrasco and bandeja paisa (the "mini" portion which is still huge). They were out of the chorizo appetizer but we had more than enough food as it turned out. Our waitress was very sweet, courteous and efficient. As another reviewer mentioned, she is working on her English but knows more than enough to take care of her patrons! We waited a bit for our food but that was due to a large delivery order that was placed right before we got in, and the fact that it was close to closing. In fact, they did have to close early that night - not sure if they were out of food or just overwhelmed with the large order. Regardless, we had no issue waiting. We were happy that they had a lot of business. Highly recommend this place.
