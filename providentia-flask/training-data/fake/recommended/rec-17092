This place is like a food-lovers' heaven. I recently stumbled upon this place and have been back 5 times since. The food here is always executed personally from the owner/ executive chef. The lobster is delicious and so is the tomato salad and filet mignon steak that is served with yukon potatoes. The quality of the food is fresh and gourmet and that's what made me fall in love with the place. The ambiance is elegant and modern/ classy. The outdoor seating in the summer is always appealing and they always have live music on the weekends and the singers that come in should probably have record deals being that they are that good. Acoustic and slow just what I'd love to hear while I'm sipping on my wine. Another good point is that their wine selection is very good. Sometimes I go there just for wine. Each time I return, I feel more and more like family. The employees remember me and are always very accommodating. I would give this place 5 stars but the only kind of negative comment I can make is that it is a little pricey. I easily spend over $150 for 2 people but I am also having one of the best meals of my life and drinking good wine. If it weren't for the cost, I'd be here more than 2 times per week.
