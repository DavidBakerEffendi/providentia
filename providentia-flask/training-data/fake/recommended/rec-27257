Frame of reference: Thursday, last week, around 7pm. It was a bit windy and cold. Got there around 7 and it was jam packed. Friendly hostess let me know that there would be a half hour wait and that we should pop into bar and chill until she called. She was super friendly and our server was also really nice. We ended up popping over to a bar and was able to enjoy a quick drink. Good mexican. It's very cozy inside and we were very lucky to get a corner table to fit the three of us. The tacos were yummy, very cute, reminded me of tacos in LA. My girlfriends got the al pastor and the calamari - best choices by far. I got the barbicoa for dinner, and made mini tacos with the tortillas they provided on the side. The ceviche salsa thing is really yummy, especially because the chips were warm!
