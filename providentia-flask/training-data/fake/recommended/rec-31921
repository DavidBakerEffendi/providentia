Had a great lunch at Thai Awesome! The place is fabulous. The lady and I braved the snow in a zip car and managed to find our way through traffic into the empty little parking lot. The restaurant was deserted but really nicely decorated (and with cheesy but adorable Valentine's Day stuff everywhere). The waitress, the only other person we saw during our time there, was incredibly nice and friendly. And the food was beyond good. We were starving and ordered a ton - the Thai Awesome app sampler, som tum (green papaya salad), veg & tofu panang curry, and the drunken noodle "lunch combo" which came with a green salad, a spring roll, and tom yum soup for like $7.  The highlights, for me, were the fish cakes on the app sampler which were well fried and extremely flavourful, the som tum which was fresh and spicy, and the panang curry which was incredibly savory and a good contrast to the sweet sauces that came with the apps. The portions were big, and the best part was that this giant meal for 2 came out to like $30.  Wish I had a car so I could go there more often.  Highlight recommend, A+++, would lunch again.
