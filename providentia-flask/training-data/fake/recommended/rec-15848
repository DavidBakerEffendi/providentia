I really like this place! You can come with friends and enjoy a cup of tea or try a dessert. Or you can come for dinner and enjoy a delicious meal that feels like it's been cooked at home and prepared just for you! (not the porridge set though) Don't forget to order a tea! I really enjoyed the salad with with smoked salmon, the pork belly dish, and the other little dishes that come with the dinner set. They usually switch up the dishes in the dinner set since they have been different each time I go.
