They can do no wrong... Never had a sit down meal here, only take-out. Been here a handful of times and even shared some tweets/instagram comments with them. The people are so friendly and it's really clean. The way they take the time to box up your food in little packages is really cool. The Chicken sandwich which was MINDBLOWING, the turkey sandwich, the cuban, and their macaroons were really good too. Oh and the fries, duck fat perfection and when dipped in the pimentón aïoli...!!!!!!!!!!... The cool thing is that theyre always changing the sandwich menu. Definitely worth a good lunch, or dinner, which I have to try. -AM
