Reviver is awesome! I travel to NYC frequently for work and this town always seems to be my downfall, what with so many excellent food options--and most not so healthy. Having recently lost a significant amount of weight, I didn't want a week in the city to reverse a lot of hard hard. I found Reviver on Yelp and ate there five times this week. The variety of food is outstanding and everything is delicious. The restaurant's slogan is, "Order whatever looks good. You can't make a mistake here." So true. I stuck with salads. I had the Midtown Chicken, Loisaida Shrimp, and my favorite, Steak and Fig Salad. The Steak and Fig salad was so good, I had it two days. I also tried both of their soups. Both were excellent. The staff is friendly and the open kitchen is immaculately clean. I was skeptical my first visit. I didn't think anyone could coax so much flavor out of healthy food, but mission accomplished. If you want a healthy, quick meal, try Reviver. So, so good. I'll be back whenever I'm in the city.
