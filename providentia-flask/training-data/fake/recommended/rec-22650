Campania makes some really great food. Obviously their pizzas are the best, coal fired little pies with amazing and fresh ingredients. I would be happy with everything on the menu including their non-pizza items and they have some great apps, but I usually stick with the pizzas. The bar is really good too. I usually stick to beers which isn't a problem as they have a nice selection of draft and bottled beers. Large wine selection and the glasses are filled to the top, if you know what I mean. Anytime I have friends visiting and we want to go somewhere nice this is where I come. Probably the best pizza in the area.
