Really nice BYOB seafood restaurant. Some people call it greek, don't expect it to be your traditional gyro's place. Lots of great grilled fresh seafood, healthy and yummy. Bring a bottle of dry white wine and a few friends and enjoy your dinner in a casual and friendly atmosphere. One only hick-up: cash only and not specified anywhere when you get there.
