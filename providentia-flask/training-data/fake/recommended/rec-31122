The final word on last night's meal: more than pretty good. We arrived a few minutes early for our 7:30 reservations  and, although we were the oldest people in the room by far, we were warmly greeted and spent some pleasant time at the bar sampling the head bar tender's skills (Mumbai and Broad & Catherine cocktails), both of which were really good. We were seated in the Lounge Room at a corner table with the view that inspired the naming of one of our cocktails.  Our server was prompt, knowledgeable, and helpful, and we ordered the bottle of California Tinto (!) the he recommended to accompany our meal after enjoying the tasting he provided. It was fine. Dinner began with very fancy potato parathas (excellent) and turkey grilled sausage on a bed of chat-like ingredients (good, but not quite cosmic).  We followed with butter chicken (I want the recipe), matar paneer (very good) and black lentil dahl (also very good),  Portions were more than adequate and our server packed up what was left when it was time to go. Desert was a sampler  that included a masala donut, a small chocolate mousse, and glab juman brulee (!), all comped for my partner's birthday and, best of all, delivered without singing! To summarize, we will return, the drinks and food were great, and the service issues alluded to  in earlier posts appear to be a old memories that should be expunged. One more thing:  the large TVs in the bar are inconsistant with the atmosphere.  Tashan wants to be more than a sports bar: Just Do It.
