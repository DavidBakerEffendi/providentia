The most confounding, irritating waitlist system where we were originally told 15-20 minutes, only to be told at the one hour mark that people who called ahead go to the front of the line. Â As to why we weren't told up front it could be 15 mins or an hour and a half (at one hour four tables of two still ahead of us), "I'm sorry." So Sabrina, that sucks
