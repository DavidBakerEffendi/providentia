Love a busy breakfast when we're beginning our day in Manhattan. Balthazar also offers a tasty lunch (steak tar tar anyone?). Dinner and into the latenight hours, this hot-spot keeps the crowds coming. Beautiful types with fun wardrobes pile into the banquettes and tiny tables to be a part of the mad SOHO-French-American bistro scene. Breakfast is a perfect start. The army of servers zip around carrying steaming bowls of cafe au lait to the ever thirsty crowd. Â I like the bottles of tap water presented with Euro-style. The food is filling and tasty and you enjoy the richness all while spying the room from any of the many tilted mirrors positioned for optimal people-watching.
