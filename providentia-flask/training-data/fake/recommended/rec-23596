This was my second trip to the Farmhouse and although I was pretty impressed to begin with, last night's dinner took me over the edge.  We started with the Kale & Arugula Salad (buttermilk-herb vinaigrette, apple, spiced pecans,, and blue cheese), which was the perfect combination of sweet and salty with a hint of spice.  Then came the Winding Brook Farm Pasture Raised Pork burger, otherwise known as one of the best burgers I've ever had in my life!  Comes with a sunny side up local egg, VT cheddar, pickled fennel, and their own Rookie's Root Beer BBQ sauce.  Do yourself a favor and add bacon for an out of this world experience.  There was absolutely nothing wrong with that burger...it was just absurdly good.  The meal came to a close with Maple Mousse-light and fluffy with intensely pure VT maple syrup flavor.  Farmhouse, you have outdone yourself!
