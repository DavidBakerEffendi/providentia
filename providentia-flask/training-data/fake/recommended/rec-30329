So nice. Such reasonable prices for New York. And can I mention the candy crunch bar for dessert? Hommos, babaganoush, labne, chakchouka, kabob, eggs benedict - everything was divine. And the atmosphere was so classy. And the bathrooms make you feel like you're in a middle eastern royal palace. Just me? Well, they're pretty cool, anyway. Food + service + ambiance = 5 stars.
