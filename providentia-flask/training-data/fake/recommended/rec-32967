Walked in thinking it was still Mizu. It's under new management and I'm not really happy with the place. Completely new menu & all you can eat sushi for 20.99. There is no longer a bar either.   We waited about 20 minutes before someone came and took our order and we were the only people inside the restaurant. We had 5 different people wait on us and it was almost like they were trying to kick us out of the place. We weren't  even finished eating and they would come and try to take our dishes away. I came to Mizu almost bi weekly. I don't think ill come back here that often.
