5 stars for what it is - a sparsely decorated hole in the wall where you can get a huge, delicious bowl of soup with authentic hand drawn noodles for less than $6. Â I wasn't brave enough to try any appetizers this time, but if you're on the lookout for spicy pig ears this is your place. The broth soaks up a delicious flavor, and I'm happy to have found a place to go to for my winter soup craves!
