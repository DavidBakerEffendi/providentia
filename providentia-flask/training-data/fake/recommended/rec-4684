Once upon a time, we were regulars. They set the bar for gyros and souvlaki in greater New Haven. Gyro is loaded with meat and you can taste the love in the way they chop the onion and cucumber so fine in the oh-so-yogurt-y tzatziki. Chicken Souvlaki is less food, but just as excellent. No one else is as good - not Acropolis, not Athenian, not the Duchess Dineraunt. I got a special once. It had been a special throughout the summer of 2007 - avocado with chicken salad. PERFECT AVOCADO. I'm not kidding. And way more food than I could eat in one sitting. Used to get the spinach salad with a side of anchovies. Not anymore.* The house dressing has a nice homemade quality. And the clam chowder is amazing (for a diner) - red skin potatoes, hot and milky and not gooey, tasty clams. Seafood bisque isn't bad either. They don't do sandwiches, really - eggplant parm, meatball, turkey sandwich and pastrami were all bizarre and disappointing. And the pizza tastes like Pizza Hut pizza - doughy, bland, slightly sweet - burned to a crisp. So no good. *I had to stop ordering the spinach salad after I realized that each time I went there a larger and larger fraction of the spinach was spoiled. For awhile I was like, it's a cheap diner and I'm getting a salad, I'll deal. Â But finally, I called it to their attention; it was like every bite actually tasted rotten and I couldn't pick through it carefully enough. Anyway, they got me a souvlaki sandwich as a replacement but they were REALLY rude about it. So now we go there half as often 'cause how regularly can you eat a gyro? Open 'til 2 AM and the waitresses rock. No breakfast, no counter.
