This place was ok. Nothing super impressive but nothing too disappointing. The service was fine, a little slow but server was very nice. Table and menus were a bit dirty but food was good. Our spinach salads were fresh with good dressing and pep. pizza was good - I've had better and worse. And drinks were fine, a little expensive for such a casual place but mixed strong enough. It's a good local place for a casual bite of food.
