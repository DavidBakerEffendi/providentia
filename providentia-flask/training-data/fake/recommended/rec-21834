First of all, Barboncino is beautiful, with great decor and atmosphere (and music).  I've been several times since it opened, and last night I tried my favorite pizza yet -- a special pie topped with meatballs.  The cheeses on all their pizzas are incredibly yummy.  My favorite salad so far is the field greens with dried cherries.  I wish there were a few more dishes to try, but I appreciate their simple approach.  Can't wait until they start serving wine!
