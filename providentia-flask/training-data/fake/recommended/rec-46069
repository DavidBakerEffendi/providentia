Lots of space at the bar and the restaurant. Tried this place for Brunch.. horse radish dip was out of the world. Not a big fan of the decor but excellent service. Cocktails were decent. Avoid the Braised Lamb Shank. Probably a 3.5 for me. And yes, made a reservation but still had to wait for 15 mins even though there were many vacant tables.
