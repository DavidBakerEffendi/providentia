I love Sweet Afton. Great place to eat and drink. They have the best bar food and by far the best burger I've ever tried. The Mac and cheese with the works (bacon and scallion) is absolutely delicious. I love the sweet tea cocktail and the blueberry muddle. Brunch is also very good and always tasty. I heart Astoria.
