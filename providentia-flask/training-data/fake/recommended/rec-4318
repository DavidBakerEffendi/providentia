Late one evening in West Philly, I saw the lights of Mood Cafe, and peeped the sign for lassis from the street. We entered the brightly lit cafe and stood in awe of the 60 flavors on the board. Then we were told...this wasn't everything. They could create infinite lassis! I was astounded by the variety. The owner began chatting us up when we were deciding what to order, and filled us in about the origins of chaat and the lassi. He also claimed - and without dissent - that he makes the best lassi (not just in Philly, not just in PA or the whole US) IN THE WORLD. He said if you did not agree, you could keep your drink for free. But no one has taken him up on that yet. We both got the house special - the mango lassi. Mine was vegan, and I was shocked that....yes, these were the best mango lassis I'd ever had. Even the one that traded yogurt for almond milk. It must be in the smooth mango that blended in. While making our choices, the second man behind the counter gave us tastes of both the banana date and rose lassis. They were both incredible. The rose lassi tasted like my past. AND IT HAS REAL ROSE PETALS. Hands down, you've got to come here and try a lassi...or 12. I expect to come back for the chaat and update my review to an even more glowing 5 stars.
