I first saw this burger on A Hamburger Today (Serious Eats blog) and was intrigued. They raved about a burger that wasn't on a traditional burger bun nor in a burger shape. To top it all off, It was the Bronte burger. As in Emily Bronte? This team-Heathcliff girl had to give it a try! Believe the hype. Call ahead for seating. (You'll want to buy me a drink for this tip) Order it medium rare. Â (Not well done. Don't F-up their perfectly seasoned beef) Have a party in your mouth. Be full- bc portions are awesome Texas-sized not skimpy NY-sized (Yeah I said it) **You're welcome, Love Tiffany** If you're opened minded, get the Whaley. If you like sweeter things, get the Bronte. For purists, get the Bells. it's a regular burger without all the "weird" added toppings.
