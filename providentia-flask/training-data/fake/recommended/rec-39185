Ok, the chef here was too much!!  We got the total lecture on how this was real sushi and not "fake" sushi and ergo no rolls that you find at other places.  It was good, don't get me wrong but sheesh a little less 'tude dude!  We actually got in late and they closed shop early.  We then went to McD's and got burgers.  We were still hungry!
