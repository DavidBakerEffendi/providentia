What a shocker. I was definitely expecting a lot more given all the positive reviews. This place was recomended to me so I thought I'd give it a try. I made a last min. reservation for tonight at 8pm- they accomdated us, no problem which I thought was good. I first ordered the "Spring ahead" drink which was not very good - i wanted something cucumberish - I sent it back and they made a random cucumber cocktail for me which I thought was nice however it was just OK. For my meal I had the Octopus small plate and the salmon small plate and let me tell you they were SUPER small. Definitely not enough for dinner for one. The salmon came out and it looks pretty but it was literally 4 tiny slices of salmon - it was a little crazy. Ron ordered the striped bass which from "large plates" -- it was not large - and it was just the fish. nothing came with it. Anyway- The waitress told us they just changed their menu a week or so ago- I kind of wish we tried them before the menu change. We will definitely not be returning... Their portions are insane and definitely expensive! --Cool vibe and decor, our waitress was sweet but it didn't win me over. PS. VERY LOUD. :)
