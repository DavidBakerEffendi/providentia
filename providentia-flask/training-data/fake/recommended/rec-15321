Went here with my friends after a long American history tour around Independence Hall in Philly. How can you go to Philly without having an original cheese-steak? Well, lucky for us I Yelped this place right in the area and the reviews were pretty good. Its not a big fancy place, its a decent neighborhood spot where the ingredients are fresh. I ordered a Philly cheese-steak with cheez wiz, which was yummy! And cheez wiz fries. My friends and I totally loved it. The guy taking our orders was nice and friendly. Â The place was not packed so we didn't have to wait long. All and all pretty good stuff.
