On that Saturday in July, wife and I had a mission: Eat as much good food as we could to prepare for a 6 hour mountain bike race the next day.  Mid day found us at the downtown Farmers' Market, which we ate our way through like a couple of locusts.  Dinner could only be Papa Frank's.  As always, the food was great.  Is it like eating Italian in the North End (of Boston, not Burlington)?  No.  Papa Frank's always satisfies though (the chix and broc pesto over penne was terrific that night); you look around your and all the diners (and they get every demographic) are happy; the staff is happy; the food makes me happy, and the bill for two with tip is about 40 bucks.   And we both rode really well in the race, due in no small part to PFs.
