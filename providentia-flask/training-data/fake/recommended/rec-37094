Another gem added to Park Slope's collection of fine dining. I ordered a Kentucky bourbon ale from the huge tap list at the bar to keep me refreshed while I waited to be seated.  For the entree, I had the ribs, brisket, pulled pork combo with Mac and chili on the side.  Awesome choice.  Portions so huge that I had another bbq meal for breakfast the next day. The meat was smoky and came off the bone easily.
