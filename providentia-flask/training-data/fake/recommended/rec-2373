Chances are 90% of the people who genuinely enjoy this place are tourists. I've been here several times. The first time was nothing special, the second the meat was dry, so was the third, and the fourth the lady at the window had an attitude when I told her they gave me the wrong kind of cheese. Tourists, if you're looking for a GOOD Philly cheesesteak, I advise you to go elsewhere. You'll be $8 short and very disappointed.
