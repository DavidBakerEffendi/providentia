I love this place. Do not be intimidated by the line because they make sure you have small bites to eat before you enter. One morning I had small portions of bread,sausage, a cookie and orange juice all before I entered the place.     The only complaint is that the place is very tight so be prepared to get an earful of someone else's convo while waiting for your food.
