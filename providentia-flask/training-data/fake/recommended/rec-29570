I found Zio on yelp a few months ago. Good pizza is hard to find in Philly, so I try to go with what's been recommended. Even though it's in a pretty busy area, it's a little bit hidden -- the storefront is small, with just a small silver sign out front. They always have an interesting selection of pizza. There are most of the standards, like plain, mushroom, and sausage, but also more gourmet and unusual toppings. I knocked off a star for being a bit expensive for your standard pizzeria. The pizza costs a little more than I like to pay -- I think it's about $2 for a slice of plain and $2.50 for mushroom pizza. However, the slices are pretty big. They always taste fresh and aren't doused in grease. The seating area is nice, clean, and well-lit. Also, the guys who work there are always really friendly, even if you're cheap like me and just get a slice of plain and a cup of tap water.
