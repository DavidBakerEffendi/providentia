My daughter and I had an awesome experience this evening while at Sandra's.  From the moment we walked in the door and were promptly greeted by our server until we walked out after finishing we were treated first class.  The service was attentive, the food absolutely fantastic and we had a wonderful visit with Sandra, too.  The consummate hostess in how she made us feel like family and shared her story and listened to ours, too. Couldn't recommend this establishment and the good people who work there high enough.  A definite must do and we look forward to returning again and again.  Many, many thanks to each and all.   Best, Ken and Camille.
