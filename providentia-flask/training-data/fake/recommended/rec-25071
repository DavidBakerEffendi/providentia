This place is brilliant.   You walk in, the floors are black and white just like a typical Greaser 70s restaurant.  When you look up, there are mirrors of all types on the ceiling.  The center piece of this place is a giant chandelier.  Something I would have never expected in the center of a restaurant.   The waiters were all very friendly, and the food was delightful.  We ordered the green curry, drunken noodles, and a few appetizers.  To drink, we had a few of their decadent mojitos.  I would recommend the green tea mojito, and the ginger basil mojito.
