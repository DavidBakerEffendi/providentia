Impeccable menu and service. Everything they serve evidently tastes of only the best choice ingredients. I had a bloody mary with a mix clearly made in house, their bottomless coffee tastes like a godsend (I like coffee after alcohol), and their mofongo (plantains, bacon) is pure genius on a plate and in your mouth. Mofongo, and really all of their non-side, full entr√©e items to order are very generously portioned. I'd recommend sharing and if you're still hungry ordering sides which are all good. Just everything done right n as it should be done kinda place.
