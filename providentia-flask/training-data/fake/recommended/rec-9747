Did not wait too long for a table for 2 on a Thursday @6:30pm.. Literally got a table in 5 minutes. However I was just lucky that whatever party was suppose to be seated didn't show up.  I believe the wait was suppose to be around 30m to an hour.   don't bother looking at the menu and order yourself the TRUFFLE FRIES and TRUFFLE BURGER (medium rare is suggested *note I usually take my burgers medium but man that medium rare was juuuuicy!) literally drooled thinking bout the burger! The staff were very nice and knowledgable! Def make a visit to Umami burger you will have a peasant experience all around. Well minus.. The bathroom experience. As previous reviews mentioned the bathroom is a little gross so go after your meal.
