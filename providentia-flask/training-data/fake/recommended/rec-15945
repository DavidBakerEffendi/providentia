Everything about this restaurant is amazing.  The food, the wine, the decor, the service...it all gets 5 stars.  I have been here many many times and I have never been disappointed.  The prices are very reasonable and the portions are a good size. The baked penne is one of the best pasta dishes I've had. I always look forward to returning to Uva.
