The food is delicious, but it can be hit or miss.  I really go there for the atmosphere, and the absurdly friendly and always on-point service.  There are gems on the menu, though.  I dream about the ricotta with figs (sea salt, thyme, and honey), the burger's worth the hype, and the mussels are just the right amount of spicy. Cocktails are great too. I did a full review on the restaurant for Power Animals, which you can see here: power-animals.com/2011/0…
