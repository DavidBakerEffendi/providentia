Great beer selection and good pricing. I recently moved to Hightstown and definitely see this as my main watering hole. I haven't eaten much of the food, but the Irish nachos were quite delicious. The bar atmosphere is a bit divey (which I personally enjoy), but the restaurant side has a nicer ambiance. There is also a lovely outdoor seating area by (you guessed it!) the lake.
