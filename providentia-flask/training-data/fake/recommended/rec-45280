I have been going to this place since the 60s!  Back the it was "Spurr's"... then for a while it was "Joe's Place"... then it became "Country Creemee".  Regardless, the food is great and I Love Love Love the old style walk-up window places! Yeah, you're going to pay more than you would at a fast food joint, but the food is so much better it's stupid to make the comparison. By the way... for Merry and others below... I grew up in Reading and they're right, this is a great place to go after a trip to the 10- or 20-foot (swimming) hole. Note:  If you like this sort of place and find yourself in Colchester, CT, you HAVE to go to Harry's!
