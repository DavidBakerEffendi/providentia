Funny thing is I like everything about this place, except for the bagels. Friendly people, great food, sandwiches, wraps. The bagels, though...eh.  Not well done enough for me.  There's really no crust.  It is all a bit chewy.  For me a good bagel, a good NY bagel, needs to have a crusty outside and a chewy inside. Still, I do like this place.
