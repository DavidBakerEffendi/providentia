First thing I'd like to say is the previous reviewer, Jay W and his one review is a jerk off in my humble opinion. The combo appetizer plate is fantastic, 5 choices of delicious, fresh, healthy apps. for $9, perfect starter for two. The pizzas are good and varied, the chicken sandwich is my favorite ( get their homemade hot sauce on the side, but be careful ) falafel is solid and the pita is made to order and hot as hell. The owners and the service are as good as it gets. So take it from the majority and give it a try you want be disappointed. And did I mention it's BYOB.
