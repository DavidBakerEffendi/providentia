SALT SALT SALT !!!! !! I ate here back in 2011 and loved it, well things have changed quite a bit since then, the food was so salty it was almost unbearable. Everything was over seasoned and my god way too much salt!!  I tried a variety of Tapas: Deviled eggs - (the paprika was overwhelming and overpowered the egg) Octopus - tasty at first but again too much paprika Lamb skewers- delicious but missing acidity Beef tongue- it was ok but lacking something Paquetitos De Jamon- the flavors are just not there with this one you could not even taste the artichoke All the dishes were salty, I couldn't wait for desert--- I really needed something sweet at this point.  The bartender said they had a Dulce de leche flan, so I decided to give it a go..... can you believe it was toped with coarse SALT!!!  WTF...... I totally get the whole caramel and sea salt thing, but this was just god awful!!! I just couldn't get away from the salt....   Super disappointed :(
