People rave about the brunch here but we went with a group of 6 for dinner and had 6 unreal meals in a great atmosphere to start off celebrating 2015. Would also be good for a one-on-one date spot. Duck meatloaf was definitely the best- just look at the pictures people have posted of it. Mussels were fantastic in a white wine sauce with fabulous spice and toasted bread.  Our table also got the cauliflower soup, squash tart, and Brussels sprouts and we're not disappointed.   As for service, they were print and helpful throughout. I look forward to returning both for dinner and to try the brunch!
