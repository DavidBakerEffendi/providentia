Great food. Great atmosphere and very nice waiter. I brought my boyfriend, which was from out of town, to this restaurant and he thoroughly enjoyed it. The bill didn't come out to be too bad either. And I came on a Friday night so I didn't see the dance show. Overall, I had a great time and recommend it to everyone.
