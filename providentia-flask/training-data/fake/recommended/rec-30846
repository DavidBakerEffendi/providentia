I'd give it five stars on the pancakes alone! Unfortunately the 45 minute wait standing at the doorway on a snowy blistering morning ruined the experience, The place is a little cramp, not cute at all during the winter. I guess the wait could be more bearable if it isn't raining or snowing. I did come here another time during the summer with friends and enjoyed the backyard seating. I remember the food and drinks were amazing that day. The service could have been better, not enough staff during my last visit. I pretty much love everything for brunch on the menu but It's the pancakes that has me dreaming of coming back often. I brought a friend here not telling her about the pancakes. She ordered French toast which was good. After tasting my pancakes and damn near devouring my plate, she said hands down the best pancakes she ever tasted.
