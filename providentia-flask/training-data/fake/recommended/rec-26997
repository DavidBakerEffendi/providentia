One of the best meals I've had in a while. The space is beautiful, warm and inviting.  The service was mostly impeccable. The menu was exciting with plenty of great food and drink options. The menu is printed daily. On the evening we went we had an array of small plates. The dishes were all super fresh and delicious, all with local farm to table ingredients.  I think I could eat their grilled octopus every day. It was a busy night and the kitchen fell way behind, otherwise it was a perfect meal.
