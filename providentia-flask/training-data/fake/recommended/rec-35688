We had a nice Yelp coupon ($10 for $20, ty Yelp!) and went to have dinner while we were in town. I hadn't been here since the venue changed hands and names. It definitely seems like a good place to watch "the game" as they have numerous , extra-large, wall mounted, flat-screen TVs. The new menu was interesting and had lots of choices. The bf got 2 doz of the clams- for the Monday evening special of 60 cents each. I had a turkey club. Everything, in general, was fine, but nothing was special. Not a bad place to go if you're in the area. PS they seemed to have some confusion about using the Yelp coupon, but after a -couple of tries, they got it right.
