Great little neighborhood restaurant bar with a great little menu. Â We had the steak and fried chicken...both were excellent. Chips with onion dip and pretzels for the starters...chips were nice and crispy and pretzels soft and warm (though you only get 2 small ones per order). Drinks were resonably priced (round 10 bucks) and tasty. Definitely recommend to anyone in the area!
