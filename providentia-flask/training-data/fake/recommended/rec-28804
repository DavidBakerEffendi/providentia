Last night I went here with a party of 15 for my birthday. They took my reservation just two days prior, and were so accommodating!! The entire table was set up before we got there, with water at each seat and a few bowls of chips and salsa down the table. The food was incredible and the service was perfect. At the end of the night, the staff brought out a surprise cake (that they made!) for me and sang. I wasn't expecting that at all! Thank you!
