I saw the reviews and I work around the corner so I decided to give it a try.  I have a soft spot for family run business and this one totally fits the bill.  Decent number of tabls dot the space but I got the feeling most of their business is take out.  Decided to go with chicken tacos and was told it would be about 10 minutes.. No sweat. Sitting down I was greeted by Maddy, the young name sake of the restaurant.  She's 5.  We talked about ice cream, who works at my job, and what happens if you don't put ice cream in the freezer.  FYI it doesn't melt it EXPLODES as per Maddy.   My food was ready and I left and when I got to my job it wasn't exactly what I had expected but still very good.  Tacos aren't as big as some of the fast food chains, but you can tell that everything is fresh and homeade, even the tortilla chips that they snuck into the bag for me.  A bit on the bland side but nothing a little hot sauce didn't help. I'll return, if nothing else to have an entertaining conversation with the 5 year old inspiration for this family joint.
