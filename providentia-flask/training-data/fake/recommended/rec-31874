The chicken tikka chaat was as sweet and savory as the kind owner behind the counter is charming.  I worship Indian food, but chaat is a very peculiar dish to me.  I probably won't seek out chaat again, but it's indeed a scrumptious snack for those who grew up with street chaat.  And if you do enjoy chaat, I can't recommend a better place than Mood Cafe, with it's generous menu of different fresh lassis and wholesome chaats.
