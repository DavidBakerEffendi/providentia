I went here on a Thursday night with the boy. I was surprised to see how busy it was at 7:30 - it seems like since there are so many options in Hell's Kitchen, the restaurant part of restaurants aren't too packed in that neighborhood. We waited about twenty minutes for a table, which wasn't too terrible. The tables are really close together and it's quite loud, so it's not a great spot for a first date unless you know that you'll be going on a less busy night. The food was very good, and it was quite cheap. My tofu pad thai was only $9, and our entire meal, with tax and a 20% tip, came out to about $45 (this included 2 entrees, an appetizer and 2 drinks). Service was fine, not amazing, but they were so busy that I couldn't blame them for not being too attentive (which I'm not a fan of anyways.) I'll be back when it's not so busy. It was actually hard to talk in the restaurant because of the noise. Great prices, great drinks and a cute, albeit noisy, atmosphere.
