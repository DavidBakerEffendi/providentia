We ended up here for dinner Saturday night when our original choice had too long a wait, and I'm glad things went how they did. Sat outside because it was a beautiful night and the wait was only 10 minutes -- I was with older family and inside would probably have been too dark and noisy for them anyway. The table was hurriedly bused before we sat down; the tablecloth was soiled but our waitress immediately replaced the linen and apologized, so no harm done. Appetizers -- dad had the escargot and seemed happy, I had the shrimp spring rolls and they were great. Just enough tang without being overseasoned. Entrees -- I had the best scallops I've ever eaten; actually cut them into small pieces to make them last longer. Tender and not at all rubbery, perfectly seasoned, huge. The risotto they were served over was okay, nothing amazing, but that's all right. Mom had a steak which she said was "like butter;" dad had fish. My white peach sangria tasted more like liquor and less like sangria but the food was so great I wouldn't begrudge them an ordinary drink. Dessert -- Creme brulee, which I have eaten all over France, and this was one of the top two I've ever had. The coffee was great as well. Our waitress was quick, attentive, polite, and efficient; just friendly enough to be friendly without being annoying. All in all, her service was top-notch. As far as atmosphere goes, I can't say too much since we sat on the street. It was a great people-watching location. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to anyone. I may be back in Baltimore now, but I'm not kidding when I say I'm still thinking about those scallops.
