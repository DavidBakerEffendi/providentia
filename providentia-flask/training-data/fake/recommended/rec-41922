Two disclaimers: I am a huge fan of brunch and have only eaten from the brunch menu.  I also happen to like the owner's other establishment, The Cambridge located on South Street...if that helps with comparing my taste buds and dining style to yours.   Now on to business, here are the reasons why I am making Hawthornes my favorite brunch spot in Philly.   1. If you go before 11:30ish on the weekend with a party of 4 or less, you will most likely get seated, unlike other "trendy" establishments where you'd have to wait up to 45 minutes (*cough*: Green Eggs Cafe).   2. You can actually make reservations 24 hours in advanced. 3. Coffee is refilled continuously, delicious, and is fair-trade source (major brownie points). 4. Atmosphere is super cozy and cute and includes:  a real burning fire place, large windows streaming in light, a counter to fill up your growlers, and an amazing beer selection showcased in their well-cataloged beer fridges. Considering all they have to offer, the space is cozy and comfortable.  A hard thing to capture. 5. And of course, the brunch food is amazing.  I'm an eggs Benedict girl and they do it to perfection.  People that I take here are my friends and family for a reason...we share food from our plates - so I can safely say there other brunch selections are equally delicious. They have happy hour from 4pm-6pm (half off beer).
