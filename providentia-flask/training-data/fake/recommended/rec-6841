holy cow this place was delicious! came for my birthday with a few friends.  had some fun cocktails and we split a bunch of plates (which they recommend) - the squid, snap peas, string beans, agnoletti and bass.  all were amazing - beautifully prepared, fantastic flavors.  in the end, we had some delicious sauces left over so we ordered the bread to sop up all the remaining goodness - so I'd recommend doing this earlier!
