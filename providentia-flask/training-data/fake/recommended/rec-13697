Wow, what a great hidden gem!  I was a little hesitant to walk in, but glad I did since it wasn't really near anything except the highway!  I had the chopped pork, mac and cheese, corn bread and a side of fries.  Definitely only order one side of fries for the table!  They are hand cut and VERY good!  I would go back if I were ever in West Haven again! Chopped pork was good.  They give you a good portion.  Mac and cheese settled my craving, but I've had better.  I was sooo full I only had a piece of my corn bread.  It looked really good, I just had no room for it!  Fries - I could eat those all day!!!
