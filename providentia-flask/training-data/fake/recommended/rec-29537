I had the pepperoni pizza and the fried dough (!). Both great, in my opinion. Ate with three other people, we plan to come again tomorrow instead of chancing anywhere else. Good prices too. Service is fast, not overly friendly, it's a very casual place though so I just want my food. I'm looking forward to coming back.
