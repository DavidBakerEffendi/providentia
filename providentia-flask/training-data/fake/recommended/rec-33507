I've only been here for brunch and both times I was exceedingly pleased.  The tart Greek yogurt is very tasty and can easily be shared as a side because it is so thick and creamy.  Be sure to order a pot of tea with it to wash it down!   The French omelet has Brie cheese in it.  Seriously?  Could you possibly ask for anything more ingenious?  The coffee is hot and strong and the waitstaff is very laid back without being inattentive.   This is also a prime spot for people watching because there's tons of foot traffic that comes through this particular intersection, which makes for good morning conversation while waiting for your coffee to kick in and get your brain going.
