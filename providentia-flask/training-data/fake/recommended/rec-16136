I came here on a Friday night (745pm) thinking that the wait wouldn't be too long. I was mistaken. If you're thinking of coming here between 7-930pm be prepared to wait. My wait was 1 hr and precise. I left my name and mobile number with the hostess and she called back at the time she told me a table would be ready. The food here is great and very affordable. I came here with my little cousins and we ordered the meatball special (duck meatballs w/ spicy meat sauce) - $7, classic meatballs w/ mushroom gravy - $7, meatball hero w/ mozzarella - $9, and three classic sliders (1 parmesan sauce, spicy sauce, and mushroom gravy) - $3/each. Everything was delicious! We topped off the meal with their amazing homemade ice cream sandwiches. Vanilla ice cream with chocolate chip cookies, caramel ice cream with peanut butter cookies, mint ice cream with brownies, and espresso ice cream with walnut meringue - $4/each. I'm telling you...if you haven't tried this place DO IT! It's definitely worth the wait. We ended up walking around the neighborhood to kill time. Things to note: -Get there early to put your name down. If you're going during dinner time the wait will be about an hour. I was with a party of 4 but if two people you may wait less. Also, if you don't mind dining at the bar the wait is considerably shorter. -It gets pretty loud in there. -Staff was friendly and gave good recommendations. -Ice cream sandwiches are a must try!
