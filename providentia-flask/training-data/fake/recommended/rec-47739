BAR serves the best pizza in New Haven and -- by extension -- the world. I lived in New Haven for six years, and cut my teeth on Sally's. Great pizza...if you can get in. But if you can't get in, you can't eat. You can get into BAR. Then there's Pepe's. Frankly (no pun intended), I never saw what all the fuss was about. But I trust that Pepe's fans are good, honest law-abiding people who won't declare jihad against me for not liking Frank's pie. Besides, if I'm not at Pepe's, there's more pizza for you! Take pleasure in that. I used to live a couple of blocks up State Street from Modern Apizza, and have to say that they're better than Pepe's, but not as good as Sally's. A little too crispy on the crust, a little too much grit in the clams, and a long, long wait. So...where does BAR fit in? BAR is better than Pepe's (better crust; better sauce) or Modern (less burn around the crust). There. I said it. In fact, BAR is on par with Sally's, with the key differences being Â that you can get *into* BAR and they serve beer. Ask for their "hoppiest" beer. I forget which one it is. As the Monty Pythons would say, I believe I've run circles 'round you logically. Case closed.
