I'm giving Chavela's 5 stars because it really *is* as good as it gets (con un "Whoohoo!") but I dread actually eating here.   The restaurant itself is the poster boy for the fact that the neighborhood is beginning to gentrify, and along with a select few other places on Franklin, proof positive that this is the perfect neighborhood for restaurant entrepreneurs to try their hand at establishing something high quality and upscalish.   The place is packed.  The tables are packed very closely together which means you'll be eating almost German beer hall style.  Expect to feel included in the two conversations to your left and right.  The place is cramped and noisy. Entradas: ======== Guacamole: A- Comes with 4 or 5 small round fried tortillas (not chips) which are very crispy and have a wonderful flavor.  This appetizer is large: it's appropriate for 2 or 3 people.  The crispy fried tortillas are an A.  The guacamole itself is very good; nice cilantro flavor.  I wish they hadn't mashed it to an even consistency; I like my guac a bit more chunky.  A little more onion, tomato and lime juice would've made this an A dish. Tlacoyo con Napoles: C+ I'm not a fan of napoles; I find them slimy, like boiled okra.  So perhaps you shouldn't take my word for this dish.  If you like napoles, I'm sure you'd love this dish, so don't listen to me. Tostada with Shrimp: A The perfect tostada.  All ingredients super fresh, and the bottom fried tortilla was super crispy and tasty.  Stayed nice and crispy for the duration of the meal.  Shrimp were delicious.  Very impressive tostada! Queso Fundido (con chorizo): A+ It's basically a hash.  They give you small warm tortillas which you can make into queso fundido tacos which are out of this world.  Very highly recommended. Tamale (cheese with jalapeño pepper): B+ Filling is grade A delicious.  Fantastic!  The masa, although very soft and very moist, had a faint but discernible strange fennel flavor to it, and I don't like fennel. Ensaladas y Sopas =============== Sopa de Tortilla: A- Delicious vibrant tomatillo flavor.  My only negative comment is that it's a little bit too salty for my tastes. Sopa de Frijoles: A+ I normally don't give A+.  An A+ means something that is not only perfect, but also, something I would have a very difficult time not ordering each and every time I come here.   This is a perfect bean soup. Tortas ===== Carne Enchilada: B- Nice flavor, but too much bread and too dry.  The filling-to-bread ratio was too low. Brunch ===== Huevos Abogados: A- Potato Hash excellent.  Eggs cooked perfectly.  I don't recall there being guac on my dish and I had to ask for a little cup of extra jalapeño hollandaise sauce b/c there wasn't enough. Chilaquiles (which chorizo): A+ Perfection.  Eggs cooked perfectly.  Tomatillo sauce was perfect. Brunch Refuerzos ============= Bacon: A+ Cooked perfectly and super tasty!
