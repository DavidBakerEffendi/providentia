I love this place. I almost don't want to review it as it has gotten really crowded lately, but they deserve the kudos. The food is terrific, just the right amount of spicy and very fresh. The service is very attentive and friendly. The decor is very cozy too, except the wooden benches can be scratchy. Once I even got a splinter from one.
