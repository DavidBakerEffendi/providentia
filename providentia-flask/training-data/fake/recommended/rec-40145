Sidecar is the corner bar of one of my coworkers/friends.  He's always talking about how great the food and drink selections are and how awesome the staff is.   On Friday of last week, I finally got to see for myself what all the buzz was about.  On approach, the bar looks like an oasis at night, with tables lining the two streets of this corner property.  Inside the bar it was dim and comfortable and the staff welcomed my friend by name.  I got to meet the owner and my friend's favorite bartender, both of whom couldn't have been nicer or more attentive, even though it was crazy busy.   He had the stone black ipa and i had the heavy weisen.  Two very different beers, but both super tasty and ones I doubt I would've been able to find on tap at any of my other watering holes. I chose the chili from the menu even though I wasn't really hungry.  It was absolutely delicious!  It was the perfect blend of sweet and spicy and I downed almost all of it despite my lack of appetite.  A couple points off for stale chips, but I really didn't want to eat those anyway.  :) I wish I was anywhere near the GH area so I could have an excuse to go here more often!  After having gone here, I'm extremely jealous that I don't have a cool corner bar to frequent.
