This one of the newest restaurants in New Haven.  We went for dinner and found the experience "just ok".  The ambience is not the cozy, warm experience you'd expect in a Latin restaurant.  The entrees took quite a while to emerge from the kitchen, which is strange since the meats and sides are all the type of dishes that are slow-cooked in advance.  Although the flavor of the meats was fine, the dishes were luke warm; the only part of the meal that was served piping-hot was the black beans.  We split the rum bread pudding for dessert.  Again, it should have been served hotter.  Unfortunately, that dish was actually not good either. Sorry I can't write a better review, since I was really looking forward to this new spot.  Hope they can fix the service issues.
