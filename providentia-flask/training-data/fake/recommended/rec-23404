I really wanted to like this place. Myself and a coworker have been waiting months for it to open. I went in and the daughter was nice enough. The place is very clean and beachy looking which I love. I took a look at the menu and was amazed at how expensive they are. I ordered a crab cake sandwich ($9.99 ) Â fries are an extra $1.50. It says clearly on the menu that lettuce, tomato and onion are included but when I got back to my office they charged me $.35 for lettuce. I get it, it's only a couple cents but don't advertise something to be included when it's not. I got my food and came back to the office excited to try it out. They gave me fries even though I didn't ask for them but they didn't charge so ok no biggie. Well they should have kept them. Very bland nothing to them. So I start on the crab cake sandwich and pull the top bun off to put tarter sauce on and to my horror there was brown slimy lettuce all over the sandwich. And no it wasn't from the heat that made the lettuce like that. So I pull off all the lettuce because I'm not throwing out a $10 sandwich and I don't have time to go back and complain. So I bite down and all I taste is bland mush. The crab cake wasn't cooked right and had too much filler and there was no flavor at all. I know they just opend but if you don't have your shit together then don't open a place up, I'm sorry. I wish them luck and maybe the food will improve but I won't be going back and don't recommend anyone wasting their time or money.
