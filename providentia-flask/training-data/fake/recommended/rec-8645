I used to come here fairly regularly when I lived in Wayne. I was in the area and stopped in for lunch. The place has not changed and the decor is still the same. Sat at the sushi bar and ordered the tuna tataki appetizer and the sashimi lunch. The tataki was very good with plenty of spicy sauce. The sashimi was also good but I should have specified no fake crab because it is like eating a flavorless sponge. All in all it was as good as I recalled.
