Maybe I just made the wrong choice by ordering a shrimp salad (20$) but no joke it was the worst one I have ever had. I was hungry but couldn't eat it anyway. (Seriously how hard it must be to screw up a SALAD?) Drinks are alright. PS Two of my friends specifically told me NOT to go there but I wanted to try it anyway just because I live around the corner.. Wrong move! There are too many cool places in that neighborhood .. would not recommend.
