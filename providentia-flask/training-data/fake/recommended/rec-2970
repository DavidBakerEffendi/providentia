Lots of really great food on the menu.  The BBQ Beef sandwich with cole slaw is a favorite, as well as their vegetairian buffalo wings.  Portions are enormous and our work lunch gang loves it.  Excellent margaritas (and the happy hour special is totally worth hitting up.)   I've also gone to watch Flyers games and have dinner and had a good time.  It's definitley one of my favorite spots to hit up in Northern Liberties.
