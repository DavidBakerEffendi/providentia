It's been a while since I've been here so this review is extra late. The nacho's we got were amazing and huge. The tacos we got were small but good and honestly probably the perfect size after devouring a huge plate of nachos. The service was friendly and professional and the blood orange margs were pretty good...sorry I know this is sac-relig to say but they really weren't out of this world...they reminded me of the ones that come out of those slushie margarita machines at Fat Tuesdays on South Street. Again the food was very good....my stomach was a bit sour shortly after though. Authentic Mexican? Eh...I'm leaning more towards not...also a bit overpriced in my opinion but obviously you're paying more for the location and the ambiance...if a neon lit up motorcycle counts as ambiance.....
