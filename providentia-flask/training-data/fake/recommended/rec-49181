OK, I have to say with a heavy heart, this place did not live up to the hype. We ate on a Wednesday night, 3 coworkers and I.  The service was attentive, our water and wine glasses were consistently filled, and the bread man came over more than once.  However, the food just wasn't up to par.  The appetizers were the best part, we ordered 2 Spicy Duck Meatballs (tender and moist, but not much duck flavor) and the Lobster Salad (definitely not a lettuce salad... it was def rich and buttery goodness though).  For entrees we had the fish, pork loin and Thai fried chicken. I had the fish, I believe it was a trout (not sure now since I think they took it off their menu).  Basically the fish was very bland and undercooked in one part and I had to ask them to cook it some more halfway through the meal (waitress was very accommodating though). My coworker who also had the same fish dish left more than half of it uneaten. The fried chicken and pork loin were alright but nothing to write home about. The desserts were pretty darn good. The chocolate soufflé special was rich, warm, and indulgent, while jelly donuts and strawberry pavlova both hit the spot in terms of texture and amount of sweetness. It at least was a good ending to the meal. Perhaps the summer menu just didn't have as good entrees as other seasons. I'd hesitate to come back for dinner, though they do have a duck burger at the bar that caught my eye...
