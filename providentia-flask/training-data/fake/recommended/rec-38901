Don't think you need one more person to tell you to try the Montreal spice bagel... But here it goes- try the Montreal spice bagel... With Montreal spice cream cheese. And then get more bagels to go- especially if you live out of state...My boyfriend and I made this mistake and regret it. A lot. Can't forget that the location has a lot of character! Even though I'm a bruins fan (you'll understand this when you take a look at their decor) they've got great a great place to take a seat and enjoy yourself! Would've given it 5 stars but I feel like I would be jumping the gun since I've only been here once but I will definitely be back!
