Great brunch spot! I came here on a Sunday visiting my sister and the food and service was awesome. The host and waiters were friendly and down to earth. Food was awesome. I had gotten the petit steak while my sister and brother in law both got separate French toast. Forgot what it was exactly. I remember one was the pumpkin apple pie? Delicious. Nice little brunch spot that I would go back to again.
