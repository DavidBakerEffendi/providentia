This is the best halal food i had in NY. The best dish is the lamb & rice! The flavor is great and the quantity is excellent with great price. My advice would be to stay away from the red hot sauce, it is REALLY SPICY! And i can handle some heat but that sauce is not required. Just use the white sauce and you will be thoroughly satisfied.
