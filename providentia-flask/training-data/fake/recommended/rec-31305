Honestly, this place was awesome when I first visited NYC and my go-to Korean place. I love the concept of getting whatever you want and paying by weight, which is GREAT for people that love variety. But the quality has gone down a lot. Before, the kimchi was tasty, meat was juicy and delicious, and the japchae (clear noodle) was really yummy. But after my last visit in January 2014, the japchae was dry, kimchi bland, and meat was blah. The only good thing was the mini pancakes. One of the things that really turned me off was when I was paying and my boyfriend was getting his food weighed, we felt like the girls were giving us dirty looks after looking at how much food we were getting, and were talking to each other in Korean. I don't mind if you're talking in Korean, but giving us dirty looks doesn't make us feel good. Which is probably why we're not going to come back here. Previously, we've been treated well, so I'm not sure what's going on. The quality of food has gone down and so has the service. Oh and I'm pretty sure the price has gone up. Pretty disappointed.
