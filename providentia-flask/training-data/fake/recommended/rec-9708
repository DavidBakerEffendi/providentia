I was introduced to this place by my friend. Their soup dumplings are delicious. The first time I went, we only had appetizers. I couldn't stop eating the soup dumplings. They have 2 varieties, The crab and pork are my favorite. Will definitely go here when in Chinatown. Make sure you get a small table if you want privacy. They will fill all of the round tables. I tend to not mind having the locals at my table because I like watching what they eat and then try it. They can recommend some great dishes.
