No, this isn't the Tom's Restaurant from Seinfeld or the Suzanne Vega song (I've actually been to that diner, and it kinda sucks. I had one of the most boring, tasteless meals of my life there). This is the better one. The Tom's Restaurant in Brooklyn that is only open for breakfast an lunch and knows how to do brunch. There's always a line on weekends, but the line is worth it, because the restaurant staff bring food out to the line as they wait. I had small servings of french fries, fruit, cookies, and silver dollar pancakes served to me as I waited. I basically had breakfast before going in to have breakfast. And then the breakfast I had in there was extraordinary. These are legit the best pancakes I've ever had. Two words: Harvest Pancakes. Make a note, then go there and shove them in your face. A word of caution, though: Don't come with a group larger than 4 people. Otherwise, it'll be a bit cramped.
