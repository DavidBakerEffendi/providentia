This restaurant is the worst ever! I recently went there and honestly their food menu looks good , but their real  food dishes  taste terrible they have a poor service !!! I've eaten  amazing and delicious ecuadorian food In other restaurants, but this place not compare to the others mentioned before. It's a totally waste of time and money.Not recommended.
