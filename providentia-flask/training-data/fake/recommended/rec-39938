I have had lunch here several times over the past few years and always found the food to be exceptional, especially their roasted meat sandwiches. This was the first time I ventured there for dinner with my family. We made a reservation and upon arrival we realized it was a good thing that we did .The dining room is not very big in place fills up fast. We had a difficult time choosing from the specials as they all seem to sound delicious. We chose this stuffed zucchini appetizer as well as the fried calamari. The calamari was one of the best I've eaten.The stuffed zucchini was an unusual appetizer with a unique taste that blew us away. As far as our entr√©es go everything was great. Our waitress JoAnn really took great personal care with us and we did not feel rushed at all. The baked bread pudding dessert was awesome. Highly recommend.
