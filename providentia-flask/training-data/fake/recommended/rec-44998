I am a self proclaimed foodie and love trying different restaurants and foods. New York is like my adult playground because there are so many amazing food options available. I have never read or heard anything about Little Owl, so it was not on my itinerary for my weekend visit. However, my friend suggested it and i was extremely pleased with her choice. This was probably my favorite meal i have ever had in the city, including eating at Momofuku Ko. The food was simple, direct and damn goooood. I had the pork chop which is a house specialty and loved the acidity of the lemon juice that really brought the dish together. I literally thought about licking my plater clean because it was that amazing. I used some of the bread to try to soak up as much of it as i could. my friend had the halibut and it was also fantastic. i do agree that the waitstaff is a litlte aloof at times, but the food is so damn good that i didnt really care. This is definitely a hidden gem in the city.
