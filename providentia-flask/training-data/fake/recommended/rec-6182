Oh Applewood...I wanted to love you, but you didn't leave a very good first impression. Applewood's been on my to-visit list for quite a while now and after being stymied by a long wait at Talde on a Thursday night, we headed across the street to Applewood which thankfully had several tables open. First off, the lighting is *very* dim to the point where I'm pretty sure I dozed off several times during the meal. Granted, we were exhausted from work/walking around all afternoon but it was still a bit much. I'm sure one could consider it to carry a romantic ambiance, but I wasn't having any of that on that night. Of course, I'm never one to let atmosphere or service detract from my opinion of a restaurant; food is my sole criteria and was where Applewood completely missed the mark. The menu is seasonal and changes daily so you're not likely to get the same things. The apps were passable although quite mediocre. For entree I opted for the pork with eggplant and bok choy, which was underwhelming to say the least. The pork was quite dry and the eggplant was pretty damn salty. The only redeeming quality to this meal were the stellar oatmeal cookies we got with the check. All in all, an incredibly disappointing meal, but I'm open to giving it another shot sometime down the line if Talde rejects me again.
