Sit at the kitchen counter if possible. Get the gnocchi and the fish of the day. The wine list is also good and lengthy. A note re: prices - I personally think that you get what you pay for at this place. They list ALL the farms they work with and almost everything on the menu comes from a place that is into sustainable farming, ethical animal practices, etc. Lots of the items are organic and made with integrity. News flash folks: organic and sustainable food does cost a little more than hormone-fed and genetically engineered crap! Invest in your body/health, not in expensive shoes and clothes. :-) I'm just saying...
