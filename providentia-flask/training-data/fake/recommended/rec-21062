I came here recently after a trip to Paris. I definitely went in with the highest of expectations and was not disappointed! I attended a special event here where the chef was testing out the lunch menu so I had a good 85% of the menu. My favorites were the steak (great cut of ribeye and perfectly cooked), flan (succulent and light), and the french onion soup (slight sweet note, I liked it.). I wish this restaurant was closer to me but I'll find a way to be back again!
