I like this place, although I usually just order the dish they call "Sesame Chicken." Sesame chicken here is not the same as sesame chicken in your normal chinese/malaysian place. This is actually minced chicken and shrimp formed into a patty. It is pretty good, and the waitperson always tells me what it is, even though it says on the menu, because I think a lot of people order without reading the description. In fact, the menu has a lot of items that reccomend that you consult with your server before ordering the item. Also remember to bring cash, because they don't take credit, debit, or diner's club. Prices are good.
