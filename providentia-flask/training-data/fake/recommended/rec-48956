Great food, and very well-executed, if not stunningly creative cocktails. Nice cozy vibe, friendly staff, and a tasty, short menu. This place is a welcome addition to a neighborhood that doesn't have anything else that hits quite this niche. Tried the skirt steak, which was very well prepared and nicely presented. The guacamole was another big hit.
