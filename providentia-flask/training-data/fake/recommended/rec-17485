I only went there for drinks but the atmosphere was cool and cozy. The staff was friendly. Not to mention, getting to try the BACON infused vodka....it's not completely terrible! They had funny/eery things hanging on the walls that make good conversation pieces. It was a Tuesday = karaoke night! I would definitely go there again!
