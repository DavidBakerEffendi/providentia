After waiting 1 and a half hours for brunch, I see a couple sneak in, take the booth by the window, ignore the hostess when she stated they needed to wait in line.   Needless to say, this couple was still served and received their food faster than my sister and I who had ordered before them.   Now brunch is one of my favorite meals and I look forward to having it at different restaurants in the city to compare and to be honest this restaurant was sorely lacking.   Biscuits were dry, $2.00 for syrup for my sisters pancakes because everyone knows pancakes never come with syrup automatically.   I was extremely disappointed and except for the cheese grits which were very good, would not recommend this place to anyone.
