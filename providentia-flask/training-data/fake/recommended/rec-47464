dingy, dark, scruffy bar scene, kind of crowded - the best burger i've had since i moved to the city.  the burger is nice and thick (cooked to your preferred temp).  friendly staff, and they do have a couple tv's with sports usually on. update: I've continued to eat here a few more times - this burger is great - bottom line! (as long as you can get a table)
