I'm not a needy customer what's so ever but if you a customers whole meal on the side that should mean something . My girlfriend and I went for a midnight snack and I ordered the hungry man special it was pretty good . The ham was a little rough but besides that it was good . On the flip side the pizza they had was absolutely nasty . The sauce and pizza was just not appetizing what's so ever . We had asked the other waiters for her opinion and she said it was great . Being a server once before I always would be honest for the fact that the service and meal would rely on the customer being content . Definitely would not go here except for breakfast .
