Portions were large and filling. The prices were reasonable. I tried the duck confit, it was pretty good, and tasting it triggers my memories of Europe. The steak and fries were also good, however I'm a fan of fries, but the steak was good! For dessert, we had a Creme brûlée and chocolate cake with ice cream. But were okay, but I would skip dessert next time.
