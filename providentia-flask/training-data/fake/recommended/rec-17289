The ultimate late night food, I will travel and pay tolls to fulfill my need for a mixed platter bathing in white sauce.   If you can get on the cart on the Hilton side of the that's the better meal in my opinion. If you're a true fiend get two platter ones for immediate consumption and one for the next day. They always say it's gotta be good if there is a line and there is a hell of a line nightly for the street meat.  Rain or shine, day or night, hot or cold be prepared to wait to get your hands on this.  However, the workers here are efficient and most of the people eating here are return customers who know what they want so the line isn't really terrible.  The only time you'll have to wait an extended period of time is when they are cooking up a new batch of chicken and lamb. Another word of caution, the hot sauce is murderous.  I only put a couple drops for a change in flavor here and there.   Gourmet's need not apply here, its hefty amounts of street meat and rice.
