Its just so darn good! I've been twice and both experiences were as good as I could've asked for. The menu is vast, service pretty quick and portions Herculean (Greek reference, get it?). The prices surprisingly fair, the environment bustling and happy,the flavors awesome and portions very generous. On my first visit I had the Gryo platter and a fava bean/tomato stew. Both delish and I couldn't finish the dish on my second visit I was there with a larger group and we started off with humus tzatziki and grilled pita. I then had the meatballs tom sauce and rice. Okay first off it was a massive portion that could supported a small village for a week. And the flavor, Shazamski! Make this place your "go-to" and you'll be consistently happy. Never had a bad meal here and I make it a point to have dinner here about 4 times a year. FYI its BYO so swing by a local liquor store if you want to enjoy libations with your lovely meal.
