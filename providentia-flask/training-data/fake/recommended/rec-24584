It's a gorgeously-lit rustic looking place and while I was there they played some chill nostalgic 90's hip-hop so I was pretty darned happy. The bartender Shantell was friendly, prompt and generally cool. I wasn't feeling very adventurous when I went there, though their cocktails look intriguing I stuck to beer... I was a little underwhelmed by their beer options, not a very diverse offering and no bottles and just a couple non-tap options in cans. The crowd seemed chill, attractive and sightly diverse. Not ALL hipsters, but yes a lot of white folks but not entirely so either. I liked the vibe though with some more earthy (less frou-frou) food and beer options I'd be a big fan. I went on a Saturday night and a weeknight and there was plenty of space to move both times, which I like. Not too many bar options near here so they've got the market cornered, you could say...
