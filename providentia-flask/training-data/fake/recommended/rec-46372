great way to switch up the standard sandwich. bread is fresh meatballs come in all varieties - i dig the veggie ones w/ pesto. like that the sandwiches come w/ fresh salads. only thing that was off about this place was when i went in a with a group of friends they said they were busy n recommended we go to their bk shopinstead of getting to go. we ended up getting to go and walking to a park nearby but still why not just suggest that? anyways--can't wait to try more!
