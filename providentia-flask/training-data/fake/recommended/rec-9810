I can't believe I've only checked in here once, since I've been here a couple of times.  I was first introduced to Umami by my friend (Luis S. reviewed 8/4).  He opened my eyes to the truffle burger.  I seriously cannot get enough.  Addiction is an understatement.  I've brought a couple of friends here already under the guise that I want to catch up with them, but really I just want an excuse to make my way to Umami Burger.  It's completely out of my way but I make a point of going there just to get my fill of their truffle burger.  It's pretty much the burger that dreams are made of.
