I decided to give Guero's a try after reading about it in NY Mag.  I'm a Texas transplant and was excited about a place that seemingly had authentic breakfast tacos.  Guero's was SUCH a disappointment!  Their breakfast tacos are super small and overpriced, not good, the wait to go was really long, and they managed to get both my order and the order before mine wrong.  This was particularly frustrating after the long wait just to get our order.  They do not have enough staff or space to deal with the amount of customers in there, and the tacos themselves were just a disappointment all around.  I would avoid this place if you are looking for anything resembling authentic breakfast tacos.
