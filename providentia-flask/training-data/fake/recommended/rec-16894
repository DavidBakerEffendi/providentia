I was tempted to only give 4 stars because of "ambiance", but the only reason that was lacking was because I was the only person there - normally a bad sign!  I got a suggestion on what to eat, and the beef chapli kabob was recommended.  Even when it arrived at the table, I thought, "Well, this looks just okay".  Nope, it was delicious.  The beef was fantastic and flavorful, and the bread was insanely good - very fresh and soft.  I didn't think I would finish it all (and I didn't!) but I came very close.  Surprisingly good, this was a very good experience.
