I wish that I can give more stars to this place! Not only they have the special interior decoration, but also they have the best soup dumpling in town. Â I'm definitely the one who has qualification to say this because I'm from China where the soup dumpling comes from! My favorite to The Bao is also their creativity on soup dumpling! I must to give the credit to their wasabi soup dumpling and chocolate soup dumpling ! Good try!
