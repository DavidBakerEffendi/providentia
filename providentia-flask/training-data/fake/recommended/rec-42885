I was meeting an old friend for a long overdue catch up and she suggested we meet at Market Table - a fantastic choice. The restaurant is quaint with a relaxed, rustic feel. And the food is top notch. My friend started with the honeydew & yellow tomato gazpacho. She raved about it, confirming it's as delicious as it is pretty. I had the beet salad for my starter. Gorgeous beets are served with goat's cheese, horseradish cr√®me, hazelnuts and dill. I love dill and the herb gave the dish an extra flavor boost that set this salad apart from most beet salads. YUM! For our main dish, we both ordered the Veal Cutlet which I highly recommend. The veal is dredged in flour and fried. It's served with artichokes barigoule (artichokes braised in wine with mushrooms), celery root puree and topped with radishes that add texture to the dish. It was mouth-watering delicious. I had to ask for extra bread to scoop up the broth and puree.
