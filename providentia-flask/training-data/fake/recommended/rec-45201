My first time at the Cafe. Not impressed with the service. Went there for breakfast this past Sunday. Waited 5 minutes before anyone said a word to us, not even a hello. Got to our seats and waited 10 minutes for the waitress to come. She finally took our beverage order. 1/2 of the people that were with us, got their coffee, She forgot that one person ordered an apple juice and she gave her an orange juice instead. Finally the coffee came and had to wait another 10 minutes before our teas came. At that time she finally took our order. a half hour went buy and we are trying to figure out why our order is taking so long. Did I say this was breakfast and they were not even busy. So the food finally came out but we were short two orders. 1 was a simple Taylor Ham, Egg and Cheese on a roll but it came out 10 minutes after everyone's food came out. At one point the waitress came over and asked anyone if they wanted more coffee but after those drinking the coffee said no, she left and did not even give us tea drinkers a chance to say, more tea please. Though it has a nice setting, not worth the trip for me. I had better service at a diner..
