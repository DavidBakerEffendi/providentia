Best Lebanese food in New York, hands down. The brussel sprouts blew me away. I never even knew I liked brussel sprouts! You will find any meat you order (duck, lamb, beef) to be the freshest you ever tasted. The decor of the restaurant is absolutely stunning with a lounge-y feel. You would not expect such delicious and traditional food to be served to you since it feels more like a lounge. The hummus order is a given. That, with the soft pita bread, melt in your mouth. My favorite is to order a bunch of small plates to share. The chefs are phenomenal.
