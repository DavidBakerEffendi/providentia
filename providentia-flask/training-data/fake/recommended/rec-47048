A great establishment for those that enjoy beer.   They are very serious about beer.  There are beers here for every taste.  If you are a person that thinks they love beer, but your tastes are along the lines of Bud, Miller, Sam, and Corona, then this may not be your kind of place... initially.   The bartender was a fellow that would openly chastise patrons on beer selections... new patrons.  This is not an overt display of hostility, but rather a reflection of his own appreciation for the craft.   If you go in, openly accepting that the folk in this bar may know more about beer than you do... a LOT more, and just tell them what you like and keep sampling, you will find a beer that you love.  Probably more than one.   Just make sure you have a way home.  Several of the beers are quite potent, and after just a few, driving is an idea that will put you and others at serious risk.
