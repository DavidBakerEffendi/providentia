So where do you go at 2am on Route 3 and you don't want to go to Tick Tock.  On my way home one night I saw 3 West Pizza was still open so I stopped in for a couple slices.  It was one of the worst pizza's I ever had.  It was bland and sloppy; it fell apart as I tried to eat it.  I thought food tastes better when you are drunk.  Well I tried them a second time because I lived so damn close; once again a major fail.  And both times I was left  with stomach pains.
