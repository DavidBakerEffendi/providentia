Yes the food is about as fresh and good as you can get--their seafood is for people who love to cook and eat seafood.  I wish there was a place like this where I live--it would make sense since I LIVE in California--go figure, I have to go to NJ for the best seafood.  The resaon I am giving NSS 5 stars is of course for the quality of goods, but the service makes it top notch.  You will have a wonderful day if you stop into this special spot.
