Reserved ahead of time for a limited availability spot for bo ssam. We were a party of seven. We were seated promptly; we had changed our reservation from 6 people to 7 although the hostess had not realized that. She was gracious, and changed our table smoothly. We ordered drinks, mainly good beers, and added a couple of appetizers to what is otherwise a fixed menu. Pigs ears (unaccountably delicious- very chewy- and I don't normally like extraneous animal offerings) and the steamed buns, which we've had on other visits and love. Â We certainly didn't need the appetizers, but were in a splurge mood. But the main reason for being there was the bo ssam. A beautiful pork shoulder, with lettuce leaves for wrapping, fresh oysters, rice and various condiments. It was a feast, and we all loved it. A great celebratory meal, which is what we were looking for. We could easily have accommodated ten people with the amount of food, which makes it an exceptionally wonderful deal.
