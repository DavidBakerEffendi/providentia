Love the rustic atmosphere and had really good service on this visit.  The hostess, bartender, and server were all great on a rainy but moderately busy Thursday.  The mussels appetizer had a wonderful wood roasted flavor but the carpaccio appetizer was mostly pretty and not special. The pork and the tuna entrees were both very good and well cooked to medium rare.   My only real complaint about this place is that the wine list is VERY pricey.  The markup gets to 400% on many bottles and $75 is about entry level for a good bottle.   (Bottles start at $45).
