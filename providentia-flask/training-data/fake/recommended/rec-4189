Pricey beer, but this is an excellent space.  Very bright, roomy, cheerful.  Ping pong and a hipster pretzel girl roaming around make you feel like you're in No Libs!  I didn't have food, but the beer was cold.  I found it odd the a half liter costs exactly half as much as a full liter of beer... it seems like you get a discount for more beer.  Why would anyone order a liter at a time?  At the end of a liter the beer is guaranteed warm, while half liters are the same price and colder.  Nonetheless, kudos to Mr. Frankford for buying a bunch of old buildings and making them an awesome space for group get togethers!
