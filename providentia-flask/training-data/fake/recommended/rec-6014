So the service is very good.  The waiter at the bar counter is friendly.  The food is good.  I had an organic steamed egg with caviar and creme fresh like.. but the little plate was not worth 25 dollars...... and the tea is 5 dollars... I am not quite sure if the price matched the special egg plate.  The plate is a size of appetizer sharing plate worth... the quality is good but again, I wouldn't put 25 dollars on that dish.
