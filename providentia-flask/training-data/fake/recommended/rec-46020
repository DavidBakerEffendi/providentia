This place never fails. Awesome food, quick service. Me and the wife never stray from our regular orders. We always start with the calamari which is probably the best fried calamari I have ever had. It's served with onions, cucumbers, tomato and lettuce and eat them all together.. It's all good. Then we eat the number 30 which is the flank steak pho. Thick strips of beef, steaming hot beef broth. Excellent. Finish your dinner off with a refreshing avocado shake, and you're good to go. Can't go wrong with this place. If you're in the area, you should definitely check it out.
