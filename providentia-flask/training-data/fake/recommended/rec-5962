We lucked out at 7:00 on a Friday night - no wait for a table for 3.   Last time we tried was on a Saturday night at 8:00, when there was a 2 1/2 hour wait!?!?!  Don't forget, they actually do take reservations during the week! In my book, Melograno has not missed a step in moving to its new, bigger location on Sansom.   Great casual atmosphere & each dish seemed to be better than the one before.  I highly recommend everything we tried - the artichoke & scallop appetizer left us wondering how anyone could make an artichoke taste so good... the portabella with goat cheese and toasted pine nuts... home made papardelle with anything (mushroom/truffle oil was my favorite)... the foccacia.. the lava cake... the cappucino.  And for the quality of food and experience, the food is very reasonably priced. Definite contender for favorite BYO in the city!
