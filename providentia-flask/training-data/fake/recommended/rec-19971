You will most likely see a line out the door every time you come here but don't panic! The people who work here are QUICK. So you're probably thinking, it's just Belgian fries, who gives a crap? It's the multitude of delectable sauces, man. I'm in love with the Parmesan peppercorn, cheddar cheese, and almost all of the mayo options. Be careful when picking a fries size because they are all quite big! A regular size should do you just fine. Enjoy!
