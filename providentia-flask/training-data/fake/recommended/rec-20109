Loud, trendy, and crowded, but the food and the price can't be beat. The Pad Thai always rocks, but bring cash or you'll be running to the ATM a block away. Great bar, but the servers don't understand English all that well. Nice outdoor space when the weather's accommodating. Ordering delivery is a huge drag, though - you can't get past the busy signal and then you can't hear them over the din.
