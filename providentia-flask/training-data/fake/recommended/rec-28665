Small and  busy brunch and French bakery.  $15 prefixed menu with orange juice and tea or  coffee. OJ on your table as soon as you sit down! BOYB place and cash only. We tried the eggs benedict and smoke salmon sandwich both were very good. Don't skip on the potatoes, they are terrific! Good coffee too. You may need to wiggle your way to your table but you won't regret it.
