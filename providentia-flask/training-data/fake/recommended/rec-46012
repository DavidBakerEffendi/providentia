This is considered one of those quick grab some Chinese food take out type places and it's actually pretty nice. It's not like those cheesey Chinese take out places you see everywhere, they actually present their restaurant a lot nicer than most and the food itself is actually pretty darn good for Chinese take out. When you actually eat in instead of taking out the plating is a lot nicer than some other Chinese take out and you almost feel like you're eating at an actual "restaurant." This is a nice place to grab some cheap Chinese food, I really recommend the black pepper chicken and the beef and broccoli. This is definitely a place that I would regularly go back to due to the price and quality of food compared to the other ones down the street.
