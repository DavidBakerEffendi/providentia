We went to Cuban Pete's for the first time in about a year. There was no wait for a table and they seated us in the small room across from the main building. The room was crowded and the music was too loud so people had to talk loudly to hear. We asked to be moved and were seated directly under speakers in main dining area. The music was louder than before. People were just about yelling at each other to be heard. We asked the waitress if they could lower the music and she said they could not.... so we left without ordering. Too bad because we like the food. After reading all the other complaints about the owner/manager and the music I truly believe he purposely sat us under the speakers because we complained about the music being too loud. Never going back. If you intend on going, bring ear plugs and DON'T complain about the music!!!
