Great tapas! And lovely warm, atmosphere. We came for a very early dinner, with a reservation around 6:15. They actually gave us quite a hard time over the phone when making the reservation, but when we arrived to be seated, we were the only ones in the dining room for a good 30-45 minutes! Nevertheless, we got an excellent table for 4 at the back of the ground floor dining room near a fireplace. There was no fire as it wasn't necessary but a great view of the whole room from that location. As for the food, all that we tried was very tasty. The ravioli are served with a parmesean-y foam that is interesting. The jumbo "huge" shrimp are legitimately that - HUGE! They are served with heads on, so they appear much larger, and there are only two. The artichokes were incredible, we ordered 3 portions, and the flatbreads were lovely as well. They only take Cash or AmEx so be prepared.
