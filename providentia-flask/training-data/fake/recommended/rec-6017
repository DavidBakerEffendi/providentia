Another "good" UWS restaurant. We generally order Meze and skip the main courses.  Our favorites are the grilled octopus and the meatballs (I believe they are called something like "Ya ya's meatballls).  We also enjoy 3 of the 4 spreads and pita.  And of course we order the Kefi salad, which was not all that fresh this last time and also didn't have the correct proportions of tomato, feta, etc. to lettuce.  In the past we have liked it.  Perhaps it was an off night. I have never ordered a main that I have ordered on a subsequent visit, and that goes for lunch mains as well.  I have, however, ordered the yummy white sangria more than once. Prices are not that high for NYC. Overall, this place is good, just not great.
