Both got the urge for a slab of cow on a Saturday afternoon.  Flipped a coin for Longhorn (across the street) or Outback, and Outback won.  Arriving at 5:30pm was not crowded,,, surprising compared to the Old Bridge and  Edison locations that are closer to out home...always packed. Seated promptly, given great service by the wait person (Deanna D), with water and the good, hot brown bread on the table quickly.  A Bloody Mary was a bit on the small side, but well-made.  The "Big" Sam Adams Summer Ale was huge, and fairly priced. Skipped the apps... no need to reduce the capability for beef consumption.  Caesar salads were good, cool, crisp, nice croutons, not over-dressed.  Seemed like a long wait for the entrees though.  The wife's filet was cooked perfectly.... RARE.  She's a stickler on how it's cooked, and it easily passed the critical appraisal.  My rib eye was correctly medium rare, good flavor.  Not enough char on the outside, a little on the thin side.  Also found the Crocodile Dundee-style steak knife could have been cleaner.  Offsetting to find a crust of something among the water spots. All things considered, enjoyable.
