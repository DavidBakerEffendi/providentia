We went to celebrate a friend so we spent a little more.  To get a gauge:  4 guys spent about $200 together, then tip.  Food quality was very good; you get the feel of a tight packed sake bar.  A lot of the food I typically didn't like (Like chicken gizzard) was prepared to something that I liked.    If you want good Japanese for a bit of a price in a packed location, this is it.
