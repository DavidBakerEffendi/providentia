I have gotten delivery four times, twice in the past week and every time was very satisfied   The dishes all arrived warm.  The taste of the sauces is more home-made than other Indian restaurants in town and West Philly. The Goan shrimp is an unusual offering and fabulous.  My naan was also superior and the rice well-cooked.   The tandoori was temptingly moist.. The Indian restaurant in Fort Washington is the only one I've been to with superior quality but also more expensive.
