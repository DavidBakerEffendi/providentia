Top Chef-ies rejoice!!!! When the house olive oil is as far as you need to go for inspiration of the restaurant name, you know the rest of the menu is going to blow your mind. Extra Virgin delivers as the "fancy night out" place without a doubt. First date, anniversary, birthday or whatever reason you're using to get a little chi-chi in the Village, Extra Virgin won't disappoint. The main dining room is warm wood, brick walls, oversize mirrors and intimate old world sensational. The atmosphere is not as all out decadent as Craftsteak, but the food is just as rewarding. Save up your dollars and patience, because you'll need a bit of both. The food is worth it, and the wait is bearable if you take a seat at the retro hip bar and enjoy the vibe and some conversation. Extra Virgin is classy and chic, but not pretentious. The menu speaks for itself with classics (their chicken soup will leave you speechless) done right and fancied up just a bit. The roasted artichoke parmesan is an unexpected yet uncomplicated surprise of flavors that excel as an appetizer. The mushroom crusted chicken is perfection of flavor and texture and should not be missed. Â  Take a trip to Extra Virgin when you're looking for a little something special and you will walk out feeling extra fantastic.
