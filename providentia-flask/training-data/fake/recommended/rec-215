This is a tiny place, very much in demand and crowded on a Friday evening!  And I can see why. Quick, friendly service and delish savory tapas.  Plus, it's all authentic -I'm a big fan of the real goods.  Great place for light dinner.  Definitely recommend coming a bit early to grab some seats! Otherwise, it's a long wait and plenty of standing!  And because of this long wait, they'd like for those seated patrons to leave as soon as the check comes.
