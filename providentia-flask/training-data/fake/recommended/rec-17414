Nice ambience, friendly courteous service. The place was little cramped tho, I could hear the lady at the other table talk about her dogs and how shes such good friends with the chef. Anyways, I had the steak, it was very tasty, great sauce, wish they gave slightly more though. My fiance had the risotto and grilled vegetables, she liked it. I liked the food and experience but wasn't that memorable to me, nice romantic place in thecity tho.
