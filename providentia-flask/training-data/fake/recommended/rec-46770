The place is smaller than other Go Go Curry places.  4 tiny tables and about 9 chairs.  But the curry was good.  I got pork, and my friend got chicken.  I may have stolen some of his food...haha No complaints about the food at all.  I didn't really like the shrimp last time, but the pork and chicken were pretty good.  The curry is on the sweeter side, so I guess people who prefer spicier curry won't like it much.
