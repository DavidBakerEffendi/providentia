Love the mash bar - great idea.  Their cashew cream is delicious and creamy.  I tried the Fresh Herb raw crackers they had from Healing Home Foods - wonderful cheesy taste.  Small coffee = tiny coffee.  Almond milk, coconut milk, grass-fed milk options.  All-in-all, a great paleo/vegan/raw friendly place.
