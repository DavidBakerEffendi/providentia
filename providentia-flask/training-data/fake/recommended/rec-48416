So, I started craving Eastern European food last week (don't ask).  Anyway, we found this place, a few blocks down from where we live.  I haven't had Chicken Paprika since I was a kid, and Steinhof definitely did not disappoint the memory.  The chicken was slow cooked in a creamy tomato and paprika sauce.  It was served with spaetzel, which were tender and yummy and they even paid enough attention to detail to fry some of the spaetzel and place the crunchies atop the chicken.  Delicious!!   The salad was alright -- it was drowning in dressing; the tomato soup was delicious though.   Basically you should just go for the chicken paprika.
