This review is only for the dinner as I'm not patient enough for the brunch crowds.  Have been here a couple of times since all the rave reviews and it simply delivers.  From the different times i've been here, i have to say the catfish tenders and the short ribs are can't miss dishes. Others might have said this, but the place really does have that home effect like you are eating at your own home with your family and friends.  The waiters are very charismatic and friendly.  The place is always packed but they still remain attentive.  This place is a short taxi ride from Center City, but always a nice walk during a warm night's out to south philly.
