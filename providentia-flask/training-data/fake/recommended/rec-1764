Every year, I travel to Philly during around this date, Lord willing; and Lord willing, I get to eat at Scannicchio. Another five-star experience.  Beet-walnut-goat cheese-arugula salad, and the salmon special (they get the freshest salmon you can imagine, except maybe Seattle), followed by homemade tiramisu and cannoli cream on the side.  Oh mi ya ya.  And capped off with homemade lemoncello. Are you kidding me? This place is like Death Row delicious.
