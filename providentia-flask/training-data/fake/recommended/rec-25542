I love this place, especially for lunch. The menu is very extensive with a lot of choices. For $8 you get a choice of soup, spring rolls and an enormous portion of food. Service is excellent, polite and extremely fast. This makes it very popular at lunch time during the week. It is often almost entirely filled with Indian kids working in corporate IT sweatshops of the area around Bloomfield. Food quality is very high. I am a Tom Yum and drunken noodles addict and both are very, very proper here. Highly reccommend.
