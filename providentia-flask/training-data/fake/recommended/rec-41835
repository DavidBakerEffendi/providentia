mmmm. i love the curry mee with young tau foo, which are egg noodle served in a spicy lemon grass coconut curry with tofu and veggies stuffed with fish! and it's what, $5.50??? yay. those fried tofus are awesomely delicious. and i even eat my bittermelon circle that comes with it, and i normally hate bittermelon. took one star off for the chile pepper paul ate that he thought was bittermelon. also, what makes a delicious and cheap meal end great is if you just walk a few blocks down to spring street and get some rice pudding from rice to riches!
