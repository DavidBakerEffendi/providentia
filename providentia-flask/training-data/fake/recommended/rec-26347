On New Years Day, everything was shut - so we resorted a diner that we had never been to before. The parking lot was packed and we knew there'd be a wait inside. Once inside, the cashier wasn't too friendly when I mistakenly took her for the hostess (eye roll). We were seated within 10 minutes and the food orders came pretty quickly as well. My omelet was decent and everyone else commented their food was just alright. They did mess up my order but fixed it right away when I pointed it out. Conclusion: The food and service is decent, but not enough for me to drive out of my way to come for brunch.
