Not the best flatbread I've had, but certainly a nice contender.  Great service, jazz music, the smell from the wood burning oven is intoxicating... service is lovely and live jazz/blue grass adds a very "hippietown, new age, liberal" feeling. The salad of the day was lightly dressed, mixed greens, dainty red onion slivers, creamy-dreamy feta and watermelon... nice starter for one of their mushroom and herbaceous flats.  Glass of wine, and yeah baby.  Chill
