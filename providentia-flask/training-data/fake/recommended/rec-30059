The four-star average rating seems about right to me.  The menu is centered around the sea.  The service and food were excellent.  The wine list is quite varied and interesting; it included wines as low as $38/bottle and as high as $XYZ. I chose the octopus appetizer and the monkfish special main dish.  (We were told that the monkfish will migrate to the regular menu from the specials board.)  Both choices were fine, though I regretted not being able to try the beef carpaccio and the pan-seared chicken, which were available on the menu and touted by previous yelpers.  Our group polished off the picpoul de pinet ($38) pretty quickly and then ordered a half-bottle of the falanghina ($29?), which I didn't like as much. I can see why Frank Bruni gave Market Table two stars a bunch of years ago (nytimes.com/restaurants/…).  This restaurant has been open for about six years and seems to be doing very well for itself.  Our visit was a great pleasure.
