I had an awful experience at this restaurant. The service was horrific. It took nearly half an hour to place my order. I then spent the entire meal trying to get the waitresses attention, practically waving my hands over my head, while she wiped tables and folded silverware near by. The food was mediocre, at best. I've since ordered takeout, going in late I discovered there was no one in the restaurant an hour before closing. I wondered if the food was bad the first time because I was so annoyed about the service. Turns out no, it was bad al the time, no matter my mood.
