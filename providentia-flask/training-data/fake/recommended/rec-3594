I was especially obsessed with this place over the summer but my obsession has since ceased. I still think that their wraps are really tasty and super full filling. They are like giant burrito sized wraps. However what I loved before was their beet salad that was super tasty, it was light and summery topped with feta cheese made when someone would order it. I guess they recently switched the feta cheese to some type of cream cheese and it's not as tasty. Also they premake them all at once and then store them in their fridge, I don't know why but it doesn't seem as fresh too. They used to serve beer at this place but has since taken it off the menu. I think the wraps are a little pricey but I guess it's typical for Manhattan prices.
