We went for Sunday Brunch and were seated within ten minutes of arrival. Service: On point and extremely fast and attentive. Food: The hype is legit about the pancakes. They taste different from other places i've been and that's in a good way. We also ordered the wild mushroom omelet. Didn't see any wild mushrooms inside the omelet and the asiago cheese was extremely light but it was still tasty. But again, the Pancakes were Dayum! good. Environment: Nice and although packed every table felt private. Prices were reasonable as well. Would definitely go back.
