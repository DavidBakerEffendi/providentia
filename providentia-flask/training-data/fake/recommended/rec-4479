I honestly have been searching for the words to review this place for a week. The service was just service. I was slightly underwhelmed with the decor, however I had no expectations of the place and had not checked any reviews before going. The food was good enough if you are in the mood for BBQ. Atmosphere is very casual. A you can wear jeans and flats kinda joint. Since I do not eat pork my options were limited as far as the menu. We tried the Brisket and the Beef Short Ribs for our main courses.  The portions were large and hearty. The best part of it all, in my opinion, was the chicken wing appetizers with the variety of sauces that are at the table. Would I go back again? Most likely for a local last minute outing, but not for a special occasion.  It just wasn't anything to call home about. Overall. Meh.
