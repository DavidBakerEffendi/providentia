Saturday night around 8:20 - made reservations for 2 because everyone said we needed them, but there were a couple of empty tables. We sat in a corner by the window. I knew this place was small, but I didn't realize how small! It's pretty tiny. Servers are nice, but leave you alone most of the time. Service isn't really too quick, which is both good and bad. Even though there weren't a lot of people there, we waited quite a while, but on the other hand, it felt very casual. No rush. Our server made some recommendations according to our preferences, which was helpful. We ended up getting: Iron Chef Spicy - tuna, fresh scallop, avocado, caviar - caviar on top was great Hana - salmon, tuna, eel, avocado topped with seared white tuna - this was delicious! The seared tuna was particularly fantastic Also a spicy tuna roll, cucumber carrot roll, and a side of white rice. They don't have a crazy variety of stuff and much of it is pretty run of the mill, but everything tasted great, seemed fresh, and was a pleasant experience. Would go back if I were around the neighborhood.
