- Waited about one hour in line to get a table (perks about going in group of 2 rather than large group - get to skip line if small tables open up) - Waited another 45 min. to get pizza after ordering (it IS fresh) - Wait wasn't justified. It WAS good, but next time I visit NY, I won't waste half of my afternoon waiting for a-ok pizza. We ordered the white pizza because we love garlic, but we both could barely taste the garlic, sad since the white pizza costs more than the red. There are much better places here in the Bay Area.
