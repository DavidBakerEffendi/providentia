They don't take reservations and the wait is pretty ridiculous unless you're a party of 2. It's a cool little place though... one long table in the middle so don't be shy about rubbing elbows with strangers. The spicy sauce is the best, we got the classic meatball with spicy sauce and some others but that was definitely the most memorable. The special changes, I had the bolognese balls, with mushroom gravy which was ok. Tried the spinach, rigatoni and risotto sides. Hands down risotto wins. Didn't try the heroes or sliders but will go back for it. The home made mint ice cream is pretty crazy and the gingersnap cookies were delish.
