This is a very nice Asian restaurant just on the edge of downtown New Haven. The decor of this place has a chic loungey vibe. The place is pretty new to the scene. The food is excellent. Their selection offers plenty of variety and does not disappoint. Their General Tso's Chicken is the best I have had in New Haven county. There is some parking in the area
