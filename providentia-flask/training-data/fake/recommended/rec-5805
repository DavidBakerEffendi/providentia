I live near this place and have been wanting to try it for a while, but have always been wary of doing so. Never again will I go here. I honestly cannot understand why it's crowded all the time. 1) They microwaved our food - from where we were sitting we could see everything that was going on at the waiter's station. My friend, who graciously decided to give this place a second try, ordered a rice bowl. We both saw them take the bowl out of a fridge - veggies, rice, and chicken in all - and put in the microwave before bringing it out to her. Unacceptable. 2) I had to wait 10 minutes for my food to come out after my friend had ordered hers. Unacceptable. 3) The serving staff was eating right near the cash register and where the customer's food is served - if you're working at a restaurant, you should be taking a break to eat and should be doing it out of the sight of customers. Unacceptable. 4) The price we both had to pay for the food was absolutely not worth it. We were contemplating ordering Chinese take out, and after our meal realized we could have gotten much more for our money and a better quality. 5) The food was nothing special. I could have made better fried rice at home. The chicken was so bland and I'm pretty sure the vegetables in the fried rice were from a frozen bag. Meh. Anything that comes out in 2 minutes should be a red flag. I prefer quality over speed on most occasions. Service was so-so and no one refilled my water. There are definitely better places in University City to get the same type of food - such as Lemon Grass and Koreana to name a few. Even some of the lunch trucks are better.
