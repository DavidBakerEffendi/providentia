This is by far the best sports bar i've ever been to not just in the state but in the country and i've been to alot of sports bars, its very clean and the employees are very courteous. The owner is there every time i'm there and really cares for his bar and his customers. Even though he is a Ranger and Dolphin fan he appreciates all teams and supports everyone that shows up there, sundays there are awesome with the amount of people from all different teams and fan clubs during football season. There are over 52 lcd tv's around the place and a great vip section with leather lounge chairs and everything, hes even got a screen thats covers and entire wall that he puts the major events on (ppv's, championship games, playoffs games, one time during the olympics i even saw curling on that screen haha) Prices are the same as every other bar you would go to, and the food selection is alot bigger than most other bars, for those people that have reviewed beer prices being to steep they are the same exact prices you would see at a fridays, applebees, ruby tuesdays and all those other restaurants with bars. Sorry they arent beer store prices. And yes pitchers usually are less than order a few glasses if u are going to drink 3 or more beers get a pitcher just know it will get warm with time. Def worth a visit at least once if you are in the area and the hotel attached is also a great place to stay in and super convenient for a long night of drinking at the bar and playing games (pool, beer pong, basketball shootout, arcade games, etc...).
