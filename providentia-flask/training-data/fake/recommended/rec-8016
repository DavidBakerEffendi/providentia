Who could say no to delicious piping hot freshly made Belgium fries? This place is heaven for a potato fiend like myself. I made it a mission to try Pomme Frites while I was in New York. I also love steak cut fries hence the Belgium fries were perfect, thick cuts of potatoes versus shoe string fries- not as big of a fan. The fries are made fresh to order- AWESOME. Love my fries piping hot and steaming when I bite into them. They are also fried to perfection, crispy yet fluffy. And their sauces.....that can go on forever! It was so hard to choose what sauce to get. It's $1.50 extra per sauce. They do also have free sauces such as chopped onions, frites sauce, ketchup or the especial (all 3 combined) They also offer Poutine fries (if you've never been to Canada....its TO DIE FOR) Fries with gravy is what it is. They offer different sizes for different prices, all $10 and under. We ordered a regular with the mango chutney and the especial sauce (both on the side) for $6. The mango chutney was good, but people raved about it, I was a bit disappointed. The Especial sauce was good too, I mean you can't go wrong with ketchup, mayo and raw onions (a must since it's free to go with your fries). The line wasn't that bad when I went. It was a Saturday night too. And it moves by pretty quickly. I will definitely be back to try more sauces. They also have tables with holes in it to hold your fries! AWESOME! But seating is limited. Maybe 20 people max (I'm honestly probably over-estimating)
