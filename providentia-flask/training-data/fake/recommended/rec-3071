The Sesame Salmon dish served here is probably one of NYC's best meals. Plus, the people-watching from their outdoor patio is great. It's gotten a nice remodeling, so it's nice to see that the owners are putting money into the place. But that Sesame Salmon dish...it's just the wackiest combo of ingredients that are consistently INCREDIBLE!
