Incredible Sunday Brunch.  Little bit pricey, $19 per adult for food only.  But the selection and quality of the brunch buffet is well worth it.  Good selections of salads and soups including lox.  There are waffle, omlets and carving stations featuring roast beef, ham and turkey.  Breakfast foods included scramble eggs, breakfast potatoes, eggs benedict, french toast, plain and blue berry pancakes, sausage and bacon.  Lunch items included pasta dishes, chicken and ribs.  Also had a good selection of deserts.  We will be back!
