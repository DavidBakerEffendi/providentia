seriously AMAZED by this place! the food is basically street cart food but its such a beautiful little hidden gem of a place with thee BEST view! would definitely recommend for lunch with friends , or for a very laid back afternoon spot. food was also tasty too but DEF CANNOT BEAT THAT VIEW!!! .. oh yeah and theres beer :D
