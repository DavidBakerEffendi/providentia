totally a nice place for dates, friends hangout, etc! i love seeing the brick oven as I walked to be seated near the entrance. shared wedge salad with blue cheese and walnuts.  a little too much olive oil for me and I wished the walnuts were in bigger chunks. clam pizza was yum.  a little soggy in the middle but the crust was thin and chewy.  A little burnt, but that was probably the purpose of the brick oven.   good service, good vibe, nice neighborhood!
