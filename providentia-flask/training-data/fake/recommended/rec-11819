This might be one of my favorite brunch places, if not my favorite brunch place, in the whole city. I came here for brunch, and the corned beef hash is amazing. Potatoes confit, actual pieces of melt-in-your-mouth brisket, and perfectly seasoned poached eggs make this dish well worth the $15. My friend had the scrambled eggs with bacon, and they were quite tasty too (the scrambled eggs verge on watery, but not really). The coffee seltzer was kind of interesting - if you mix it fully, the taste comes out with a seltzer beginning and an aftertaste of coffee that's quite refreshing, albeit different. Our wait was about 10 minutes on a Saturday at 12:45, and it had thinned out by the time we finished brunch at 2:00. Note that it's kind of loud in here because all the tables are so close together, and you're better off the less people you have with you.
