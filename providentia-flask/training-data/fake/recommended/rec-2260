Sweet mystery of life at last I've found you! This is the best pizza served anywhere.   I recommend being a purist about it.  Lg pepperoni, carafe of house wine(only 16$!), and cannoli for desert.   You can't go wrong.  This place made us fall in love with brooklyn period. MUST TRY if you're in new york.
