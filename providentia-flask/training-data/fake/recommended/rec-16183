Owned by the same people at Song, I expected good cheap food and that's exactly what I got.  Joya has a nicer atmosphere than Song but the food is just as good.  My friends and I shared bottles of Riesling and Pinot Blanc - and for bottles that were $22 and $23, they were great!  We started with the summer rolls (I've had better) and I had the Pad Thai with shrimp.  There were a lot of shrimp in the dish and they were fresh and nicely cooked.  The Pad Thai had a little too much garlic but overall it was really tasty and I love that they serve everything with lemon wedges - great touch.
