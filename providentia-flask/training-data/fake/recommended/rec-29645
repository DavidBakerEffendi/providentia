This place is one of the best Portuguese restaurants ever! The bread and olives were superior. The clam appetizer for $10 was out if this world and a fantastic deal. The seafood entrees were mouthwatering. Felt like I was really in a small town in the middle of Portugal. Go out of your way to eat at Valencia, perfect stop near NJ turnpike en route to NYC.
