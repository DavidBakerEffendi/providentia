Mushroom dip is in town and I sure like it.  Ask for a free sample and no one would say no to you.  Came back here again with my boyfriend to get the small Belgian waffle fries with one dipping.  Can you guess which one we order this time?  Way too many for you to guess and way too many for us to pick so we picked the most common one and it is ...  cheddar cheese.  We both like the mushroom dip more but it is ok because there will always be next time to order mushroom dip with their very tasty and delicious fries.  How can I say no to fries when I like potatoes too much?
