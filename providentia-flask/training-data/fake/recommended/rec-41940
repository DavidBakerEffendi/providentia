I had the tasting menu, 'The Turista' which is not only ridiculously incredible value.....but an authentic Italian experience.  I started with the braised snails in a fig reduction. My pasta course was a rabbit ravioli and my main course was an amazing veal special with which I only needed a fork to eat.  Chocolate-pistachio semi-fredo for dessert....An awesome BYOB.
