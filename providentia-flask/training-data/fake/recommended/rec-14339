I've finally found it. The perfect $5 sandwich. I thought that having a sandwich for lunch every day was a luxury I would never be able to afford, except for maybe if I was willing to stoop to sketchy corner delis pushing old vegetables and Boar's Head garbage. Normally the tradeoff with the cheap Banh Mi is that it's gamey and smelly, and comes with low-quality ingredients. Couldn't be further from the truth in reference to this place. I absolutely love every part of it, crisp fresh vegetables and tender meat on a huge toasted hero roll. Doesn't get any better than this.
