This is one special place. I came here in July 2013 for an intimate birthday dinner with my loved ones. Lets talk food first - we could not decide what to order so our lovely waiter suggested the tasting menu. Unlike other tasting menus, this was unpretentious, the servings were huge and each course came with all different flavors. It was great value & definitely the way to go for a group. Next, the service was the best I've had in the city. From the sommelier to each waiter we encountered, everyone was friendly and knowledgable of their menu. All in all, amazing restaurant with a fantastic ambiance & service.
