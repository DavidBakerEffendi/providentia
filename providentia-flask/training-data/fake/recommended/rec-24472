We found this place on Yelp, and had high hopes due to the good reviews. So on one weekend afternoon, we ventured all the way out to Williamsburg to have lunch here. We ordered the scallop appetizer, uni on salmon, sashimi platter, pork belly and party bomb. The quality and taste of the food that we received was not impressive. They do get some points for being creative, but it seemed that they did that at the expense of taste. The pork belly and party bomb were particularly disappointing, as those were both highly recommended items based on reviews. We were left scratching our heads as to why others gave such high ratings. Â  The sashimi quality is average and the cooked food was also not memorable. The portion sizes were also very small even and overall it doesn't seem that what we received was worth the price that is being charged.
