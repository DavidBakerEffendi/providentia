As a big fan of Thai food, I like Room Service a lot. Some of the top drunken noodles I've had in the city. Some are too spicy, others not spicy enough, but these are perfect. Go for the lunch special and get some veggie dumplings with it! Sidenote - I had no idea what to expect the first time I went. A name like Room Service? Chandeliers upon entering? Nifty little joint...
