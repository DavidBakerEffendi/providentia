I had several co workers in town tonight and wanted to try to bring them to a real authentic "Jersey Style" Italian establishment.  From the moment I walked in I knew I picked the right place! They handled a group of 10 without any issue, service was prompt and courteous.   The appetizers were very different, but excellent at the same time.   Meals were of true Italian flavor.  Everything was excellent.   I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for good food, in a nice atmosphere with casual attire in mind!!
