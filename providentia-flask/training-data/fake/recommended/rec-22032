One of my goals for my trip to Philadelphia was to visit Reading Terminal.  The place is filled with great options for food. I was leaning towards the southern food so it was either the fried chicken place (Deliah?) or the Cajun Cafe.  I  have been to New Orleans a couple of times, so I decided to try the Cajun Cafe to see how the food matched up.  The oyster po boy was great.  The oysters were friend nicely, not too greasy.  The mayo, pickles, and tomato were in good balance.  The bread had a nice chewiness to it as well.  I really enjoyed the Po Boy; it brought back some memories of New Orleans (pre-Katrina).  I also had an order of the Jambalaya (just cooked within an hour) and brought it back to the hotel.  There was a nice spiciness which was not overpowering. jambalaya
