My fiancee and I had a BLT lobster roll and a regular lobster roll. Fries are fries and drinks are drinks, so I'm going to just review based upon what this place is known for. Basically to get one slice of bacon on your lobster roll it costs you $2, which I don't think is worth it. The only other gripe is that you get so much lobster on the roll that it is tough to eat - this isn't really a gripe, it's amazing. I wish the roll was a bit more substantial so that it could better hold the glory inside. Great place to visit if you're in the area, but I'm not sure the next time I'd make the trip.
