I love that there is a great restaurant I can take my kids to that isn't the Cheesecake Factory-- it's not even a fair comparison. Buttermilk Channel was truly wonderful. The service was phenomenal and the fried chicken and waffles... Drool... I got the steak special of the night, which wasn't that great but the fried chicken and the radicchio salad really was unlike anything I've had before. We actually got the fried chicken for my husband and an order of the kids' fried chicken. The kids meal came out first and it was less saltier but the chicken was juicy and perfect. We paired it with broccoli for my very picky toddler son but he wiped the plate clean. And, the strawberry ice cream for the kids came with a cone as a hat and two m and ms for eyes. It was really delightful. As for the pecan pie sundae, it was really very sweet and it was just too much for three of us. All in all, a lovely night and a great meal. We have been raving about it to all our friends!
