After seeing a review for best burgers in NJ. My and my love went to check out Krug's Tavern in Newark NJ. Walked into a crowed front bar on right with high tables on left walked on more to the back room where there was larger tables and 3 Huge tvs (looks like 2 45" and 1 65") all with the game on. Ordered a cheese burger and fries med well. And a Corona. She brought me a wonderful super cold beer which was extremely refreshing. When burger came it first looked like it was on the burnt side but gave it a shot.  To my surprise it was PERFECTLY cooked, juicy and simply delicious. The fries were lithely golden brown Streak fries. Yum!  My conclusion was the prices were right on and the food is totally worth the ride to get a perfect burger. I totally recommend the food!
