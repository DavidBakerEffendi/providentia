Having gone to high school very nearby to here *ahem Port Richmond in the house!*, I got used to coming to this deli every morning for breakfast and afternoon for lunch. I'm a big fan of the BLT, shrimp parmigiana, and the occasional roast beef too, which is pretty bangin with onions and the black deliciousness on the side, which I've seriously considered drinking. The place does get crowded, especially in the mornings from 7 to 9, and afternoons from 1 to 4. I just take that as a testament to how good it is.
