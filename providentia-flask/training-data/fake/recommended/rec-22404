I went to Mickey's during happy hour on a Thursday.  The place was really crowded filled with a lot of old men.  The service was good however I ordered a paella dinner to go.  This is a Spanish dish with, chicken, chorizo sausage, and shrimp combine with rice simmered in broth.  This meal cost $45.00 b/c its made for two.  I took the meal home and the shrimps were bad.  I could smell it the minute I opened the container and once I tasted it that was the confirmation.  I tried to pick all the shrimps out and eat the remaining food but couldn't do it.  Now it's just sitting in my refridge.  If I try to take it back I'm sure they are going to find some way to blame me.  What a waste of my money.
