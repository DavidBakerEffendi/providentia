The Veggie burger is claimed to be the best in the world.  I've had better but it is pretty damn good.  During happy hour it was only $5 with a side of fries.   Beer selection was fantastic and the prices were pretty good being that the bar is in Olde City. The barkeep was super chill and I plan on going back anytime I am in Olde City.
