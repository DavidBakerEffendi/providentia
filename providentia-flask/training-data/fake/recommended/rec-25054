I am VERY happy to say that Fare has redeemed itself many times over.  They have worked out their service issues and have developed a cocktail menu that makes me melt.  Let's take a second to talk about their very clean martini.....BEST.MARTINI.EVER, and it's only 2 ingredients.  I don't know if the magical ingredient is fairy dust or a little bitta love from the bartenders, but it never fails to be delish!  Way to go Fare; I am a super fan :)
