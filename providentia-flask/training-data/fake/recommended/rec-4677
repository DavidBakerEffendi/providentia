Attention, Cali friends.  Good Mexican food does exist in the Northeast!   I was introduced to Baja's a couple of months ago by foodie friends who loved the place.  I had the rolled taco and enchilada combo.  I was pleased, but not ecstatic.  I was mostly in love with the margarita and the salsa selection, all were full of flavor. Suggestion: small bowls for the salsa for the table to share instead of awkward plates that make all my salsas mix together.  Please? Round 2: I went for the carnitas.  They were exactly what I was hoping for...tender, well-seasoned, perfect serving size.  The rice and beans were better than I recall from the first time.  Friend got the Chile Verde plate and we were in love with that, too.  The green chile sauce was superb.   Mr. Manager was quite pleased with himself, and deservedly so.  After he learned that we were well-versed in the ways of Mexican food, he still guaranteed that we would not be disappointed. How right he was. :)
