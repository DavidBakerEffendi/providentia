I was here last night, a Weds night and we had a 10 min wait- no res made. It was very crowded and I sat in a very uncomfortable metal and leather chair that was pretty short and I felt like a kid with my date. The food is good.  To start we got the peanut chicken scewars and lemon grass soup that was yummy. He had Chicken Basil with noodles and I had the Red Curry veg style. It was not too spicy and came with a side of white rice. I felt a little like our waiter was rushing us out the door.  Prolly cause they were busy.
