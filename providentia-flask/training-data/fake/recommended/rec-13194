First and foremost, I would like to say for $6 and the AMOUNT of food you get is truly amazing. I would not say its the BEST quality/taste of chicken, rice, and/or lamb. Only reason why I'm giving it a 4 star and not a 3 star is because of QUANTITY. Lets be honest, half of us that go there is usually late night after a party. Is the line worth the wait? Hell YEAH when you're drunk! LOL White sauce... best tasting white sauce? I dont think so. Is it good? OH YEAH. But I'm sure if I go down the next street and order a combo, I would be satisfy as well.
