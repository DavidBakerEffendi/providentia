I'm in Love with Ilili!  I just loved this place.  Our waiter was friendly and attentive and took the extra step to bring us a wine sample when we were trying to decide on a bottle. We dined here for restaurant week.  Restaurant week is when we try out new spots because its so much easier since most restaurants have great combinations ready for selecting. The amount of food and quality of food was phenomenal n the restaurant week menu. My favorites were the Phenocian fries, the hummus, calamari, the chicken skewers, and the Lebanese wine. We weren't big fans of the traditional dessert and the smokey baba ganoush but couldn't stop raving over the honey pastry and everything else that we had.   We left being the biggest fans. When we arived we were greated and treated amazingly well by the hosting staff. They were fantastic about remembering our names and helping us with checking our coats in. When the rest of our party arrived we were seated immediately.  The restaurant is a great size with a nicely sized lounge area in the front. I have nothing but rave reviews for all aspects of a wonderful evening at Ilili.
