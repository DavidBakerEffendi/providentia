I came here with my sistah friends for brunch. It was AHMAYZING!! The drink I had was tasty. The eggs were nice, fluffy n cheesy. But the grits are absolutely the BEST I have EVER had in a long time. The fried chicken was very juicy. It was good, but I'm also good with not having that when I return again. I highly recommend this place. I would love to try the place out for dinner.
