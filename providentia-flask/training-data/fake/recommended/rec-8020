As a big fan of Jet Wine Bar, I've been eagerly awaiting their new restaurant, Rex 1516. They had a few delays which only added to the anticipation, but, Rex 1516 lives up to expectations. We've been there twice in the short time they've been open. Once for dinner and once for drinks. The night we went to dinner was just a couple nights after they opened and they did not yet have their full bar, so they offered two complimentary glasses of wine. Coming from the same people who run Jet, the wine was quite good, definitely not your First Friday plastic cup Chardonnay kind of free. We were curious about many of their southern influenced offerings, so instead of my partner and I each ordering an entree, we opted to select a few of the appetizers so that we could try more. We started by sharing the fig bruschetta and the arugula and roasted pear salad. They had a special duck soup which we split and ended with the mac 'n' cheese. Everything was absolutely delicious. Can't wait to go back and try more. We stopped by for a couple of drinks on a Friday night. It was pleasantly not crowded, although that won't last long as word spreads about how excellent everything is. The bar tends toward variations of classic cocktails. They have a small but nice draft and bottled beer selection and, of course, an excellent selection of wines. I had a perfect Sazerac and an excellent old fashion. The bar is dark and elegant with a very inviting couch along the back wall. The staff have been all very nice and incredibly welcoming. Between Rex 1516 and Jet Wine Bar, I don't know if I'm ever leaving that block of South Street!
