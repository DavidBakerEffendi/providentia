The food is very good and my 3 stars are mostly a reflection of price/value than anything else.  We ate there two nights ago.  We had the burger, flounder, lobster Mac and cheese, short rib and crab cake.    Burger was great as was the short rib.  The flounder was good.  Crab cake was average.  The lobster Mac and cheese was way way too rich and a little soupy for my taste.   The desserts ( chocolate torte and cheesecake) were a bit disappointing.  Perhaps my expectations were too high,    Service was stellar and the decor nice.   I'll probably go again but in the summer when the gorgeous patio is open.   I can only justify spending $200 for 2 (wine was BYO) on special occasions.
