For what they offer they are really good. We had mahi curry and creamy soup. Both tasty delicious. They have few tables . Most people take out. They has this Brooklyn hipster vibe and food philosophy in the place and the food. Most foods even in places that advertise themselves as healthy taste taste to some degree unhealthy salty. No exception here! I find the food a bit salty. Above what level of being considered healthy. But it could be just me. If you want a quick fix of reliable, not over priced food in there area with no frills , this is the place.
