Went here for a date and was pleasantly surprised that even though I was going in with high expectations, this restaurant exceeded them all.   First & foremost do yourself a favor and stop by the wine and liquor store less than 2 blocks away as this establishment is BYOB. It was a Saturday night and busy still even at 9pm however the host greeted us immediately and checked in with us 10 mins later to tell us our table was being cleaned for us to be seated Waitress came immediately and explained their menu with ease and pointed out what specials people were enjoying and was extremely helpful with choosing appetizers and answering questions about the menu Appetizers and entrees came out quickly and tasted amazing. We had the seafood Guacamole martini for appetizer.  For entrees we had the Chilean sea bass, and the Habilbut fish with Garlic lobster meat - both were delicious and came with choice of sides. For desert we had the Vanilla sea salt and caramel Ice cream (which they get from The Bent Spoon) which was also quite tasty and topped off a great meal. I would definitely come back here again to try out other entrees when I am back in the area Tip- make reservations early! For a weekend at least early morning of or a few days prior for a prime time reservation.
