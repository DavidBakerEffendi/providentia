I had dinner here last night with my girlfriend. We had the mixed chicken/shrimp dumplings and the chicken satay, which were delicious, especially the dumplings... really top-quality! Then I had the house pad-thai and she had something spicy (a thai-named entree at the beginning of the Bangkok-style entrees page... I can't recall it exactly). The noodles of the pad-thai were tasty, but the seafood they go so proud about on their menu was tasteless; the giant shrimps were totally bland. My girlfriend's entree was ok, but she wasn't impressed either. The service was standard. I didn't feel particularly welcomed, probably because the place is very crowded, and they tend to rush you. Nevertheless they were polite and professional, so I don't have any complain. I found the price to be very good for the appetizers we selected, as the quality was impeccable. But the entrees were a bit overpriced for what we got. You can get better thai food elsewhere for less. One warning. If you get seated in the entrance room (where the bar is), prepare yourself for some serious cold. We had to keep our coats on the whole time because every time that door opens, there's nothing that prevents the cold air from coming in. The thick curtain they keep does very little to keep you warm. I think it's time to do something about it. The place is cute, but try to go to the back room, which is much more romantic (and warm).
