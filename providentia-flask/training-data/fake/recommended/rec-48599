We came here on a not so busy night for drinks a few weeks ago. While my drink was pretty weak, the atmosphere of the place was really cool. Our table had little gizmos to entertain yourself while you waited, the lounge couches were cool, and the exterior windows had ridiculous paper mâché monsters outside.
