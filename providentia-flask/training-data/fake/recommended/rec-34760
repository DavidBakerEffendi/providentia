Tony's has the best Pizza in Wayne.  I am not sure why everyone else in town makes it greasy or tasteless in the land of pizza, but Tony's gets it right every time. We mostly get takeout or delivery, and they always get the order right.  Pizza is great, and the meals are all way better than pizzeria food.  Tony's is a very good choice for a casual family restaurant IF its not too crowded.  It gets packed on Friday and Saturday nights.
