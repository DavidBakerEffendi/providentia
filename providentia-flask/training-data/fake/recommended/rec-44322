Came here with a friend then other night and was so happy with everything!! We shared a few rounds of appetizers and each was better than the last. The meatballs with yogurt sauce and pita was by far my favorite. The octopus was so fresh. We shared the tuna which was cooked perfectly, I loved the saltiness that the olives gave it.
