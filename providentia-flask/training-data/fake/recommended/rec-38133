Iraqi turkey. Roman portabella (with added avocado). Jamaican avocado (with added bacon!). These are a few of my favorite things. Four Corners provides the tastiest, most creative sandwiches in Chittenden County, if not all of New England (though I must confess I haven't been to every sandwich shop in New England.) Yes, they are small, and only take cash, and on a busy day at noon, you could find yourself waiting upwards of a half hour for a sandwich. Calling ahead makes it easier on days like this. Sometimes, however, you might be the only person in there, and won't have very long to wait, so ultimately it's a gamble. Â Some might say the sandwiches are a little pricey, but I find that the bread alone is worth the price, not to mention the quality of the ingredients. After a renovation which removed much of the eclectic clutter around the place (I actually find myself missing the happy meal toys, Disney characters and weird antiques that used to deck the walls), Four Corners has more seating than before and they now offer wine and a limited selection of draught beers (including Trapp Lager, a Vermont gem.) Well done, Four Corners, well done. Just go there. Get the Iraqi Turkey. It's faaaaantastic.
