Great Portuguese menu at very affordable price points. Visited on two separate occasions. First visit I ordered simple side of red beans and rice. Watermelon for desert. Total price with tax $5.39. The dish was prepared well, good ratio of beans and rice seasoned well enough to compete with some very good NOLA recipes. Â Next visit I ordered half grilled chicken, salad, rice and black beans; price $11.24 with tax. Needless to say it was to much for one sitting and took half of it home. The price also included ample helping of bread. With out a doubt I will be back to try some of the other dishes on the menu.
