I was there for Chinese New Year and waited 30+minutes in line for a table just for the Soup Dumplings. They weren't worth my wait and they wouldn't have been worth it if I hadn't waited. They don't remind me of the soup dumplings I had Shanghai. They came hot to the table but by the time I ate my second one they were cold. The soup inside tasted of water with barely a hint of meat flavor. I felt lied to after reading all the good reviews. I can only assume these people haven't actually been to Shanghai or Chinese and are happy with poor Americanized foods. I will say the service was fast but they served in no real order. I am positive they would have serve desert Â first had I ordered it with my regular order because they could plate it before they steamed the dumpling. The menu is unoriginal. The menu could be found at any "Asian restaurant" and for a place touting it's Shanghai foods the soup dumplings were the only thing from the region that I saw. The prices were laughable for what you get. They have padded their prices to get the highest possible profit margins. If any of the 6 dishes I had were good, I could see paying these ridiculous prices but they were standard Asian. No soul, No character, Nothing but service that wants to move tables. To say one positive thing, the place looks greats. You might as well save the trip and go to your local Chinese take away. And if you live in Chinatown go to any of the other places.
