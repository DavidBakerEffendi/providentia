I'm so glad I found this place looking for sushi in the LES. Not your typical fancy super high profile fine dining sushi restaurant. It's rather casual and cater to more reasonable prices to the local customers. I came here the first time for happy hour from 3pm to 7pm (even on weekends) and I was amazed with all the options I had. They had a full menu of items that offered cooked kitchen apps and fresh sushi. The happy hour menu was such a steal I had to admit I ordered mostly from there including thai spring rolls, dumplings, fried rice, simple rolls like eel with avocado, salmon with avacado all for $3.50 each!!! The quality was up to par with most sushi places, but the prices unbeatable. Beer, wine and sake was also $3.50 each!! Â I was so full I couldn't appreciate all the other fancy rolls and sashimi apps they offered at the full dinner menu. I'm already planning my next visit there to give the rest of their menu a try.
