Yeah, right, like there was ever a chance this place was getting less than five stars. Um, excellent downstairs layout (booths, tables, bar tables, bar AND pool tables)?  Check. Fun looking waitresses?  Check. Ahmahzing live booking?  Check.  (Even though I've never ventured upstairs yet.) A photobooth?  Check. Yummy foodtowns?  Check. Outdoor seating?  Check. Totally deck jukebox ("deck" is totally a thing)?  Check. Constant presence of my number one fake boyfrond?  Check plus! Did I miss anything?  Probably, but I guarantee they get checks on that too.   Oh yeah, plus this is where I realized what my purpose in life is...
