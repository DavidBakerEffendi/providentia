Three years ago, I would've raved about this place. However, they have recently started slipping off. The place is always packed, and the waiters make sure to rush the plates off your table so they could pack the place further. The rice balls, which used to be amazing, came out semi frozen in the middle. The prices have gone up drastically for sub-par food. If you get seated in the main dining room, be prepared to be on top of the other guests sitting next to you. One of their special appetizers  ($14.99) !!! came out with gamey, overripe tomatoes, and a piece of burrata half the size of my palm. Unfortunately, this place has gotten too big for its own good, everything is rushed,  and the quality of the food and atmosphere has suffered dramatically. Which really makes me sad, this used to be an amazing, family run authentic Italian restaurant.
