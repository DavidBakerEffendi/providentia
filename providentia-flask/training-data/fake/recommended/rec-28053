This place just does not seem to be serious about serving cask conditioned beer despite being a craft beer bar that has advertised itself as serving cask.  Over the past year or more I have dropped in here many times only to find their handpump once again dry and no cask ale available (I left).  If you are in this neighborhood and want cask ale I suggest going three blocks north to The Gingerman which always has one and often two excellent handpumped cask conditioned beers.  I wish Rattle'n'hum would properly cater to the growing devotees of real ale.
