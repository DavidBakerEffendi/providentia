The restaurant is look authentic and classy and this place get very crowded at dinner time. You need to prepare for the waiting time especially on weekend night it will be like 30-45 mins from my experience . The food was delicious, my favorite is plato don. Service is great, their staff very friendly. The only one thing that I don't like is their table are too close together. :(
