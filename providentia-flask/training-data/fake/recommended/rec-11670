Great neighborhood bar that's got a great mix of music, decor, and unique cocktails. The friendly staff and laid back atmosphere make you feel like you've been coming there for years, even if it's your first time. The bartenders/waiters really know the drinks inside and out and have always been helpful in finding something that suits my mood. Past reviews have pointed out the happy hour special (2 cocktails for $10), so I'll just second that. One major perk - this is one of the only late-night dining options in the area, especially on the weekend (kitchen open until 2:00 AM!). I ordered the burger for takeout for a late-night dinner and it was pretty legit.
