Great atmosphere for brunch after a long night of drinking. Dark, sparsely decorated, old and new fixtures. Food was really fresh. I was extremely pleased with the veggie burger. It was the best veggie burger I've ever eaten. Nice array of fixings for the Bloody Mary bar. Husband was pleased with the pollo taco. Great place for tourists on a Saturday!
