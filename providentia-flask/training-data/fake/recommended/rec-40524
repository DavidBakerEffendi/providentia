Seemed like a decent enough place while in town for business. I was interested in the Reuben but didn't come across any reviews, glad I tried this one. Most places make below average versions with either too much flavorless meat or not enough sauce, sauerkraut and soggy bread. Everything was good about this reuben from the crunchy rye bread to the cheese, possibly the best I've had. Although it was enough for me the serving of coleslaw was quite small.
