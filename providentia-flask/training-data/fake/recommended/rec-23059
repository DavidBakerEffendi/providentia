What a wonderful addition to Princeton's restaurant scene!  We went there a couple weeks ago on my husband's birthday.  A lot of restaurants in this region are either trying to be slick and modern, or have that old, stodgy, colonial feel.  Peacock Inn has found a really happy medium, in terms of food, service, and decor.  The rooms are cozy, with comfy furniture but an updated feel.   The food is similarly cozy-but-updated.  My husband the traditionalist wavered between choosing steak or lobster, and ended up choosing lobster which he really enjoyed.  I had the short ribs which were really nicely done.  The lamb carpaccio starter was also great---unique in flavor, with a slightly spicy sauce and salad on top.   When I made the reservation online, I simply wrote in the comment box that it would be my husband's birthday.  That was enough that (without any further reminders) his dessert came out with a candle and "happy birthday" written on the plate.  It was a great touch. Overall, this was our nicest evening of dining in Princeton in quite some time.  I think this will become our go-to spot for special meals.
