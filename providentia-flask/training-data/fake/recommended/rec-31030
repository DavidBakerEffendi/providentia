Every time I watch some travel channel show that lists Pats as "The" place to go in Philadelphia to get a cheesesteak, wait.... let me re-phrase that, to get the best cheesesteak, I want to laugh. I remember the first time I ever had one. My father took me there when I was 14. Even at that young age I knew that this was something greasy and disgusting. The only reason I choked it down and smiled is because my dad thought that he was doing something really nice for me. So, ok it's been a lot of years since then and since my husband and I just happened to be in the area we thought, well why not. My best advice is, don't go. Save yourself and just don't do it. It's actually worse than I remember it.
