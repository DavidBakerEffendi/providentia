Nice romantic ambiance, mouth-watering aromas of freshly made crepes, lots of options (vegetarian, meat, fish, sweet options)... they don't skimp on fillings. Prices are acceptable ($8-13), especially considering FiDi location. I liked their tea selection that comes in a big metallic pot ($6.50 for two). Black currant juice was too sweet and came in a rather small glass, so I won't be getting that again. You might feel a bit cramped if place gets crowded, but for late Tue night there were only two tables taken. Also, it was kind of amusing to hear two waitresses loudly converse in Russian. I guess I just kind of assumed that Nordic place will not 'outsource' their staff. But service was prompt and courteous, so no reasons to complain.
