Had my birthday date here. I heard all the hype beforehand and tried to go into this place with zero expectations. The place, overall, was great! The staff was friendly and the decor/atmosphere add to the cool feel of the restaurant. Everything I ate was delicious - pork buns and kim chi fried rice and dumplings. All good and I was hungry! This is a great place for a date or special occassion. The food was slightly overpriced (great food but not the best I ever had), but you pay for the ambience.
