Market Table is AMAZING!!!! Can you say fresh?! I feel like there is a farm in the back that they quickly pick the ingredients from after you order.  First of all I love this atmosphere.  It is covered with plants and flowers on the outside.  The inside is bright, clean and crisp.  Very into it.   Mom and I ordered two glasses of rose (a pinot noir actually) It was so good, so light and fruity.  The best rose I've ever had.  Ordered the market salad and the roasted chicken.  Felt like 5 minutes later our dishes came out.  Fresh from the cob corn was on both our dishes and it was crispy, sweet and fresh, loved it.  The market salad was light but fulfilling.  The chicken was moist and a great portion for lunch.   I cannot wait to come back to this place.  There were a number of items on the menu that sounded great and I'm interested to take a peak at the dinner menu and different seasonal items.   A safe bet if you love veggies.  Also a safe bet if you don't ;)
