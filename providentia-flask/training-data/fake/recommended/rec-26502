Woorijip is a good cheap place to eat when you're tired of all the other asian food available you always eat like chinese, viet , or japanese. It's a korean buffet sorta thing and the place usually get packed around weekends or fridays. The place is clean...sorta( will get in to details) Â and the price for the buffet is fantastic at around 7.00 per pound. The place sells alcohol and mostly people go there to just drink and hang around. The only thing about this place that could be negative in anyway is probably the limited seatings and its more like a high school cafeteria thing where everyone conversant loudly. My experience with cleanness detail: The only reason about this place that I didn't rate it a five star is because the mustard from the hot food side is really dirty. Im not sure if it was just me but I found a little tiny worm on my food that I almost ate. As nasty as it sound it was there and I played xD around it before confirming it lol so yeah. I will be going back however but not for a while till I get the thought out of my mind. But overall , give this place a try. Its the only cheap and legit korean place you can enjoy if you're on a budget.
