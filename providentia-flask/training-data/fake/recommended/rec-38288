As a long-time Manhattanite I'm spoiled for choice--good choice.  So when I spend my daily grind working in Verona, I understand that my lunch-time choices are somewhat limited to Subway, some great pizza joints and a couple of local delis.  How surprised was I, then, to stumble upon Kate's.  The menu is inventive but accessible, in other words, you don't have to be a foodie to understand it but it's a world away from your Boar's Head and Swiss or chicken parm.  The bread, too, is outstanding: fresh, crispy baguettes; real herb focaccia.  And I have to admit that on occasion I've succumbed to the temptation of one of the several ready-made entrees to take home for dinner.  I'm not a big Yelp! poster but this one deserves it.  It's the real deal and I am a fan.
