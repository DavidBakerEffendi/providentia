I went to Bogota because I saw on the BAM website that Bogota offered free mojitos with the purchase of an entree for BAM members (usually $8). Excited, I brought a group of five friends and we had a fun time for dinner. The management was really nice about giving us the discount, though they told me they no longer participate with BAM. I was disappointed to learn that, and therefore probably won't be back, even though the food was perfectly tasty. I hope they will reconsider some sort of partnership with BAM as a way to encourage people in the neighborhood to support a great institution, and a way to lure members in the door.
