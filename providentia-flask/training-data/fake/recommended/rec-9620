Grimaldi's is a fucking tourist trap!  I spent 3 hrs in line, and another hour after sitting down until I got my pizza.  The waiting room upstairs is so damn depressing and it feels like you're in an apocalypse movie where you're in some waiting area hoping your name gets called to get on the ship out of earth before it implodes.  Oh, and the guy calling names gives NO SHITS and gives about 2 seconds after calling a name before crossing it off the list forever.  It's the 21st century, let's get some electronic queue system so it's all more fair and transparent? Pizza was great, but damn, I want my 5 hrs of life back.  If you really need it, I would go to another "Grimaldi's" location in manhattan or hoboken.
