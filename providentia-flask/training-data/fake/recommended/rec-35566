Couldn't ask for better food, service or ambiance. Small place which makes it much more exclusive. The Chef was very nice and the staff was very helpful with explaining each dish on the menu. I expected to be shuffled out because its such a small place and they'd want the table but I was there for a good 3 hours and was more than welcome to stay as long as I wanted. I brought a bottle of wine which was great. They kept my wine chilled and didn't charge a corking fee. My date was very impressed and so was I.
