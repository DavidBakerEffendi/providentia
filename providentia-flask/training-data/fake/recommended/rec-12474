One of my favorite eateries in New York. My friend and I got the Mixed Chicken and Gyro Over Rice with White Sauce. The combination was extremely flavorful and delicious. During my visit in New York, I wanted to go back for a second time which is very unlike me since I love to eat at new places when visiting new cities. But unfortunately, we didn't have enough time. So now I'm just dreaming about it at home...
