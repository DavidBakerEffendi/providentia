I love that the plates are all meant to be shared. The pink peppercorn cashew "cheese" was delicious, and the avocado crabcakes were the best crabcakes I've ever had. Unfortunately the other dishes were lackluster - veer far away from the chicken meatballs and the overly salted swiss chard. It was tough to get ahold of our server. Â It may simply have been a bad day; the waitress at the next table sounded chipper and informative. Fare touts its sustainable / grass-fed / organic / local cuisine, but not everything lives up to the fanFare. (rim shot)
