The place is a dive bar. The floors are cracked and the bathrooms don't close. Amongst all it's aesthetic flaws, it's a diamond in the rough. The place is run by a family who is personable and accommodating. The food is beyond amazing, everything is made at the time of order, no frozen food here. There are two pool tables, darts, and a mega touch. The vibe is country folk but the people are very friendly. It's hard to find at first if you trust google maps but once you do, you won't be disappointed. Stop by here any night, grab a cheesesteak, quesadilla, or anything for that matter because everything is delicious. They also have carry out if you need somewhere late to pick up. By far the most pleasantly surprising bar/restaurant I've ever been to, a must try for all.
