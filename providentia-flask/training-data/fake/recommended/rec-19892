AMAZING! I love the french toast. I'll admit Beyonce brought me here. But when the queen Bey loves it why would't I? I love love love the french toast I can't say that enough. Every time I try and venture off and try something new I always end up back to the french toast. Its just wonderful, m mouth is watering thinking about it. The pecan bourbon sauce is just divine. I'll take a side of bacon and house made pickles on the side, odd I know but it work. Just the right amount of saltiness to balance out the sweet decadence from the french toast.
