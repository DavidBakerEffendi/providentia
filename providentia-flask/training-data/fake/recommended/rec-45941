I frequently travel to the Middle East and North Africa for work and this place is as close to authentic as you're going to get! The vegetables are extremely fresh and all the meat is organic, purchased from local farmers and hand-cut in the on-location halal meat market in the back. To add to the great quality of food, the customer-service is A+ and a perfect garnish to the experience. I highly recommend this family-owned business. Once you try it, I guarantee you'll be back!
