I loved this place. The Dirty Pickle Martini was outstanding: vinegary-tartness with just the right amount of bite from those fantastic McClure's Pickles. The Dark 'n Stormy was soooo nice and gingery without being too sweet. I really liked the Spicy Cherry Margarita too: spicy (but not too much so) from the habanero-infused tequila and again, just the right amount of sweetness. I also had a Cucumber Collins with vodka instead of gin which was equally pleasing; refreshing and lightly sweet. All of these were potentially dangerous in how completely tasty they were without tasting a bit like alcohol. I liked some of the old-timey glassware as well. The Beer-Battered Fried McClure's Brooklyn Pickles were fantastic: fluffy-doughy batter with tart-hot pickle with a sort-of remoulade dipping sauce. Mac & Cheese was deliciously cheesy with Irish cheddar, muenster, and gruyere; not runny, and actually had macaroni (not substituted with shells or ziti whatever, which irks me for some reason). Nice and dark, with outdoor seating in the back. Hipsterish, but not too aggressively so. This place made me miss living in NY a LOT.
