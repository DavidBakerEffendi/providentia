My husband and I stopped here between a bus tour to get a drink. They had a prohibition type feel to it, which was really cool. The drinks were really well priced, a lot cheaper then all the other places we visited. The bartender was really funny and joked with us, which I really liked. Our stay was short there but I would definitely go back.
