I really wanted to like this place more than I actually did. Will give it a while to iron out the kinks and then try again. The most critical component should be the burger. And it was good but not great. Patty was thicker than Five Guys but not as large as Farmhouse, prob around 6 oz. All our parties' were slightly overdone, with zero red in it despite ordering medium doneness. Meat was moist but not especially tasty. Toppings were good, brioche bun was good but my wife's was cold to the touch. Prices were between $11-17 depending on toppings. Other Cons: - Slow service: we arrived at 11:45am with the place basically empty, but still waited about 20min for our food. - Uneven service: one burger was supposed to be plain, but had cheese on it; one dish of fries was cold Pros: - Good fries. We had a variety of orders, all were a good balance of crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Be forewarned the truffle fries have spicy chili flakes. - Good draft beer list - Facility was sleek, open and clean - Staff was friendly It's right next to the movie theater, so I anticipate that Friday dinner and Saturday lunch & dinner it will be packed. I wanted to like it more, and I think we will go back and try again. But if you're going to make your burger the centerpiece of your restaurant, it better be a great burger. As of today, I'd still choose the Farmhouse burger any day.
