While the service was good & fast, I was appalled by the price of the grilled shrimp salad & the incredibly mediocre quality of this $17 dish.  The salad dressing was wayyyy too salty (come on!!!  Too much salt is such a rooky move!!!) and the shrimp tasted like nothing... basically like salt & grill taste.  Its ONLY saving grace was that there was ample tasteless shrimp on the plate. But I mean, lettuce, capers, a couple of tomato halves, and shrimp. So lame. Save your money, and if you want a better fish/salad, you can hop across the street to Miss Lilly's for a decent snapper over salad.
