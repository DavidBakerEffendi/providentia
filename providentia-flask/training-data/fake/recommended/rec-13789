I don't have much else to add to what's already been written. Â We ordered the homemade biscuit (which actually was quite tasty even though it looks really dry. The raspberry preserves were very good, not too sweet), the sugar cured bacon (omg, the highlight for me, it was like a plate of bacon candy) and the blueberry pancakes. The pancakes are as good as everyone says they are - they are fluffy, light and the maple butter is what makes them what they are. The blueberries and the blueberry syrup on top is a little sketchy because i think they used frozen blueberries. Still good but I think they might be that much better had fresh berries been used. We didn't wait as we went during the week. Overall good but a 1-2 hour wait just isn't worth it.
