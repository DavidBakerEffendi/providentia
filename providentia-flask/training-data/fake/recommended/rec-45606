You'll wait, but it will be well worth it.  This place has so many delicious breakfast options.  I'd go something with eggs for your order so you can opt for the biscuit rather than toast.  It's amazing.  Even better is to go with someone who likes to share and have them order pancakes so you can have the best of both worlds.  Good coffee in cool metal mugs.  Great energetic atmosphere.  Not a quiet relaxing spot.  This isn't your grandma's diner.
