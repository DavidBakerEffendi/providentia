Came here today in hopes of having a really bomb ass cubano and I must say I was decently satisfied... After watching that damn movie, Chef, I've been craving a damn cubano!!! Legit on a mission to find that crispity, crunchety, buttery bread with all tha works inside... The cubano I had here was so good I was throughly pleased.. I've read that some do not like the sandwich but it was good! (Trust me, I'm half Puerto Rican) delish. Only downfall was the sandwich could have been bigger... It was 9$ like really? In PR or any authentic place that has these gem sandwiches sells them for like 4-7$... I mean I guess it's nyc .. Fiance had the pernil with the twist sandwich he inhaled that in like two seconds... Interesting it had sweet plantains inside of the sandwich .. How creatively tasty that was.. 2 sandwiches and an empanada $20 ...
