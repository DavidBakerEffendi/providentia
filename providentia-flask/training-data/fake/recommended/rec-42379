Sadly, instead of improving, Athena's has gone in the other direction.  Still no drinks available other than tap water.  Only one employee was working when I returned for my second visit, and he was working as both the waiter and the cook.  I ordered a gyro and noticed that the rotisserie seemed to be off, so I asked about it and was told they would heat it up. It's unfortunate.  I really liked this place when they opened.
