This is probably the better buffet I've eaten at since I got here a little over a week ago. I've eaten here once before back in 2010 when I was visiting some relatives but couldn't really enjoy it since it was incredibly busy during that day. This time, however, we stopped by right when it opened. Service: The waitresses are attentive and will always get you what you need. Some waitresses are nicer than others, though. Food: If you want better quality food from this particular buffet, I suggest you get here early. The cooks actually take the time to cook the food when they aren't too busy. The sushi is actually fresh and the rest of the food is kept warm. Of all the items they offer, the char siu, buttered potatoes, shrimp and chive dumplings, the various sushi rolls, fried squid, baked seafood, fried mackerel, steamed crab, and bacon wrapped imitation crab meat are my favorite items here. Price: Reasonable pricing for a decent selection of food. You pay after you eat. There's plenty of parking, but of course, if you go directly around lunch or dinner time, it will be pretty crowded.
