My friends and I went for dinner on saturday. Everything I tasted was good, squash gnocchi, brussel sprouts, hummus plate, apple pie dessert. My entree was the chicken dish, it came with cheese dumplings. It was very good. As our very nice server Alicia put it everything is as organic and local as possible. Its a very cozy and relaxing restaurant with a lot of nice decor. I would definitely eat here again, however I feel like everything is about $5 more expensive then it ought to be. I am going to try the one in Wayne PA.
