One of the finest Italian restaurants I have ever experienced. Just like eating at a small bistro in rural Italy. Every dish is superbly done, creative and delicious. Turista menu is best bargain in Philly. Loved their use of game like wild boar and rabbit. Homemade pastas were perfectly cooked with firm but not hard consistency. Service was friendly and welcoming. Get the Italian version of escargot. Amazing, and I never liked it before.
