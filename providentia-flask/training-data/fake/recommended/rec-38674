**Hot Tomato** ~ bad management = bad reviews~ Don't ever go to Hot Tomato with a $50 gift card, they will only let you use $10 of it and expect you to pay the remaining balance making you use the remaining $40 ~ 4 different times... I'm sorry I thought the whole point of a gift card was the fact that its a "gift" already paid for, why in the hell would I want to pay for a $60 meal in cash when I have $50 on a prepaid gift card! Such a great meal on my anniversary ruined by awful management {the service was good n very efficient}... I don't think I have ever been so outraged by the way management spoke to us as if we were an old couple hard of hearing, it was as if she had to have the entire block hear her "try" to degrade us... luckily for us my big mouth along with my husband's told that loud mouth little twerp off in such a way, I surprised myself in the end when she was beyond baffled and told us to just forget the whole thing and we were all set! Well thank you very much lady I guess calling the owner was a much bigger problem for you! Haven't you heard the customer is always right!
