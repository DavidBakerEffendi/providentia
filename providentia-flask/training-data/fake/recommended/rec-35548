The gnocchi was good but the service was really disappointing. Perhaps it was because our table was squeezed tightly between two others, but our server barely spoke with us. We didn't hear about any specials--the first contact with our server was, "Ready to order?" It was frustrating when a couple were seated next to us to watch them hear about the specials--they sounded good! I had been excited about eating here, but we won't be back--there are so many little neighborhood BYOs that there's no need to repeat this experience.
