Walked in seated quickly little after 6pm during the week Ambiance of the place was nice. The table was a bit tight because we sat at the corner of the table and I had NO ROOM for my legs so I had to sit sideways. That was annoying. Other than that! Food.. We had the Bruschetta it had eggplant and just wasn't what i was expecting. I'm not a fan of eggplant but I tried it. I wouldn't recommend. The beet salad I liked.. A little small but was tasty. The wild boar meatballs were the best of the entire meal. The sauce was tasty as well. I had the lasagna. I liked it. It was good at first but felt a bit mushy.. but then on the corner it tasted a bit hard.. Overall it was good. But i think Nizza down the street may have them beat on overall taste and presentation. Others ordered Chicken with lemon.. it was good. And another pasta, I'm not sure which one but it tasted just like my lasagna. Which was odd. But it was good. Service was great. Very friendly waiter which was nice for a change. Quick service.. meals came fast.. Overall I liked this place but it isn't memorable enough to come back. I'd say try it once for sure. A lot of people ordered their pizza.. maybe I'd try that next time if I go back.
