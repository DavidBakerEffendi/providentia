Monday morning breakfast with the family.  Sitting outside on the patio,  relaxing and enjoying some great crepes. Had the Atlantic monsieur which is a nice light flaky smoked salmon, eggs, etc.  The crispy apple crepe was very fresh plus the whipped cream :).  The noah's ark was two eggs,  two sugar crepes and two bacon slices.  Had the two hash browns which were a bit like a potato latke.  Great ingredients and good combinations.  My wife,  ex Starbucks batista Daus the coffee is good also.  Packed also on a Mon morning at 9:30!
