Fabulous dinner spot.  The restaurant is beautiful and the service friendly.  I really loved how they focused on seasonal produce and did such a great job with basic components.  They also had a good wine list. When we were there - the weather was very nice and they had the windows open.  That made the dining experience even nicer - you felt like you were a part of the neighborhood.
