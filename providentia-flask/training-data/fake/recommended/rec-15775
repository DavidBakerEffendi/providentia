I've lived in FiDi for years and Dead Rabbit is just one of those places where I can truly say, it never gets old. You just have to go. It is always packed and seats are hard to come by, but just go. Hang downstairs in the Taproom if you want to drink up after work, mingle, and have bar bites. Head upstairs (with a reservation) to the Parlor for a date or for a more chill time with friends. I've discovered my favorite drinks are on the Ambitious and Cultivated pages of the menu. Upstairs is definitely more my scene. Dim lighting, piano playing, shots out of teacups. Check, check, check! You'll probably drop a pretty penny here but suck it up, you live in NYC.
