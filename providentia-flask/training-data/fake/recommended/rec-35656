Came here on a Saturday night with a few friends, and it wasn't that busy. We brought a bottle of wine, and the wait staff opened it very quickly. The waitstaff here throughout the night was very attentive and very friendly. The menu here is quite extensive, with the numbers reaching into the high 100's, it can be tough to make a decision of what to get. Despite this challenge, several us got pho dishes, and they were very good. We were given a heap of the usual basil, jalapenos, lime, and bean sprouts to put into our soups. The appetizers we got were also good, summer rolls with chicken and shrimp were crunchy and chewy at the same time. If only there had been some room for dessert, which after pho, their rarely is.
