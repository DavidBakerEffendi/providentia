This is just a warning for anyone traveling out of their way for the bread. Unfortunately, there is no rhyme or reason to when the bread, for instance - the Sourdough - is available. Without a schedule, and without a way of contacting them to ask (per the counterperson), it becomes a dicey trip to make especially given the long wait in a line to find out.
