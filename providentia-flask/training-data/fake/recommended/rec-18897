I love a few things here: the laid-back ambiance (you can sit down for a while and not feel like you need to get up and out asap!), the crepes, the chocolate-filled pastries and the French sodas. The savory crepes are so delicious (they definitely know how to make their crepes) and they also have a crepe cart that you can rent for parties and other events! I really appreciate good coffee, and this cafe has got that too. I once drove to Stafford Springs while at UConn to go to their other location (now since closed) but I loved this place so much and wanted to go despite being up at Storrs. I was not disappointed. I now have tried the traditional king cake at the Elite party and OH-MY-GOD, by the end of the night we were fearlessly demolishing the remainder in the corner of the event, a little ashamed, a little proud. This king cake (almond filled, we think) is so ridiculously good- if you want to get one for Mardi Gras, this is the place to go. Support your local, independent cafes!
