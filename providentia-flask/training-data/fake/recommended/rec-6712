It is brand new, building isn't even on any satellite maps of the area. Â Pretty standard Italian style food, definitely on the pricier side of things. Odd, because although I sat at the bar, decor in the dining area seemed a little tacky, lots of deep reds. Pimpin it... Food was good, house favorite chicken dish (kitchen left out the sausage though) was viciously spicy but VERY cheesy and flavorful. Help were nice and accommodating. Don't know that I'll be back soon as bang for the buck was less than I prefer, but if you're staying next door it's worth a look.
