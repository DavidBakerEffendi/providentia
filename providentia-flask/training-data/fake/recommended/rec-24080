Yum, yum, yum. Stopped I'm here when I didn't want to eat at my original choice for brunch (MUD) bc they only had a flat rate brunch. Turns out I probably would have saves $ at MUD, but I just don't eat enough for hat deal. On to Cafe Orlin... I was dining alone so the hostess gave me the option to sit at he bar or get a table. There was a wait for tables (didn't seem long, but a wait nonetheless) so I opted for the bar. Â There are 6 stools and sitting there on a busy weekend you really get a show. The espresso machine guy along with the bartender cranked out drinks nonstop. It was truly a sight to see and really made me appreciate how hard restaurant workers work. I ordered the spinach, tomato and I think goat cheese omelet and a sparkling pomegranate drink (mimosa with pomegranate juice instead of orange). It came with a cold potato salad, a greens salad and whole grain toast. The omelet was the star. It was decent sized - I'd say 2 eggs- but with all of he sides was more than I could eat. The eggs were fluffy and delicious. I really enjoyed all of my meal. The drink was just ok, but I am a bit of a wine baby snob and you have to know that places like this are using cheap sparkling wine. Hey, it is what it is though so I'm not complaining. I'd eat here again should I find myself in the East Village.
