We ordered the tasting menu since we had no clue how to order.   So we got the Tonton Salad, the Salmon Carpaccio, the Gyoza, the grilled pork tonsoku and then the Hakata Ton Ton hotpot.  There was a serious amount of food and  I was stuffed early on.  But some of the food was a bit weird in taste and we weren't too excited about it.  But the hot pot was really yummy and I'd recommend just getting that.   They also were having a wine special where they were serving wines for a very cheap price - we tried a few but didn't like any of the wines.  I'd give a higher rating here for the hot pot on its own.
