belgiovine's makes a sandwich a religious experience. i mentioned belgiovine's to someone who is a tri-athlete and "eats right", and i've seen him there three times since.  he's a convert.  how could you not be? if you want to impress with your cooking skills, pick up some chicken cutlets and fresh mozzarella, bring them home, slice up the mozz, and make your own chicken parmagiana.  it's a staple in our house, and it's heaven.  but go before rush hour, or they'll sell out -- the food is as fresh as it is good. their prosciutto is amazing, and sliced single-molecule thin so you get all of the flavor and texture.  if you want cappacola, they'll ask "cappacola or hot ham" to be sure (the hot ham is spicy, and exquisite).   hot peppers aren't the sad pathetic little rings out of a jar, they're long, grilled and marinated peppers that add just the right kick in combination with the balsamic and their breads.   their stuffed breads (chicken cutlet, sausage, veggie, in that order) are equally good, and we have been known to drive them to south jersey with the care and planning normally reserved for bringing fireworks over the pennsylvania state line.   to top it all off, all of the counter staff are friendly, fast, polite and know their meats and cheeses.
