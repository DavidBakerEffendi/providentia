The soups are delicious, some of the best I've ever had.  The one with Vietnamese ham is an exception, that one was pretty gross.  Everything else I've had has been excellent (especially the egg noodles).  I've had pho at a number of other places and I'd say typically the broths aren't as flavorful and delicious as they are at Pho 68.  I do have to complain a bit though about the terrible music they always have playing (ie an instrumental piano cover of a Linkin Park song) and sometimes the service is a little slow.
