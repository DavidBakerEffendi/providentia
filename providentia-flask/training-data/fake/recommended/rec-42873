As far as Japanese food goes, this place is pretty standard - nothing really outstanding, but definitely not bad either. We ordered the sashimi special (tuna, salmon, and some other pieces of fish that must not have been that memorable), the cod (which tasted like any other cod I've had in the city), and the assortment of meats. Now the meats was actually very good, and kind of saved my meal. The filet was cooked very nice and tender - dark pink on the inside. The meatball was seasoned very well and also nice and juicy. The highlight of the meal, however, was the dessert. I'm not sure exactly what it was called, as it was my friend's decision. The best way to describe it was a bowl of chilled, sweetened green tea soup with small rice cakes and a scoop of ice cream in the middle. The ice cream complemented the soup rather well. This was so delicious that, when we found out the chilled soupy dessert also had a hot counterpart, we just had to see how it compared. And it compared pretty well! Not sure which one I preferred more - they both hit the spot just right.
