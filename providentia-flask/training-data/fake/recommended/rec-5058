I got their Bistro burger or whatever it is that has the bacon.  The bacon was KICKA**, for sure.  I might just go get a plate of bacon next time as a side.  The burger itself was a-ok.  It may have been because I ordered it medium rare and usually when I do that, restaurants give me medium (or even well-done, wtf!) but this time it actually came out medium rare.  I'll come back to try it medium and see... Oh, and the fries suck.  They taste like the ones you get frozen in the bag.  And they don't look like the picture of the fries, either.  Maybe they've changed it? I like the feel of the place, though.  Very small, lots of beer, lots of sports on the TV's.
