This place has really gone downhill.  This used to be our family destination, but for the second time in a row the service was bad and the food lousy.  Fried calamari was soggy to the point of being inedible, then a 45 minute wait for our meal which had clearly been sitting there waiting for us, as it was stone cold. The worst part is it was early and there restaurant wasn't even near capacity. I'm not sure what the problem was.   The veggie burger is a major skip it.  Mushy, tasteless, vile.  when they finally brought our food out, I asked for creme brulee (which our kids love) while we were eating. The waiter told me it comes out fast.  We finish eating, get the check, pay the check, ten minutes later the creme brulee arrives and it is stone cold.  A REALLY bad meal.  Goodbye to our favorite restaurant.
