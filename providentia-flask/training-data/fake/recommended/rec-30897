This review is long over due... I've been coming to Spicy Village just over a year now back when it was He Nan Flavor. Not being a native New Yorker I craved the yummy Chinese food I'm accustomed to from my hometown Vancouver. I usually only order the Big tray of chicken and the pork pancakes.... The lady knows me well and soon as she sees me.. she asks "big tray of chicken?" haha you bring new friend! Strangely enough she knows I don't speak Chinese but insists on speaking Chinese to me?!?!?! Which is okay becuase I can understand a bit of what she says and usually just nod and smile back :) I bring friends who are visiting out of town to this place especially when I know they haven't had some good Spicy Chinese food in a while... I recommend this place to everyone but now its starting to be more popular I'm afraid I won't get a table!!
