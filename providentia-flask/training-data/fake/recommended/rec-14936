HOLY SHIT! BEST HOT DOGS OF MY LIFE! I work right off of South St and one of the other tattoo shops told us about this place told and we RUSHED over.. They have every kind of hot dog you can think of! I am from Seattle and they actually have a Seattle dog! Cream Cheese and all! Everyone was really nice and the place was cute! For being open only a week they had their shit together! We will be back for many many many more hot dogs!
