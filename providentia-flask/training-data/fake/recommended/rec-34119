After reading the somewhat mediocre reviews, I was skeptical about coming here but so glad we did.  We had our 3 young kids with us, one of whom was way past nap time.   The server came over immediately, we ordered drinks and the kids meals and they came out ridiculously fast.  That alone is worth a 5 star review! But my husband and I both got burgers (I got the one with mushrooms and swiss cheese and my husband got a cheeseburger) and they were great.  The beer selection was also very good.  Unfortunately, due to the aforementioned sleep-deprived 2 year old, I knew I wouldn't have time to enjoy a pint so I didn't bother ordering one. What more can you ask for in a restaurant: good service, good food and good beer selection.  Oh yea, and prices were reasonable too.  Thanks Box 63!
