The grilled calamari and beet salad were fantastic.  So were the 5 bottles of wine.   I can't comment on the rest because I don't really remember all that well after the first course. Perfect dinner and the waiter put up with us the whole time, even as we took "breaks" to check out the lunar eclipse that was going on that night.  Thinking of it, he would make a great kindergarten teacher.
