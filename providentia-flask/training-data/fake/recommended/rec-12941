So the meatballs here are OK. That's about it. I just don't get the hype about this place. It's a hole in the wall! Why would anyone want to stand on a 2 hour line saturday night to get into this crummy little place with barely any room to move around just to have some meatballs that you can honestly go grab at ikea (sweedish meatballs - excellent!). I'd rather spend 20 minutes on a line and go to provocateur or lavo than waste my time trying to get some meatballs for 2 hours. But in any case they are the go to spot on weekdays monday to thursday cause then you can sit down right away and you don't feel rushed!
