This is fry heaven on earth. Best I have ever had. Not only is this fry cooked perfectly there are a few good choices of dipping sauces to go with them. It's like getting all you want then putting a cherry on top. I always make my way here if I'm around this part of town. If you haven't gone... go and if you have been there GO! Only thing is that it gets crowded at time but well worth the wait.
