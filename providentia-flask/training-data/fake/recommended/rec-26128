Very pleasantly surprised! It's only a 5 minute walk from my house, and the food is exceptional. First was the calamari with sweet chili sauce. Very flavorful and crispy. I had the Pad Priew Wan, a sweet and sour chicken dish - chicken was tender and juicy, plenty of vegetables and lots of pineapple. For dessert, sticky rice with custard! All of it was very well prepared, presentation top notch. The service was friendly and very helpful. Super happy to find this place.
