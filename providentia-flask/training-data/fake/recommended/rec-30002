Terri adds vegan/vegetarian options to the FiDi lunch scene.  There was barely a wait when I visited for lunch, which is a plus.  So far, I have only tried their avocado and hummus wrap.  It was tasty, but heavy handed on the hummus...I wish it was the other way around...more avocado than hummus.  I'll probably visit again or order on Seamless.
