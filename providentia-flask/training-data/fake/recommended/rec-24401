Went here on a Thursday afternoon, totally not planned but the menu looked good so my friends and I decided to try it out. The place looked nice enough, but everything was just mediocre. Normally you cannot go wrong with Italian food, but this place didn't really do it right either. The service was ok, not vey attentive which was strange given that we were the only people in the restaurant. Probably not going back.
