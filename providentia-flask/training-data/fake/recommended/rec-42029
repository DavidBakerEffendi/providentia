My friend had been raving about this place for about a week, so we went for an early dinner. I got the $1 chicken empanada (happy hour special), the skirt steak with fried yuca, a side of saut√©ed veggies, and a coffee - everything was SUPER flavorful and absolutely amazing. Both my friend and I ate for under $45. The ambiance is sexy hipster and would be perfect for date night or girls night. Literally one of my new favorite restaurants!!
