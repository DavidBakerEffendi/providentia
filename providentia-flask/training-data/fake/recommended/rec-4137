Tapas... what a fun concept! I always enjoy tapas because I can try a little bit of everything and share it with great company. My favorite items from here have to be the patatas bravas and deviled eggs. The patatas bravas come smothered in a creamy sauce that pairs well with the seasoned crunchy potatoes. And the deviled eggs are so so creamy, and filling. I haven't gotten the chance to try everything on the menu, but will definitely be returning!
