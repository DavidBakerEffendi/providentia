This place has changed hands many times since it was Lentina's. None of the other places were any good, but this place is up to par with any other real Italian deli around. And there fresh Mozzarella might be better than the other two guys in town. They have lots of daily hot foods you can take home and use real Italian cold cuts. And all the Italian groceries you could need.  One issue I have with them is that they have to learn how to make a sandwich in less time than it takes for me to read Moby Dick. . I was the only person being helped by this particular lady but it still took her about 10 minutes to make me two simple sandwiches, in a world where the guy down the block does the same thing for you in 2 minutes this will give me second thoughts about going back if I'm in a rush, which we always are. Another issue I had is that I bought some nutella that turned out to be expired by over 9 months, I never brought it back or told them about it, I'm sure they would have replaced if I did. I just don't want to have to look at all the expiration dates before I buy something, I'm trusting the vender does that before putting something out.   That being said I'm very happy this place is around and doing well so now I have on other option to get some great Italian deli food. I might go there right now and get a nice sandwich.
