Tried to order takeout at night. Phone was dead. Told the bartender phone was out. "Above my pay grade." Annoying but ordered Carmen fries covered in bacon, green onions and oaxaca string cheese because I'm a glutton for punishment. Pro-tip: Go here for lunch to get better service. The owners are usually there. Night staff has a chip on their shoulder.
