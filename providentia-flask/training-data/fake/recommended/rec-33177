Consistent food the three or four times we've been here - I love the prime rib, and the hubs has always been happy with his meals. He's had the salmon burger, and tried a filet mignon with lobster topping for Valentine's Day. I tasted it and it was delicious. The waitstaff is very friendly and accommodating. Glad to have this place nearby.
