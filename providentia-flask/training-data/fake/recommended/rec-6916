Ceviche and Beefheart. This is not some Brooklyn duo, but the delicious food I had for a recent snack at Surfish Bistro. I have been waiting to check this place out for a long time cause I heard that they made several different kinds of Ceviche, which  I could eat every day. The staff could not have been sweeter and gladly made recommendations for the ceviche tasting. Tuna with pineapple, Ceviche Mixto, and Ceviche de Pulpo were all perfectly fresh, light ,and very well balanced with the accompanying sauces. The recommended peruvian beer(name forgotten) was bad ass with the ceviche starter.  For the second and final snack course I had Anticuchos - Grilled marinated beef heart. Brilliant and my kinda dessert. Perfectly seasoned and tender. The place is fairly tiny, with 4 or 5 bar seats, some tables, and a patio that I did not see yet. Fairly priced, I can't wait to return and check out more offerings. I only wish it was right near home.
