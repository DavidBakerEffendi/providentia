I don't hate this place. Actually I kind of liked this place. Having never really explored New Haven before I don't have much to compare it to in the area but I did hear quite a bit of criticism about Anchor before going. It was a first date and it seemed I wasn't the only one as two other people asked if I was the person they were meeting (I must have seemed confused when I walked in and looked around). It's a small place, with the lights fully on so no hiding what you actually look like if it is a first date. There is a juke box, although I never saw someone pick a song and the music became very bad when it reached 11-12pm. There was only one bartender, nice fella, handling the crowd well. Good location and parking, good selection of bottled beers and a diverse crowd all seeming to enjoy themselves in personal conversations. Complaints: the bathrooms downstairs are adjacent to a sketchy, if not creepy, old possibly dance floor or gambling area in the basement, and something happened with the draft taps so couldn't order draft after 10pm. The guy I was with said something goes wrong with their booze supply, lights, servers, or music nearly every time he goes (but still comes back so I'm guessing no major issues). I was warned this was a 'Yale "tool" Bar' however I think it's a cool little hangout and fits well with the Dive Bar status it has here on yelp. In summary, I'd go back, but probably not until after exploring what the rest of New Haven has to offer first.
