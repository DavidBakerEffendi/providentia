This is a good spot if you're looking for budget friendly sushi. It seems as though the sushi is always half off. You can get a variety of rolls for less than $5 each. My friends and I usually order edamame and miso soup for starters along with a bunch of rolls to share. No one spends over $20. One thing that is a bit of a disappointment is that they tend to forget to bring out the edamame until the sushi is served. The sushi always comes out fresh and I've never had to wait for a table which is great.
