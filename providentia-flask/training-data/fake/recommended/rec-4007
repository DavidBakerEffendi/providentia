I went here for Dine in Brooklyn, and had reservations for 10:45pm. We eat late, and were happy to be assured we wouldn't be rushing anyone by starting at that hour. We arrived slightly early, and waited for a group who had paid and were just sipping water. The hostess recommended we wait inside so they knew we were there, all went well, and we were seated within 10 minutes of our reservation. Bread and spread came swiftly. There was butter, some mustard/dairy amalgam, and a cup of pâté. Any place that gives me pâté for my bread wins my heart. After the bread, we were given a rather large, perfectly cooked, scallop on a citrus/green salad as an apology for the wait. This was not necessary, but was definitely appreciated. I had the jalapeno/sweetbread appetizer, it was fantastic, but maybe a little too spicy for the first course. There was a vegetable/cream soup which was very good and very creamy. The beet salad was good, but just a beet salad. I tried the citrus soda and the apple/vanilla soda, neither were anything special. After the first course the hostess checked in on us, I mentioned I liked the pate and she brought out two more large servings for the table. This too was not necessary, but was definitely appreciated. My main course was duck breast, duck leg ragu, chard, and cream sauce. It was salty, creamy and fantastic. The mushroom risotto was very good, but not new. There was a fish with herb sauce, and I remember it being well cooked but oversalted. Dessert was bread pudding, which was dense and delicious, and most importantly lacking raisins. I despise raisins. There were three paragraphs here about the shortcomings of raisins and the people who cook with them before I thought better of it. The madeline with irish coffee was just good. Overall, a good meal with great service. All of my dishes were hits, but I think my fellow diners didn't fare quite as well.
