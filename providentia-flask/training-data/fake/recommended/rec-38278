I love this adorable nook of a place. It is super cute. The service is sweet. The ros'e sangria is great. We breezed on in at 6pm, no wait at all, though the place filled to the brim and people were waiting at the door when we left. Met an old friend, chatted, sipped & dined in peace. Spinach & artichoke dip is soooooo good. As are the chicken meatballs in pesto. All around this is such a charming little slot in what can be, at times, Â a less than charming world.
