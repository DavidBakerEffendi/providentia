Went there on their opening night. Super impressed. The staff was organized. Food came out on time. Everything we ordered was great. We had some type of vegetable dumpling which was unreal, mushroom appetizer, carrot salad (very good,) the skirt steak and chicken entree. No complaints. I will be back.
