I've gone to Juniors twice in the last month and I'm not ashamed to say it was due to their legendary cheesecake. The food, however, left quite a bit to be desired. First time,tried the char-broiled burger. It was too dry and not as flavorful as I remember (I grew up going to Juniors in Bklyn). Second time, I had the brisket. I was served some beef that was over 50% percent fat. I found that disgraceful because Juniors is supposed to be one of the best. If they want to keep their reputation, they better fire the cook or teach him how to cook, one or the other. But in the end, all is forgiven when you get your dessert. I had the raspberry swirl cheesecake and a more decadent, delicious piece of cake I have never had. For the incredible cheesecake, I will give them four stars despite the disappointing food. The servers were also good.
