Their Ramen broth is awesome. It is full of flavor and the noodles are incredibly fresh.Also, I think I had an aneurysm when I tasted the Zeppole donuts. These were freaking amazing. One other charming aspect is how you are greeted by the sushi chefs when you walk in. You def. feel special :) I would recommend this place for sure.
