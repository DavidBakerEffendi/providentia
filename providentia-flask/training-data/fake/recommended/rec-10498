Going to the Ear Inn sort of gives you the same feeling as slipping into a pair of your grandfather's leather oxfords - old, warn-in, smelly, and familiar....all in a good way. Props for steadfastness and fortitude. Believe it or not I had a very romantic brunch there years ago, and it's a fun place to go for drinks too.
