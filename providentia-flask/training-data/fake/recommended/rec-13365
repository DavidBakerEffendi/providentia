Despite being out of several of their must have dishes, we felt our Sunday night meal was very good. Started with mussels in a wine sauce that is bread soaking/dipping good!  The Kefi salad was very good too. Lamb Shank was fall off the bone tender on a bed of orzo.  The roasted lemon chicken was very tasty. Party of two with one glass of wine, under $60.  When we come back, I know exactly what to order, everything they were out of when we were there!  Note to self, plan an earlier dinner.
