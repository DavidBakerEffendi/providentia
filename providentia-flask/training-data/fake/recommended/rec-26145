My story is the same everyone else's. We've drive passed Thai O'Briens every day for a few years and mocked the stereotypical Chinese "restaurant" yellow sign and the hilarious name. Then a cousin of ours drove in from out of town and, being the typical hipster she is, requested that we try it one day. Hey, if a hipster serves a purpose, it's to find secluded food/clothes joints. I ordered to go and have since been back 3 or 4 times. I'm a vegetarian, so the cuisine is definitely workable for me. The Pad Thai is one of the best I've ever had and their curries are excellent, as well. Ignore the crappy reviews about bad parking and weird location. It's an urban area. Not everything can have an Applebees (bleh) sized parking lot. The layout of the building is actually pretty cool with the restaurant in the front and bar in the back. I've never stepped foot in the bar because that's not my scene, but I've heard excellent things. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because of their $10 dollar minimum on deliveries. I understand that it's not worth it for them to travel for a $5 order, however, when there are items on your menu that come out to $9.60 with tax, I don't think it's fair to tell me that you can't make the delivery. You don't do that to a trusted customer, never mind someone new just trying the place out. Price your food $.40 higher if you really need the extra money. I'm one person and want a single meal for myself. I end up ordering a $1.00 side of rice and that does the trick. All in all, great food spot. /Rant.
