Modo Mio was amazing! I went with a group of 8 people for a friends birthday. Because we had a large party every person was a set $35 which included an appetizer, pasta dish, entree and dessert. Each person was able to pick anything off the menu...no limitations although the price was fixed. The food was unbelievable. I started with the fried mozzarella special then moved onto the spinach ravioli in a brown butter sauce and cocoa and, when I thought I couldn't eat anymore, I made room for the chicken milanese. It was fabulous!! For dessert we got a few plates of mixed sweets which were all great, especially the tiramisu and the chocolate cake. Overall, a great experience. Our waitress was fun and attentive. Peter, the head chef, came out to greet us and was so personable. A great experience and I cannot wait to go back!
