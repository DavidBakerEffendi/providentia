Yumma-licious Greek food and great prices.  We had: - Karpathian Makarounes - Grilled sardines - Keftedakia - Tyropitakia - Meat Gyro Platter - Moussaka All for about $60.  There was so much food, we stuffed ourselves and still have about 3 meals worth to take home.  I am so full right now, I might have to hurl.  Owwww...  But so worth it.
