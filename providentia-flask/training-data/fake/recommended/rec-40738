Went here for dinner w/ the fam earlier this month.  tuesday night dinner at 8:30p - found awesome street parking (meter, yuck) - but it was right outside the restaurant.  got seated right away, awesome. our service was great. now the food review: appetizer: mac & cheese - must do it!  there were 3 of us, and it was the perfect amount to share.  not too much where u fill up.  it was really delicious, bread crumb topping too.  perfect crunch. mom had the fried chicken & was very happy with it.  sister had the pot roast meal - also really delicious.  i had to get the grilled cheese & tomato soup almost out of default.  i always wanna get that to compare w/ other restaurants to see who has the best.  definitely didnt care for their grilled cheese.  the tomato soup was pretty good though.  gave my leftovers to my little brother.  made me realize i should not go to comfort foods restaurants anymore and get back to eating healthy!
