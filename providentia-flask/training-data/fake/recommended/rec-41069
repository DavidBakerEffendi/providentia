Just Go!!  My girlfriend and I went here for dinner last weekend and we literally felt like  foreign diplomats!  Our waitress, Julietta, really knew exactly the type of drinks to recommend and all of the house mixed drinks used name brand tequilas.  She was spot on with the drinks, so I also tried her recommended tacos, the beef rib, absolutely amazing!  The general mgr Luis visited our table and was so much fun that we chatted with him a few times through out the night.  Even the night mgr Ricardo got in on the fun when we asked him to have a shot with us!  The setting was very relaxed and comfortable and had a great vibe, all of the front doors were open as our table edged the sidewalk.  All of the food is house made by a known Chef who began the restaurant here in NYC.  Honestly, we had an amazing time and cannot wait to go back!  Try this place!!
