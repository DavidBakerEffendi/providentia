My husband and I have ordered takeout a few times, and it's always mediocre at best. If this the best the area has to offer, I need to find a new hangover remedy.   I usually get the sesame chicken combo, that comes with fried rice and an egg roll. The egg roll is usually the best part, and that's not saying much. Have you ever seen sesame chicken, without sesame seeds??? Huh? The chicken seems like real chicken at least, but it's always gooey, flat pieces lacking sesame seeds. The fried rice is just rice- there is no onion, egg, carrot pieces. I could make plain rice at home myself.   I've ordered veggies with garlic sauce on the side also, eh. Wonton soup is ok. They've also messed up our delivery order before, and instead of offering to come back and deliver what we had ordered,  she said they'd give us something free next time, and refused to deliver anything else. I wish there were better in the area.
