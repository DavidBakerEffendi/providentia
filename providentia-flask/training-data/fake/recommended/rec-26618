To those who aren't brazilian, look up Rodizio. The meat is brought to you like a king, and you can choose if you'd like a cut of it or not - and it is all you can eat. The meat is roasted - i believe the same way portuguese churasqueiras do theirs (hence the skewers) which gives it far better flavor than anything you'd have at most chain steakhouses.  In my opinion, the american steakhouse has nothing on the brazilian rodizio.  If you are a carnivore, this is the crown royale of dining.   This place is kinda small, but the food is always terrific.
