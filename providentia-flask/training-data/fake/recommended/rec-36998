mmm this place is practically a new york institution.  it's big on power lunches as you can gather from the businessmen around you but the service never falters.  the food is great and the dessert is even better, although I must say I'm a little biased because my friend is a pastry chef there but I swear it's inventive and some of the best I've ever had.
