i wanted to give it 5 stars, i really did, and i'll tell you why i didn't coming up.  first and foremost, you have to try the beef marrow and oxtail marmalade.  i think when it comes to food you can never judge a book by it's cover and this dish is no exception.  had it not been for friends who ordered the dish for the table, we probably would have been guilty of not following the above cliche.  AND, had it not been for their friends doing the same for them, they would have missed out.  so i'm quite thankful we have friends who have friends who like oxtail.  simply put, it's amazing. the fifth star i reserve for restaurants where you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu.  unfortunately, i have had a couple dismal dinners here and the verdict all hung on the entree.  everything else about this restaurant is top-notch; even the bread & butter is 5 star quality.  thankfully there's a wide selection on the menu. remember, beef marrow and oxtail marmalade.  trust me, and my friends, and their friends.
