I LOVE that this location has a lot of seating compared to the location at Waverly Pl. The food, I found, is the same and service is very quick. Crunchy falafels, delicious hummus, and fluffy pita with za'atar dusted on top. My favorite is the spicy red falafel. I haven't been back in while but I saw that the platters are a bit smaller now when I glanced at my neighbor's plate. Either way, the food is fabulous and I like how it doesn't feel like quick food. Very trendy, on-the-go, spot and it fills you up without the huge guilt trip of eating something heavy.
