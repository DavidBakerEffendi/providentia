Throughout the month of March if you purchase certain glasses of wine then $1 will be donated to Ronald McDonald House. I love it when a business is charitable. For the food: The scallops wrapped in prosciutto was our fav. While the pappardelle dish was good but slightly too salty. And that's saying something as my guilty pleasure snack is sea-salt potato chips. I'd go back.
