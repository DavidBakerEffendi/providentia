Fairly good experience - 3 stars because it was "really good" and falls a little short of "great" or "amazing" -Fast service. Maybe too fast? 7:15 reservation on Saturday night. Felt early in the night, we happily got a table for 2 next to the window. We had drinks, an appetizer and entree all by 7:50. While I enjoy quick service things felt rushed (e.g. server frantically slides down appetizer and runs away so I had to shout after him awkwardly for a request) -Food was again, really good, but nothing earth shattering. One of the better Mexican experiences in NYC (I'm an LA native so its tough to find good Mexican in this city). We had the pork tacos to start, chicken enchiladas in mole sauce and the cod special. I'd recommend all of it, but there's nothing itching at me to return for these dishes -Wine selection is on the cheap side. Good if you're looking for $8-9 glass, bad if you're looking for higher quality... Decent date night spot, decent food. Worried about the B health rating. Would recommend if you're in the mood for Mexican food, but wouldn't be a go-to recommendation overall.
