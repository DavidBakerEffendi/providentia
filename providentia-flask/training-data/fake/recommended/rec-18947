Perfect place for brunch with friends if you're in astoria. I mainly come here for their filling Â paninis. My favorite is the roast mushrooms because I'm a sucker for that special blend of mushrooms and caramelized onions but nearly all of the paninis I tried here were pretty good. Ambiance is homey but attractive.
