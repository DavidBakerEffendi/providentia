Between a three and a four on the stars, but since this is where the sandwich was invented, giving them the 4.  I'm a fan of Jim's on South Street, always have been, always will.  Came to both Pat's and Geno's for the first time in about 30 years to make sure I still had it right, and I do.  Pat's is good, Jim's is great.  If you are in the area and have to pick between the "big 2", take Pat's.  If you have the time, sidle over to South Street and get the best....at Jim's.
