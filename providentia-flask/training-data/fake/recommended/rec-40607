My best friend came into town for business a few weeks ago and after work we came here. I can't even tell you how great this place is. Just SO good. We had a sashimi salad which I didn't like but otherwise we had like 5 different rolls that were all great, tempura was phenomenal. Â Since it was Philly beer week this place wasn't too crowded (all the local bars were). We sat outside underneath the sign and laughed the night away. Apparently they've lost their liquor license so no Sake right now. Also the hostess and waiter we had that Thursday night were AMAZING, and I had no problem tipping them $20 for being so awesome to us. It's a great place overall and I can't wait to go again.
