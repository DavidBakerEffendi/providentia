Go here for tapas if you can't find another spot and must have tapas or the location is extremely convenient. We ordered their mango sangria and were underwhelmed. For food, we had the croquetas de pollo, skirt steak, mussels in avo sauce, and patatas bravas. None of them were bad but nothing was the best or close to best rendition of anything I've ever eaten. The avo sauce with bread and the skirt steak were probably the highlights of the meal. I make better croquetas at home and the patatas bravas were no where near as delicious as my old favorite, Mercat. The waitstaff was mildly attentive but not up to NYC caliber. I reserved on open table and honored my reservation. Nai marked me as no-show even though I showed up exactly on time. Open table resolved the issue but it was just a bummer that I had to deal with that. No other of the 39+ restaurants I've reserved through open table have ever done this to me so I'm rounding Nai down to 3 stars.
