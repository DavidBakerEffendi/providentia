Outdoor seating and gluten free options! It's also very cheap. We got there and had a different dish each. Of note is their ability to make almost anything on their menu gluten-free. Â I was the only person who needed a gluten free dish, the Spaghetti a la Carbonara, and my company had gnocchi, Ragu, and another saucy pasta. I forgot what it was. They also ordered an appetizer-- octopus, and they loved it. The meal left much to be desired. My friends all tried a bit of my pasta, as well as each of their plates, and there was little to no difference. The food was very, very, very bland. My meal was heavy on the dairy, which I knew, but even I was surprised by how much they soaked my poor gluten free penne in dairy. I felt like I was a 1 year old having my morning bottle and not dinner at 8 PM on a Friday night. There appeared to be two servers when we were there, both of them doubling as bartenders throughout the night. The restaurant was not at all crowded, but they asked all people who entered if they had reservations. I found this comical because it implied that they were very busy (at 8 PM), when they were very obviously not. They had an extensive wine menu, but we had none of it. I think we might have enjoyed it more if we had considered either the wine or the desserts (five options, I think... tiramisu among them). In short, it's not a very extensive menu, but it's relatively inexpensive and there are options for the gluten-free world. It would definitely not be my first choice in the future.
