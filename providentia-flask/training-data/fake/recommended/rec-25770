I tried making reservations for 2 since we are traveling to NY and I have pre selected the restaurants and made reservations for my itinerary. This place takes reservations for 4 + only and I told her we are traveling and there are only 2 of us! They would not accommodate. She also said the wait time would be at least 35 min and to come super early or really late. NOTE: Reservations are only good for parties of 4+
