Stop what you are doing right now and try their curried sweet potato. No, seriously. DO IT. When I go into NYC, Hu Kitchen is one of the places I hope to visit. I have a Google Maps Engine database of restaurants and grocery stores that have gluten-free options, and I love Hu Kitchen because it provides so much choice. Everything on their menu is gluten-free, with the exception of their chocolate bars, which were made in a facility that processes wheat (sob!). To respond to other comments: Yes, it's a bit pricey, but I'm willing to indulge on my days in NYC if it means that I won't get glutened. The food is way better than Dig Inn, my other short-list eatery.
