Fortunately I was dining at company expense, not my own, since the food was ordinary, but heavily overpriced. Service was nice and attentive (better be, there was only one other table occupied). I'm not a pasta doneness snob, but the fettucine definitely didn't make it to al dente - way too chewy. Flavors and freshness of everything was average for a midrange restaurant, and nowhere near justifying the upper-midrange pricing. Nice front window tables, though, if you can get them.
