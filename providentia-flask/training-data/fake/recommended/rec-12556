Truffle burger special was / is the best burger I've ever had so far. I ordered it medium and it came out juicy and tender. The Parmesan cheese crisp added flavor depth, saltiness, and texture. Fried egg on top was perfectly cooked. Truffles fries were a good pairing. The fries are skinny small fries - I used a fork to get five/six fries instead and proceeded to stuff my face. I could've passed on the salted chocolate truffle ice cream - either I was truffled out and/or truffle and chocolate aren't my thing. See the truffle trend here? It was the Special so why not order the specials since all the other menu items will remain on the menu for future visits. Â Oh, and there will be a future visit. Service was great. Music is a bit loud in the downstairs area - how do you have a conversation? Cocktail drinks were pretty tasty.
