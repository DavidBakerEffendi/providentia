gorgeous hapsburg style decor delicious and surprisingly not super expensive food SACHERTORTE ($8 a slice but i'd pay double because it's fucking SACHERTORTE) ummm yeah also the bread basket they give you is literally overflowing and this isn't cheesecake factory bread, hunny bunnies. i can't say enough good things about cafe sabarsky. my favorite place to eat in nyc by far.
