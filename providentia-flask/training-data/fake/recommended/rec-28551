Great concept. I have to watch my carbs because of an insulin resistance issue and paleo has been an easy way to reduce my sugar/carb intake. I love the curried sweet potato salad but it is sweeter than it needs to be because of the dried apricots. Â Also at $12.50/ lbs for potato salad, I want to be able to eat everything in it. I also purchased a fish stick but could not eat it there because they would not heat up food in the refrigerated case. The cookies are very yummy! However when I am trying to lose weight I need to stay away from the paleo cheat items (their cookies, brownies, etc) and root vegetable based foods. If I lived closer, I'd be here a lot more often.
