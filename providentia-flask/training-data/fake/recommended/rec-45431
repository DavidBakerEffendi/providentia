Me and my gf wanted fish and decided to check out Blue Point on a whim. We had both never been there so it was to our surprise how delicious it turned out to be. The place gets very crowded and it isn't the quietest of settings, however they do offer wine glasses to the people waiting which is very cool.   We had little neck clams to start which were great with the cocktail sauce.  Then our fried calamari and buffalo shrimp came next which were equally as good (the table next to us had the buffalo calamari and they looked amazing).   Entree included scallops for my gf and salmon/swordfish for me.  The scallops were incredible, and you get a choice of many sides including garlic mashed which I would recommend. The salmon was good, swordfish was eh. I blame myself for ordering it, as there was simply so much to choose from but overall we were more than satisfied and definitely want to go back. A great place to go with a group as well. Staff was great, food was even better. Bluepoint wins.
