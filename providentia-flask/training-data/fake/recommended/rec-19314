I loved this place. It looks like a mix between Mel's Diner and Black Angus, but with a young crowd and tasty food cocktails! I've never seen a more perfect mix of young professionals enjoying big burgers, or finer foods like tuna tartar, and smashing adult beverages. I think it's a great Manhattan getaway into the south.
