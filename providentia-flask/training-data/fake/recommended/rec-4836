I was really craving mexican food so we went here. The food was okay. nothing to brag about. what turned me off the most is the huge scorpion looking bug i saw crawling up the wall. the waitress saw it and ran over and knocked it off the wall with a plate. i immediately felt nauseous and wanted to leave fast. unfortunately circumstances like that make me not want to ever go back there.
