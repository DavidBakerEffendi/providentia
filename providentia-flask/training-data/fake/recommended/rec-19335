I love this place. I have yet to come see a show here, but every time I come for drinks with a group of friends we have a great time. The atmosphere is cool and the drinks are good. Why the two stars? Unfortunately, every time, the experience with the service at the bar is very frustrating. I've obviously been to crowded bars, and I know it gets hectic and it can take a while to get the bartender's attention. At JB though, each time, I get the impression the girls behind the bar are purposely being rude. I've stood there trying to get their attention, while they reorganize the ketchup bottles behind the bar. From now on, my strategy is to send my boyfriend to the bar as it seems guys get the bartenders' attention more quickly. And I'll keep my tip until the attitude changes.
