After a year, I have returned. It took me awhile to return since I moved to NYC just because it's a breakfast joint for me, and auth.. anyways.. A lot better this time around. I came by myself in the morning the day after Thanksgiving, so I did expect the place to be packed by the time I get there, and it was. But luckily I just wanted to be at the bar and they had an opening. Service was a lot faster, once I've sat down, bartender placed a full glass of water and a pitcher/bottle of water for refills. I thought it couldn't get better than that, but it did. I ordered the same meal as I did last year, which is a Nutella French Toast. Food came a lot faster this time, and the bartender/waiter checked how I was doing 2-3 times in the process. Changing my review from 3 stars to 5 stars.
