Came here for lunch around 1:30 on Sunday and surprisingly we didn't have to wait for than 5 minutes for a table.  We were seated on the 2nd floor right next to the window which was nice.        Umami Burger has a good variety of burgers but what really caught my eye was the Voltagio burger.  This monster of an artery clogging burger consisted of a bun that had been deep fried in batter to give it a french toast like consistency, served with bacon, maple syrup, and powdered sugar.   If you're a fan of sweet and salty foods then you would love  this burger.  The other great thing about Umami Burger is their great selection of beers but for all of this delicious food they serve, be prepared to pay a pretty penny because the food here is not cheap.  I would say to definitely avoid their onion rings because they were absolutely awful.  The tempura batter was so thick they resembled more like doughnuts rather than onion rings.  In fact there was so much batter on these things there was a section of my onion ring that was nothing more than raw flour.  Baring the lousy onion rings, I thought the service was good and they really did win me over with their beer selection and interesting burger combinations.
