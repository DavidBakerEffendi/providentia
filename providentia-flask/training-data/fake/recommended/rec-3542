I have nothing negative to say about Marlow and Sons. The place is cozy, the atmosphere is charming, the food has been nothing less than amazing each and every time i have been here. Love it. I had the oysters last time, followed by guinea fowl. Previously I have had pheasant , the brick chicken, soup, and other deliciousness. The accompaniments are always great - awesome seasonal vegetables, all so tasty. And of course the chocolate caramel tart is a must - i am not a desert person but this is non-negotiable. Highly recommended.
