When i visited my cousins in New Jersey and New York...coming to this spot was probably he highlight of my whole trip. I hated the east coast because it was hot as hell and humid as fuck. let me just say the west coast is definitely the best coast...without a doubt mans...but anyways...the food here was soooooo bomb...the sangrias booooomb...the service was boooomb...ambiance bommmmb...spending time with my east coast fam...bommmbbb....oh and me and my cousin in law setting up my bf for a surprise happy bday stunt...HILLLLLARIOUS HAHAHAHAS...it wasn't even my bf's birthday but we told the waiters it was so later on they started coming around with their drums and those mexican rattle thingys...wow that was intense...anyways bottom line...i love this spot mans...
