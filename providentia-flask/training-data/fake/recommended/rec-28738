i dig the decor and the eats.  they have so many tasty looking options for both veggies and meat lovers.  i've had their root vegetable mash and their super duper green juice.  both didn't disappoint.  they have a bunch of seating upstairs and even a bar with wine and beer.  i also like that they have unhomogenized milk and that they make their own almond milk - definite brownie points there.  they are a bit pricey, but it is quality food so i don't mind spending the money.  the only room for improvement would be the checkout/ordering flow - there tends to be traffic jams and limited registers so if you're looking to get in and out quick at lunch time, be prepared for some delays.
