High competition in the Brooklyn BBQ scene, but personally I think Morgan's is top of the class...Had an assortment of food: fatty brisket, lean brisket, pulled pork, cornbread, baked sweet potato and ribs, and they were all incredibly delicious. This place has burnt ends down to a science. Great beer selection too, plenty of good pairings to go with all that meat. Will be back for seconds.
