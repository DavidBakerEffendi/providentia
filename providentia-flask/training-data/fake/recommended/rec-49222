Just went here for a late lunch today.  The service was great and the food was excellent.  The white bean and escarole soup is amazing.  Also, they leave a whole jar of Cornichons on the table to snack on.  Delicious.  They also have a great bar that takes over most of the restaurant.  I would say half of the seating is at the bar. It is a tiny place.  There is happy hour from 3:30-5:30 on Tuesdays and Sundays which is basically cheap oysters and bar snacks.
