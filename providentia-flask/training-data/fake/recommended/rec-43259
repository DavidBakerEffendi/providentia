Seems to be a Princeton town staple, but very disappointing nonetheless. The "hoagies" should be called sandwiches, since they offer very little meat, and the restaurant should be called Subway.  What a shame, since its in the perfect geographic location  - in NJ and just a stone's throw from Phili.  That locale normally produces hoagies you can write home about:  Several, paper thin meat and cheese or steak slices, packed into the roll with a ration of 3:1, content to bread. Good thing the rolls are delicious, since they completely outweigh the sandwich content.
