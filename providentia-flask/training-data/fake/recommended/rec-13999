The wait was nearly two hours for a table in the dinning room on a Saturday evening, so we opted for a booth near the bar, which was perfect, although I suggest a reservation several weeks in advance if you want a dinning room table. I had the Lobster bisque soup, followed by braised short ribs, both were outstanding. They were hopping and wanted to turn the table, but were courteous in allowing our party the time we wanted to enjoy the ambiance and flavor of the place. I would definitely go back...
