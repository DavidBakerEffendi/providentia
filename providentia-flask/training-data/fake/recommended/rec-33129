These guys are doing it right. Came in here on a Saturday night. Â One guy working the regiester the other working the kitchen. Waited a few minutes for my sandwich to be made, during that time, about 8 people walked in and ordered food, the workers in there new every customer by name and order. There aren't enough propierters like this in this CITY....They will suceed on this alone. By the way, there food is also amazing!
