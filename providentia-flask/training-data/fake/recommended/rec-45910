Ladies and gentlemen, you have arrived. Welcome to The Pizza Chef. Yes, I said "the." Why? Because you have reached the pinnical of pie. Pizza Chef is an institution. Don't make a mistake and buy pizza from one of those "other" pie holes. Pizza chef has outlasted countless pizza joints in Windsor and will last til the end of time. On a serious note, why do pizza place have video games? Better yet, why don't other restaurants have them? BTW Chef used to have a friggin Congo pinball machine. Congo the movie. Sweet. The grilled chicken salad has addictive chemicals.
