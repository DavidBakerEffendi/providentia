Sat at the bar and had dinner. I had the bacon-wrapped trout, which comes with grits and "mustardy" mustard greens (Dijon sauce, but "mustardy" is fun to say). The trout was tender and flaky and the bacon was crisp. I'm generally a pro-leafy greens person, so I loved the "mustardy" mustard greens. I even liked the grits, which were creamy and polenta-like. My fiance had the fried chicken. The skin was super-crisp. It might be a little too browned for some people's taste, but I was impressed with the level of crispness and the juiciness of the chicken within. I know that's a tough balance to hit, so it shows that the kitchen knows what they're doing. The people sitting next to us at the bar were working through the snacks and small plates. What I saw looked and smelled great. I definitely want to try the flatbread with ramps, the pickles, maybe some baked (broiled?) oysters. The room is very simple, but still warm and elegant feeling. The bartenders seemed to know their stuff and made good suggestions of cocktails and etc. The place seems to be consistently busy, especially for the relatively quieter part of Carroll Gardens it's in.
