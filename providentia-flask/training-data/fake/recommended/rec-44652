Waitress was super rude and unapproachable. We wanted to go to another place after putting in our order and she told us she had to stay and eat the food.      We were NOT going to stay for food that was not even cooked. We then preceded to leave, she chased us down and told us that this is not how we are supposed to do things and that she was going to lose money as well as the restaurant. I have NEVER been treated that way...ever! I will never go back.
