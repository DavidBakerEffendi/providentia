My husband and I have been eating here since we started dating. The food is consistently delicious. Tonight, Valentine's Day, we had 8 o clock reservations (just as we did last year on Valentine's Day). We walked in, just on time to find a line of three other couples, waiting to be seated- all with reservations as well. The wait would have been over an hour. Needless to say, we left and probably will not be returning. Extremely disappointing service. We will be finding a new tradition.
