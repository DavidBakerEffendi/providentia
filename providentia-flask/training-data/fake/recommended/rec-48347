I do have to say: I wasn't too impressed with the service at first. A bartender who asks us three times whether or not we want to have an alcoholic beverage with our brunch (once should have been enough to determine we really only want coffee and OJ). And then the 30 minute wait until our food finally made it to the bar... Well, I was already thinking this joint was another flop. Then I got the food and changed my opinion 360 degrees: Best gourmet-resembling pieces ever! I ordered the croquet madame and it tasted better than what I had ever gotten back in Paris. The salad dressing was actually enjoyable and didn't pull the entire meal down (as it tends to in so many other restaurants). My friend decided to go with the three egg omelette with toast and a side, which was equally delicious. I have to say that the way these pieces were prepared exceeded the expectations I had initially. We were briefly thinking about trying the house donuts but after the brunch were simply too stuffed to go for more. A girl sitting at a neighboring table had ordered the Challah French Toast, which looked so huge, it is probably meant for two people instead of one person. I am greatly impressed by Rye and can only recommend it to anyone who wants to try a classy cuisine with uniquely prepared dishes in the Williamsburg area. Way to go for more!
