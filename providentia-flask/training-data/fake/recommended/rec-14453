I used to go to this place regularly because the pizza is great, but the customer service drove me away. Â During my last visit I started coughing uncontrollably while eating my usual slice. I didn't have a drink so I asked the cashier for a cup of tap water. She refused to give me water- and told me I had to buy a drink- while I was turning purple. Thanks- but no thanks. This wasn't the first time I had shoddy service but I decided that it would be the last. There are lots of other great pizza joints in the area- after all it is next to Little Italy.
