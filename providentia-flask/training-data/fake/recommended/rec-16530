What a disappointment. Went to Graffiti on a Sunday evening and we were immediately seated at a large table. A group of 6 came in and were seated next to us. They were very kind and decided to leave since we were on a date (without us saying anything). Then the host came over and, after we offered to walk around the area and come back once a smaller table opened up so the six could stay he said "Well, you just made me lose six customers." Never been spoken to like that at a restaurant. Needless to say he lost two more customers.
