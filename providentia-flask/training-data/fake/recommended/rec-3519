I have come here several times with my family and we always enjoy our meal. Brunch is deliscious. I've had the eggs benedict and my teen daughter who is fussy has enjoyed the eggs benedict. Steaks are good. A hit with both teen daughters is the poulet cordon bleu (with french fries for them). I've had the mussels and a simple salad and it was very good. Service is wonderful; they seem to want you to enjoy the dining experience. Good wine too. Oh and the same daring daughter who enjoyed the eggs benedict also enjoyed the escargot and said "formidable" (French for great)! I agree!
