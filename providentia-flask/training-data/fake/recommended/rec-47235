The food was soooo good. The staff sooooo bad. The staff was huddled and louder than the clients. Attitude from the hostess and the bartenders, which both messed up our seats and drinks, and still gave me the attitude. Ahhh. What a shame. Usually it's the other way around. Anyway, if you want good food with a group of assholes working for you. go here! What's going on with NY service?
