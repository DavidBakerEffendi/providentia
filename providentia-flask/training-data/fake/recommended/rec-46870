Nice place and good vegan food. The little bit of everything soup is delicious and the bbq ribs are pretty good too. The place is clean and has a nice vibe. The waiters are very attentive- maybe a little too attentive which makes me a bit uncomfortable. They stand in the middle of the room and watch everyone eat. Other than that, the only truly annoying issue is finding parking, but hey, what can you do...
