Owner/ chef is very welcoming and accommodating. He fills up your glasses with spring water bottles at no extra cost. Small menu that is just done to perfection. Very authentic and much tastier meats than kebab house of Afghanistan. It feels like eating at his house, he pampers you, chats you up. I agree with other reviewers don't expect fast food. This is quality excellent food. Lamb is so amazing and it is grass fed. A couple of Lebanese guys next to me were eating it raw. Falafel is off the charts. Super authentic seasoning. The chicken is also cooked to perfection. Without any charring.yum. Most definitely coming back.
