I have to stop here every time I come to NY or anywhere near it. Before my fateful encounter with halal food, I would never eat lamb, but I've converted. Thank goodness. That white sauce is just to die for. I just want to fill up a bottle and take it back to California with me... ANYWAY, chicken or lamb. Find a ledge, enjoy your food while people watching. Or pidgeon watching... I miss NY.
