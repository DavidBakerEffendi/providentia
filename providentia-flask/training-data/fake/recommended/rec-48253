We chose this restaurant after doing a Google search on best seafood in NJ.  While it wasn't tops on the list that the search produced, it's definitely tops in my list now.  Expertly prepared fresh delicious seafood in this great little simple main street restaurant.  We had a table in the front window corner, where we people watched while picking out our meals from this simple, but expansive menu.  Our waiter, Chris, explained everything and made some great recommendations.  I started out with the crab guacamole appetizer, and my husband had the mussels prepared Thai style.  Both were yummy.  I then had a bowl of NE Clam Chowder.  I must say that it was the chunkiest, most clam-filled bowl I've ever had.  The clams were so tender.  My husband had their halibut & jumbo lump crab special with a side of mashed sweet potatoes.  He raved nonstop.  I had the jumbo lump crab cakes.  They were so light and sweet with enormous chunks of crab.  Fantastic.  We'd definitely return again.
