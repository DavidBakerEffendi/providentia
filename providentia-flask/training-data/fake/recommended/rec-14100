I really wanted to love this place, but unfortunately the cleanliness is in question when I leave both times with a mad dash for the bathroom. Besides that, the pan fried house special, hand pulled noodles are savory and very flavorful. I definitely would recommend this and the pan fried pork dumplings. I could live without the noodle soups. The chicken broth seemed watered down and lacked depth. I often found the hand pulled noodles to stem from a large clump of dough as if it birthed all the strands. Not too appetizing to ingest uncooked rough dough. Besides the food, i never really care too much about service because we are in Chinatown.... not in a michelin star restaurant.  But suffice to say, I also cannot review the service when I felt like it didn't even exist. Sometimes they remembered stuff, sometimes they didn't.  Other times they walked, but most of the time they dragged their ball and chain. I'll just stick to my good ol' noodles at Wing Wong or bo Ky
