If you like great food and absolutely awful service, this is the place for you.  Made a reservation on OpenTable and requested an outside seat if available.  After being greeted upon our arrival with a pained 'Yeah?' by our hostess, we were shown to our table that was smack dab in front of the entrance, despite every other table except one in the entire restaurant being vacant.  Inquired about my request for an outdoor table, and was told you cannot reserve a table there.  Seeing through the window that the back was about 60% empty, I asked if we could sit there anyways.  Nope, 'those tables are reserved.' ... My wife's salad was fantastic... and I know this because it came out 20 minutes before my food was served.  It gave me time to sip and savor my tiny $3 vietnamese coffee which did not come with refills (and they offer no other coffee option) because how can they expect to make money if they just kept giving me coffee for free while I waited 30 minutes for food in an empty restaurant? My dish arrived with 2 plastic plates marred by scratch marks and stains.  Apparently our dishes were meant to be shared despite the first one not having any plates accompanying it.  It also was very delicious.  It was so good that the waitstaff wanted it for themselves because I repeatedly had to tell them I wasn't finished yet as they attempted to take it away and clear our table. Our check was simply placed on our table and then we were ignored until we paid and left.  The outdoor tables remained empty. I may eat here again, but it would most certainly have to be carry-out.
