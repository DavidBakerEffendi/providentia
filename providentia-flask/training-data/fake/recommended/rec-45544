My new favorite brunch spot :) It was dead upon arrival but couldn't complain. The service was great and everything that came out was fresh! The bf and I shared their hummus before our main course. I ordered the veggie omelet with a side salad and potatoes. It had more than enough on the plate! The bf had the bison burger. I don't eat red meat, so I didn't try it but he plate was clean by the end of our meal. I definitely left full but left without the guilt of eating out at an unhealthy place :) Would definitely return here for brunch again.
