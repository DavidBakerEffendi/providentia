Let me start off by saying, I am not a Â huge pizza fan *gasp*, but it is my husband's favorite food, and the kids love it. While in Burlington on vacation, we researched a place for dinner and liked the reviews this place had received. I ESPECIALLY liked the fact that they support LOCAL farms! (I am a Vermont native.) We started off with a salad. The dressing was some sort of vinagrette that was delicate and GOOD! My husband ordered beer - and when he had questions about the level of hop flavor, the waitress brought him so many samples (3 half glasses), he didn't even really HAVE to order another! (Though he did!) We got a large pizza for the adults to share, and a small for the kids. The large was half pepperoni and half sausage. (They had specific names, but they escape me.) The pizza the kids ordered was half cheese and herbs and half bread-stick like. We like the way they were sliced into strips - much easier to handle and unique. By far, this was the best pizza I have ever had! My husband thoroughly enjoyed it, but he doesn't get input in this review since he thinks Papa Ginos pizza is somewhat gourmet! : ) The herbs seasoned it perfectly, the sauce was not too sweet or acidic, and the pepperoni and sausage were excellent. The true testament is the kids. My step-son is a peanut and he hardly eats. He ate his half of their pizza and some of ours!! I have not seen him that excited about food in a long time! We did a little research and found that there are 2 locations relatively near our home. We are already trying to plan another trip. SO good! SO fresh!
