I had the bacon mac and cheese and chicken fried steak. This was the real ish. The food made me feel like I was right back in the South. The mac and cheese had a smooth and creamy sauce that was well balanced and season, and the toping was nice and crisp. WHO AM I KIDDING, IT"S MAC AND CHEESE AND BACON... OF COURSE IT"S GOING TO BE GOOD. Is it revolutionary? No, but it is incredibly satisfying. The chicken fried steak was also mad legit. BE WARNED THIS IS SOME ITIS INDUCING FOOD. GET YOU SOME.
