I've heard so much about this place and its burgers that I decided to give it a try. At rush hour. During prime dinner time. So when they tell you 20 minutes - regardless of whether or not your whole party is there - it's 20 minutes. I ordered The Original Umami Burger, and it was really filling! It's like a mix between the Shake Shack and Five Guys burgers - not too small, not too big, but just right. My friends and I also ordered the truffle fries - YUM! These are similar to the fries at Jack & Nellie's: thin enough for you to not regret finishing your plate. They give you 4 different types of dipping sauces for the fries - but I can't quite seem to remember them now. All I remember are the mayonnaise and spicy sauces. Regardless, they're free, so go try them! Add a little kick to yo fries. To top off my meal, I had Original Sin cider. YUM! Overall, the prices for the burger were all right - $20 including burger and fries. Not including the beer. But I read on the menu about their "deals:" Burger + fries + drink = $18.50 Burger + fries + beer = $21.50 So it's not THAT bad. The only thing that I would really complain about this place is - the noise level? From what I saw, everyone was screaming at the top of their lungs to talk to each other. I wouldn't know how to go about changing it, but it was such a hassle to raise my voice when I just wanted to have a conversation... Cailin's Recommendation: The Original Umami Burger - $13 Truffle fries - $3-6
