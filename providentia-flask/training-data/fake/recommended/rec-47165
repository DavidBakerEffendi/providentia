I had a wonderful lunch experience here!  Great service, gorgeous rustic decor and the best part was the food!  Went for restaurant week and everything was amazing.  This was a couple years ago so I don't remember everything I had.  I've been meaning to go back for dinner, and once I do I'll write an updated review!
