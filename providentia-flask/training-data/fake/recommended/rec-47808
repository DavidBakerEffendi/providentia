I am a burger fan and this is one of the best. The burgers are freshly cooked, nicely seasoned, and offered in many creative ways. I tend to like them in a fairly traditional way - cheese, some onion, and I do enjoy their Goldburger sauce which has a nice bite to it - there's some mustard and good spices included in that sauce. Their onion rings are large and crispy, and take my advice and order a side of the Goldburger sauce for dipping. There's always something interesting on the specials board - I've had a nice, spicy soup, some interesting empanadas, and other offerings based on the season and I'm assuming the chef's whim. It's simple inside - order at the counter, grab one of the tables in the front or back space, and they will bring you your food when it's ready. There's ample parking - some up front but a larger lot in the back with a back door access.
