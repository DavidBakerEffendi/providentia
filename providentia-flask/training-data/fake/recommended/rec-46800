Apart from the awesome and friendly staff the fries are the best. Their dipping sauces are all amazing and they have more than a handful to pick from. But if you don't know what to pick don't FEAR you can try as many as you want ;) but I do have my favorites... Vietnamese Pineapple Mayo and Peppercorn Parmesan are must haves :)
