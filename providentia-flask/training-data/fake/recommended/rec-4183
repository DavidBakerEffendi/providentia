I've gone back about three times since I wrote my first review back in 2011, and I've come to the conclusion that this place is pretty solid for drinks, but you are taking a gamble on the food.  I definitely ordered wrong the first time I came here.  Now that I know what to order, I can have tasty junk food with my drinks. Do yourself a favor and order something off the cocktail menu.  The drinks have been solid every time I've come here.  The pina margarita is sweet but doesn't skimp on the tequila, and if you add a salt rim, you get a nice contrast of sweet and salty.  The Drunken Arnold Palmer is probably my favorite tea vodka concoction.  It has the right mixture of sour and sweet and the touch of mint makes for a refreshing beverage.  I've tried to replicate it at home, and I can get close, but it's never quite the same.  This drink is really what has kept me coming back. If you've got to have food here, order snack food!  The veggie wings, although over-priced are delicious due to their crispy texture and vinegary sauce with a kick.  They go well with a side of fries and a tequila based cocktail.  A few weeks ago I decided to detour from this and ordered a fried chicken sandwich.  The portion was huge and the sandwich had a large hunk of breast meat that was breaded and loaded with the toppings I'd requested.  However, someone had left it in the frialator for a bit too long and it was burnt in places which gave it an overall burnt taste.  It was too bad because it had a lot of potential.  The fries were good as usual. Service is a hit or a miss, and there will most certainly be a wait on the weekend, even if you come late.  I will come here again for drinks and snacks, but I really don't think this is the best place to go for dinner.  Stay away from the burritos and the beans, order a delicious drink, and you should be fine.
