Is the burger here delicious? Absolutely Would I say it's the best burger in NY? No way. Sorry, but my heart still belongs to Shake Shack ... or even Greasy Nicks up in Westchester. As a testimony, I'll say that I've lived by Corner Bistro for almost three years and have only stepped foot inside three times. The main reasons are: 1) Like I said the burger is definitely juicy and flavorful, but ultimately disappointing after all the hype that's been built up about it 2) Unlike Shake Shack, where I'd gladly spend an hour basking in the sun in Madison Square Park, I'm not as inclined to be compressed between crowds of men and women vying for a table in a dingy restaurant 3) The reason for said compression is that there is almost always a wait 4) In my experience the staff has never been very friendly. I mean c'mon. Why do they have to be? It's not like people will stop flocking to Corner Bistro because a waiter was curt. But for me personally, grouped will all my aforementioned qualms, I would prefer a more full dining experience then the one I've had at Corner Bistro. Of course, when it's 4 am on a weekend and I'm hungry, everything I've said goes totally out the window ... oh well
