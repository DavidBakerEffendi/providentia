We order from godfathers weekly. Everything is great. I like to think of myself as an Italian sub connoisseur and they prob have the best I've ever had. The key to a great sandwich is the bread and I believe they get theirs from sorrentos. Their buffalo wings are really great too which was unexpected. The Italian salad is excellent. I always ask for them to chop it up and they are happy to do so. My favorite pasta is the arrabbiata. All of their pizzas are good but the grandma pie is amazing. Also, don't miss the Nutella dessert pie. We dine there occasionally. The atmosphere is great and they have a raw bar. Enjoy!
