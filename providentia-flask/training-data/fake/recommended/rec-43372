I went Osteria for the 3rd time last night and for the for the 3rd time have been overly impressed. The service... They were able to anticipate every need we had. They knew what we needed before we knew it and by the time we figured it out, they were there ready to be of service. For example,we were early for our reservation so we went to the bar as we waited.  There were no seats but after a few seconds, and I mean seconds, a bar tender came out from behind the bar to give us a bar menu and took our order.  After the greeter let us know that our table was ready, the bar tender was out with the bill so we could settle up.  She even graciously asked if she could hold our jackets while we signed the bill. The Food. As always, the food was excellent.  I'm amazed at some of the reviews on here. There is a Menu full of amazing rustic Italian dishes and people order the most basic Pizza and give the restaurant 3 stars because they don't see what everyone was raving about. ??? I had a dish of fried Mozzarella with cold plum tomatoes that was very delicious but also very heavy. I also had a pasta dish with pork, cabbage and orange zest which was also fantastic. Now here is wear Osteria really impressed me. The meal was taking to come out longer than they thought it should.  We we were fine and were enjoying the conversation and not really thinking that things were taking too long.  Even so, our server brought out a simple plate of ravioli with thyme and mushrooms for us to share. I think I enjoyed the ravioli more than I did my main course. Then....to further apologize for something to which we had not even taken offense, they brought out a tray with four different desserts, gelato, a pine nut torte, a pastry shell with banana cream a passion fruit  cheesecake.  This was all to apologize.  We were blown away! We asked for coffee and told the waitress we were going to pay for it. All in all, a great experience!  We will definitely come back again!
