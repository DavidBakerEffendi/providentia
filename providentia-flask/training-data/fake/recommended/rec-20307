I love the fried chicken and waffles here. *Warning* The size of the chicken is enough to feed a small family and you should ask for more syrup, because the container of syrup they serve you must have been miniaturized.  However, my new absolute all time favorite is the herb crusted fish with creamy grits.  Oh.my.god.  I would sell a major organ for another taste of that...ok, maybe not.  But it was damn good.
