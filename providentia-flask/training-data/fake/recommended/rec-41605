We had a group of 12 for a business dinner during the week. We went family style and the food was fantastic, plentiful, well made and beautifully presented. The music and singers added so much to the dinner. My clients from Texas loves the authenticity, the tastes and atmosphere as did all of us!! Lots of fun, great food and super accommodating professional team. Franco, you are at the top of your game!
