Cozy little gem in the West Village.  Great food, amazing cheese selection and nice wine list.  The service was outstanding.  The place looks like it could be super snobby with its chic French wait staff, but it's the opposite!  Our waitress made great menu recommendations based on the wine we were drinking and she was spot on.  The oxtail marmalade was delicious.  Loved the cheeses she picked for us.  Can't wait to go back!
