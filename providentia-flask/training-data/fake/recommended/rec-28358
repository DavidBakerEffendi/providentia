I trekked out here from West Harlem to meet a friend who was raving about his local joint, and shit was he right.  Worth the train ride. This could easily be my new favorite bar.  Friendly people and friendly staff.  Great, original, simple menu.  I absolutely love this place. Dimly lit, rustic feel, with great beers on tap.  Drink menu was also very original. As for the food, I had the mac and cheese.  It was superb.  The beautiful young lady sitting next to me had a burger, which she also raved about.  Definitely regretting not getting her number. I'll be back.  Soon.  For the drinks, food and also that girls number.
