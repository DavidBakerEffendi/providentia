This was such a find!  I've visited New York several times and have never even heard of this restaurant.  I stumbled across it while browsing another travel guide (sorry, TripAdvisor!) and was as excited about the menu as I was that the restaurant itself is housed in the "Friends" apartment.  I decided to go for brunch, which was potentially risky since they don't take reservations for their weekend brunch. There's a subway station very nearby so it was easy to get to.  When I walked in, I was immediately greeted and seated at the bar.  I highly recommend sitting at the bar.  The restaurant is very tiny, even by New York standards, with only a handful of tables.  There are four chairs at the bar, which is also where the register is located.  Because I was traveling alone, it can sometimes be lonely/boring to eat by yourself, which is why the bar seating was favorable.  I had wonderful conversation with the staff as they prepared drinks and rang up customers.  You have a tiny peek into the equally small kitchen where you can watch your meals being made. The food was equally delicious.  I had their special of the day, which was brioche French toast, as well as a side of cheese grits.  Being from the south, I'm always a little skeptical of northerners attempting grits, but they were wonderful.  The French toast was two thick slices of brioche that was generously dusted with powdered sugar and drizzled with fresh strawberries.  They came served with a side of syrup that I wasted no time dousing all over. When they bring your check, its nestled inside of a guest book.  It was fun to glance a few of the comments as well as leave my own.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.  I've heard that their lunch and dinner menus are equally pleasing to the palate.
