First of all... You walk in and it smells of rotting fish.  That should've been our first clue!  Save the frustration and go to Sushi Village ten minutes down the street in little Falls for all you can eat sushi/sashimi! Sashimi on the all you can eat special is anything but fresh!  The service was bad, nay horrid.  I'm not sure how many times we asked for the udon soup a person in our party ordered but it never came.  Though a missing miso soup came with the ice cream dessert... Really?!   Our first waitress barely spoke English but tried to explain that they charge you $1 for every piece you don't eat.  Needless to say we didn't actually find this out until the end of the meal when the one English speaking person informed us in a less then polite way.  Sushi Village ten minutes down the road and doesn't charge unless you leave a huge plate of food, sashimi is fresher too!
