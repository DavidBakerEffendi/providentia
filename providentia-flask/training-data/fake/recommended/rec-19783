My husband and I decided to try a new spot for brunch lately and decided to Venture out to Carroll Gardens. Soooo glad we did!! We arrived 25 minutes before they opened and there was a line already forming, mostly parents with children. On our menu, grilled cheese, the buttermilk pancakes and pork chop and waffles. The buttermilk pancakes, as my husband put it, "out of this world!" I couldn't agree more. The grilled cheese was okay, nothing to write home about. The pork chop and waffles is good, just not as good as the chicken and waffles which are only offered on the dinner menu. Overall, it was great. My daughter loves the crayons they give out and thoroughly enjoyed the pancakes too. My advice, go early if you can and get the pancakes!!
