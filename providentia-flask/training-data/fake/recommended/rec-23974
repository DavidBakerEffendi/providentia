This is one of my favorite byob spots in the city.  If you want Italian food go here.  The restaurant is a nice size and typically decorated but the food is delicious and very fairly priced.  Add your own bottle of wine and you can't beat this place.  Not to mention the owner who is sure to check up on you during your dining experience.   When I mentioned how I was disappointed to  see the menu had changed as I was craving a certain dish he told me whatever I wanted they would make me whether it is on the menu or not!
