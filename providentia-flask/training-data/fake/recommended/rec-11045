I want into this society! My friend works here and raved about it. So we stopped by for dinner. It's a huge upgrade from the artful dodger. The space is light, airy, and rustic. There's lots of seating at table and at the big brass (or copper?) bar. From the beautifully decorated space to the drinks to the menu offerings this place was top notch. We started with cocktails which were inventive and tasty (liberal arts degree and woozles/boozes? Whatever it was called it was delicious with a kick of rhubarb.) the mushroom side dish was orgasmic with a chestnut crema, exotic mushrooms and a sweet touch of berries we couldn't decipher. The duck scrapple fris√©e was delicious, also with a sweet little something something that added to the flavor profile. And the scallops were served with corn cakes that looked like the scallops--and we're almost as tasty. Excited to go back for their new brunch and try the sticky bun French toast. And the rest of the drink menu.
