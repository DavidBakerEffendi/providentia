I rarely write reviews, but this place has such a terrible service, I'll never go back! When we got there we put our names down and the hostess said very rudely that it was a 45 min wait. So we waited... 30 min in, we asked the hostess, how long is the wait now, and she said 45 minutes. Baffled, we told her that 30 min had elapsed and she proceed to explain that the 45 min "wait" was an average, that it might be more than 45 min or less than 45 min. (thanks for explaining what an average is). Then she said (after we had already waited 35min), -well I have some tables by the door- and at this point all we wanted was to eat. The waitress took a good 15 min to greet us, took our order and never saw her again until we asked for the check. She took another 15 to come back with the change, and that's when I told her she was terrible and we were leaving a 10% tip. The food isn't great... honestly you can find better chicken at the food emporium/whole foods roasted chicken section. Also, it is really annoying that every 10 minutes they sign the happy birthday song at full volume... look I have nothing against birthdays, but turning the lights off and the volume is a little ridiculous Don't go to this place
