Live music every single night, waiters wearing stripes, a good wine list and some very fine beers, lightbulbs whose filament shows and a real water closet in the bathroom. Warm lentil salad, chicken dijonnaise with mashed potatoes, a very unique and delicious macaroni and cheese served with a side of applesauce (gotta love it) and for dessert--oh my lord--date cake with caramel sauce and whipped cream. Oh this place is very fine. Very fine, indeed.
