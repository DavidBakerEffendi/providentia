I finally found a BBQ joint that lived up to it's hype.  I can't wait to go back.  The prices were reasonable, the staff was warm and happy, the food outstanding.  They even had my favorite beer, Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Beer.  The only disappointing thing was that my corn bread was bland and a bit stale but I will forgive them for that.   I loved the decor and that the seats were not on top of one another.  I can't wait to go back.  Definitely make reservations though. It gets very crowded.
