I have been here a number of times and each time I want to come back for more! It is completely different than the old Schuyler Diner. They did a fabulous job remodeling, very clean and the decor takes you away from the typical diner feel. They have great burgers, wraps, paninis and breakfast items. It isn't too expensive and it has something for everyone's taste buds! And who couldn't love that extra 20% off your bill once you check into Yelp! ; ) My favorites are the buffalo chicken wrap and guacamole burger with sweet potato fries!
