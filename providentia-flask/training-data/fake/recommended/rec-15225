I want to give this 4 stars for the mozzarella/brussel sprouts/bacon appetizer.  But the pizza was just okay.  One thing that was confusing - one of the pizzas we got had bread crumbs as a topping on it - and bread crumbs were offered as an accompaniment for the other pizzas we got.  And the calamari appetizer we got also had breadcrumbs on it.  I'm convinced all the food we got would have been better if it did not have these bread crumbs on it.   Anyway, its booshy pizza + BYOB which I think is rare so that part is a plus.  I'd try it again and make sure anything i ordered didn't come with bread crumbs.
