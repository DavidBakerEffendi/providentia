This is hands down one of the best places in Fishtown! Every time I host out of town guests, we go here. The draft list is always full of great brews. Never had to look at the bottle menu, but it's large. The atmosphere is a small room and it's pretty intimate. Daytime has the nice daylight coming in and nighttime is nice and dim. The staff is always incredibly friendly and always familiar faces as it seems they stick around a long time. A very laid back feel to this place....but moving on to the best part...the food! I once ordered the veggie burger. Nothing special, but still great. My favorite thing ever is their vegan coconut club! It comes with a mound of the best fries (ask for old bay fries!). The sandwich is consistent. Just trust me on this one! I'll go there any time of day for it and usually don't leave with leftovers! Everyone I go with loves the menu because it caters to just about everyone. Vegans, meat eaters, picky eaters, etc. The only negative thing I do have to say about this place is that on weekend evenings it can get busy. The dining room is tight...not a big room for as busy as they get! And when it's packed in there-expect to yell to your dining partners! That's never stopped us from going and enjoying an incredible meal and incredible service!
