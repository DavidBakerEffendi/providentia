This place was awesome.  Great seafood and you can see the fish readily on display infront of the kitchen if you venture to the back.  We had the grilled red snapper, grilled octopus (awesome, best octopus I've ever had), potatoes, and spread.  I'd recommend all of those dishes.  All the food was very well prepared, great seasoning, and the way you'd expect authentic Greek food.  Restrained preparation featuring the ingredients.  Service was very good as well.  There was a little bit of a wait for a table of two, but it was well worth it.  I would definitely go back here and would actually try it for a larger group as it seems like it's best for a larger party (barring any waits). The big highlight of the night though was the octopus.  You can't go there and not try it.  GO THERE.  NOW.
