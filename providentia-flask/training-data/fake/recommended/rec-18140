Opted to try Osteria for an Anniversary dinner.  Based on all the hype this place had a lot to live up to, and we both agree it delivered.  Price isn't really a factor I consider for infrequent meals like this; you know it is going to be expensive and you need to just brace for that and enjoy the food & experience.   While overall I would not rate this as one of the "top" meals I've ever had, there were a few exceptional dishes to single out. First, the grilled octopus with lemon: the octopus was perfectly cooked, with a slight char and crispiness on the outside.  The smokey wood flavor paired with the acidic bite of the cured lemon was killer.  Definitely the most memorable octopus dish I've had anywhere.  Along with fresh Sicilian Lemonade, it was a solid way to kick things off.   The parma pizza with fontina and prosciutto was also excellent.  Rich and salty, but thin enough that it wasn't too much to eat before the pasta and meat dishes.  I liked the extra drizzle of olive oil on top.   Of all the other courses, what specifically stood out was the quality of the pasta (although I would have appreciated slightly larger portions).  They know what they are doing with pasta...and don't skimp on the butter.  The dish with trumpet mushrooms was something else.   Actually a bit disappointed in the rabbit dish.  The meat could have been more exciting, and the polenta was just eh (but then again, most polenta is just eh, so maybe my fault for ordering). The service was just fine...I'm never very interested in grading service and try not to let it influence an appreciation for what the chef is doing.  The sommelier did seem to take himself pretty seriously, but, that's just his job, and I'm sure some people are expecting supreme patronage at restaurants like this.   Overall, Osteria was very impressive from start to finish.  We had a great evening, and will definitely be back.
