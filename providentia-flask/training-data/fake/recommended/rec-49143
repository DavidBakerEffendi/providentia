We're from Chicago and thought we'd yelp for a NY restaurant on our last night there.  Decided to go to Joseph Leonard even though they don't take reservations.  In Chicago such as Longman and Eagle, you arrive and the host tells you there's a two hour wait and then a blank stare.  At Joseph Leonard, the host gave us a 30 minute wait time and said that he would call us on our cell when our table was ready.   Our experience got better from there.  We were seated at the "chef's table" and had several amuse-bouche throughout dinner.  And the chef was on that night.  We overhead him tell the staff to wear gloves because someone was allergic to shellfish.  He engaged in several conversation with us even though he was super busy.  In the end, the amazing food topped off our experience.  All the dishes we had were delicious and fresh.   Thank you Joseph Leonard for giving us one of the best meals and a quintessential New York experience.
