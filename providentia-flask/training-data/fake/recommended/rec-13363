I don't usually review spots when I'm on vacation, but The Spotted Pig was so delicious, I just had to. We had heard it was a long wait, so we arrived 15 minutes before dinner service began.  Umm, yeah, the wait was 2 hours.  The great thing is you can leave your number and shop your way through the West Village while you wait.  By the time our phone call came we were good n' hungry, but it was so worth the wait! The AMAZING -Chicken Liver Toast - we had read amazing reviews of this so we had to try it.  Despite our skepticism, this was a unanimous favorite of the night.  It had a chicken salad texture rather than the paste I was expecting.  Served on toast, we just couldn't get enough! -Ricotta Gnuddi with Brown Butter and Sage - so freakin' good.  I've never had gnuddi so I have nothing to compare it to, which might be a good thing (for the other restaurants I mean).  Pillows of hot, soft, rich ricotta pan fried ever so gently with buttery love and served in a creamy butter sage white sauce, they were delectable! -Wild Striped Bass with Cauliflower and Hazelnuts - the fish was cooked to perfection and the cauliflower puree with hazelnuts were the perfect additions. -Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort - EVERYONE in the restaurant  (and on Yelp!) ordered the burger so we had to try it.  You have to LOVE bleu cheese, because the roquefort is STRONG.  Personally it disgusts me, but my friend really enjoyed it.  The shoestring fries were prepared with roasted slivers of garlic and thyme and were just delicious.  Even after we pronounced we were full, we just kept eating them. The OK -Duck Rillette - spread on toast, this was very interesting.  It tasted like pureed pot pie to me, and had a sweetness to it.  I can't say if I liked it or not, it was just interesting. -Buffalo Buratta with Kale Pesto and Prosciutto - this was ok but not a stand out.   -Deviled Eggs - these were just ok.  Beware, they're super vinegar-y if you don't like that sort of thing.
