Quirky, informal, slow, cozy, delicious. The food here is amazing. Slow cooked BBQ ribs, pulled pork, fried chicken... On and on, this is a real culinary delight. This is not the usual fry it up joint, or even a standard bbq joint, this is crafting with care. Occasionally you will find one small item here or there that misses the mark a bit, but over and over again, their meals are so damn good. Don't come here expecting to rush, come here when you want to relax, enjoy the cozy inside or the pleasant garden. The service is a sometimes super attentive and friendly -- but often very slow -- the meals can take a while to come out. Go there *knowing* this, and also knowing that, oh man, when it does come out it's well worth it. In line with their informal, non-NY vibe, sometimes they aren't open when you show up earlier in the day. The posted hours are that they open at 11am, but I recommend calling ahead anytime you want to come by before 5pm to make sure they are there.
