BEST xiao long tang bao (Steamed soup dumpling: $5.95 for 8 pc) BEST scallion pancake ($2.95) BEST drunken chicken ($7.95) No really, it's amazing how a well-renowned Chinese restaurant can serve all these excellent food at cheap prices! The star of course is the XLTB. Be careful when you pick up a dumpling so that you don't break it, because it is filled with hot delicious soup that you do not want to waste! Once you carefully placed it on your spoon, break it so your spoon will be filled with the soup within. Don't try to directly bite the XLTB like a normal dumpling! It will be a hot mess. Be sure to get the golden pan-fried scallion pancake and the drunken chicken too! I haven't had a drunken chicken this good ever since my first drunken chicken dish in a high-end restaurant in Taiwan. It's cash only and you may have to wait for a while so be prepared. If you are visiting NYC Chinatown, you need to eat a meal here especially if you want stellar XLTB!
