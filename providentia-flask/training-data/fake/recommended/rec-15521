Dining at this adorable Italian place was a wonderful experience. They sat us right away on a Saturday night. I ordered the Petto Danatra (pan seared duck in thyme sauce with sauteed oyster mushrooms, spinach & fingerling potatoes). Â This dish was very delicious, rich in taste, and prepared very well. Furthermore, the entire dinner was very reasonably priced. I will definitely be returning!
