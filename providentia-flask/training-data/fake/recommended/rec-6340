Came here right when it opened around 5:30 to grab drinks and a couple appetizers before dinner later that night. We were seated at the communal table/bar thing. I found this really uncomfortable.. I like chairs where I can have my feet on the ground. The seats also close together, so when I put my bag on the hook, it kept knocking into my legs and probably those of the person next to me. Also, I was sitting right next to where all the clean cutlery/glasses were, so the waiters kept coming to that spot. Made me feel claustrophobic. Anyway, on to the food. The steamed pork buns are good. Sirloin tartare was good too.. I couldn't stop eating it. The spicy pork sausage and rice cakes were tasty as well. I normally don't like super spicy things, but this dish was fine. I liked the flavors in this dish the most, though it was a bit oily overall. Tried a couple cocktails. Applejack manhattan and Final word I think. Both were good, but a bit smaller than I thought they'd be for the price. If I were to return, it'd be to try the bo ssam pork shoulder with a larger group -- it looks amazing and I think I'd enjoy sitting amongst friends rather than strangers a lot more!
