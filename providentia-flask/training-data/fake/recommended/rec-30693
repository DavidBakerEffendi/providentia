This is really a fabulous burger ... I've never had anything else there (except the chicken wings while waiting for the burgers).  The waitresses are the best ... they are really busy so they seem abrupt, but they are just moving too fast.  The place is starting to realize that it's not so terrible to offer salad instead of potatoes with the burger ... a huge positive step. It's a classic pub atmosphere, and they keep the adult beverages moving, but they gotta do something about the sawdust.  Can't put anything on the floor , always in fear of slipping .... and it smells foul.
