All the food I've had here has been very creative and tasty, both for lunch and breakfast.  I especially love the chipotle-tinged guacamole they use on the BLT.  Stumptown coffee is very good and they do a nice job with it.  The atmosphere is quiet and relaxing, provided there aren't too many kids around.  The counter/wait staff is friendly and a few times they've even brought out free samples of other dishes that I assume are being tested in the kitchen or something.  I've only had one bad experience here, but that's what drove me to post a review. I took a friend here for breakfast on a Sunday morning a few weeks ago, though, and the vibe was really uncomfortable.  Someone -- the manager/head chef, I presume -- was loudly reaming out his staff pretty much the entire time we were there (which had to be an hour because there was a line to order and the food took a while to come out).  We were the last people to order food before the manager angrily told the counter guy not to take any more food orders.  As we waited for our breakfast, we heard manager berating his employees almost constantly, and we could hear this clearly even though we were seated on the far end of the place, opposite the kitchen.  Not ideal conditions for enjoying a meal. I don't necessarily fault Manager Dude for being angry.  It sounded like these were new employees, and if he demands perfection and this is just his management style or whatever, I get that.  But if you've laid your restaurant out like this, with a very exposed kitchen, you have to be cognizant of that fact!  Your customers do not want to hear you admonishing your employees' technique or cleaning skills.  Even if it were positive banter coming from the kitchen, it still would have been annoying during a hung-over Sunday breakfast, or any time, for that manner. I like this place a lot, I just hope this was a fluke occurrence.
