The sushi is really good here, and for $25 ish bucks you can't go wrong. The decor is really beautiful too, they did a great job with really interesting lighting and Asian decor. Now, there are two kinds of sushi places. The kind that is all you can eat and the full service type. You can eat from their full service menu but it will be more money than the all you can eat. I spoke to the sushi chef there, he told me that frozen fish reps tried to sell him their fish and Masa would not use it. All is fresh and you can tell the difference.
