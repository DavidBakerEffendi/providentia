I used to live a few miles from this joint and when I saw it on the Food Network, I hopped in my car and hit the road. I was on a mission... that's until I got lost. I pulled over next to a cop and asked for directions. Cops know good eats and he steered me in the right direction. I marched in and ordered two "rippas." (my attempts at a Joisey accent couldn't hide my Californian). The service was anything but friendly, but then again, that's Jersey. The casing split with rivers of grease in it. I hid them by smothering a thick layer of their mustard relish. The casing has a little crispness to it rather than the snap that I enjoy, It was good, but hot dogs are bad enough for you without the added grease. The little flavor that's added by deep frying wasn't enough to justify the added badness.
