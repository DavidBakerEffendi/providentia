We Love Ciro's. My BF always gets the White garlic pie and loves it! We have had the hot subs.... very good! Chicken fingers, great... mozz sticks delish. The best part are the people that work there. The ladies who answer are SO nice, and don't rush me off the phone. The delivery guys are ALWAYS so pleasant, EVERY time we order, they deliver with a smile and a "have a great night" :) Â WE LOVE CIROS! In fact we are waiting for the doorbell right now lol
