Totto ramen is authentic, simple, a slice of heaven in your bowl.  The wait is outrageous but if you go in group of 2s I think it helps.  We were 3 - kinda like a tetris piece that doesn't fit anywhere :(   At any rate, we ordered the pork belly on a bed of bean sprouts and the pork just melted in your mouth.  I was a little less crazy about their avotuna.  But I felt that their main show, ramen, was simply unbeatable.  Broth was light and clean, noodles were perfectly al dente, and the spicy sesame oil added just enough kick to make it very very flavorful.  We devoured our bowls in 7 minutes and walked out of there thinking how beautiful life is.  Addictive.
