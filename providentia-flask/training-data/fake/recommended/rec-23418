Came here with a brokleyn free beer coupon. The bartender was very nice and had no issue with us using it. We both ordered burgers (Turkey and beef) and both were huge and delicious and definitely good value for money. The overhead subway does make this place a little noisy but the decor is nice and I'd definitely go back.
