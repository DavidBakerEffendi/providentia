Dirt cheap, but even dirtier inside.  The hot and sour soup is easily among the worst I've had in NYC.  I'm dumbfounded by the people on here who are raving about the dumplings... they're just OK.  Plus, I found a hair in one of them.  I definitely would not go back and risk hepatitis A just to save a few bucks. Enjoy if you are Ebenezer Scrooge stingy and have no palette for Chinese food.
