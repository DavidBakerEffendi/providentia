I live practically next door to this place and have been several times for a weekend breakfast.  The service is great and even when it's crowded you can always seem to get a table.  The majority of the menu is homemade and very tasty. I walked in to make a dinner carry out order for the first time.  10-15 minutes went by and several employees, including a chef, assured me my food was coming.  Finally one waiter offered me a free drink, which I think is outstanding as far as service goes... so obviously I got wine.  Then another gentleman came out of the kitchen to tell me they were remaking my sandwich because it was now cold (they had been waiting on my sweet potato fries apparently).  So I had time to enoy my wine AND got a hot, really good meal in the end. DO NOTE that every time I've been for breakfast the food came out super quick.  So I'm not sure what the issue was for dinner but the fact that everyone in the restaurant seemed to acknowledge it and they offered something on the house in return, well that's why they get 5 stars.
