Went here last night with my girlfriend, we were pretty surprised by the place, its really nice, with a light up and heated outdoor eating area, inside was modern and new, bathrooms were nice.... Live music from a 4 person band was playing in the background, this place seems pretty sweet ! and its BYOB ! And then we tried the food.... bruschetta was pretty terrible, it was basically a garden salad, with 400 tomatoes, and 4 burnt little wafers of bread, very small hint of spices, garlic, and basil + olive oil, we didnt really like it too much we then ordered our entree with a ceasar salad ceasar salad was pretty bad, i typically destroy all the food in front of me, and i couldnt make it through half of my salad, same for my girlfriend too, we werent even sure if it had dressing on it or not, very leafy, odd spices, ehhhh, not too good, not remotely "ceasar salad-like" she got the chicken Parmesan with homemade penne, the penne was awesome, however it was very dry, they didnt use that much sauce at all for the pasta, the chicken was overcooked and dry, it almost appeared as if no sauce was used for this either, just chicken and cheese, she wasn't impressed and ended up taking half home (which sits in the fridge untouched)  i give it a 5 out of 10. i ordered the chicken eduardo,  the chicken was pretty good, yet was sorta chewy, they dumped about a half gallon of this red/pink sauce over the chicken, they sprinkled the chicken with a little bit of canned lump crab meat, which was a bad move.... it made the dish confusing, didnt really fit into the equation 4 tiny stems of asparagus were tossed on the outside of the plate, asparagus was good, wish it came with more, and this was all tossed on top of some semi burnt potato wedges, my plate was more like soup than dinner, way too much sauce, horrible crab meat, and rubbery chicken service was great, ambiance was great, lighting and cleaniless was great, however the food kinda sucked..... not sure if i'll be coming back again, sorry guys great place to bring a bottle of wine and grab an appetizer tho, good music, nice flow.... food is their only problem
