This restaurant is tight, tasty and fun.  The menu is short, just fish, seafood and fish, although there are burgers if you have one anti-fish person in your party.  My swordfish was perfectly cooked, and the vegetable melange and mashed potatoes that came with it were well prepared.  The corn crab chowder is too rich though, very creamy. My spouse had scallops, and he refused to share, so I can't  comment on them.  BYOB.
