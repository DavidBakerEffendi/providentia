Came here again for a sit-in dinner. I got the Valentine's roll -- IT IS BOMBIN. My friend got the Phoenix Roll (also bombin, so I hear) and another friend got their udon [1]. Again, only complaint is that the rice is not as soft and chewy as Sushi Gallery in the 2-subway station. Service is a little slow in getting out the menus and getting us our orders. But we also had no wait and great sushi, so it was still a solid dining experience [2]. [1] Not sure about the udon quality but that thing was HUGE and it had endless stuff in it. Like he was randomly pulling out mini octopuses, clams, tempura, etc etc from that udon. [2] Try to go a little early. There's usually a wait after 6!
