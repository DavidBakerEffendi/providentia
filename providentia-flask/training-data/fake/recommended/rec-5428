Terminal a location, wasn't expecting a Phillips here, but its nothing like it full fledge restaurants elsewhere.  But it did the trick for an above average lobster bisque, and great waffle fries.  They have a small tap of a Brooklyn, Sam's, their own amber, a few macros.   Would just go to the ruby tuesdays further down next time.
