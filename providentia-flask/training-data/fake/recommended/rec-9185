I went here last night with a group of people and it was just as everyone has said; terrific. I tried the "pizza of the day" and the polenta. The polenta was really good, but the pizza of the day was the best part. Funny, I'd had pizza already earlier that day because my fiance wanted to try New York style pizza. The first time he was disappointed, but this time he was in love. The neighborhood was out of the way for us, but worth the trek. Oh, and the decor, absolutely adorable.
