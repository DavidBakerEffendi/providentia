Really a two star for food, and a 3.5-ish for drink. Went on a Friday night, not too crowded but far from empty.  They were running a half off all international drafts and bottles special all night, which, given their very strong selection, was quite a fantastic deal.  I don't need Royal Tavern darkness, but Wishing Well was too bright for my tastes (comparable would be Tangiers).  Atmosphere was fine. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The food, however, was simply not good.  For an appetizer, I had the tuna tartar, which was adequate but too salty and grisly.  I also had the  SHAME burger, and I agree with Carrie M: dreadful.  She had it to the tee so I''ll just quote: " Yes, I ordered it because I had to find out how they were going to make something with those ingredients taste good (scraple, cheese, meat).  Answer:  They didn't.  It tastes like a greasy fast food chain sausage, smothered in American cheese, topped with beef, on a grocery-s tore bought hamburger bun."  To boot, it's a really unfortunate texture combination.  My friends both had the octopus, which neither enjoyed. In summary: seems like a decent place to watch a game and/or grab a few beers, but I can't imagine ever going to eat here again with the Royal only a few blocks away.
