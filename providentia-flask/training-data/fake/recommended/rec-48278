Read & heard most reviews, I should've read all of it-- Would've saved me the headache.   Servers were terrific but the bartender could've offered to have us sit at the bar and wait for the kitchen to open, instead he had us come back at 5p- that was a strike which i sadly ignored. We came back actually only to be told by host man he'll need our table by 8p. So in other words don't stay too long". Really? It was 5:30p!! Strike 2.  He need not worry because after 15mins of tasting our order (lumpia shanghai & the kare-kare chicken special), we asked to wrap the food & bring us our check.  Having known the cuisine, I was not impressed by this special dish. Overall, its probably a great place to visit if you're a tourist in NYC, & try the drinks or dessert, but not for a meal.
