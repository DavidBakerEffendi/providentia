I LOVE ramen and I LOVE Ippudo! My boyfriend and I came in here one night after catching a broadway show and it was the perfect meal to end a rainy night. Â The dishes are flavorful and bowls of soup comforting (i think I could literally survive off ramen for days/months if I could lol). I had the Akamaru Modern and it did not disappoint. The broth was a delicate balance of flavors while the noodles had a perfect bite as any good noodle should. The ambiance is pleasant and the staff is friendly and attentive. It's a restaurant worth the hype. Def going back
