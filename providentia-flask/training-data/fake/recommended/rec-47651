So, didnt feel like waiting in line hours for pizza at the other New Haven pizza hot spots, and stayed at the Omni - which was about 2 blocks from here and thought it was great.  Good little brewery, solid beer, and liked my pizza.  Small was HUGE and couldn't even eat it all at one sitting.  Also in an old garage looking place, with garage doors, brick look and vibe, which was really cool.  Good for individuals or families with kids too, as I saw several of those as well for dinner. Noticed some of the people on yelp complaining that the place only hires hot girls, and they were not too helpful.... well, hiring hot girls sounds like a wise decision, b/c who likes beer and pizza the most?? That's right -- MEN.   So I decided to check it out and see --- and low and behold, the girls all were young hotties (Minus the one dude server, not sure the deal with that!).  But I found my bartender to be very helpful, friendly and I never had to wait for service at bar.  So my guess is people complaining were just haters and that's why their service was not as good.   So I recommend you go, imbibe and enjoy the food, beer and scenery!
