I love orange.  I love orange buildings where they offer orange things to eat and drink, then use the orange fruit pulp to mulch the orange marigolds in the orange-rimmed tree lawns out front.  If Mood Café's "mood" is reflected by their color scheme, then that works for me. Also the Mood offers vegan lassi in 20+ flavours.  However, the Mood uses almond milk, which tends to overpower the fruit--Maybe switch to rice milk so that we can taste the fruit? Now all that Baltimore Ave needs are dosas and a proper kati roll and we'll be good to go...
