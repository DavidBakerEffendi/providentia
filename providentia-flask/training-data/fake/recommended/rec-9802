I just don't understand why everyone is in love with this place. I've been back several times to TRY to like it. Even through the 2 hour waits and $15+/bowl price tags, I still TRY...and FAIL every time to see the charm. Ippudo just seems to me like a modern, fusion, overpriced ramen place with some pretty innovative, but underwhelming dishes. The noodles don't even taste fresh to me. The pork slices are razor thin, and what? I only get HALF an egg? The appetizers are decently good, but portions are so tiny, its got me licking the plates just to get my money's worth. I'd rather trade a seat on those fancy 2 sided chairs for a stool at Totto or Minca. At least I'll get a whole egg. Yay.
