Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! Finally authentic Mexican food. Super clean bathroom, clean tables etc. great tasting Horchata, and Limonada. Every dish we've ordered has been beautiful & tasty. I love the chicken tacos, the salsa is tasty but not too hot and the Enchiladas Huertas were a good variety of flavor. It has all been amazing and look forward to many visits at Monte Alban. My Husband & I have visited them for Saturday morning breakfast. You will not find anything like it in the area. If you can't decide go with the chorizo y papas burrito with green chile. It's amazing. Half of it will satisfy one person. Along with the Horchata, can't beat it.For lunch or dinner, the gorditas, enchiladas nortenas, or any taco dish will satisfy the not just your huger craving, authentic, good food craving.
