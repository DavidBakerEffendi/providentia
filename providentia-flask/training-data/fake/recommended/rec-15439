Been there three times and I always get the same thing. The roasted chicken is extremely delicious and moist. My friend always gets the chicken noodle soup. I do wish their appetizer menu was more varied, but they're still new and surely will be changing it up as they go along. Pricey, but great for a special dinner or just drinks.
