We think these are the best crepes in town and we've tried the other two places. We like it best because it's got a nice vibe, bench seating and yummy crepes. Reminds us of our overseas travels. The waitstaff is cheerful. We have only ever gotten the crepes so not sure about other dishes. Great for a special treat (sweet ones) or savory for a nice brunch or lunch. I will admit that it depends on who is cooking. Recently however (and we go weekly) the cooking has been perfect for the crepes. Earlier this year, there was one chef that we learned to avoid. The butter-sugar however are not worth it. Crepe is too thick for that, but no one else in town has got those right either. Nutella with bananas and strawberries great as are ham and cheese and egg and prosciutto.
