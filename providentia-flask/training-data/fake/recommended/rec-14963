I will preface everything by acknowledging this is probably the best chaat in Philly.  Not that there is much competition (besides themselves at Desi Chaat house).   I thought I had ordered a beef chaat (26) and a mango lassi (1) - but the owner thought I had ordered a veggie chaat (which was also 1, but on the chaat board) and a beef chaat, so he ended up making two chats for me.  I explained to him I thought I had ordered a lassi and a chaat as opposed to two different chaats.  He asked me if I wanted a lassi, but I wasn't about to spend more money on the meal.  There was a line of people waiting for food, so I was just being sport about and bought the two chaats and figured I'd eat the second one later.   I just thought from a customer service perspective the owner would have acknowledged that it was his mistake for not clarifying my order.  I also think he shouldn't have charged me for the chaat I told him I didn't know I had ordered.  Granted, it was my fault for not being more aware of the entire menu, but with the uniqueness of the menu format (on the wall, Chalk, with different menu items next to the same numbers). It had rained outside when we were there, the owners helper was moving a floormat next to the door - he threw the mat on the floor right next to me while I was eating and dirty water splattered all over me.  I wasn't about to make a scene, but I thought that it was totally disrespectful.   I thought the chaat was good, but at the end of the day, it's just microwaved meat on top of some chips and sauce.  I would probably go to Desi Chaat House again, but I will never go to the Mood Cafe again.
