i'm a starr girl. big fan of his. this is a great diner, with a warm feeling to it. the martini olive lighting gives it a chichi, posh look of an older era. great drink concoctions and the food speaks for itself. this isn't a burger and fries type of diner. starr puts a twist on the definition of diner here. btw, i would pay for the thai beef salad to be put back on the menu. *drool*
