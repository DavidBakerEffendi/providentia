The best Thai food in NYC. There's a reason the line is out the door nearly all hours of the day, and it's packed like sardines. Also, super affordable and you get a lot for what you order! The music is funny, it's like a club took all of Gangnam Style and it's relatives and blasts it. Find a bar nearby to wait, or go during a slower part of a day... which I tried and still waited for 10 minutes, it's that good!
