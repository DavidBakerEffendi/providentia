Very expensive for the area, food was ok.. Nothing special. I overheard one server, maybe a manager, yelling at the other servers to get out of their prep station where they keep bread, coffee etc.. That alone ruined my experience.. No need to talk to your employees like that.. Everyone there must hate their jobs, that's probably why the service is horrible.. Can't wait to see what restaurant this turns into next..
