Stumbled in here on a snowy Friday night before a show at Curio Theater.  Best mussels ever (in a kind of Moroccan-tasting jalapeno sauce) - so good that we ended up dipping the risotto balls in the sauce.  The lamb shanks were tender and perfectly seasoned.  My chicken was a little over-cooked, but so flavorful that it didn't matter.   Just sorry this isn't closer.  On the other hand, nice to have a go-to place in West Philly.
