SOLID Thai food and nice ambiance where you can take a date or catch up with friends since its not too loud (plus, there's a full bar!) Kang Gai - red curry with chicken - SPICY and DELICIOUS! Would definitely go again! Plus, Trader Joe's is a few blocks away for some after dinner food shopping! Â ENJOY!
