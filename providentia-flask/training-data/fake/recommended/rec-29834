It's a great pizza and overall a thoroughly enjoyable experience 3 of us shared a large margarita pizza with Italian sausage & red onions, what really stood out was the sweetness & freshness of the tomato sauce. The service was very friendly & prompt right from seating us to all the way thru. I doubt some of the claims I have read that it's New York's first Pizzeria since I never saw anything like that inside the place and they were doing good bit of self promotion inside but it does give you the feel of classic New York Little Italy experience, the cavernous interiors, the rustic decor, the limited take it or leave it menu! Along with the pizzas they have good selection of beers & wines.
