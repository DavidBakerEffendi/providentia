Used the Groupon deal on a Friday night in January. It was dead inside. We had a reservation, but definitely not needed. I imagine it might be busier in warmer weather when you can sit outside on the water. The inside is dark, in a good on an old ship way. You could say it is outdated, but overall a neat place to have a meal. We had a table with a great view of the bridge. First, I will say the service was excellent. Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable. She quickly brought out warm rolls and took our order. We started with the salt and pepper shrimp which were actually really delicious and was a great size for sharing between 2 people. Unfortunately, this is where the food stopped being great. I ordered the scallops with the gnocchi and port sauce. This meal was so disappointing, especially at $32. The scallops were grey, rubbery, and lacked any real flavor. The gnocchi tastes like french toast and the vegetables were basically a mix of brussel sprouts and undercooked carrots. Very strange combination that I really regret picking off the menu. My fiancee got the ribeye with crabmeat. While the meat was cooked okay, the crab was mushy and quite unedible. For $50 this is not acceptable. We chose to skip dessert based on our entrees. I really think this place has potential to be a cool dining destination, but their entrees need a lot of work and their prices are just too expensive. Even with the Groupon deal, I felt we overpaid for what we ate. There are much better places to go in Philly for less money. I will not return to the Moshulu anytime soon.
