Another one of the touted "Best Burgers" in NYC, I'd have to say that Corner Bistro fell short. Certainly a good sized, plump burger and cooked precisely to order and in prompt fashion (despite the packed house and ever-growing line).  It's not a bad burger - it just falls short of what this city has to offer.  The patty was blatantly under seasoned, and lacked the juiciness and general depth of flavor that other burger joints in the city have been able to achieve with their various specialty blends. Plus, with lines that grow and multiply at alarming rates, especially during peak hours, I would have to say that this is NOT one of the places that I would endure an extended wait if you are hoping to be rewarded for your troubles by an outstanding burger at the end of it all.
