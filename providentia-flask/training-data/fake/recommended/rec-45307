I went here for my birthday dinner last week and I was really blown away. I heard great things about this restaurant and it exceeded my expectations. The atmosphere is lovely and the food was outstanding. I really enjoyed the fusilli (the homemade pasta is amazing)and the Dorade was really tender and creatively prepared. Best of all was the exceptional customer service. We were given free Prosecco because my partner let the waiter know it was my birthday and they didn't charge us for our dessert - a divine dark chocolate pudding. Thanks for making my birthday so delicious!
