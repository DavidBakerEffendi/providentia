After a long day at the Met, my gf and I met up with a friend at Scarpetta to recharge and get our Italian fix in NY before heading back home to Baltimore. The bread basket is certainly one of the better bread baskets I have come across in my life. For appetizers, we ordered the Fritto Misto and the Truffled Mushroom Polenta. The fritto was perfectly fried and surprisingly light. The rich and creamy polenta lives up to its reputation and is one of the best preparations I have had. We had three pastas: the black taglionlini, the duck foie gras ravioli, and the famous spaghetti w/ basil. The black tagliolini was delicate and fresh, dressed lightly with chopped bits of seafood, though I longed for a more intense flavor. The duck foie gras ravioli was to me one-dimensional, though everyone else loved it. The spaghetti was the best pasta dish of the night for me, it's flavor rich and homey. I could eat bowls of this every night! For entrees, we shared the Black Cod and the Capretto. Both were perfectly executed. The cod was flawlessly cooked, with crispy skin providing a nice contrast to the juicy meat and subtly sweet sauce it was sitting on. The Capretto was awesome as well, accompanied by perfectly roasted diced potatoes and a sauce as delightful as it was complex. Desserts were nice, but nothing spectacular. We had banana budino and date bread pudding, the budino being the better of the two. I expected the pasta dishes to be the highlight of our meal, but I actually have to admit to enjoying the entrees more. Pretty pricey meal at the end of the day, definitely a spot for a special night out. Don't miss the polenta, spaghetti, black cod, and capretto!
