By far, my most fave restaurant in the East Village, I have yet to try anything on the menu that isn't positvely BEAUTIFUL to eat! Romantic, gorgeous, excellent service and delish with totally reasonable prices and an amazing wine list makes this a most perfect date spot. LOVE! Def get a reservation and they'll still make you wait, but it's worth it!
