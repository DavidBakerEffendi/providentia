i think the first time i went to this truck was waaaaaaaay back when i went to temple.  being a student who had a ton of classes in buery hall, naturally i went here at least once a week.  studying for finals a group of us ate 3 of these huge babies each throughout the day.  it was a tough challenege we all came through with flying colors, and a couple of "craps".  Ahem, crepes.  the dudes at the truck are the best, if you go a lot they will give you free sodas everyonce in a while and are always nice.  they are always playing crap classic rock way loud.  the only other place to eat on campus is the thai place where the little lady screams "chicken buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun" at the top of her lungs! also friz had a thing for the girl that used to work there with the super "frizzy" long brown hair.  i always dream of them hooking up so we all could get more freebies, but alas it never materialized.   crepe truck you are my muse!
