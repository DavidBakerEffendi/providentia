There are a ton of Italian restaurants in NYC so I'm not saying Aurora is the absolute best in NYC. BUT, every time we dine here we leave happy, full and satisfied. Food is always consistently great. Service is personal, engaging and attentive but not over the top. It's usually fairly easy to get a table for two and its a great location. Their fritto is our favorite! Unique drinks too. Highly recommend aurora. Whenever we are in NY we head there.
