I'd move to Red Hook for Petite Crevette. It's daily catch of seafood. The board always shows the daily specials which is worth a try. Favorites have been cioppino, red snapper, tuna burgers-- and whoah-- the meat burger really rocks. Atmosphere is so cozy, warm and intimate-- very date worthy. Cash only, no delivery, but you can take out.
