Too much of anything is never a good thing huh?  Well, I kind of love this place. We get catered food from Chinatown maybe one or two Mondays a month. These are usually the days where the line to get food in our office is so long that we have bodies pushed up against the glass partitions for one of our other departments. They have served veggie lo mein, veggie fried rice, chicken and broccoli, beef and broccoli, boneless spare ribs, shrimp tempura rolls, california rolls, sweet potato rolls, spring rolls, and if we're lucky the garlic harbor shrimp. I can rate everything that is Chinese about a 4/5. The Garlic Harbor shrimp and spring rolls would be 5/5. The Japanese sushi however a 3/5 due to the fact they are usually prepared early and displayed for a few hours rather than made fresh on the spot(rice is softer).  I've also have had Chinatown deliver a few times and they were quick to deliver most of the time. Even when an older lady was late with delivery, she gave me like $5 off the order and left before I was even able to give a tip(drove there after work and dropped it off to her). I occasionally ordered from a spot a few doors down (5 grains) but when comparing the two Chinatown holds down Harrison when it comes to quality Chinese food. Plus if you go to dine in, it does look a lot better than a majority of Chinese spots in the are. The one thing factor giving this place a 4/5 rather than 5/5 is the prices. They are a little high in my opinion, but the quality is better than most, but still overpriced slightly.
