A warm, welcoming spot to greet us from the cold. I stumbled across Miriam as I was riding down 5th ave in search of a good place for dinner. The menu consists of Palestinian/Israeli/Levant and North African and Mediterranean foods. The waitstaff is very friendly and the food was good. Try the couscous plates if you would like a generous portion. The hot cider cocktail hit the spot and the merguez sausage is very good. The ambience is nice. A nice fusion of North Africa meets Israeli/Levant.
