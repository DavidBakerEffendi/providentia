My boyfriend took me to Fitler this past week for a congratulatory I got a new job dinner. We sat in a romantic booth and took it all in. The atmosphere is very casual, the space is teeny, and the open kitchen is great...all of which enhance the experience. Fitler seems like the perfect girl next door...unpretentious and filled with locals on a random week night. Standouts from the meal were the house baked rolls, the gnocchi, and the pumpkin cheesecake. The gnocchi was heavenly and light and I would have been happy eating a whole bowl. We also had the mushroom soup, bluefish croquettes, and the duck breast over lentils. We weren't in love with the soup or croquettes, but both still solid options. The service was great, and they comped us each a drink and our dessert which was a very nice and unexpected touch. While some of the food didn't blow me away, I loved our experience at Fitler Dining Room. It's the perfect cozy place to have around the corner, and I foresee coming back many times this winter. Also can't wait to try their cheese. Tip: full bar with the option to BYO for a $10 corkage fee.
