Been hearing about this place and had to try it. It's quite swanky on the inside and has a very lounge-y feel. Oh, and being located in the middle of Hell's Kitchen, you get a quite fabulous looking crowd. Now for the food: - Papaya Salad: Not very good at all. Very bland and boring. Was disappointed in this because it's easy enough to do right. - Assorted Golden Fritters: Amazing! An appetizer in which you get two servings of each item!! A great way to satisfy everyone's needs: fried dumplings, fried shrimp rolls, fried veggie rolls and fried tofu rolls! All very flavorful. - Spicy Basil Noodles with Beef: Ordered this medium and it was pretty good. Probably should've ordered it spicy. Note to self next time around. It was pretty standard fare. I should've gone a more adventurous route. Cocktails: (the bartenders here KNOW how to make a cocktail!) - Room with a View: a cross between a lychee and passion fruit martini. Simply delicious. - Detox (I'm sure it was labeled something more elaborate but I forgot): Vodka based with hints of honey, ginger and pomegranate and another type of juice, I think? Thought this was going to be overly sweet but it wasn't. The grated ginger into the cocktail was a nice touch, especially for ginger lovers! A cute, inexpensive, intimate, date spot! Will be back! It can get quite loud with all the chatter, but the ambiance is nice.
