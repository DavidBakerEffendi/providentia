Nice friendly staff and the food is beyond delicious!! Don't be afraid to turn those cards over to red every once in awhile to breath and enjoy the meats you already have.  When you flip back to green your plate will be full in 30 seconds!   If however you are looking for a quiet intimate dinner this is not the place for you.
