To be honest, sometimes I'm skeptical about price-fix menus. Yes, the food comes at a slight smaller portion. But that's to be expected. In past experiences, sometimes even the quality/flavor lacks that luster that you would find in their regular dishes. Not here. No way, no how. Bengal Tiger Indian Food packs quite a punch when it comes to their cuisine. Located on the 2nd floor, Bengal Tiger is a cozy, bright little space. There's not much seating to go around so if you plan on coming for a bite... arrive before that dinner rush. They have beautiful artwork/phrases from wall to wall with those classic warm as well as jewel tones... very inviting. I was meeting my friend after work and we got there JUST in time. We managed to snag the last spot since a portion of the restaurant was conquered by a meetup group. Although a tight space, we sat comfortably. Vegetarians, have no fear. You have options here! (Rhyme not intended.) My friend had plenty of meatless options which was great. For the price of $16.95, you get an appetizer, entree and dessert. Not bad IMO. App/Veggie Samosa: Phenomenal. The outside is crispy and the inside was generously seasoned filled with potato and peas. And it was on top of a green & red sauce that had quite the kick. Let's just say I asked for a personal pitcher of water. Entree/Chicken TIkka Masala: Had to go with the classic choice, of course Indian spicy. (Go big or go home!) The chicken was extremely tender and there was just the right amount of sauce to meat ratio. The layers and depth of earthiness and savory flavors were on par. Dessert/Kheer: I'm a rice pudding lover. Add cashews? Spices? Home run. All in all, I highly recommend Bengal Tiger. There's unlimited basmati rice and their Naan is superb. The prices won't burn a hole in your wallet and they don't sacrifice on the spice. Staff was incredibly friendly and my water glass was never empty. This is a fantastic little spot to satisfy all your Indian Food cravings.
