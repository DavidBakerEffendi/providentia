Love, Love, Love, this restaurant! The food is amazing and the wait staff is equally as wonderful.  We have been here a number of times and have never had a bad experience.  Their garlic shrimp is perfectly cooked and tasty.  Their ham and cheese croquettes are one of my favorite things to eat here.  The flamenco shows are awesome.  Oh, and the drinks are priced well and are tasty but pack a punch.  Can't wait to go back!
