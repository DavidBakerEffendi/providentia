Waiting for over an hour gets your appetite going and your saliva flowing.  So when I sit down, I should be excited with my napkin tucked into my shirt and my chopsticks in my right hand ready to down some Ramen.  For 14 bucks and tip, I expected more not only in quantity but in quality.  I got the Akamaru Modern which is okay, not the best I've had but not the worst.  The atmosphere is fun and the staff is helpful and nice but my check made me cringe. I think I get more satisfaction making my own ramen at home... but then again, my friends will ditch me
