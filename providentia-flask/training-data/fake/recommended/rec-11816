I need to come here more often. The food's tasty and the place is so big it's reliably easy to get a table, even last minute on the weekends. There's a nice lounge area with low tables and chairs, a bar, and two floors of dining area. I've been here for dinner several times but yesterday was the first time I tried it for brunch. I had the truffle eggs benedict and it was fabulous! The best part of ilili is the balanced menu of savory meats & veggies that's intended to be shared. Appropriate for brunch, lunch, or dinner, parties of 2 or parties of 8, new friends, old friends, dates, birthdays, quick bites... you get the trend.
