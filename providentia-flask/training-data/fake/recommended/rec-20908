I recently visited The Smith with a friend and was thoroughly impressed. The atmosphere is perfect for someone my age, a fresh college graduate, as it was a bit loud and filled with energy. I sat tucked in a corner an had a full view of the entire restaurant. I found it interesting that they have a rather large table in the middle of the restaurant where people of different parties can sit together and mingle. As for the food- DELICIOUS. The best meat I've ever had. So tender you didn't need to cut it with a knife. (I had some sort of braised ribs with potatoes, I don't recall the actual name. It was the only one like it on the menu though.) I would certainly go back anytime! Tasty.
