They specialize in honey crust, their white pizza pie is topped with parmegiano and garlic, red pie with sauce and mozzarella, yum. Their topings are anchivies, chicken, meatballs, italian sausage, fresh basil, fresh tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, green peppers, and anything else you wish for. The honey is optional but it's quite nice if you are craving for something new and different, they only do the edge and don't wollop it on, just very subtly brush a little bit on. Besides great pizza you may have hot or mild wings, desserts, beer soft drinks or vino. It's not elegant at all you can comfortably go in jeans and a nice shirt. The dining is family style, three rows of tables set up length wise along the dining room. There is a bar to sit at and a big screen tv. One thing I really like about this place is that they also have live music. A  live big band playing from 8PM to 11PM on Monday nights. but I just hate when people have live entertainment and come to stare at the tv??? P.S. No big band on the memorial weekend though, just letting you know so you don't  plan to go and there is no  music. Lately my sweatheart has been joining them and singing the standards, the whole place comes alive when he sings, everyone is very happy and people request their favorite songs. Really worth checking them out. Hugs. Kat
