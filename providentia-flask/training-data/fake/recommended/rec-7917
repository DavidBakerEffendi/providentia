It was ok. The butter pasta looked like it had a whole stick of butter in it, but otherwise it was good. The beet and pomegranate punch was sour, but if you add some sugar, it's good. The avocado blt was really good. The cheese burger should get 3 stars, my brother told me. The mushroom omelet gets 4 stars, said my dad. The service was good, though. Great place to eat.
