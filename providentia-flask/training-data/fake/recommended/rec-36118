We recently visited this restaurant and had a great experience. Naturally we ordered the steak frites and yes, they were amazing. The sitting arrangement is quite tight, but we didn't mind because many restaurants in New York have the same cramped quarters and frankly, that's one of the things I look forward to when we visit NY. We live in Houston and the two cities are very different as Houston is very laid back and much quieter than NY. Even though this restaurant is super busy and everyone is running around attending to their customers, they still managed to bring us a glass of champagne that our uncle in Texas called in and ordered for us in celebration of our recent marriage. Our waitress, Robin, was warm, cheerful and efficient. She made some great suggestions on what we should order and we really appreciated her suggestions. She didn't act like she wanted us to order, eat and leave quickly because she needed to turn tables quickly. We made reservations for Sunday brunch and didn't have to wait at all. We were seated about 3 minutes after we got there. This place may not be for everyone, but for those who enjoy a lively, bustling atmosphere, with a great waitstaff and excellent food - then this is an ideal restaurant for you!
