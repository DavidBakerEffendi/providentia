Perilla is a low key place with a lot of flavor.  That's my kind of place!  I don't remember exactly what I ordered, but I do remember having many exotic dishes (duck, meatballs,) that went smoothly with the excellent red wine that I was having.  The chef is creative, the food is unique & gourmet.  I hope to be back again soon, with friends in tow...!
