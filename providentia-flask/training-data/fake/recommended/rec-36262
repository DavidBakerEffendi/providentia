Off the street, L'Artusi is a tad hard to find.  Inside, you are glad you found it.  This is excellent Italian food.  Small portions but taste quantity yields to copious amounts of quality.  Enjoyed tartar, eschiotto (a sausage pasta dish) change my outlook on what is delicious.  Olive oil cake was great.
