My friends and I enjoyed a fun Saturday night dinner here recently.  The place was CROWDED, but in spite of that fact, our food came out at an absurdly rapid clip.  (It was almost too fast--later, nursing a surfeit of Pancho Nachos at the Standard Tap, one of my dining partners and I wondered if we would ever not feel like fat tubs of lard ever again.)   The cocktail I had, the Texas Tea, was basically sweet tea with peach vodka, I think.  It was delicious--not too sugary--and will be perfect in the summertime.  Come to think of it, I see ECR really blossoming in the warmer months--it just seems like the perfect kind of airy spot to enjoy on a midweek August evening.   Oh, I also had the S'mores bread pudding for dessert, which was absolutely decadent.   The coolest part about this place is that you get a new hipster server every time you need something, so by the end of the night, you've been served by like, 5 totally different dudes, all with varying degrees of Jesus hair and body fat percentages in the single digits.  It's amazing that none of them screwed up an order!
