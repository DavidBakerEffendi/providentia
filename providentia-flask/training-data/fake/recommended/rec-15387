The Food - Solid 3-4 stars. The cheese selection is amazing. Normally you get a very small amount of cheese on a cheese plate but this was hearty and delicious. The jumbo shrimp was also a good 3.5 stars. The Service - Good service. The waitress seemed to be very impatient with us placing our order. Once it was clear we were taking our time enjoying appetizers and conversation, she left us alone for a long time without checking in (granted they were really busy). The Ambiance - We asked to be seated in the back garden area and it was beautiful, intimate and really comfortable. I would definitely go here again as the food was good and the ambiance was excellent.
