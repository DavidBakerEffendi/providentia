We went on a Sunday for brunch, and my mate was instantly skittish of the line snaking 'round the block.  We asked the group in front of us how long they thought the wait might be, and the woman, all wide-eyed, said, "You've never been here before?  You barely have to wait.  It's huge inside. It's SO good." Well, with that endorsement, we stayed on line - and I'm so happy we did.  Someone came around to feed us orange slices and strawberries with whipped cream while we waited.  And oh yes, that wait was merely 10 minutes! We ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes, eggs, sausage, bacon and the grilled chicken. Everything came out lickety-split and the coffee was served in the normal-sized mugs (not the small diner-sized ones) - and piping hot. Pancakes were by far the best we've ever had!  And the bacon for me was cooked to perfection.  The only thing a little disappointing was the grilled chicken - a bit tough and dry, but they have this house-made chipotle tartar sauce on the table that they try to push and it somehow saved the chicken in the end. Service was so friendly and efficient.  Great bustling vibe - never overwhelming. What a fun neighborhood spot. I would come here every weekend!
