There are many reasons to love Song. Unfortunately, its food just isn't one of them. For the money, it's the best deal in Park Slope. The dishes are both cheap (most under $8) and plentiful, and though nothing will blow your mind, noodle dishes, soups, appetizers and entrees all arrive consistently hot, larger than you expected, and vaguely spicy. This is, sadly, the most you can say for it. My Tom Ka Gai arrived with the chicken tasting as plain as if it had been boiled in water, and the mushrooms absolutely uncooked. Staples like Pad Thai are just a little too greasy, a little too bland, a little too mediocre. It's the sort of take-out food you eat when you're on a budget and want to believe you can supply yourself with something more nourishing than Top Ramen. Song manages this level of competence, but only just. The atmosphere is Song's redemption. The DJ is both intrinsically cooler than everyone in the room and understands the exact level of bass that conversation can bear. The music is always on, always good, and always something you can't remember having heard before, but you like it. You wish that you could get a list of all songs played during your visit with your receipt. The staff is friendly and so are the cooks - if you come in on a busy night as part of a twosome, you can snag the two stools at the stone bar facing into the kitchen, where you can watch as what you believed is confirmed: the same spices go into everything. Song's sleek silver decor and highly maintained bar also count for something, though the bartender is easily stumped by drink requests. Song's a pretty box with a mediocre present inside, but I suppose it's the thought that counts.
