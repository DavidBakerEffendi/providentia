A simple coffee shop/sandwich purveyor this is not; the place offers a host of quality sandwiches made on delicious bread and awesome coffee that even a European/Aussie would love--I know, I asked some. The interior is open and welcoming thanks to the large windows they open on balmy days-- and the friendly staff as well. An added perk is that they do almond milk! Delicious almond milk latte just MAKES my Saturday. Also, if you want a beer to take home, they have a bit of a store in the back that sells beers and other odds and ends.
