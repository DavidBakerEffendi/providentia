Every time I come here, I beg my group to order the pork shoulder dinner to no avail. Yet everything we order is always amazing! Â Think fried duck necks, fresh oysters, different types of sliced cured ham, lamb, fish, beef - and all of it doesn't taste like what you expect it to taste, it's a party in your mouth! No 5 stars cause I still had to ask for water refills...
