We have eaten here twice while visiting New York. The first time, we enjoyed the evening atmosphere and had the fried chicken and waffles. The maple syrup served along with it is white good, and the fried chicken is remarkable. This is coming from a Georgia girl. On our second visit, we had the mac & cheese waffles with fried pork chops. Not as exciting as the fried chicken and waffles from our first visit, but good nonetheless. We will be back soon.
