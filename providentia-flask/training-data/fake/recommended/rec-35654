Very disappointing menu, food way below average! I've been to tapas bars in Madrid, Barcelona, malaga and Marbella, as well as othe locations in the US and overseas. This has to be the worst. Lamb is tasteless, duck tastes terrible, complimentary air holes, as well as watered down sangria. Wouldn't recommend it to my worst ennemy! Stay away, save yourself a few bucks!!!
