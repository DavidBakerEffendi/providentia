I went to Benvenuti for a corporate lunch and it was a fantastic experience. The staff was very nice and the food was great. I had the Chicken Marsala lunch special which came with a choice of soup or salad, included your choice of pasta, great bread, and coffee or tea. All of this for only $11/$12. I would recommend Benvenuti to anyone interested in a great meal at a great price. Plus it's BYOB!!!
