I've got to say I still love their food but when you go to this place when it is really busy the service is super slow.  If the place is packed I think the wait staff gets flustered and can't tell who was helped or not since its a "seat yourself" place.  On one occasion I went with my husband and waited 20min to be helped but then just left because it was too busy.
