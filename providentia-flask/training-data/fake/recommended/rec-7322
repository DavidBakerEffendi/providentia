Delicious! This place is so cute! The cocktails are excellent - I had the Vodka and Soda and I could not taste the alcohol (but still got a buzz going). Went here late on a Saturday night. Note to self: don't try to make a reservation for a popular restaurant in Manhattan on the morning of your dinner. You will end up with a 10:15pm reservation. But I digress. Went here with a friend and we shared the bone marrow, ribeye, and brussel sprouts. Also got a bottle of wine which was also really good. All of the food was amazing!! The ribeye was flavorful and tender. And the vibe was really trendy. Felt like we were out without having to scream at each other to talk. Loved it and will definitely be back.
