Something has changed here. The buffet today was so disappointing. The spicy flavor I drive here for was totally missing. No authentic south indian curry - just the flavorless plantain. Dosas were bad. Sambar I couldn't even get to take. Rasam was the only saving grace I think. Sorry this was my most favorite south indian place in NJ. Not any more.
