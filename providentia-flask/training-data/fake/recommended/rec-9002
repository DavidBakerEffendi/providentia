"watch out for falling caterpillars" this is my new favorite weekend spot! i went for brunch on a warm september weekend and was absolutely charmed by their lovely back garden, the quiet atmosphere, and the excellent refreshments. i was sitting under a tree that is apparently home to a family of caterpillars, but that didn't bother me. i'll be back soon!
