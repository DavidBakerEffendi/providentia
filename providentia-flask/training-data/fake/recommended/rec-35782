My mother in law loves italian food so she found this place on the internet. Amazingly, on a Tuesday night it was NOT crowded and we were of two tables taken in the restaurant. We were looking for a place that served ossobucco. Let me tell you, the portions here were HUGE. We each ordered the ossobucco which came with risotto. The lamb was HUGE. We couldn't even finish and had to take it to go. The atmosphere was romantic. We had the tomato soup which was sooo fresh and tasty and the tomato/mozzarella salad. All the portions were decently sized. I have been to Italy and had their ossobucco and have never been able to find anything like it in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, but now my searching is done. When i want a huge chunk of meat with marrow this is my place. The prices were very reasonable. Our waiter was strange and mumbled to himself a lot, that was the only problem I had with the place.
