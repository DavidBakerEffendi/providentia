I appreciate the clean modern architectural interior, which stands in pointed contrast to the ubiquitous rustic, wooden, crumbly, old vintage aesthetic that pervades in so many Brooklyn restaurants. The food, however, is simply not that impressive. I had the orecchiete with sausage and broccoli rabe, which was like a totally boring dish that can be made at home on a weeknight with no effort whatsoever. I really wanted fish this time, but literally the ONLY non-pasta fish or shellfish was the special, hake, Â which was the special last time too. Hake (seemingly the new skate) is on menus everywhere, which I theorize to derive from its its relatively obscurity, and restaurants' fear of seeming prosaic by offering a much better tasting but more familiar fish. As for wine, we ordered a bottle of Loire Sauvignon Blanc, which was the most acidic of its kind that I've ever had. I'm sure that some of the wines are fine, but this one was not.
