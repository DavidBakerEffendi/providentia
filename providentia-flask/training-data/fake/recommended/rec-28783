Food was awesome ! I wanted to hit this place up for a while and finally made with my best friend. I was so sad the food was good I got to full to try any dessert but will be returning to just have dressers next time for sure. I gave it a 4/5 not for the food and dessert but the seating. It's not to big of a location and we were close to the door so everytime someone came in you could feel the cold breeze creep inside. But the food and service was great !
