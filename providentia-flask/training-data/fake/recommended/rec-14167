After I was done at the MOMA, I was starving and knew that this cart was somewhere nearby.  I walked up 54th and saw it on 53rd, across from the Hilton.  Luckily, the line was really short.  I had the chicken pita with the red and white sauces.  The white sauce was good but the red sauce was fantastic, spicy and tangy.  I wish I had asked for extra.  It was quite large and only $4.   Next time, I'm getting the chicken over rice with extra red sauce.  I may run over there now.  Man, I'm going to miss carts like this back in SF.
