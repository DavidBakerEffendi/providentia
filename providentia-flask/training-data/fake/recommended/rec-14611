Seriously Overrated ! This cart offers the same menu options as any other Halal Cart. Gyros, Meat over rice etc, so what makes this so different from the rest ?? I haven't tried the Gyros but I ordered the meat over rice. Compared to other carts they dice the chicken and meat and the rice is moist, mix it all together with all the sauce toppings and you get a really nice mouthful of meat rice and sauce in every bite. That's what's unique about this cart nothing special. Without the sauces it's just plain diced chicken and gyro on rice. I can't see what all the fuss is about but still it doesn't taste bad and it is fast food on a plate for 6 bucks so can't complain. You get what you pay for but I'm sure there are other Halal Carts that are just as good. They've probably been around for a really long time and are lucky that they have a loyal customer following hence the really long queue but for me the food doesn't justify it.
