I don't know why it's listed as Vietnamese. It's Cambodian, hence the name. Â Reminds me of friends' mom's cooking growing up. That real good, real Cambodian. Even if my husband and I don't make our monthly visit, we still can't get the food off our minds. Get the rice and thinly sliced, marinated beef w/ salad - sorry, I forget the name. Don't go in expecting a Le Bec Fin experience. But ambience will never taste this good.
