I wanted to say "Waited 2 hours to sit but it was so worth it." But I just can't. It's a good place for ramen but the wait is really long. Make sure to make a same-day reservation starting at 3 PM. Otherwise, you will be looking at 2-3 hours of wait. It's a bowl of ramen. I can't emphasize this enough. IT'S RAMEN. Street food from Japan and people sometimes stand as eating. It feels awkward to see people sitting in a 22-seat kinda upscale restaurant eating a bowl of ramen like we are dining at a star restaurant. The mu ramen is good. The broth is delicious but could be a bit too rich for someone. My boyfriend got TONKOTSU 2.0 which is less salty and it would be a better choice if you'd prefer a lighter broth. U&I is standard. The rice is a bit dry and hard for me. I don't know if it is late or we are just unlucky to have the last spoon of that pot of rice. But the rice feels a bit off. Don't get me wrong. The Mu Ramen is a good ramen place. But I still prefer a more authentic ramen place with steam, sweat, and the crowd. That feels more real to me. The waitress is great tho. The girl who's in charge of the guest list definitely knows what she's doing. She's very polite and considerate, efficient and organized. The place could be a lot worse without her.
