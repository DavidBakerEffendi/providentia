In the battle of Ippudo vs. Totto, Totto WINS (by a slight margin in terms of ramen... Ippudo has my heart when it comes to pork buns though).  After enduring the obligatory 90 minute wait between the standing area outside the little plastic hut on the steps and the standing area inside the little plastic hut on the steps, it was finally Totto time. One similarity that I find between Totto and Ippudo is that they both always have inordinately long wait times... but they're both worth the wait - every time. It had been a few months since my list visit to Totto, so I ordered my go-to, the Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen.  As is tradition, it was fantastic... though I promised myself that I'd try the Totto Spicy Ramen next time, as I've heard great things about it.  I added the Kikurage Mushroom and an extra helping of Char Siu Pork to the ramen, which hit the spot - though next time I will try the Shredded Char Siu Pork, as the Char Siu Pork was a bit thick and unwieldy with the chopsticks (which are quality chopsticks, btw). The reason I think the ramen at Totto is slightly better than the ramen at Ippudo is purely based on the broth... the flavor is phenomenal at both, but the flavor at Totto just suits my palate a bit more... which is tough since Ippudo is a 3 minute walk from my apartment, but Totto is worth the hike IMO. I give it 4 stars only because I wish it was more easily accessible (i.e. that I could get it any time I wanted without waiting 60+ minutes outside), and I wish there was more space in there so that you could relax for a bit after your meal instead of feeling like you should get up so the next group sitting outside can get in and eat... but for ramen, Totto is tops in my book.
