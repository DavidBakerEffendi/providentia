I have eaten a lot of great food in New York and this is one of my favorite places hands down.  Now granted I grew up in Tennessee so I'm probably a little biased but this place has great, speakeasy atmosphere, really good food, and at ridiculous cheap prices for what you're getting. First time we went we had the fried green tomatoes and while I was impressed with the size of the plate and the arugala and big slices of bacon were good, they weren't the BEST fried green tomatoes I've ever had. Fried chicken is a MUST, seriously, do it.  The corn bread is sweet enough to be dessert so definitely don't skip it.  I'm a fan of the mac and cheese but what's not to love about mac and cheese.  My girlfriend, who loves the healthier side of life insists on the grilled broccoli which comes out with a great char and grill feel.  Last time I was there we ordered a duck cassoulet and I was really impressed with it as well.  It had lots of flavor and was  a lot of food. And I know at this point you'll be stuffed, but get the Rum Butter Cake or whatever the delicious not chocolate cake is called.  It's served warm with fruit and ice cream and you HAVE to have it. Ok, small place, go in small groups. you're welcome :)
