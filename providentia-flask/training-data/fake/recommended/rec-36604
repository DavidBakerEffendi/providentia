Stopped in "just for a drink" at the bar and ended up with a three-digit bar bill!  At $14 a pop, their signature cocktails are a premium price, but it was my evening's entertainment.  My friend had oysters (I did not partake -- I drank my dinner!) and was quite the happy camper.  A great memory...
