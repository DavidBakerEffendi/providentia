Alice's Arbor is a great addition to our Bed Stuy neighborhood. I'm glad to have a place in the neighborhood that serves great cosmos, too! The owners are very friendly and approachable. I had a nice glass of wine and spoke with one of the owners one day, and it was very pleasant. However, I can't really comment on the food because I was unable to have any the day I went with my family. As a parent with three children under the age of 6, Alice's Arbor may not be the best place for me to frequent (even though it is a family restaurant and will be adding a children's menu). The waitress spent more time texting than greeting us, and repeatedly rolled her eyes and sighed when we asked about high chairs. As soon she brought us the high chairs, we decided to leave. She didn't seem surprised that we left, and it looked as though she really couldn't have cared less. I hope Alice's Arbor thrives in our neighborhood, but I implore the owners to hire wait staff that are a bit more hospitable to the customers. The hostess/wait staff are often the first person that customers see, so if they are Â rude, customers will think the entire establishment is run by rude people. I would hate to see that happen to Alice's Arbor.
