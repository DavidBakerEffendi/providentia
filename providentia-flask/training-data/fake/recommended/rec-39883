One blissfully romantic night when the moon was looming bright over the east village, I stumbled upon the most delightful surprise... Yuca.    To be honest, the hunger pains coupled with enduring two hot and muggy subway transfers from Chelsea made narrowing down a restaurant quicker than usual. What turned me on to Yuca was the small but accommodating street-side patio, which is perfect on a New York summer night. The first thing that was necessary for this impromptu dinner was a bottle of wine to go with the overabundance of tapas that followed the drink orders. Although the wine list isn't extensive, the selection of Spanish wines seemed fitting for the kinds of Latin dishes on the menu. Wine aside, the cocktail menu more than makes up for anything that may lack in the vino department.     The food was perfect. However, when you see the words TAPAS, do not expect traditional small plates, the portions are larger than expected. The empanadas and pinchados were both delicious, but you should not leave with out trying one of the many ceviches offered on the menu. The shrimp ceviche was out of this world and the salmon & octopus ceviche still sparks curiosity in my taste buds.     All-in-all, you can expect excellent service and an all around fabulous and care-free dining experience at Yuca. Enjoy!
