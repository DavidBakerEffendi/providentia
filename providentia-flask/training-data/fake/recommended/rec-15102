One of the better cheese steak joints in Philidelphia, plus you don't have to deal with the touristy crowds and subpar sandwiches down at Geno's and Pat's (stay away).  The sandwich itself is on the smaller side, so if you are really hungry you might have to get two, it would be nice if they offered a larger size.  The meat is rib eye sliced in house, which is great, but I feel they slice it too thin, which cooks too quickly, and becomes a bit dry.  A thicker slicing would probably go a long way in a more tender and juicier sandwich, and maybe a five star rating.  They offer many toppings, and french fries with various toppings.  All in all a good sandwich on a nice roll.  You'll spend a bit more than other "fast food" places, but it's worth it.
