So I've been here a number of times over the years.  Heck, I remember when it was the Seasons bar prior to being KC Prime. Anyway, its not bad, but its not great either.  Its a little pricey (especially lunch) for what you get in my opinion, but that fits for most of the Princeton, NJ area restaurants.  Personally, as a non-fine dining type individual I think you get better value at your local Outback Steakhouse.  And you get a better quality/service at, say, Ruth's Chris.  Food preparation time is definitely a little slow.  It can get crowded around the holidays and certain areas are tight.  The restaurant is a little dark in my opinion.   If you havent been though and are debating about trying it worth the shot as everyone has different opinions.... mine of which is just its ok/semi-good.
