Always great food, decent service. The location is a little cramped but when ya sit down to eat its well worth the trouble, and the valet FOR FREE which is a plus so i dont have to drive around elizabeth looking for a parking place. I had Chicken Parm and it is DELICIOUS, Friends had Steaks on Stone which are really great cuts of Beef that you cook how you want. only real down side is the is no free refills on soda. . . . you get cans of soda i always thought  its cheaper to just have fountain soda but is not a big enough problem that id knock off  star
