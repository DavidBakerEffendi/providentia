The soup dumplings here are very very good.  Not quite as good as some soup dumpling places in Shanghai, but very good for xiao long bao in the USA.  They definitely have the most "soup" in the dumpling of any xiao long bao places that I've tried.  The dumplings are pretty big and the skin is fairly thin.  You will need to be careful when handling them so that they don't break.  It is piping hot and you should be careful while eating, or you will be sure to burn your tongue.  You can get 8 pork xiao long bao for $4.95 or 8 pork and crab roe ones for $6.95.  They are both very good, and which one to get will depend on whether you like the crab roe flavor or not.  I recommend trying one of each and seeing what you like better.   That said, feel free to skip everything else on the menu.  That is why this place doesn't get 5 stars.  Most of the rest of the food here is way overpriced and they are cash only.  Furthermore, they add auto-gratuity onto the bill no matter how large your party is, and there is almost always a wait to get in to the crowded restaurant.  The service is not great (probably due to the auto-gratuity) but it isn't much worse than any standard chinese restaurant.   We did order the pan fried potstickers, which were ok.  We also got the shrimp fried Shanghainese rice cakes.  I felt that this was lacking in flavor and I have had much better rice cakes elsewhere for cheaper.  Stick to the soup dumplings!
