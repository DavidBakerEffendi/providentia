I came here for happy hour with my friend after work. I know it's a beer destination but I was in the mood for something different.  I ordered the blueberry mojito, which was tasty but I will stick to beer if I go here again. My friend and I had 2 of their happy hour appetizers.  I read reviews about how amazing the fried-chick pea fritters were so thats what we got along with the gorgonzola fondue. I wasn't crazy about the fritters but the fondue was awesome! The decor was really nice with a wood carved bar. The bartender was nice but a little slow on the service and we had to flag him down to order our food. Overall, it was a cool place. I would go back for beers and to try some of their other food.
