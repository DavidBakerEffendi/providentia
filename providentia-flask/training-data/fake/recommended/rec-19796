Waited an hour and a half for a table after being told it would be 30 minutes. Waited another 30 minutes for our food. Wait staff was slow and inattentive. As for food, the popovers were delicious. Â I really enjoyed the seasoning on the fried chicken, but thought it was severely over-battered. Not worth the price. Won't be back.
