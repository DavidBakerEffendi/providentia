There was a 45 min wait but once seated the service was good. I ordered the healthy French toast which was ok (that's what I get for ordering healthy at a place like this) but my boyfriend had the Sunrise Sampler and I couldn't stop eating off his place. The grits and biscuits melted in my mouth. It was also so cheap
