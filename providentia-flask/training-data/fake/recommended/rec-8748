Loud. That is the major thing I take away fro. This place.  Trendy decor, blasting music, which leads to people yelling over it while eating.  When sharing a communal table, as we did, this is not exactly ideal. If it wasn't a date, I would be ok w/ it.  I like the experience of something a bit different, always try new places, & the food was actually pretty Damn good!  Fully stocked bar w/ lots of unique options.  Food was prepared in creative ways. Probably better for a group. But if you intend on a romantic getting to know you kind of evening, this should not be your first choice.
