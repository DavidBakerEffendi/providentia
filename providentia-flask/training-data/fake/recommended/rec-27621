Totally delicious. Good place to go when you crave the simplicity and goodness of Japanese but don't want sushi. Would recommend for a low-key night out, post movie dining or afternoon pick me up. Generous portions - my $13.50 soba noodle bowl is easily three meals. Curry udon highly recommended. Service is quick. They serve genmaicha tea vs. regular green tea. Lots of sake options and a few Japanese beers available too. Lastly - as someone who can be a bit of a ball of nerves, I found the simplicity and vibe of this place truly comforting and relaxing.
