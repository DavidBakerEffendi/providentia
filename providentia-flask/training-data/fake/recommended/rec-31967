Jolie Cantina is quite literally on my corner, yet for some reason I never find myself able to convince myself to go in. Luckily, this Sunday, when I found myself in a brunch conundrum (my usual spot was super crowded) my boyfriend convinced me to give this place a shot. The restaurant was decorated with a tastefully done combination of French and Mexican art, and both the outdoor and indoor areas were comfortable to sit in. I decided on the corned beef and eggs which was amazing, and my boyfriend ordered their version of eggs benedict which he also loved. I took away one star because I felt that the portion sizes were a bit small, but everything else was great. Checking into Yelp and getting a surprise 10% off our brunch bill didn't hurt either (and encouraged me to order one of their yummy drinks)
