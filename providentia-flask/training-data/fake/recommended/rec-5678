Great concept, just about everything had some form of chocolate in it! My friend and I split the beer battered onion rings with dark chocolate ranch dressing, perfectly crunchy and the dipping sauce was a good balance between savory and sweet. I ordered the Pasta La Mancha (minus sausage, plus mushrooms) and my friend had the baja fish tacos. Everything was tasty. For dessert I had the mexican hot chocolate and my friend had the white chocolate cheesecake crepe. Everything was delicious, the presentation and ambience were great, too!
