FINALLY can check this place off my list. Excellent burgers, better than Burger Joint in my opinion. No frills, menu is posted on the wall, good selection of beers, and lots of power outlets behind the seat. ATM in the house, since it's cash only. Got the cheeseburger, medium, and it was delicious. Everything = tomatoes, onions. Bacon is extra. There's no mushrooms.
