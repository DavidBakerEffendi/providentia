Came here for a lunch with some coworkers on a rainy day. Luckily the place wasn't packed, as there's normally a line out the door. As we were waiting for a table to open up the waitress was extremely efficient at time management and took our orders right away. By the time we sat down our food was ready. The guac and plantain chips are a Â MUST, and paired with 2-3 empanadas you have a pretty solid meal. Open 24 hours a day, I'd come back :)
