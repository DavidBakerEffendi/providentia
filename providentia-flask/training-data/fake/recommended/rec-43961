Had lunch today at the Tarry Lodge.  We did the prix fix menu for $20.00.  Great selections and generous portions.  I had the pasta with clams in a clear sauce.  Excellent.  Also had the chopped salad, nice dressing.  We had the twist ice cream with your choice of two toppings,  Everything was just delish... Will go back again.
