I work nearby, and this is my go-to for a delicious weekday lunch. I LOVE the roast chicken plate here! It's the perfect lunchtime meal. The chicken is always super moist and it comes with a side of broccolini, all finished with a succulent sauce and topped with one of my favorite things...dried figs! As for sandwiches, the BLT with avocado is my favorite. The pulled pork and brisket sandwiches are both moist and flavorful, although I find them too oily for take-out. The portions are quite generous and the prices are very reasonable. This is easily one of the best restaurants in LIC. If it's warm, ask to sit out in the back patio.
