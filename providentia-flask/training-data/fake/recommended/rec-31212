We came here for brunch, which is pretty worth it for the type of well established restaurant that it is. They have a $22 dollar per person option which consists of a first and second brunch course.( I recommend the poached eggs) includes coffee/tea and a pastry basket, which is absolutely amazing and the best raspberry dipping sauce I've ever had. We ordered the French toast as well, have to admit that Sabrina's has a better French toast but this is still delicious as well. I've been to most of the garces company owned restaurants and the portions are more on the smaller side with a more tapas approach. I'm guessing because they encourage sharing since their dishes are unique. This place is a beautiful venue that has outside and indoor seating. Garces is also know for their speciality drinks, so I would make it a point to visit if you wanted to try something new.
