This place is great! Great food, great drinks, great prices! One of my fav places in NYC. You can only book for a party of eight of more, otherwise you need to show up and put your name down for a table, usually an hour wait! Lots of other bars around to grab a drink while you wait though! Awesome place for dates or celebrations.
