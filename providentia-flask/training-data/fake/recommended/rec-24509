Wow, what an amazing and charming place. The decor is amazing, and the food is even better. I've been here twice. The first time I tried tapas at the bar, and the bartender was not only friendly but made some excellent specialty cocktails. The second time I went I sat in the back, by a beautiful fireplace, and had the short rib entree which was excellent. Overall everything about this place is top notch!
