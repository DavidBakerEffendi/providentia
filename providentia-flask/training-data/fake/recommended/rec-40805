I dined at Soco BK for Sunday brunch to celebrate my birthday with a party of 11. We had to wait a bit due to some mix up with our reservation however the host quickly resolved the issue and we were seated reasonably quickly. Our server Alex was great and provided excellent service. We had a birthday cake and the waiters brought it out with candles provided by SoCo. It was touching that they were so attentive as I forgot to bring candles with me. As far as the food, I tried the steamed mussels and had the sweet potato pancakes both of which were delicious. The decor is nice and hip, however the space is tight, and it is not easy for dinning with infants or toddlers. Overall, though, it was great experience!
