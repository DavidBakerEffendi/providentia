I am in town on business and staying locally in Brooklyn. For a week now, I have wanted to head to Olea but each time I went it was packed. Tonight i finally went and decided to just order some take out. There were a couple of bar stools open at the bar, but they were in between people. When i asked the hostess if there were seats at the bar open she glanced over and told me no. Well- i found my own and made people push over. I also got a glass of wine which the bartender never asked me if I wanted another glass, yet asked all the locals around me if they did. He acted like i didn't exist. Its hard to be from out of town and go to a bar/restaurant and be alone and he didn't help. I got a trio of Meze's- the tzaiki was watery and the beet and regular hummus was fine. The fried olives tapas were SO salty, i have never had an olive as salty as these. All in all i was pretty dissapointed because I had read such great reviews.
