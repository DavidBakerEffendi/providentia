Waited 1.5hrs for a table of 2. If you're planning to go go party larger than 4, go as early as possible or enjoy margaritas at the bar. The Pastelitos was yummy, crispy crust filled with shredded pork. If you like empanadas, you'll enjoy this! Must try churrasco. Not every restaurant make tender churrasco, but they do! In case you haven't tried swordfish, it taste like chicken breast, not my type of fish.
