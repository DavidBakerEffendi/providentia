One of my favorite resturaunts in all of NYC... Food porportions are huge! (One meal feeds four) It's always busy here so make reservations if you plan on visiting with three or more people. LOOK UP! Because that's where you will find the food menu, on the wall... Though it can be tough to read depending on where u sit, they have more menus scattered around the resturaunt... Overall, great place to dine out. :) Note: BRING BIG BILLS ONLY!!! lol ;)
