I'd start this off with you really can't go wrong with Uva.  For UES Italian, it may have the best balance of ambiance, food quality, and value.  We've dined here on a handful of occasions and its consistently the same experience.  I'd comp this to Crispo (albeit I like Crispo more, but let's focus more on Uva). So, a lot of seating options at Uva.  Given the weather allows it, there is outdoor seating in front, and, in the back on the first floor there is a covered patio of sorts.  Most recently we ate downstairs which I liked.  A little quieter - likely I am just getting old. They only take reservations for large parties, so there is likely going to be a wait. I'd suggest hitting the bar at Bocca for a drink (food at Bocca very good too; order the baby fried artichokes!), and circle back when its time to sit. Menu is quite broad, and we usually go with a group and order multiple appetizers to share.  Of what I have had, here are the most memorable items (first two best main courses on the menu, in my not so humble opinion). Gnocchi di ricotta - wow, this is likely best thing on the menu.  The cheese, salt, and truffle combine and create habit forming dish.  Outstanding, get this every time. Pappardelle al ragu di vitello - another favorite.  I love pappardelle, and its very good here.  Ragu nice and meaty.  Very hearty dish for a very hearty appetite Sheep's ricotta cheese and black truffle honey - creamy, salty, sweet.  Best of bruschette if you want something a bit different than the usual. Polenta tartufata - delicious, especially if you are a polenta fan.  Quite decadent for polenta dish. Burrata Barese - one of the better burrata dishes I have had.  Very creamy, little sweetness with balsamic glaze.  Fava beans nice touch. Polpettine di vitello - mini veal meatballs.  Great tomato sauce.
