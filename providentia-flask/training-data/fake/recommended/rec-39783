1. Atmosphere - I dig it. Mildly Latin, pumping the music, first legit saturday of spring so the doors and windows were wide open. Outdoor tables were 2 tops only but we got a window seat so were pretty much outdoors. 2. Service - this is where the star loss happened. Very poor. Forgot coffee completely, forgot the starter, and got one of our orders wrong (Mine). Didn't fill water cups until after we finished eating and we had to ask for coffee refills. So the server got my order wrong and proceeded to tell me what I ordered even though everyone at the table clearly remembered that I said the right thing and I even pointed to it on the menu. Then it took them so long to get my order out that my brunchmates finished theirs...so had to eat fast... 3. Food - I did enjoy my meal. I had the daily special which was the scrambled eggs arepa that came with a mixture of regular and sweet potato home fries. Also tried the huevos rancheros which was a really great balance of elements...eggs, delicious guacamole and a black bean quesadilla. I think if they were able to get the order correct I would really dig this place. $14 for brunch that includes and entree and two drink (choice of usual suspects bloodymary, mimosa, screwdriver, oj and tea or coffee).
