this was our first time here and was outstanding ! first the staff was very friendly, our waitress was very nice as well and very helpful and answered all the questions about the menu. For me the perfect start Â is the bread it sets the tone for the rest of the meal and the bread was great and the oil they served with it was smoked and was out of this world had 3 serving of it. We had the 'tasting of 4' both of us first 'roasted beet tartare' was good, 'whipped foir-gras' good also, 'baby spanish octopus' very tender liked it a lot, one of the reasons I came here, 'diver scallops' they were good but not as good as the waitress raved about them. 'rowhan duck' was good but a little on the small side for a portion and luke warm. ''pulled short rib' was good also about the same portion as the duck, each dish needed more time in the oven for heat enstead of looking pretty! save that for the pictures in the magazines. For dessert 'chocolate ganache' liked it , 'Banana Brulee' this was the biggest disapointment of the dinner, was not good and not at all what we expected ! it just didnt do it for us at all, over all I would go again and would highly recommend getting the 'tasting for 4 or 5' if your looking for place that has over sized portions dont go here, but if you want good food and food that tasted good than try it out, its a cool restaurant and are doing a great job
