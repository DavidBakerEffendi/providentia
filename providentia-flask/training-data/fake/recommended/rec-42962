Some of the best handling of salmon I've seen at a casual dining restaurant in the city, particularly considering the fairly modest prices. I've tried several other entrees here as well and they haven't had a misstep yet. Recently ventured into trying their cocktails and have to give them kudos for those too! Delicious and creative. Be prepared, however, for a long wait if you're going on peak weekend hours and brunch. Weeknights or weekday lunches are your best bet for quick seating and service.
