Had a urban daddy perk for this place that includes 2 hours of unlimited beer.  The waiter was great always stooping by if we wanted more beer.  The food was awesome and the staff was excellent.  My husband left his iPhone and one of the staff ran out to give it back.   Awesome place we will be back.
