I love the food, drinks, and staff... not the crowd! But I live across the street so I don't care, I just go there for the amazing food and happy hour specials. Cocktails are amazing, they have great mojitos and sangrias. The service is very good. Since we're not there for the crowd we usually go during weeknights and sit at the bar. The bartenders know we're from the neighborhood and even remember our names. The food is amazing, my favorite are the arepas, lomo saltado, and the tuna tartar. The place is beautiful, too. I can see from my apartment that gets too busy during the weekends.
