The food and service here are always wonderful. Definitely would recommend the mackerel, the mixed greens salad, the foie gras, the steak for two...all excellent. Would love to try the chicken some time. Hen of the woods. Nuff said. Well, there is one server who is a bit on the obnoxious side - pretentious and sneaks up on you, which is a bit off-putting compared to everything else that is so perfect about this place.
