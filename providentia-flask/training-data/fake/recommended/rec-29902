Guess I'm definitely in the minority here, but I don't understand all the hype about this place. Stopped by with a friend for a late lunch, got the mixed chicken and gyro over rice, put reasonable amounts of white sauce and hot sauce - their hot sauce is HOT! I love eating spicy food and put about as much as everyone else around me did but literally started crying (with pain? joy?) at one point because it was just so damn hot, even after I gulped down the entire contents of my water bottle. One serving is huge. And 80% meat (my guy friend was a very enthusiastic fan of this fact). While I was eating all of it I couldn't stop, though not actually sure if that was because it was delicious or because it was sinfully spicy - heavily leaning towards the latter because of course the only way to stop your tongue from burning while eating spicy food is to eat more of it, yeah? But after I finished I felt sick from so much meat and oil and richness and ulcer-causing sauce. The food also didn't taste at all discernibly different from the cart food across the street. I guess I'll come back if I'm ever in the area and starving and in desperate need of a calorie injection and feeling rather masochistic that day, but otherwise no big hurries to visit again.
