We were just looking for a place to sit and grab a cup of coffee while at the Italian Market and saw Sabrina's Cafe.  It was quite busy with alot of people already waiting for a table but they had a table for two open in a small room right by the kitchen. We were served a glass of ice water immediately upon being seated. The atmosphere is unique with antiques and art work on the walls with tables tightly positioned in various rooms through out the restaurant.  The menu is quite large with something for everyone. Once we took a look we decided on a breakfast sandwich and blueberry pancakes. The buttermilk blueberry pancakes might have been the best I ever had. The 2 offered as a shortstack were all I needed along with the delicious sausage links to fill me up. My wife had an egg sandwich with turkey bacon that was so large she could only eat half. The homefries that were served with the sandwich were piping hot and very flavorful. The colorful staff were very attentive to our needs and also were quick with coffee refills. We have found another go to spot in Philadelphia and can't wait to go back and try it again!
