Visited this place yesterday. Was very nice and food was extremely good. I had egg rolls ,cutlets and tea. All done in real Sri Lankan taste. Didn't have a chance to try the buffet. But waiting for it I'm my next visit. I highly recommend the place. Staff and the owner is very friendly and remind you of the true Sri Lankan hospitality.
