Stumbled in here late last night after the Manchester United/Union game.  Awesome!  The bartender was so friendly, she got our food order in just before the kitchen closed - the beer was fresh and great - so were the potato pancakes and the schnitzel sandwich.  Looking forward to going back.   Can't forget to mention that the Oktoberfest Beer Wench dresses are quite great.
