Really wanted to like this place. My partner and I went in for lunch today and were seated promptly and promised waters. After 10 minutes or so, the waters never came and various other table were seated and got their drinks. We tried, unsuccessfully, to get someone's attention so we got up and left. The menu looked awesome and I wish I got to try one of their sandwiches but I can only be ignored for so long.
