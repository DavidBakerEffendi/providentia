Great Restaurant. Great menu. My girlfriend and I ventured down last night (a friday) and waited less than ten minutes for a table. We had two glasses of wine and four courses and paid less than 100 dollars. To start we had the frogs legs They were super juicy and the sauce that accompanied them was perfectly spicy and worked splendidly with the frogs legs. Then the Foie Doughnut What a beautiful combination. This was the best Foie prep I have ever had! Everything about it was awesome. Then the steak The protein was perfectly cooked and seasoned. With it came avocado, kimchi, and roasted potatoes all Â of which paired brilliantly. Then Oh MY God!! Then the LAMB Two pieces of lamb belly and colantro! That was it but it was incredible! Thanks for a great meal we will be back soon
