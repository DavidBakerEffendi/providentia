Went here for lunch last Sunday (3/14/10) to figure out which place was better: Geno's or Pat's. And the winner is Pat's....by a long shot.  For this review, I want to describe only Pat's Cheesesteak sandwich and I'll have a separate review for Geno's.  We arrived at Pat's around 11am and there wasn't any huge lines.  I ordered the cheesesteak "wit" whiz, which is chopped steak with grilled onions and cheeze whiz on a french roll (maybe italian). The order came out to around $8. The people who worked there were very cool and nice...no-nonsense type of guys.  There was even a cop sitting back there, chillin' with some of the employees.  Back to the cheesesteak, it was very good.  The steak was nicely seasoned and chopped up, the onions were nicely grilled, and the cheese whiz was thick but fluid.  I liked the roll as well but I can't say if it was french or italian bread.  I really liked the different textures...it was soft inside and had a nice crunchy outside.  After sharing some of my Pat's cheesesteak with my wife, I went to Geno's and came back to the car to share it with my wife also. After eating maybe a third of the Geno's cheesesteak, I went back to Pat's to order another one to take home.  I told the guy that his (Pat's) was better and he said, "it's ok, they got the pretty lights over there."  But yeah, Pat's reigns supreme in my eyes regarding who has the best Philly Cheesesteak on this block.  Try it if you ever get the chance.
