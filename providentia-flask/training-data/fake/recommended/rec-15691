Before visiting Philly, I read all the great reviews about the place. My daughter and I try to eat gluten free so we were very exited to try the gluten free pizza. The place turned out to be a huge disappointment. It's a very small place, but nicely decorated. I ordered Gluten Free Pizza. My daughter had tuna special and my husband ordered chicken dish. They were all below par. They brought us gluten free bread and it was awful. You can buy a much better bread in any supermarket. Tuna was overcooked. My husband's chicken was also overcooked and flavorless. However the biggest disappointment was my pizza. It looked and tasted like cheap frozen supermarket pizza. The crust was grainy and had bad aftertaste. The toppings were a joke (please see picture). They charge a lot of money for it too! Awful experience overall! I would never go back and I definitely don't recommend this to any of my Gluten Free friends!
