Unbelievable.  It feels like a hide-away from the craziness of the city.  Almost like a Prohibition-era Speakeasy.  The low hum of the chatter is soothing.  The waitstaff is helpful and not at all pushy or in your way.   Probably because they know that they can leave you alone with your out-of-this-world burger. I love how small the place is -- unless, of course, I'm standing on the outside looking in.
