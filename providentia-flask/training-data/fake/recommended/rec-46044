This place gets super crowded, especially on the weekends. The decor is really lacking, which of course is not the biggest deal, but it could improve the dining experience.  It is definitely nice that this is a BYOB place.  The food is so-so. I usually get the pho, but I have had other dishes.  The one thing I notice is that they tend to use way too much sauce of some of their dishes which makes for a watery/greasy dish. If you get pho with chicken or beef, they do not give you that much meat. Otherwise, if you are in the mood for Vietnamese, it is likely that this will hit the spot, as it is pretty decent.
