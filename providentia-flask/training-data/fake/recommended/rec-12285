went here with my friends for brunch. the waiting time was decent, they have a lot of tables inside and you can sit outside also. I've always wanted to try eggs benedict and I'm glad that I tried it here first. it was pretty good and it comes with a SMALL glass of orange juice and tea/coffee for $15ish. it wasn't as good as I hoped for it be since the place had good ratings. i recommend everyone to try it out, but probably wouldn't be coming back again
