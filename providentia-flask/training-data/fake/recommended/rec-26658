Always call to make a reservation during the weekends, especially during brunch because it can get crowded. So far, i have been to Fare twice.  The first time with a large group and the second time, i took my mother there for mother's day.  The food is fresh and the presentation is beautiful.  The food portions are just enough to enjoy and to be full.   I would definitely recommend everyone to experience Fare!
