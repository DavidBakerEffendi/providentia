Here are some business tips: If you are sure that your food is sooo amazing that there will be a line forming EVERYDAY (not just wknds), you should probably consider expanding your restaurant or moving to a bigger property. I came at 10am Friday and was told the wait was 1.5hrs. Worse, it does not even have a waiting area so everyone has to get out standing in freezing cold weather. I was really really turned off and chose another restaurant instead. Your food may be heavenly, but I don't know how many customers the long wait can turn away each day... DO YOUR MATH manager... Remember your location is not great: If there are shopping areas near you, it might be fine because patrons may simply choose to hang around in those areas for 1.5hrs - You got NOTHING to kill time near your area!! Why would I wait 1.5hrs in winter for you - no matter how amazing your pancake is...? No reservation is allowed either... Smart manager should come up with a way to accomodate customers who have to wait. It is a buyers' market at the end of the day...I cannot believe such a restaurant can compete in the business. Sorry.
