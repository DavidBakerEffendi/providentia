Went here today with my coworkers for lunch. Table of four - three of us got our food within a reasonable amount of time, but our fourth was left waiting. Even though there were profuse apologies, it still took another half an hour which, for lunch hour during a work day, just doesn't work.   I ordered the chicken penang curry. For a place called Chop Shop, I would have expected the food to be decently diced.  The smallest piece of chicken was 2"x2"x2", and all of it was dry besides.  The taste was fine, it was just an extremely coarsely made dish. Also, chopsticks?  Thai food isn't eaten with chopsticks. My coworker also reported the drunken noodles to be nothing special.  For the cost, this place is definitely not worth it.
