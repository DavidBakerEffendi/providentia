I really dig this place. Solid food, good atmosphere, great beer selection. I've been with buddies from out of town and with my kids. Calamari is above average, and I'd say the same for my jambalaya. My chili was great - and cheap! I'm looking forward to spending time in their outside area again. All around solid review for this place.
