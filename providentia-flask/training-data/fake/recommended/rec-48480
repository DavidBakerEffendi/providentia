It was quick dinner stop from the hotel I stayed. Indide was nicely decorated and a live singer's song was a little loud for the nite. Calamari tempura apptzr, crab & corn soup were good. But the buger and vegi. Panne were so blend, almost no taste at all. Service was really slow, i mean slow. When we paid our bill in cash they didn't even bother to give us full changes back. The change was short 92 cents. Probably they didn't wanna bother customer with all coins but when it comes almost a dollar worth, i wondered why did they do that.. I think this is not respectful to Â their customers...
