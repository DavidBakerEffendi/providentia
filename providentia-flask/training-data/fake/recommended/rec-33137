Have been to New Orleans and absolutely loved the food!  Used to go to Cooking with Jazz in Whitestone which was marvelous and that they closed and reopened years later in Jamaica Estates and now are gone.  They lost the magic in their Jamaica venue.  Now there is Sugar Freak!  First let me tell you the decor is adorable, very innovative and comfortable.  Next the prices are truly reasonable.  And lastly the food is amazing! We were 4 during the brunch time,but you could select from either menu. Started with  the hush puppies (could have made a meal of them) and crawfish boudin balls. Then we shared an order of crawfish etoufee -nicely flavored (they ran out of grits so there was no chance for shrimp & grits), veggie muffuletta (so delicious),and the pulled pork po'boy (yummy).  Could hardly finish it all, but we topped it off with the beignets and banana foster creme.  Let me tell you the bill(don't forget the free drink) was $76.00!  So the next time you want flavor and a dose of Louisiana cooking, check this place out.  I am sure a cardiologist would say don't go too often, but there actually healthy alternatives, but who wants those the first time around!
