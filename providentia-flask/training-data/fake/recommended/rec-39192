We liked it.  Found this local gem via a Living Social coupon.  Cuban cuisine is our fav, so we are very in tune to what is good and what is not.  This place is good.  Simple decor and an even simpler menu.   Empanadas, garlic shrimp and tamales for apps.  A few salad options, and 10 or so entree selections.  The staples of Pernil (roasted pork), Ropa Vieja, Bisteca, are a few choices amongst others.  Traditional sides of various rices, maduros, tostones, and yuca round out the meal (entrees come with a choice of two). Staff was fine (knowledgable and helpful).  Place has about 25 seats plus 6 at the counter.  At 7pm on a Saturday, the place was full.  Many looked like regulars (which we will become). 2 apps and 2 entrees $38 plus grat.  Well worth it.  Give this place a try and you won't have to head east or south to Miami to get a great Cuban meal.
