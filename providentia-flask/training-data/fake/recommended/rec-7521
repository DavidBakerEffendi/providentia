I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. The only reason for not giving 5 stars is because the place is pretty small, and we waited close to 2 hours for a table (despite having been promised 1.5 hours).  While you wait, there's a great little bar area with a fantastically diverse (and extensive) beer selection. What's even better is ordering the half pints, which are so reasonably priced, and getting to sample many beers! (which made the wait slightly less painful...or perhaps it was the easy-on-the-eyes endearingly quiet bartender...). After finally being seated, the rest of the night was a foodie's  delight! Local everything....quinoa stuffed roasted delicata squash, arugula salad with toasted farro, corn cakes with braised kale and oyster mushrooms, venison burger cooked to perfection....yes please! The squash was a bit on the dry side, but I don't know if it was the beer or the kale talking because the meal was stellar! My only regret was not having enough room for dessert...
