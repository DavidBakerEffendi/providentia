UPDATE- has moved up from 3 to 4 stars upon return visits.  Service improved a lot, the food was all around well done, and it was a much better experience.  Standouts the second time around were duck and a great leek soup.  There was a little bit of a wait and the bar was too crowded to really enjoy (for good reason, see original review).   For posterity's sake, here's the original review: Before anything the BAR GETS 5 STARS!!! Decor is also beautiful (for a bar setting) Originally came here a few months ago at the beginning of their infamous soft opening.   We sat at the bar, had an amazing conversation with the bartender and had wonderful cocktails.  The Improved Tequila was great and I had one of the better Old Fashions I've ever tasted. We were excited to come back last night to eat.  The food was good, clearly fresh ingredients, and nicely put together, but nothing that necessarily deserves the price tag, and all a little overshadowed by the amazing cocktails and somewhat mismatched decor for the "high dining." The Beet salad was the standout to me- an impressively stacked morsel that had blue cheese and bucheron along with micro arugula.  Nice presentation with melted bucheron drizzled around. For entrees we got the duck breast (nicely done, though next time I'll go medium rare instead of medium) with a nicely seasoned couscous, and the pork belly entree, with broccoli rabe.  Not the best belly I've had, though I did like the crispness around the outside (which may have led to it being a bit overdone on the inside). The other thing that disappointed was slow service.  Food took quite a bit of time, and we even canceled two coffees when they hadn't arrived after we finished the dessert.   I will finish by giving huge props to the renovation of the space and the beautiful historic bar.  I will certainly be coming back, but it will be for drinks and some nibbling on the snack menu.
