I went here with my boyfriend on a saturday night. They said there would be about a 40 minute wait so we got drinks and after about 15 minutes we were given a table. We shared a huge gates of eden salad with fresh arugala, candied walnuts, and cranberries. We then got two pizzas, and each got a dessert. We thought that we would end up bringing leftovers home meanwhile we ended up finishing everything and each got ice cream. Plus Paulie Gee comes to each table and brings the pizza.. All in all a good place for a chill night
