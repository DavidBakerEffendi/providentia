Here is my story. I went there at 1 am. I waited on the line. I was even verbally offended by some other drunk customers there (See, this is a crazy world). But I don't care as long as I got my platter. So what about the food? 4 stars for their chicken. Â But 5 stars for their secret white sauce. I mean it. Without the white sauce, there is nothing to excite about. The hot sauce is ridiculously hot, too. If you haven't tried it yet, remember their banner. "All the people of the world can be put into two categories: those who have had the platter, and those who have not."
