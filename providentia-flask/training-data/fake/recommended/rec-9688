I can't stop going here. The food is amazing. I had the spring rolls with the plum sauce and it was to die for. Long after I finished my my spring rolls I was still dipping my finger in the sauce. Delicious! The drunken noodles are tasty and not too spicy for my less adventurous eaters. The drinks are good as well. Definitely try "Kissing Kissing Berry" & their Mojitos. I'm never disappointed when I go here and doubt I will be.
