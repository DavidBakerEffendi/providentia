We went to this place from out of town and it was recommended by a friend. This place is very busy and famous. We arrived before 12pm and still needed to wait a couple minutes to get a seat. Â When we were done, there was a long line outside. However, I don't think their pizza is better than other places. We ordered an origin tomato pie with anchovies, it was too salty. We also ordered a special white clam pizza, it was too dry.
