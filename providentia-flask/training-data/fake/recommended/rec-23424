I'd give it four stars for the food but if i could rate their service i'd give it 2.5 or 3 . 1st off we waited like 30 mins for our food to come which I could understand,like I said the food Is great ; but they kept on getting our orders mixed up and lastly one of orders never even made out to us( even when reminded them twice about it and they acknowledged us and our reminder.... But still never made it to us . We just gave up on it. Â Good thing we checked our bill and had them take it off since we never got it, But like i said the food is great especially the crispy chicken biscuit ah-mazing... My friends and i will definitely order it again .
