Got lucky, walked in mon night labor day.  Very small and intimate hard to get table.  Mire simple bit a menu with durable elegance. Met chef, he and a team of 4 others work hard in partial ooen kitchen.  Meatball sliders- no joke, best meatball i have ever had.  And ive had thousands :) .  Halibut and lamb chops as entrees.  Delicious.  Great experience
