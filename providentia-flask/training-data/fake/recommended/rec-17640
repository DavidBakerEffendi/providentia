After becoming tired with the same old delivery/take-out menus at home, Vinnie's menu crept out of a pile.  My Mom & I looked at each other, thought for a second, and began perusing the options. We decided on a chicken parmigana sandwich for her, and a vegetable wrap for me.  I also ordered a side dish of oven-roasted potatoes. Thirty minutes later on a Friday night (which is amazing), we had our food, and it was piping hot.   My mother loved the sandwich and the fact that they don't over-pour the sauce on the sandwich. My Dr. Donna wrap (sans the broccoli rabe) was absolutely delicious.  I never knew just plain veggies could taste so good in a wrap,  The potatoes were roasted to perfection. We've ordered from here a few times since then, and we've never been disappointed.
