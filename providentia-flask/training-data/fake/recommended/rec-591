Great BYOB date place. Nice ambiance, good food, great service. Before we even ordered, we were brought delicious focaccia that we immediately gobbled up. We ended up ordering the mussels appetizer (great to share), and then ordering the lamb entree and the truffled pappardelle, both of which were tasty! I would definitely recommend for a nice date night.
