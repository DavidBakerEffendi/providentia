Still tasty, but in recent months, the ramen has become insanely oily (beyond the expected amount for tonkotsu ramen, which is already a lot!). People I've taken here lately have not been impressed. Also, the wait is WAY too long now, they raised their prices (by just a dollar but still), and some of the hostesses are da*n rude.
