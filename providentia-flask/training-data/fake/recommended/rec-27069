I had a previous review on here where I gave all the props to Dominick's up the road.  Dom still serves up an outstanding slice but I recently tried this place and it really rivals his pies.  Fantastically crisp crust with a tangy sauce and good quality mozzarella.  I don't know what is making the pizza better in Totowa, NJ but keep it up!!
