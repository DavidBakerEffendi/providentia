PRO's: - Good pizza - Friendly owner or whoever the gent is who runs it CON's: - not very close to subway station, at least as far as I'm aware - cash only - no liquor license. What's better than beer and pizza? - not all of the olives on my pizza were pitted. Bit in and hurt my teeth more than once.
