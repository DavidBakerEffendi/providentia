Is it summer vacation for service at New York restaurants? Great food can't be saved by a cluster f...of mistakes in how the food appeared or often just did not at a recent dinner on the back patio.  Yes the food is good and the patio beautiful.  But if you want to average a 100 tab per person,  figure out this one.  When you serve a cheese course you need to bring a knife so we can actually eat it.   Maybe service is just a thing of the past.
