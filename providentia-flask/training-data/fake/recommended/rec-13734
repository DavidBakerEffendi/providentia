My first encounter with Simon Pearce occurred one rainy afternoon spent watching Sweet Home Alabama.  Taken aback by the beautiful southern glass showcased throughout the film, I turned to the all-knowing higher power, Google (duh!), and after a bit of searching to uncover the manufacturer a new obsession was born! Located on the Ottauquechee River near a rustic wood-covered bridge this restaurant appears to have been plucked from the heavens!  With live glass blowing demonstrations downstairs, a showroom overflowing with stunning goods upstairs, and a top notch restaurant serving local and seasonal ingredients, this place is a guaranteed great time. NOTE:  All of the china and glassware used in the restaurant is Simon Pearce, so it's a plus to be able to try out the product for yourself before buying!
