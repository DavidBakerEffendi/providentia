Penelope has been on my bookmark list for months. I was finally able to get a table on a saturday afternoon. Overall the place was good, nothing spectacular though. I had extremely high hopes for this place, but it fell a little short. The only thing that I can say really stood out was the fact they had a coffee machine at the front for patrons that are waiting. I think that was pretty cool. And all their little saying around the place is cute. Food was good but like I said nothing to call home about. I probably won't come again just because the wait is ridiculous. The place gets enough business and will do well without mine.
