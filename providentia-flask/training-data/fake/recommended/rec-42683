Yeah it's popular... West Village locals are so lucky to live by this kick-ass foodie favorite...oh, and the cocktails are pretty good too. Quiet Storm was really good... Bourbon anything is good though. The food is modern comfort food done really well... Some of the prices are crazy expensive and others are surprisingly good values...but I won't say which is a rip off because it's all balanced with values like the Rib-Eye w Potato Gratin for $45. I would charge 50-65 at my restaurant.
