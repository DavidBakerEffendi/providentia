Spent the first day of summer here. Cool spot on the water. Super views! Super efficient bartender! This food was very good but it is Bosnian themed.. not Brazilian, as are the guys who run the place. There are other options as well..burgers, etc. Don't forget to bring cash.. Only form of payment accepted. Enjoy! !
