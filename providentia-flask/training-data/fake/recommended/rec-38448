Found this place on yelp. Google Map isn't updated, so don't be scared of this place. Went with 2 other guys and had our order taken quickly. I had fried catfish with okra and cornbread. The cornbread was very good. The fried okra was crunchy on the outside, but soft on the inside. The batter on the catfish was different than my grandma used to make, but good all the same. Good adhesion to the fish, and the texture was a little bit more like a beer batter. The food came out quick and was equally quickly eaten. I'll be back to try the BBQ.
