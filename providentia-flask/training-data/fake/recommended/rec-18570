Think I just died and went to heaven. Very gluttonous heaven. Came here for valentine's day and immediately fell in love (with the food mainly... just kidding, Elijah D!). The decor of the place is stunning-- it reminded me of a very modern Gramercy Tavern. Orchids are everywhere, exposed brick walls, tables that are close together but still intimate. It's candle-lit, elegant, and the huge window-walls overlook a scenic part of the west village. The goods: - Fried East Coast Oysters and Savoy Cabbage Slaw - Diver Scallops with peppercress and lime - Pancetta wrapped filet mignon (!) and lobster homefries (!!) - Striped sea bass with pomegranate brussel sprouts and oyster mushrooms - Old Bay fries To add to our growing muffintops, we also ordered the olive oil cake with rosemary gelato (holy shit this is amazing). Everything was incredible, but the entrees really took the cake (literally). What I appreciated most about market table was how fresh and incredibly inventive all the dishes were. I found myself biting into several dishes and remarking that I had never tasted anything like it. Appetizers were good, a bit strange, but a perfect introduction to the main courses which blew my mind. I didn't love the cabbage slaw cause I thought it was too sour. The pancetta wrapped filet mignon and lobster homefries were ridiculously delicious. Steak was cooked to perfection and the lobster and potato combination was amazing. Though I don't usually order fish at expensive restaurants, the striped bass was AMAZING. The buttery brussel sprouts and meaty mushrooms were the perfect compliment to the fish. Only thing I wasn't crazy about the olive oil cake, but the rosemary gelato more than made up for it. This is the perfect place for a special occasion with friends or a romantic date. Â Wish I could afford to eat here every week. Delish.
