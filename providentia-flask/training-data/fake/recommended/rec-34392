Had dinner at EB Strong's last evening with 5 colleagues and the event was exactly what you would expect from top tier steakhouse.   All of the appetizers were very good and well prepared as well as the selection of salads on the menu.  Unfortunately they excluded a Caesar Salad for some reason which disappointed a few of my colleagues.  Preparation of our entrée where exactly on point, with my Filet Mignon cooked to perfection.  Service was excellent and very competent.  The one negative that I would mention was that the wine list published on their website was not up to date relative the vintage years of their wines.  Otherwise, would highly suggest this establishment.
