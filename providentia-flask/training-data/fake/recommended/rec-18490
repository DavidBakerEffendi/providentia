I ordered from Five Tacos for an office party of 60 people. We ordered the taco bar which was more than enough food. It was a delicious success! Everyone was raving about the food and I must say I was overwhelmed by the flavors of the meat, as well as the sauces. Â Will 100% cater from them again! My personal favorite was the Chorizo taco, it was perfection.
