Dropped in here before heading out due to yelpers' good reviews. The atmosphere was nice with house music in the back and the atmosphere being like a quiet corner in a upscale club almost...haha. It's a nice change from your usual eats. Spicy Thai Basil Noodles: excellent, seasoning perfect Pad thai with beef: very good but I wouldn't call it the best I've ever had 8 out of 10. Overall, excellent choice in the area.
