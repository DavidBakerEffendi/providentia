It can be kind of a double-edged sword to be named as one of NYC's best burgers, but this burger does manage to hold its own. The cozy, cramped, neighborhood joint has a boisterous, friendly vibe, only slightly marred by the hordes of people jammed together. But it has its own kind of charm, I guess. We managed to get the last two seats in the place when we popped in for a quick late bite. Ordered two cheeseburgers and a large fries to share. The food took a while...a long while..or maybe we were just really hungry. The burger verdict..yum! This belongs in the messy, greasy burgers category. This is not your gourmet fare with it's artisanal what-nots and locally-grown what-have-yous. This is a plain old good no-frills burger from a bar. It's super tasty and filling and hits the spot. One thing to note, the cooking time is crucial to a burger like this. Rare to medium rare and you get a soft, juicy, drippy burger. If you go more cooked than that you're pushing it. If god forbid you go well-done (you heathen!), you might as well just eat cardboard. The meat isn't seasoned much, and you really just need to appreciate the meaty goodness of a rare-cooked burger. Fries are quite mediocre, unless you like them twice-fried and crunchy. You can get better fries from fast food places.
