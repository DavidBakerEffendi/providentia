i have officially defected from black and brew, after an incident with bad milk, i wandered sneakingly across the street to B2. Love, love, love this place. dog friendly, staff is great, and i have even found myself craving the vegan peanutbutter cookies, which is big for me as i denounce all desserts vegan. i also love that they allow me to convince myself that i'm having a "smoothie" when we all know that when it has ice cream its a milkshake!
