A little torn about this place but nonetheless, I would be back. For all those complaining about cost, first off, it's NY, second, you get what you pay for so go to the fast food joint if you want "cheap quality meat".  For me, the burger size was just right, not too big and not too small.  You are going to order sides and beer so I don't see the point in complaining about the size based on the price.  We got the original and truffle burger, I liked both but thought the original was slightly better as I really didn't taste or smell the truffle in the truffle burger.  It's all about the senses.  They were cooked to perfection so big score on that.  Also had the truffle beet salad which I loved.  The onion rings were just so so...but the sweet potato fries hit it since everthing else was salty.  The dips were not that interesting but nice that they offered something besides ketchup.  The beer selection was awesome...the left hand stout was delish with my truffle burger.  Had the ice cream sandwich for dessert, while good, nothing to rave about - will skip and just have more fries next time.  Will definitely be back to sample other burgers.  One note is that they should really try to space out the tables better, there really isn't a walking lane so it was a bit cumbersome.
