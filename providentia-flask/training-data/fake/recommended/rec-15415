1/19- Really incredible cocktails and service. Hot boys here too, if you're single. ;) I had the Classic ramen and wish I woulda gone for the one w spice for a lil more flavor. My friend had the spice one and it wasn't terribly spicy- and just right. Ask for the egg inside. Super yummy. Long wait- so be prepared for at least 80min wait! Serious! :)
