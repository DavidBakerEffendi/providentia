Nice ambience, though the place can get a little loud. Sit upstairs if don't want to yell. We took the prix fixe menu. Three different pasta dishes on the same plate. A Bolognese, Ravioli with beets and mushrooms (strange), a white cheese and basil sauce (I think). Â All very good. Big portions (too much). Nice wine list. They have two. The economy wine list where all of the wines are $24 and the higher end wine list. Waitstaff was fantastic! Fun spot!
