Pros: 1. GREAT appetizers; especially the robiola cheese and black truffles chisolino. That was divine. You cannot order enough of it! You could probably order JUST appetizers and make a meal of it- great cheese selection too! 2. A great selection on main course; a lot of vegetarian options too. The gnocchi is perfect. 3. Dessert- The almond tart amazing! 4. We were a large group of people; and were seated in the basement. The atmosphere was perfect, away from the loud music and perfect for conversation. Our servers were great too!! Cons 1. The main courses were alright. Nothing fabulous except the gnocchi. 2. The chocolate mousse was pretty weak
