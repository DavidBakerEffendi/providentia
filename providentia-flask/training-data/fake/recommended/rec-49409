Service could have been considerably better, but the food? Amazing! I was invited here for a casual date (which later led to less-than-casual coffee...) and was pleasantly surprised to find a huge selection of all-vegan delicious-sounding sushi rolls, wraps, soups, and salads. He ordered the Mighty Mushroom and Spicy Mang rolls and I ordered the Citrus Salad, which came with the most amazing tofu my taste buds had ever sampled. (Upon his instance, the aforementioned taste buds also sampled both rolls, and, though I was not a huge fan of the mango-containing rolls, I quite liked the medley of perfectly-seasoned mushrooms in the other.) Great spot for casual lunches, perfect for vegans and those just trying to avoid meat for a meal. Also good for gluten-free folks! Word of advice though, don't waste your money on the orange coconut juice. It tastes like a chalky mixture of some sort of tropical baby food-meets tropical-flavored protein shake (is that a thing?), strained to achieve a watery consistency.
