One of the only places in the US that tastes and feels like an Israeli Falafel place. The pita, salads, chips (included in your falafel) and the falafel balls are all authentic and given to you in the quick rushed manner of Israelis. Unlike most American Falafel places they have a table of extra pickles, veggies and topics for free. So you don't have to pay every time you want some extra chatzilim. I would venture to say that this is the best falafel place outside of Israel.
