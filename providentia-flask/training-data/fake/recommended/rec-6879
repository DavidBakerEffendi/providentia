My first inclination that Runner & Stone existed was when I ate across the street at The Pines, and was almost more impressed with the bread accompanying the cheese plate than the cheese itself - that's really saying something as I adore cheese! After that experience, I knew I had to check out Runner & Stone for dinner! My husband and I went on a weeknight and were immediately impressed with the minimalist, ecofriendly architecture. We were seated towards the back, with a lovely view of their outdoor terrace (no seats out there I'm afraid) and a great breeze as well. Service was knowledgeable, and we soon found ourselves enjoying amuse and baked breads that were delicious. We're talking crispy, crunchy, olive-oily bread here folks, it was delicious! I started with the baby beet salad, accompanied by a delicious walnut yogurt dressing that really popped in terms of fresh, tangy flavor. Can't remember husband's appetizer, but for dinner I had the Fish of the day, which was Fluke, cooked in a flavorful grebiche sauce that is sort of a mix of capers, onions and eggs - I'd never had anything like it before but found it to be absolutely unique and delicious! My husband had the merguez, a hearty dish finished with garbanzos and a tangy harissa. We also tried some vegetables - save room for these!! Our haricots vert were buttery and delicious. As much as I wanted to try dessert I was full from eating every bite off of my plate. I would definitely return, it's a beautiful space in Gowanus and quite near where I live. I would also return to check out brunch & bakery items. Ideal for a date or intimate gathering.
