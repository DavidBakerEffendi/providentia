What really puts this place on the map for me is the Wii. I used to live in a house with a Wii and now I don't. I'm not ashamed to say I got a little addicted, so the fact that I can walk a few blocks away, grab a beer and some fries and play a round of Wii golf, well...that kinda does it for me. Not interested in Wii? With a decent food and beer selection, this place is a-ok and even sans Wii, I'd happily tarry for a round or two. Friendly, neighborly service as well.
