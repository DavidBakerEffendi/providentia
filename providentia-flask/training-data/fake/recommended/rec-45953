Great disco fries! The secret is in the gravy- it's delicious! The only problem with the gravy is that they seem to be rationing it.. We definitely could have used a little more on our fries. The cheese could've been more plentiful as well. And they could have actually melted the cheese... My boyfriend loved his jersey shore burger. As far as the rest of the meal goes, it was mediocre. Grilled cheese-definitely sub par.  It was two slim pieces of cheese between two giant pieces of bread.  The bread was so thick, I could barely take a bite. Strawberry Milk Shake- Artificial tasting.. i.e. strawberry syrup instead of real strawberries. Open-faced Roast Beef- tender and delicious, and the red skin mashed potatoes were seasoned well; however, it came with no gravy!!  What kind of open-faced sandwich comes without gravy? What the hell guys? Is there a gravy shortage?  The waiter must have seen the confused looks on our faces because he said "Oh.. did you want gravy with that?" And he brought out a small cup. Speaking of the waiter, he was very awkward and soft spoken. There were hardly any people there, but our waiter kept disappearing whenever we needed something. We asked for 3 waters and he just left us with those tiny cups the bus boys give you. Half way through the meal he brought us one large water (no straw), and mumbled something about "in case you want more." Even though there was such a small amount of customers, they still took a long time to bring the food. Oh and here's something that really bothers me... but this is really just a person irritant- I HATE when people put cheese on a side salad. If I'm ordering a salad, it's because I'm trying to be healthy and I don't want a pound of cheese with my lettuce. But that's just me. Overall, Tic Toc was just okay. I might go back for the Disco Fries, but remember to ask for extra gravy!
