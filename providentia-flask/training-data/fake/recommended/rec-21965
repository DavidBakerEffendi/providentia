The place is very clean and nice.  the staff very helpful.  we needed a place to eat lunch before going to the museum of moving images.  I checked out yelp and found this place.  they have a buffet (cold and hot) and you pay by weight.  I tried to get a little bit of everything , since its hard to guess what my kids would like and what they wouldn't.  The potato salad was a winner with my daughter.  We also liked the beef, the corn pudding, the lemon chicken, rice and beans.  The pasta not so great, but that was the only thing we didn't like.  for a family of 4, it cost us about $20 for lunch.  can't go wrong. The food was freshed and well prepared.  I also got a fruit tart for dessert which was also delicious.  We did not try the rodizio, but if we're ever in the area again, I would come back to try it.  I'd definitely recommend this place if you're in the area.
