The Bronzino was possibly the BEST I've had ever--Tarragon, Sage & Cilantro Herbs baked within (like a sandwich ) imparting amazing flavors to the whitefish flounder which was succulent, tender & phenomenal. Sat next to a designer from C.Wonder & Tod Williams & Billie Tsien's son--how cool is that? Communal tables offer singles a good way to socialize when you're shy--this is a G_d send :) Really intriguing selection of dishes hailing from the south--Kentucky Fried Chicken but a 5 star version--the tenderest tastiest largest biscuits this side north of the mason dixon line. LOL. Gabriel the manager was like an angel, overseeing this new culinary addition to the LES. Megan the waitstaff and the chef were very accommodating to diners requests for specific dietary needs. At the Derby, You are Special. This place Rocks !
