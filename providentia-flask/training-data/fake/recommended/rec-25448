Cmon People!!!!!!!!! How can you screw up a very simple Veggie Fajita and a Veggie Quesadilla ??? How??? And where is the cheese????? How can the mushrooms be so raw and bitter?? Where are the other veggies in the stuffing? Barely there sour cream!! Was so excited to check out this resto that couldn't wait and ended up being their 3rd or 4th customer on their opening day!! Nicely done decor with a trendy spanish music in the background and welcoming staff.... I imagined the food would justify the look n feel of the resto.... But it was far from edible.... I don't know if it was their opening day blues... but... First impression counts!
