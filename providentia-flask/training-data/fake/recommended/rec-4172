Stopped in for a sandwich and a beer. Also had a seltzer.  Got the bill and saw they charged $3 for a seltzer.  I'd pay a buck or two and not complain, but $3 for a glass of water?   That's just stupid. Way to drive off someone  who would come here all the time if you weren't so stupid in your pricing.  Never again.
