If i wasn't a local I probably wouldn't venture too far to get to Kite and Key.  But the food is always ok, service has always been below average, except for my server last saturday who was awesome, some dude with a beard who was pretty cool and attentive.  I want this place to do awesome, the owners are pretty cool guys I have known since their Bishops Collar days.  I will go back definitely.
