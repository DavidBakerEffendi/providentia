O-M-G! Loved! Loved! Loved! I definitely am not qualified to review Ethiopian food as this is the first time I have tried it but I can tell you if something is tasty or not! This food rocks! I landed here on recommendation and boy am I great full. Â The menu was a bit limited and if I remember correctly had no meat options for brunch at least (not totally sure though) I ordered a lentil and stuffing dish with yoghurt and it was simply amazing. This got me thinking I could go vegetarian! Ive been told to try their feast for 2 platters where you can sample 7 different options. Yums!!!
