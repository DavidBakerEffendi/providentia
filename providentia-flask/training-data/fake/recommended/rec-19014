Lobster rolls are a popular sandwich in NYC as of late by way of the New England states.  I enjoy lobster.  So a few weeks ago I decided to give Red Hook a try with SL and SC to see what all the hype was about... The location is in the middle of nowhere in Brooklyn.  Once you get off the BQE, it's pretty straight forward to get there.  However you drive through a very industrial area to get the the pound.... When we arrived, we ordered in the main room to the left and then had to transport our food to the dining room to the right.  We had SL guarding our food as we made the trips back and forth: yelp.com/biz_photos/nOjG… They have a spacious and clean dining room with about 6 tables.   Here's what we ordered... 1.  Connecticut Rolls with lobster, butter, and scallions for $16: yelp.com/biz_photos/nOjG… The meat used was pretty much all fatty claw meat which was very sweet.  Coupled with the nicely buttered roll, it was a a very TASTY sandwich.  However i found it small for the price.  As for the pickle, it was very good while the chips were just chips to me.   2.  Maine lobster roll + pickle + cape cod chips for $16: yelp.com/biz_photos/nOjG… SJ ordered this sandwich and she found it to be too dry and chewy.  From the looks of it, Connecticut looks like the way to go.  She also enjoyed the accompanying pickle.   3.  Downeast Bisque with Lobster, Clams, Shrimp and Haddock with a kick for $7: yelp.com/biz_photos/nOjG… I found the soup to be nice with a fair amount of seafood.  It was a bit salty, but I personally didn't mind as I enjoy salty food. 4.  shrimp and corn chowder (i think) for $6 yelp.com/biz_photos/nOjG… Same 5.  new england clam chowder for $7 yelp.com/biz_photos/nOjG… Same Summary:  Red Hook Lobster pound serves good food, but it's not filling and is very expensive.  The hype is somewhat warranted, but I don't really see it...
