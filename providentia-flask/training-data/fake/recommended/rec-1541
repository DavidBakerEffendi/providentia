Someone on yelp raved about the broccoli rabe + provolone + roast pork combo. Although I preferred DiNic's to Herschel's, I can't clamor to be a big fan of broccoli rabe. If you're going to get broccoli rabe, you better like it, or you're just better off with spinach instead. Rabe has this bitter and subtle spicy kick to it that not many people are used to. It certainly is an acquired taste and I couldn't acquire it in 15 minutes no matter how many forced bites I took.
