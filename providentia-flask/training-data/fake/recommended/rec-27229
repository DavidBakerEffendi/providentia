I would say this is one of the best bagel shops within the woodbridge area that I know of which is easy to get to. Sometimes this place can be very crowded on the weekends. I have never tried the subs from here. This review is for the bagels which I take home and freeze for the week days for work. These bagels are huge and fresh, even after defrosting they still taste great! I don't think the blueberry is real but other than that I would recommend the everything bagels.
