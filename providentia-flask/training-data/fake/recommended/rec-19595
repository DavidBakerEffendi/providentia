We were looking to mix up our Hartford County Korean BBQ experience.  I really liked that they had a variety of starch bases.  At the time I was on some sort of gluten-free diet experiment and they even had various gluten-free sauces and seasonings that were still delicious.  I had the sweet potato noodles as my Bibimbap base.  OMG. Do it!  I added all the veggies, chicken and sesame oil.  BF had the white rice as his Bibimbap with all the veggies, beef and hot paste in a hot stone bowl.  Delish! I recommend this place as a take out place. The atmosphere isn't really anything to write home about.  But definitely worth a visit for the food.
