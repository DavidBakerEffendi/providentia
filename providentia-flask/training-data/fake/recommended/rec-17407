I'll preface this by saying I worked private parties here on a few occasions and used to wait tables at Egan and Sons right next door (same owners). The executive chef, Sam, is very talented and puts a lot of pride into the seafood cuisine and the presentation. On a side note, I know they get at least 2 or 3 fresh deliveries a week. The decor here is beautiful. The owners put a lot of work into it and it really paid off. This goes for downstairs and the upstairs lounge area. One of my favorite things about Halcyon was the brunch, but they stopped doing it. I wish they would bring it back. Still, this is a great place to go for dinner, drinks, or for a private party in the upstairs lounge. If there is a wait next door at Egan's, Halcyon is a great alternative. Although a little pricier than Egan's, not everyone in your party necessarily has to like seafood. Last I knew, they had steak and burger options as well to accommodate the non-seafood eaters.
