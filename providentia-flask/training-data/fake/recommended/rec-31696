One of my families favorite restaurants and I have a difficult family to feed. One vegetarian and one gluten free but they all love this place. The  decor and wait staff which are very attentive will have you thinking you are in Greece. The food is very fresh and the bacalava is the best I have ever had. A very good value. You definitely won't go away hungry. I've had just about everything on the menu and have no complaints.  Excellent salads and fresh fish. One of our go to restaurants in the area.
