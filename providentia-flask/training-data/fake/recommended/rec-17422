I enjoyed the food but it just wasnt my favorite type of food so do not go by my review of the dining alone. The atmosphere is fun but very loud and the waiters sing the same happy birthday song over and over all night. A good place to go with friends for a night out. Be advised it is BYOB however they will make sangria for you (for a price) if you bring your own wine.
