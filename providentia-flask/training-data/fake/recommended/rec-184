I work near Subworks and often place large sub orders to feed my staff for lunch when we are working on Saturdays.  Yesterday, I placed an order at 11:45 am to be delivered at 1:00 pm.  It was an order for 8 subs, which is smaller than the orders I usually place.  At 12:55, I received a call from Stephanie saying my order wasn't going to be ready for 1:00 pm.  I said "that's ok, how long do you think it will be?".  She put Barbara, the manager, on the phone.  Barbara proceeded to complain to me that they are too busy working on an order that was placed before mine for 40 subs and repeated that my order would not be ready.  I asked her why I wasn't told when I called that they were too busy to fill my request.  I would have called another place.  She responded with, "so do you want to cancel the order?".  Of course I had to cancel it because my staff was going to break for lunch in 5 minutes and I had no food to give them.  Barbara did not once apologize for their mistake and instead made me feel like my order was a huge inconvenience for her.  Well, I won't be ordering from or visiting Subworks ever again. Barbara won't have to worry about my orders being an inconvenience to her ever again! To the owner of Subworks, I'm sorry to inform you that you have a lousy manager who has caused you to lose future business because of her incredibly rude way of speaking to good customers.
