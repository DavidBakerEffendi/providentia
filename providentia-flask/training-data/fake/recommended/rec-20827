I can't believe I'm reviewing a fast food joint, but I feel the need. Craving wings on a rainy night after a hard day. Wing Zone closed, not that I miss their scrawny wings so much but they did have flavor. First time ordering here, delivery, love the name. Awful! First off, they are "kinda" battered. Not real wings (yes, ordered the bone in). I hate battered, but who doesn't like firied chicken, so could have lived with it. Let's see, ordered three diffferent kinds, all supposedly spicy, couldn't tell a diff. no spicy, no flavour. Breading soggy, and we're not talking fried, it was soggy no taste breading. barely any sauce, kinda gross! Enough said. Ordered cole slaw, didn't arrive, side salad was soggy, no salad spinner?, extra blue dressing, didn't arrive. Called and only option was store credit, never ordering from them again so no deal. The extra star is for the delivery guy who worked hard to find my house, which is difficult. He was great.
