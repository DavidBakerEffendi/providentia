A marvelous experience. I had a light meal, but thought the restaurant was beautiful. It is located in the Neue Galerie which houses a number of Klimt paintings and a number of German and Austrian exhibits. I suppose it was the combination of a delicious crepe and coffee in a wonderful setting that made me love it so.
