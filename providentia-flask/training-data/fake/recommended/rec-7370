I've been coming to Salt & Fat since the restaurant first opened about 2 or 3 years ago, and I have never left unsatisfied. The food is excellent, and the service is also great. If you're a foodie and you like to try new flavor combinations and different dishes, this is the place to go. I highly recommend if you want to impress one of your Manhattan friends who think that Queens has nothing to offer, because Salt & Fat will definitely make them think twice about that. I've tried mostly everything on the menu, and every time I go I make sure to order the scallops and the pork trotter. Both are AMAZING! And the bacon popcorn is especially delicious too. Kudos to the chef at Salt & Fat for being a culinary genius!
