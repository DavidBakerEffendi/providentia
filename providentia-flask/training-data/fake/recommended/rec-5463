Was in town and had some of the samples they were giving out for an outdoor event.  Once I went inside I had the Jambalaya Bowl which I give 8/10 (great for restaurant but just missing the  homemade flavor).  Now the soups on the other hand, are the best.  I had Creole Chicken Corn Chowder and a Mac and Cheese Ball the next day before I went home  This place is great for a quick bite (Its like a deli style setup with barstools) while sightseeing in Philadelphia.
