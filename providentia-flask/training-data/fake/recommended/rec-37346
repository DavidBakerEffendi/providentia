I don't know how I feel about this place. I've eaten food from here a few times and have always gotten mixed responses. The first time I came here for dinner, I really enjoyed my pasta. There were no complaints! The second time I got food here, was from a takeout pizza. It was rather soft, pretty good, but nothing too special. I came back with my significant other for dinner, and had no major issues with our food. In fact, since we were here rather late, they took off a charge for calamari and our dessert (since they didn't have the ones we asked about). That left a good impression! However, my significant other and his parents have frequently been stating lately that their pizza is getting worse. "It isn't how it used to be", they say. Unfortunately, I haven't tried their pizza back in 'the good 'ol days' so I am not one to say. They explained that they were disappointed with a recent experience at the restaurant and would no longer be coming back. Apparently, after ordering calamari as an appetizer, they didn't receive it until the main course had come. They asked to send it back until the course was finished, which they did, but unfortunately it came back cold. When they finally ate it, it wasn't even as good as it used to be. However, they still charged them for the poor quality of an appetizer. However, I personally wasn't turned off by their food. I tried a meatball hero at one point and it was rather good. The meatballs were very moist (maybe a little too moist) but they tasted good. Unfortunately, since it was takeout, they packed it in a way so that the bread and cheese got stuck to the plate and broke off as I ate.
