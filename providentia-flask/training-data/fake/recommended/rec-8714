This may be my first review but this place is great!  They bombard you with really great home style Italian food.  Pesto and bruschetta bread to start and salad following that.  By the time we made it to our appetizer, fried calamari, we were already full.  The calamari was delicious and tender, the entrees were humongous portions and so tasty.  The atmosphere is a little loud with very dim lighting. The food is well worth the price. A must try restaurant!
