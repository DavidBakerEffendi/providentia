It's the best 3,000 calorie, booze-filled lunch ever! My wife the food freak took me here.  I resisted at first. "How good can some lunch place in Philly be?  Why are we waiting for 20 minutes on a Thursday at 11:45 a.m." Small, intimate, with fantastic service. They have the 1920s honeycomb floors.  The vibe suggests pending Mob hit, in a good way.  Attentive but not annoying service.  We had a burger and this decadent lobster mac-and-cheese with real chunks of fresh lobster.  Burger dominated and overwhelmed its bun. The appetizer was this pickled cauliflower-thing on bread.  We split an Irish car bomb shake, part whiskey, part chocolate shake, part chocolate cake.  Amazing. The bill for two with a drink each was under $60.  This is a one of a kind lunch and dining experience.
