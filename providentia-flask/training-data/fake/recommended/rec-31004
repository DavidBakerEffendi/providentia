In Riva never disappoints. The food is delicious (mamas meat balls, polenta, duck ragu & pepperoni pizza are some of my favorites), the waitstaff is always great and the atmosphere is perfect (both indoor and outdoor). Â  Last night we ordered a 4 course tasting menu and it was amazing. Everything their kitchen puts out is a masterpiece!
