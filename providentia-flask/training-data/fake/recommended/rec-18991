This was a regular spot for me before I moved to the city, and in the past month I've already been back twice. This place has great food - from sandwiches to eggs and toast (my go-to Sunday brunch meal) - but be aware of the crowds. I've never had to wait more than half an hour, but the place is small and cramped (you pretty much sit on top of each other) so I wouldn't suggest going with a group. But for a small brunch or coffee, this place is worth it!
