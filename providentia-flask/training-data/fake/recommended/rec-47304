I ordered from here solely based on reviews & location. And bc they have a pizza named Cheesus Christ (how fun is that?!). Bad idea. I should have asked price & size. I was charged $50 for THREE 1-topping 10"/6-slice pies of mediocre taste. The crust is hardly "crusty". In fact, it's quite flaccid & mushy. And burnt. Not sure how one accomplishes that, but Roberta's has succeeded. I will never order here again.
