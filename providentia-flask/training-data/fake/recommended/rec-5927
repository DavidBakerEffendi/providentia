If such a thing is possible in Manhattan, this is a real townie bar, and I love it.  When I step into Tavern on Jane, I feel like I'm walking into some old school inn somewhere up north on the Hudson.  And the food is exactly the sort of meat and potatoes comfort food you'd expect from such a place.  I can't say I've ever had a bad meal here.  The roast chicken is a stand out for me, as well as the potatoes au gratin.  Yum.
