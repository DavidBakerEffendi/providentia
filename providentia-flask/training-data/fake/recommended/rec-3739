I'm so happy I finally tried this place out! All the food on display looked wonderful. Some of the prices seemed a bit high but their lunch specials sounded good, I would definitely go back for their soup lunch special which was soup, a side, and a soda for $7. This time though I had a side of plantains and a chicken empanada. The plantains were delicious, nice and plump. They gave them to me in a cup and there were a lot. The empanada was pretty good too. Filled nicely and flavored well. It was definitely enough food for lunch and only $3.80. Will be back!
