Best diner ever.  Like seriously.... ever.  The menu is a classic diner menu with diner fare but the food  is prepared using fresh ingredients.  I'm obsessed with the gyro platter, chicken kabobs, omelets, salads, and broccoli rabe.  What diner has broccoli rabe sautéed with olive oil, garlic, and fresh mushrooms????? The Nevada.  Just go.
