I have to admit, for the price this place is a slam dunk. They give you quite a bit of food with their brunch special. I had the arepas, and i ordered an extra side of plantains. Wowsers! Those plantains lasted me and my dining partner for two whole other separate meals. You can't even buy uncooked plantains at the store for that cheap! The food was delicious, the blood mary (which comes with the brunch special btw) was decent, and the service was prompt. All in all, I haven't found a place that compares when you factor food, price, and service. Go Yuca!
