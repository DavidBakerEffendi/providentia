Just moved into the neighborhood (from the big apple) and am addicted to Ramen.  So was happy to find this spot 3 blocks from my new digs... broth is good.. not too salty, noodles have a great firm, chewy texture, pork is fatty and good.. steamed pork bun are delicious too.  Dangerous how close it is to my house.. argh!
