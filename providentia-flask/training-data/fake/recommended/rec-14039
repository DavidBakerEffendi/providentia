I like Public. It's offers a good variety for brunch at good prices. The pancakes are pretty good with the fresh ricotta. If you're looking for something savory, then try the smoked salmon and poached eggs. The cuisine is always accented with a particular uniqueness just like the modern industrial decor. I must say, I'll need to come back for a dinner. The entrees sound spectacular.
