Just a wonderful, little French restaurant in New York City. I went there for dinner and had a great experience. The menu is very simple and the plates are made to be shared. The ambiance is just lovely and you feel like you have been whisked away to Paris. Service was excellent. The menu had about 15 or so dishes such as coq au vin, steak tartare, mussels, Â legumes and then cheese and pate choices. Each dish was made to perfection. For the 3 of us, we ordered 4 plates, 2 cheeses, and 1 pate and we were pretty full. A great place for a date or a group of friends. I will definitely be back.
