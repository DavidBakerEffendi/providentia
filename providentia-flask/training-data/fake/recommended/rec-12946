Who would have thought that a vegetarian would fall in love with a place called The Meatball Shop?!? This was hands down, one of the best meals I've had so far in NYC. I came here at the recommendation of a fellow vegetarian and ordered the Kitchen Sink Special -- I got 3-4 veggie balls with pesto sauce on top of a bed of greens, and a side of steamed broccoli. And let me just say, THESE BALLS WERE AMAZEBALLS. It was a nice respite from the typical veggie burger and the pesto sauce was so yummy! I savored every bite. You know when you finish a Â meal and you wish you could go through the act of eating it all over again? Yup, that's how I felt after my experience at the Meatball Shop. The decor of the place was really cool, I enjoyed the dimly lit room. They may not be maximizing their seating capacity by placing one big table in the middle of the room, but that's their choice. Great place for a nice laid back dinner--highly recommend!!
