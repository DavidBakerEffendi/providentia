Stopped by this adorable, cozy spot for brunch and it was lovely. Tasty, homey food that left me full and content =). I ordered the crepe with fig, goat cheese, and honey and added on chicken since I wanted some protein in there. My bf got the curry chicken crepe. Both were fantastic and delicious, with really interesting flavors and ingredients that blended together very well. I had been a little apprehensive about my crepe choice (not a huge fan of figs) but felt pressured by the countless yelp reviews praising it. I was glad I took the leap! The crepes come in a square shape instead of the triangular shape you'll see more commonly, with an open-faced center, as well as a side salad. Really good, and hit the spot for me. Recommended!
