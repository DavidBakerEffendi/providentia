I've had mixed experiences with the Jose Garces restaurants (Garces Trading Co. and Distrito were positive, Amada and Chifa were not) but Tinto is by far my favorite.  We ate here for their Don Quioxte dinner, 10 dishes and 4 wine pairings.  Every dish was cooked perfectly; creative ingredients and flavor combinations.  First experience with rare squab and it was phenomenal. Great service.  Staff is very knowledgeable.  I will definitely come back here again to experience their standard menu.
