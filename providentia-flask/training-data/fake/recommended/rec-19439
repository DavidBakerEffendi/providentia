Have a big group? Need to just take them somewhere to keep them busy, fed, and well lubricated? Frankfort Hall is perfect for that.... Jenga, Ping Pong, drinking games... They have it all. The food is German (duh) and beer is also German (duh) with some local brews as well. It is definitely a hike from Center City... But maybe that is the draw?
