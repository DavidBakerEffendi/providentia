I have been searching for a long time for a good brunch place in the area. Having tried different brunch spots from living near NYC and in Philadelphia I can be slightly critical when it comes to food because I have tried so many places. I must say that I will definitely be coming back here. The food was delicious and the restaurant was cute. The organic whole wheat pancakes were probably the best pancakes I've ever had. Will definitely be back!
