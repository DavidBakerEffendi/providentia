One of the best meals of my life. It's Italian the way you want it to be- well seasoned, proper portions, classic but fresh. We dined with another couple and had bread with basil compound butter, amazing!, diver scallops, veal, and short rib ragu over gnocchi. All of it was delicious and the ambiance is perfect...very NYC. Cannot wait to return, and although we aren't locals we'll plan another trip just to eat here again!
