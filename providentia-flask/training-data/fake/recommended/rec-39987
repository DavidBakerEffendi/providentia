I'm a fan of national mechanics having been here 5-6 times in the past year. The service here has always been great and the food itself is in the 3-4 star range. Of note, Ive had the veggie burger and though it was all right, but in their defense some of my friends have raved about it. Although obviously not pre made frozen patty, the veggie burger didn't do it for me. It could likely be because their regular burger is so well made. Ive had good experiences with food off of the specials menu. On my most recent trip I had the nachos (vegetarian) and hummus as appetizers. The salsa in the nachos tasted store bought, but I was a fan of the guacamole. The hummus was fine. I go here mostly for the great atmosphere and great service and National Mechanics has always come through.
