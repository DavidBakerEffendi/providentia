Oh wow. Found Sakagura on Yelp after searching for Chawanmushi and made a last minute reservation - totally exceeded my expectations. The receptionist was accommodating and courteous when I kept changing my reservation, so that was a good start, but the food would bring me back anyway. I've been here maybe 4 times in the last few months and keep bringing new people here every time. Great for traditional fair away from sushi, and with the soft jazz and amber lighting and old Tokyo decor, it feels like I'm walking into a Cowboy Bebop episode every time I'm here.
