I LOVE THIS PLACE..!! Its basically my second home!  Great place to hang out, eat, drink, or dance if your up for it.  Try out the pork buns (aka crack buns) and the Wings here are SO GOOD!!!  The drinks here are legit, the music is always good, and the staff here are AWESOME!  Don't think about if you want to go there...just DO IT!
