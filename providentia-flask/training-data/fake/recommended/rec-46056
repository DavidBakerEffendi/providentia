I have only had the Banh Mi Sai Gon here but it was excellent and I recommend the place. The sandwich was perfectly balanced with the right amount of meat and pate and vegetables and not too much mayo. So if you have never had the national sandwich of Vietnam and you like pork, try one of these. The price is right too.
