Love this place!! I live in California now and have to make a visit every time I'm back in the city.  I've eaten my way through the menu and the burger, mussels, and wings are at the top my list of favorites.  Discovered that you can order the magnificent blood orange margarita by the shaker - an excellent value for a great cocktail.  The bread pudding is quite amazing too.
