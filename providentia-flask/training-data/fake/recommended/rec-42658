To be fair I tried this not only once, but twice to make sure I hadn't gotten a dud meal. The rice and lo mein are terribly bland. I ordered light onions and it came with chunks of onions. Boneless spare ribs were dry and the chicken wings I ordered hadn't seen a fryer since yesterday. My brother pointed out that I was the 5th order of the day so it only leaves me to believe that they were reheated. Egg roll was ok. Worse part customer service is terrible barely greeted me when I came and picked the food. Asked me what I ordered and charged my card and left it on the counter and walked away. I had to wave him down for a pen to sign the receipt. Never again will I go here. Ming moon has faired well in the Wethersfield area, but definitely no one will replace Black Bamboo in West Hartford....
