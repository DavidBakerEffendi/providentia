I've been eating here since it opened in its smaller location years ago. I had just moved to BK from LA and was so happy to have a great Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood. Definitely the best Mexican food I've had since leaving LA. The owner's are really sweet and I'm glad business is going well. I'm vegetarian - and I've had all the veggie friendly dishes here and they're all terrific depending on what you're in the mood for. The spicy green salsa is epic and the Brunch is not to be missed.
