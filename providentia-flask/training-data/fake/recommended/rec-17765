Worst place to have barbecue!! I met a friend for a quick dinner and luckily there was a Groupon (only way I would have tried this place). The food was absolutely disgusting and not edible. The potato salad looked like it had been sitting and was old, the collard greens were disgusting. The beef rid had more fat than meet and looked as though it was bad meat. And it didn't help that the owner was walking around like she was trying to relive Flashdance. Plus I have never used a Groupon for exactly what it was for and end up owing for a party deposit - what the heck that is I have no idea. Do you self a favor and find somewhere else to eat - even if your desperate!!!
