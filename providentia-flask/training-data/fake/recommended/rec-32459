Ichiban is an interesting place to review. I've been here a number of times now and I finally get it. Ichiban is not a Japanese restaurant. If you look through the lower star reviews you'll notice that most of them discuss Japanese food, specifically sushi. Ichiban's sushi isn't terrible, on par with most middle of the road places actually, it just gets in the way of what they really do well which is traditional Korean food. I have brought a number of my co-workers here for their lunch special which has many options and is very affordable. (~$12) Kimchee Geegae was very good and plenty spicy. The Hemultang and Doen Jang Geegae are also very good. All three are soups/stews served in stone pots that maintain the temperature for a while. I love the feeling after eating warm nourishing food but if it's too hot for you, just wait. Their Korean BBQ is solid but not the best I've had. It always tastes better when you cook it yourself and they have that option here but I've only had it from the kitchen. I definitely plan to bring a group here for some Jinro and BBQ.
