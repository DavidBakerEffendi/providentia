I had this place all wrong. I came back here on a Saturday after the final game of the world cup. This place was amazingly refreshing after the 7 dollars a beer at Brass Monkey. I was starving, having woken up at 2:00 PM for the game, and going immediately to the bar. I ordered first one burger, then another. Both hit the spot perfectly, and for 2 burgers, and 2 drinks, the bill was less than 25 dollars. This place really came through this time. Note: I think the main reason I didn't appreciate this place the first time, was that I had overhyped the burgers, and expected a little too much. This place is perfect for a neighborhood snack, and a drink.
