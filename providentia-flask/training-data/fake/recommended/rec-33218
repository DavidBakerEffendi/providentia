I've been here twice, the first time I ordered some sort of pork sandwich with pickles and other garnishes on top. The second time, I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich. Considering the rating of this place, I truly tried to mentally tell myself this place was worth its hype. Unfortunately, it isn't. I mean there's nothing spectacular about the sandwiches. I could get this anywhere. The other things is.. when you place an order to go, you can watch the employees make the sandwich, which basically consists of placing pre-made ingredients on two pieces of bread and toasting the bread.. nothing spectacular. I mean the food isn't bad, but the ratings are a bit inflated in my opinion.
