Lunch at Penelope made me feel like I was on vacation or at the very least somewhere else, which was a great thing. We stopped in for lunch and were pleased with everything. Lunch was: Nice Chicken Meatballs appetizer: Since the Chicken Meatballs were all over the menu, we figured lets give them a whirl. I like that the meatballs are chunky with bits of coarsely chopped onion. The flavor is overall good. For all the menu fanfare I expected something else like a secret ingredient. But, good meatball. Entrees: The Apple/Brie Sandwich with Chicken and Honey Mustard on 7 grain bread with a side of greens. I was very happy with the flavors and the portions seemed right on. Chicken Pot Pie with greens. Looked nice and homey. Taste was really nice. Crust was a great combination of flaky and substantial. Atmosphere was good and laid back. Staff was really nice. Prices are affordable. We'll have to come for Brunch sometime.
