My wife and I are Indian food lovers. In the past we have had to go into Princeton for a decent curry. No longer. Kochi has really raised the bar in the area and serves up delicious dishes from both north and south India. We were really impressed with Tom the owner and his attention to our tastes. He was helpful in guiding us as we tried both old favorites and a few new surprises. Definitely highly recommend and we will be returning again soon. Don't miss out on this gem hidden in a strip mall, it's great and you'll be glad you tried it.
