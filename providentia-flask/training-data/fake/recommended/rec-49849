great drinks. lovely atmosphere. had I not lived on the west coast for the past 17 years i'd probably think the food was fantastic but sadly, this is standard east coast Mexican. i know what we have out in California is not the real deal either but it's heads and shoulders above what New York has on offer. Ok, it's the one things we've got on you, so please, let us be the ones to gloat, just this once...
