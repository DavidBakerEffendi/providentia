The not-so-creatively named Vermont pub in downtown Burlington serves a lot of purposes. It's a functional "inner city" bar (if you can call Burlington a real city). It's a decent restaurant with traditional American food. And it's a pretty decent brewery. Â  They have a lot of different beers on tap of their own making, and some of them push the experimental side pretty far. Which is great! The sampler is a beautiful single-line deck and it's one of the few places I've been that brews an actually tasty Irish Red. A note to beer tourists - Burlington will overwhelm you with it's breweries and they all are open at odd and different times. Use the Vermont Pub as your "downtime" or mid-afternoon stop when other places aren't quiet open.
