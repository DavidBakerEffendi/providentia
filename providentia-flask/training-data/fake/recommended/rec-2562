In the battle between Cheese-Steak giants Geno's and Pat's, Geno's is like the Lowrider Chevy Impala with chrome rims, whale-tail, curb feelers, exhaust tips, fuzzy dice, loud stereo, and faux-sheepskin seat covers. It's loud. Really loud. The place is freaking covered in neon, is bright as all getout, and there's copious politically-charged postings in their windows. All in all it lends to a fascist vibe that you WILL buy your steak at Geno's and you WILL like it! Pat's, directly across the street, is the Chevy Nova with a fading paint job and Bondo in a dent in the door. Point being, just as both are Chevys underneath, the actual cheesesteaks aren't that much different. I used to go to each interchangeably but I've decided that I prefer Pat's. I like the steaks a little better but I also like the unpretentious, grungy vibe. To be sure, the only time I generally go is when I'm intoxicated (and this is good advice for everyone, by the way - it's a real slice of Philly after 2AM), so my judgement on the sammiches may be flawed. Neither one really makes the best Philly Cheesesteak anyway. Try Tony Lukes, Steaks On South, John's Roast Pork or (my personal fave) Abner's.
