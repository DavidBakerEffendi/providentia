The Saint Austere has been my favorite restaurant in NYC since it opened 2 years ago!  I have NEVER had a bad experience.  The unique thing about the St. Austere is their 'tapas and a half' style plates that allow to customize your dining experience every time you go.  Group of 15, No problem [but you should probably call ahead]; 2 for happy hour snacks or dinner, affordable and satisfying.  The staff is always there to help pick what to order, describe ingredients, suggest wine pairings - I mean, truly this place is one of a kind.   Favorite Dinner for 2:  Wine; Polenta; Patatas Bravas; [pork-belly croquettes*]; Housemade Cavatelli First time? Definitely get the tasting menu.  It runs around $40 per person (more if you include wine pairings) - but you have the option to customize what you pick and it's really the best way to try a bit of everything [and be VERRRY full].   Otherwise, you really can't go wrong with this delicious menu. *Please bring back the pork bellies! :D -Corey
