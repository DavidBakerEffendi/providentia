So I held off on this review for nearly a year. Why? It's not often that I say "that was literally the best __________ I've ever had." But that's exactly what Is said about Paesano's roast suckling pig sandwich. So i sat on it for a long while and here we are. It's literally the best sandwich I've ever had. Get there early, but not before me.
