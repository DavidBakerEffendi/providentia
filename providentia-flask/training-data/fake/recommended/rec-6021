I read about this fried chicken finger joint a long time ago. Â But never git a chance to try it out. Either I got no time or I rejected my bf's idea to go there. 1. I think the price is actually quite expensive for 3 "little" fingers. 2. It's not that convenient for us to go after work. We worked in UES. On this Thursday which was our anniversary, bf took me over there for our anniversary dinner. With more than an hour till our dinner reservation, we wondered around the neighborhood and trying to find a place to sit after 1 hour walk. He suggested this place. It's quite empty the time we went in. We only ordered 3 pieces of the classic cruchy fried chicken fingers. Didn't want to stuff ourselves before dinner. The wait was about 5 minutes. Then it came with these 3 giant pieces of chicken fingers. They were huge! It's my fault that I thought the tenders were small just judging from the pictures. They were so juice and fresh and cruchy. Love their crust! It's fried perfectly without excess oil left in your taste bud. Totally worth the walk and price. Definitely coming back to try out their other crazy flavor.
