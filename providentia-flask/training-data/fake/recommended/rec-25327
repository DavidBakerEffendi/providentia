I love this place. the ambiance is great and reminds me of an old school bar with the music and drink menu. I ordered a dirty martini and the bartender asked me how dirty I like it (now, now get your mind out of he gutter) Â and adjusted it without hesitation when I asked him. It was a fun place and we'll be going there again.
