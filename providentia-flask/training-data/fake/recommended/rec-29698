Ate here every week for the last few weeks. We tried other similar pizza places and this is one of the top! Food: Exceptional. Service: Great! Price: Good. Good after a show. Warning: Very little seating. Although when I went, I got lucky every time and found seats for me and my fiance, but Â finding 2 seats is easy. But pizza's deliciousness overpowers the seating issue. Still 5 stars! I highly recommend.
