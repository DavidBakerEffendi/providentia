Simply amazing! Cute and intimate restaurant, I highly suggest making reservations for dinner, even on a weekday. Portions are large enough to share between 2 people so my friend and I ordered the following: 1. Arugula salad: delicious, ricotta salata cheese is one of my favorites so this was a must try. It's a light but satisfying salad. 2. Side of brussel sprouts & bacon: good flavoring, a little greasy though. 3. Bianca pizza: WOW, this was one of the best pizzas I've ever had. The pizza's thin crust was perfection, absolutely amazing. Great cheese and we added sausage on half the pizza. I highly recommend and would definitely come back again. Prices are moderate considering the portion size. My only regret is not ordering pasta, next time!
