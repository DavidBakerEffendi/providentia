They informed us that the menu here is seasonal and dependent on the quality of the ingredients. The sweet peas were not sweet enough on the day we came so they didn't make any sweet peas flan. The food tasted great. My favorite was the strawberry spinach salad with candied pecans. It was lightly dressed but still one of the best salads I've has. The service is wonderful. You also get free bread to start.
