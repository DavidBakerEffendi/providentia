Just moved to the neighborhood.  I had been dying to try this place, and it absolutely lives up to the hype.  The pizza is exceptional in every way, and I think the calzones may be even better than the pizza.  Make sure to order both.  The BYO policy, charming (if spartan) interior and great service are all added benefits, but I would give Lucali five stars for the food alone.  I recommend over-ordering and taking home what you don't finish.
