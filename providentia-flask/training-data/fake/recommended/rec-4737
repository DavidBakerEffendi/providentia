Zento further proves that I am every marketing scheme's wet dream. I fall for all sorts of items in cute little packages. So when I saw a high quality picture of their Square Sushi roll in Philadelphia Mag, I had to go. Food needs to aesthetically please my palate AND my eyes. Further more, I have a major crush on Morimoto and learning that the sushi chef here interned under him. Oh, I think I had a wet dream, myself. The restaurant is small. T he space here can accommodate about 25 people patrons. Since I'm s-m-r-t and didn't make reservations we had to wait about 45 mins on a Friday night for a table. That wasn't too bad since there are lots of places in Olde City to grab a drink while you wait. The waitress took down my name and cell to call me when a table was ready. We brought a bottle of wine and ordered the square sushi roll, rainbow roll, softshell crab tempura roll, kanpachi (yellowtail) roll, spicy tuna and edamame. The service was great, quick and attentive. All of the rolls were tasty and looked beautiful, however, they were TINY! Their sushi rolls pack a lot of flavor but the size just doesn't do it for me. As much as I love feeling like a giant when I pick up small things, I'd rather not feel that way when picking up my food.
