My coworkers and I had a wonderful experience when we came in today for lunch.  The owners were both out on the floor, greeting customers and providing a ton of knowledge on th menu items and ingredients.  We all decided to go with the hot food section trying the vegetable lasagna and turkey meatloaf.  All rave reviews.  The kale chips are wonderful and the sample of chocolate chia pudding on our way out was to die for (worth heading back just for that).  Anyone on the primal/paleo bandwagon or just looking to eat as natural as possible needs to give Hu Kitchen a try.
