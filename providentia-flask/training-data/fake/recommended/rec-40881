Ordered the cuban while my wife had the short rip sandwich. The meat is melt in your mouth good. The pretzel rolls are amazing. Even the salad that came with the sandwich was delicious. Probably the only real top notch restaurant in the neighborhood. I'll definitely be going back to try other items on the menu.
