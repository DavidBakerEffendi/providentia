TAPAS! TAPAS! TAPAS! I'm obsessed with tapas so any excuse to try a new place is fine by me. Casa Mono was great from beginning to end. The space is tiny and very dimly lit, which adds to the intimate atmosphere. Make a reservation early! Between 2 ppl, we shared Pulpo, Razor Clams, Skirt Steak, Guinea Hen, Patatas Bravas, and Pork Croquetas. For dessert we had the Crema Catalana. All over a bottle of Lalama :-) I dont have anything bad to say about any of the dishes.everything had the right combination of ingridients to make it taste delicious. I especially liked the razor clams and patatas bravas. This place made me reminisce about my amazing dining experience in Spain. Highly recommend!
