Food: 4 stars Service: 4 stars Ambiance: 4 stars Location: 4 stars Price: 3 stars Recommendations: The pork sandwich is delicious and a classic.  The sharp provolone makes the sandwich.  I am excited to try the roast beef.  It looked delicious on the cutting board.  Definitely a great choice in Reading Terminal.
