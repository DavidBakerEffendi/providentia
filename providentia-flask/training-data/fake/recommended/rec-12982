Still the best, as always. Perfect as a dinner spot after a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge, hungry stomachs abound! We had the half and half - half pepperoni and half mushroom. Yum! The pizza slices are true New York style, large, cheesy, with loads of ingredients and fairly thin crust. The place smells so heavenly, I swear it makes one ever hungrier as you are waiting for your awesome, delicious food! The menu is good, the service is fast and I would have given it five stars if not for the 1 hour wait to get in at 6pm! I thought we were early enough but I guess there will always be a line at Grimaldi's at all times of the day. Bring cash and an umbrella - it drizzled while we were waiting so that was not fun at all! Well worth the visit though, I would come back here again when I visit Manhattan, just to get another slice of that yummy pizza!
