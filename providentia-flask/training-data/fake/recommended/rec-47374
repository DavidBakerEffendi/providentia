I went here on a whim after reading about their french toast on a friend's blog. It lived up to my expectations, so I was happy. Unfortunatley, it was nearly 3pm and I hadn't eaten all day so I couldn't eat more b/c i felt like my stomach shrunk... Maybe it's just the neighborhood, but I'm really not diggin' the whole "lets smush tables so close together that the woman (me) has to squeeze in to sit against the wall and the man has to sit on the chair. It was super crowded when we got there, so I was relieved that we actually didn't have to wait any time for a table. I must give a shout out to the waiter who admitted she was confused by my request and took the $12 drink off the final bill b/c of the misunderstanding! I might go back in the summer when the city seems to empty out and I'll have some more elbow room.
