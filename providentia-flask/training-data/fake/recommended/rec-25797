This was my second time at Rye. The first time being during lunch. I think I enjoyed coming at lunch time more. The ambiance is great - it's intimate, cute, cozy. 90% of the dinner menu contained bacon - however there are no issues with having the dishes without - for vegetarians. The Brussel sprouts were cooked well and flavorful. The Mac and cheese came out piping hot and had a good taste once cool enough to be edible. I've had the meatloaf sandwich twice and this time I wasn't blown away like I was the first. I felt the sweet bbq sauce on it overwhelmed the great taste of the meatloaf and the fried onions were way too salty. I've tried the vanilla crème brûlée and it was the best I've had. The waitstaff were knowledgeable and the bartenders are great. Try an old fashioned - they make them well with a large cube of ice. Around 8pm it did get quite busy.
