I am not an "elite" reviewer here at Yelp, and I don't know how to review a restaurant with the same highfalutin' vocabulary most common to wine or beer afficionados. I do know one thing, though - this restaurant has captured my heart as well as my stomach. I've eaten here more times than I can count, and it has almost become a pilgrimage for me each time i come to the city. I have never been disappointed. Not every review here is positive, and every restaurant can have an off night, or it's just not to the liking of every patron. For me, I've never found a place that I enjoy more consistently. I speak for myself. The food is authentic northern Italian cuisine, prepared by Renato (from the Genoa area) and his loyal staff. The lobster cannelloni are divine, and as has been mentioned, the meatballs large enough to choke a horse. The spaghetti alle vongole is al dente and succulent. The osso buco, again of brobdingnagian proportions, melts in your mouth. One day, Renato served me a marinated lamb's tongue appetizer that wasn't even on the menu, and I promptly died and went to heaven. The place is always full, and it's loud. Renato has to shout the menu at you in his peculiar blend of Genovese and English, and you may not understand everything. No worries - whatever you order is likely to be scrumptious. The staff are faithful, attentive, friendly and competent. It's true, their desserts are outsourced, but that's never put me off. Wherever they get their tiramisu, it's a lot better (light, fluffy, creamy) than many I've had elsewhere. I'm teetotal, so I can't comment on Â their selection of wines; but then I've never seen anyone stand up and shout rude imprecations because it was bad. Reservations are a must. Or you will wait. And it will be worth it. Dagnabit, now I'm drooling all over my keyboard. Go. Soon. You can thank me later.
