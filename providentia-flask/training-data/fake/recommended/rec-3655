Greatness every single time I eat here! My go to orders are the Booker T which is the burger topped with a piece of fried chicken. It sound ridiculous but it taste amazing and you are getting the best of everything on the menu. Brunch here is amazing also, just get there early as there is always a bit of a wait on the weekends. The staff is warm and friendly. The drinks are delicious. Hot House is definitely a Bed-Stuy gem!
