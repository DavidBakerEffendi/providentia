This place is adorable--my boyfriend lives about a block away and we  decided to try it out after seeing it packed every night (even yesterday, Wednesday, when we went at 10pm!).  The decor is really unique (there was a giant wooden ant above our heads) and the space is intimate and candlelit.  The food, however, is just so-so.  We had the beet salad, the cauliflower soup, coq au vin, and the burger.  Everything tasted fine, but it seemed really overpriced for what it was--nothing special or particularly memorable (I could have gotten a much better burger at corner bistro down the street for $10 less).  Service was great--maybe I'll come back for brunch.
