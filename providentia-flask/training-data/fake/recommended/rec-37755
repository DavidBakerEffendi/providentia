Terakawa is my go to spot for ramen in Philadelphia. While they may not have the fancy spoons found at ramen bar, the richness of their broth and the fullness of its flavor make it a step above the rest....in Philly. It's not quite up to NYC standards for ramen yet, but it's pretty close. I usually get the whopper ramen which is like a double serving of the Mayu ramen with delicious crushed garlic oil in the tonkotsu (Berkshire pork bone broth).  It has almost everything that Terakawa has to offer - 5 slices of that tender, delicious charshu (pork), bean sprouts, cabbage, sliced carrots, bamboo shoots, kikurage mushroom, 2 delicate halves of hard broiled egg.  Add some dehydrated garlic and some of that spicy chili oil (if you can figure out how to work the pump action). You can also customize the actual ramen noodles by getting thick or thin noodles and specifying the firmness of the noodles. Another delicious item is the fried pork with rice and curry and a side salad.  The pork is always juicy and cooked just right.  The curry is rich and on point.  And the combination of fried pork, rice, and curry is ridiculous! Staff is super nice and remember your name. Prices are reasonable.  Cash or credit Enjoy!
