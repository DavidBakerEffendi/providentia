Here is the situation: my wife & I were walking around on a crisp fall afternoon, having ourselves a nice little time. Maybe we were walking to the Clover Club for some cocktails, or the Court Street Cinema for a movie.  Regardless.  My wife raised her hand, pointed to an inflated turkey wearing a Pilgrim's outfit, & said: "Oh look, Palo Santo!" Of course, she didn't mean the Thanksgiving decoration but rather the holiday mascot, but now we've started creating a mythology around the Turkey in a Pilgrim's outfit, Palo Santo.   Which goes to show you: it can be easy to forget this place exists.  Hidden away as it is, it behooves you to recall it in your moment of need.  Grab brunch, grab dinner!  The interior's strange nautical theme is about as authentic as a Wes Anderson movie, but not in a precious way.  The food is odd; twists on the usual.  So be prepared for something a little playful.
