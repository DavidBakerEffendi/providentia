I come here for the food first and the sports scene second.  I now live in Seattle and go here every time I come home.  We always get: Mussels in red sauce Crab fries Pizza- honestly my favorite pizza in the entire country... no lie!  Lots of sauce on top of the cheese baked to the textured crust.  Amazing!
