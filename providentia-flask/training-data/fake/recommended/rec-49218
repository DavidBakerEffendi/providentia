We/I have been to JL's 5-6 times for dinner and drinks, and it just doesn't get any better or friendlier than this. Came in with a business partner form out of town, and I left feeling like the mayor! The service is terrific and beyond friendly, good Mid-Westerner's from Wisconsin that treat everyone like family. Daniel, the bartender, practically dove over the bar to shake my hand. The food is so good, oysters, pate, Steak au poivre, great wine, and bread pudding to die for. Cant wait to go back.
