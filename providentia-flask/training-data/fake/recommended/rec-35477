This place is amazing. Fairly difficult to find gluten free pasta (especially that's good) so between that and the reviews I was really excited. This place did not disappoint. The restaurant itself is quaint, with great staff and is always packed. Everything we ordered was phenomenal, I definitely recommend the Strozzapreti al ragu- the bolognese sauce was awesome. My friend got the pesto pasta and loved it as well. Â Would recommend getting a starter as well. The food is really well priced, the most expensive items are the wines- but worth the price. Can't recommend this place enough.
