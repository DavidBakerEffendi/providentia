Just stopped in this past week for the "Special Spicy Pork" sandwich and really love this place. I was addicted to it about two years ago until I played it out to Â my taste buds. Went there just way too much and had to stop. Since I am back I have to say that the taste and quality have not changed one bit and the pricing is certainly reasonable. The sandwich is not skimp at all and more importantly the flavors are big and delicious. This spot is great for the bahn mi, is small and not fancy. Go in get your food read a magazine grab a bubble tea and bounce! You got to try it.
