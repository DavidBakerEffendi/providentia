Café Gitane is the place to come with friends or to read the Sunday paper alone. Locals, it will make you feel part of your city and visitors, it will make you feel in the know., Across from the Hudson River and housed in the hotel where the Titanic survivors stayed, Café Gitane has location, history and good food!   But it also has Emma.  She is a terrific manager. I called her in advance because I needed a table for 6 for brunch as friends were in from out of town. She told me they didn't take reservations but not to worry. When I met her that morning, I saw she knew her stuff and we had a great time and great service and a great meal. She and I even hugged each other when I left!  Emma is aces and so is Café Gitane. Love the baked egg dishes, excellent coffee and the pastries.  I have had dinner here before and it is equally good.
