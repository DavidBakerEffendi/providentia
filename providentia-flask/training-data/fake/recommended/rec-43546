This is usually the place I go when I'm with a large group of friends because they accommodate both couples and large groups of people. The pub food is pretty great. The beer? Not so much. I understand the hype because it's a brewpub in the middle of downtown Burlington. Their beer isn't that great. Neither is their service. I've been here twice in the last 2 weeks and have gotten the wrong beer both times. I'm the kind of person who won't say anything and just deal with it and get over it but the second time left me a little frustrated. The only 2 beers I like are the snakebite and the premium cream, otherwise I'll pass. Their nachos are fantastic. I'm a little picky when it comes to nachos but these guys know how to make them right.
