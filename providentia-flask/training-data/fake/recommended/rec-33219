A couple friends and I went up to Philly from Baltimore for the night and we stumbled upon this restaurant for some sunday brunch. Â At first I was a bit hesitant to try this spot just because it was super busy and looked like it might just be a tourist trap. BOY was i wrong. We got a table right away (this place probably had about 100 diners already sitting) and there was nice outdoor seating overlooking the park as well as indoor seating which was just as nice because the windows were all open. My friend ordered the mimosa and i ordered the bellini to start. YUM! I got the eggs benedict which was delicious. Eggs benedict is eggs benedict but something about this dish made it extra good. I don't know if it was the tasty canadian bacon or the homemade hollandaise sauce but it was one of the best egg bennies i've ever had. We also got the yogurt parfait with granola and fresh fruit to share - and I know it sounds blah but it was a refreshing and tasty addition. The staff was super friendly and the french-like decor was a great atmosphere. Definitely recommend this place- the only downfall was the prices- but hey not every city can be as cheap as baltimore.
