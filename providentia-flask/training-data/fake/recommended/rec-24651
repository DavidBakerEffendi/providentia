But seriously, the food here is remarkable. The catfish sandwich with spicy fries is mind blowing. Whenever I go to Smorgasburg I end up not getting anything and just coming to Juniper because it's all I want. Service is craaaazy slow though. There's never more than one or two tables of people when I'm there, but it still takes over 20 minutes for the food to come out. My friends and I actually started calling ahead with our orders and showing up there to eat in the backyard haha. It's pay-at-the-counter style, so you can easily do this without looking like a huge douche canoe. Backyard is adorable, it's always nice and quiet and full of space so you can bring a whole group of people there.
