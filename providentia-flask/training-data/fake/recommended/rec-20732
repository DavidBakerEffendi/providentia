I just had to go back again for the Classic Ramen noodle with the pork belly, it was so good the first time.  The small piece of pork belly just melts in your mouth. Well, to my disappointment the second time there I got two paper thin slices of pork tender loin that looked like they didn't reconstituted enough. Dry like camel dong!  The only good thing was the noodle which was al dente!  Even the eel on rice was just okay, nothing to oodle about.
