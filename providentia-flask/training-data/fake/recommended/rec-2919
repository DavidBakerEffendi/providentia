I just moved into Fishtown a month ago and came across cedar point while out on a run.... Â While looking for "happy hours" in the area a week later I stopped in and was wowed by the service food and drink. This Low key gem has a phenomenal, ever-changing draft (and daily specials) list with obscure (and high in alcohol %) selections that last as long as the keg does. Their foodie-friendly specials coupled with an eclectic everyday menu is sure to entice every taste bud. Surely now one of my favorite spots. Salute and Bon appetite!
