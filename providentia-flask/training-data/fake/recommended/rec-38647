Govinda's had one shot to impress me, and one shot is all it took. I can slap a five-star rating up there with confidence because I would eat that same vegetarian cheesesteak over and over again if only I could. Â Trust me, I think about it more often than I care to admit. I guess I should try to be a cup-half-full optimist and declare it best for my health that I live thousands of miles away, but if you are anywhere in the vicinity of this place AND a vegetarian or vegan, it really is necessary that you stop by. As an ovo-lacto vegetarian who eats mostly vegan, I was in search of a quintessential Philly experience and opted for a gooey cheesesteak with real cheese. There was some sort of amazing gravy thrown in, and the fake meat had a wonderful, unexpected seasoning. I was really pleased that there were vegan options, and woefully eyed the dessert case full of vegan goods that I would have loved to sample if only I had some room.
