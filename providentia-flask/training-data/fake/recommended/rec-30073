I was at jury duty at the Superior Courthouse and I checked this out on Yelp. Thought I'd give it a try as it was just a block away. Wow! I got the chicken pita shawarma with lime cilantro hummus, corn-black bean salad, roasted cauliflower and the Tzatziki. They packed it in this cool cardboard box with a zip off top. I settled in my car, Â opened the little treasure and took a bite. I was in heaven. It was incredibly tasty and fresh, fresh, fresh! There fixin's bar makes Chipotle look like amateurs. I'm going back!
