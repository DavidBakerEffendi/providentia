This is a review for Saturday lunch only. My fianc√© and I were in the area and we were so hungry so we decided we were going to this place instead of my usual across the street. He really likes this place because they have pretty much everything from hot dogs to Chinese dim sum, it's actually quiet a sight when you are standing right there in the aisle. You look to the left you have your typical American food, then you look to the right you have yummy dim sum steamed up in the little bamboo thingy. I thought the selections were mediocre++, not the best but much better than your other tropical Chinese/Japanese buffet. Seafood/sushi choices were decent. Maybe they would have more choices if we went during dinner. Overall, I'd go back again for sure. Service was fast, as soon as they see an empty plate they came right up and cleaned it up.
