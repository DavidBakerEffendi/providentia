Living just around the corner, this is where my BF and I always go with guests from out of town. It is consistently good food. The servings are not really enough to take home for the next day, sadly, but constitute "just enough" so that you can clean your plate and not feel like a glutton. The appetizers are delish; we try different ones every time and are never disappointed. We also get them take-out when we want a night in with no difficulties. Menu suggestions: pad thai (the one with basil is great!), lovely nest.
