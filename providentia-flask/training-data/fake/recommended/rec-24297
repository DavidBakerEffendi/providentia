El Camino Real was a decent place.  I've definitely had better mexican food made by and for non mexican eaters in Philadelphia though.  Their burritos are kind of decieving.  They are basically two taquitos (meat wrapped in tortilla with no toppings).  This is not to say that they werent good, just they would have been better with the traditional lettuce tomato onion guac etc...  I did however try my friends seitan "chicken wings" which were excellent.   The service was pretty bad.  We did not recieve our drinks (for 3 rounds of drinks) for a good 10 min after they were ordered.   This place could be a lot better.
