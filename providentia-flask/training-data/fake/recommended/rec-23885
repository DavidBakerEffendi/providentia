Had a great visit last week. The service was outstanding as I didn't experience or pick up any of the bad vibes mentioned by other reviewers. We ordered the french toast special, breakfast pizza, and old-fashioned bacon and eggs. The special was outstanding, loaded with fresh seasonal berries and plenty of white chocolate cream cheese. Highly recommended. The breakfast pizza was a real treat, freshly prepared and tasty. Even the order of bacon and eggs over hard were done to perfection. The mint iced-tea was a real treat as well. Normally I don't prefer mint in my tea but I have to say the tea was brewed to perfection (I had 4 glasses!). We sat at the bar overlooking the cooks and it was a real treat watching them cook and also interacting with them. I rated the trip 5 stars because everything was perfect on our end. With tax and tip we spent $40.00, which was on par with the food and experience.
