This is definitely the best and traditional place noodle place in Philadelphia beside Sang Kee's wonton noodles. It reminded me of the homemade hand shaved noodles my grandmother used to made for me. I love the chewy texture. The first time I came I tried the hand drawn noodles and it was ok but the hand shaved ones was definitely better with the lamb noodles. My husband and I tried the Aromatic Mixed Platter which was delicious and he actually enjoyed it surprisingly. We had lamb noodles and meatball noodle soup. I asked a friend to joined me for dinner yesterday and she ordered the braised beef noodle and lamb noodle. The beef was tender and delicious. She is hooked as well. This is definitely a place that is inexpensive and delicious. Also cash only.
