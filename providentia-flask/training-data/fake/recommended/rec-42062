Met friends here after work one day and it wasn't too bad. Did go around happy hour and the beer selection was varied. They have both indoor and outdoor seating which is great cause the indoor area gets a bit crowded. They had 1$ oysters which was ok. The price is typical for a NYC bar.  A nice place to meet friends after work without too much hassle! Oh and the bacon wrapped dates .....yes I said bacon wrapped. ... we're delicious.  I  tried one from my friends plate and it was surprisingly scrumptious! !
