I walked from the World Trade Center to this spot since I've heard great things. It was a hot and humid day. Glad to say I wasn't disappointed! It's a very small spot and has limited seating. Surprisingly they do accept credit cards. Prices are fair. I ordered their famous square pizza and one slice of their marinara cheese pizza to go. They claim they use all natural ingredients. The staff was friendly and they work fast Â  On the wall I saw bunch of pictures of famous people which was pretty cool. It's located in the great area of Little Italy. I tried both the square pizza and the marinara. The square was thick and had enough sauce and cheese. I didn't feel like I was getting ripped off. The marinara was also perfect! If you're looking for an authentic pizza done right you need to check this place out! I didn't give it 5 stars because it's so small. If it was larger I woulda enjoyed the pizza there on the spot while it was hot! Will definitely come back!
