i'm not necessarily the biggest chicken finger fan, but any joint that plays A$AP's Pilot Talk 2 gets brownie points from me. It's a little hard to wrap my head around dessert chicken, but The Salted Caramel Pretzel was the surprise favorite at this chicken finger focussed eatery in Greenwich Village. Don't forget the side of cajun fries!
