This is a ramen lover's dream!...you know aside from the long wait :) The broth has a richness that is sure to cure winter blues, summer blues, any kind of blues. Generous portions. Try the samurai ribs! They are a little pricey but your taste buds will thank you. Go around dinner time to take advantage of the beer happy hour. At least you'll have something to drink while hoping and praying someone gets up from their table stat!
