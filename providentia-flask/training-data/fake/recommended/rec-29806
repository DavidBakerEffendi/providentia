Tried both the allumettes and classic thick fries, and a sampling of the sauces including the Harissa mayo, spicy chipotle mayo, wasabi mayo and bbq ketchup. Liked the Harissa and chipotle mayos the best. The staff/ owners were very friendly and explained the menu and suggested sauces to try. Nice fries with good crispiness! Definitely recommend for french fry lovers!
