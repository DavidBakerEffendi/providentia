Love love love this place!! My friend and I visit here often and are always satisfied. I used to live in Jersey but moved to nyc but I still travel to Cuban Petes. The food has tons of great flavor and always comes out nice and hot. My favorite entree is Carlitos Way chicken. The coconut rice and yams that come with it are amazing. The staff here is always very friendly and the owner is awesome. It does get crowded especially on the weekends so expect a little wait. Weekdays are a little less crowded. They should expand another restaurant to the bronx or harlem perhaps. They would get sooo much business. To me their cuban food tastes way better and authentic than any other place in the nyc.
