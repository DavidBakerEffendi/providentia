My friend had her going away party here before she moved to New York. There are plenty of benches/tables, but this place fills up super quickly. Luckily we got there before the after work rush, so we were able to get a table for all 12 of us. There are some games like ping pong and there is also food. I got a vegtarian hotdog and it was absolutely disgusting, so I wouldn't recommend ordering that. Â They have plenty of alcohol options and other basic bavarian food options like pretzels and sausages. It has a nice ambiance at night with the lights and the night sky above. Great place to visit when the weather is warmer.
