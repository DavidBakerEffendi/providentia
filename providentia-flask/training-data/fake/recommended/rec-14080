I've been hesitant to post this review because my friend and I had stopped in on a Wednesday night for sweet crepes as dessert, hence it wasn't a full on experience. To be fair, I put down 4 stars, but if there were 1/2 stars, it'd definitely be a 3.5 since I can't say "I'm a fan". We asked for the sweet crepe menu and was politely told, for future reference, that they do not take dessert only tables when they are busy. Since there was a handful of empty tables, I was able to get my flamb√©ed crepe suzette, but fyi ask before getting seated if you're looking for a dessert only visit.
