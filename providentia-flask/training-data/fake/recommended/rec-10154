For those of you fans of Samosas (Indian), you MUST try Empanadas.  And I cannot BELIEVE I waited THIS long to venture into this place.  Especially coming from a Latin upbringing (I hope my ancestors are not cursing me for this!) So last night, as I was venturing in Hells Kitchen, hunger struck, and without hesitation, I crossed 9th Avenue to finally see what this place was about.  And by the time I was done, I was in Empanada Heaven! But I must be honest.  I have seen this place walking by multiple times, and always thought "What?  How good could a place only selling empanadas be?"  This, coupled by the brightly lit and lightly colorned dining room.  Not denying it, but I thought it was a chain.  Case in point, I will not judge a book by its cover anymore! Once seated, the first thing that caught my eyes was VIAGRA.  Um... right.  I had the same reaction.  I will take one please.  And when I was done, I must say it was VERY satifying.  I see where the name came from now!  :) And I even indulged and got the cheese and apricot empanada for desert.  Warm, and very good. So now I must venture back to try their other empanadas to do it justice and make up for lost times!  :)
