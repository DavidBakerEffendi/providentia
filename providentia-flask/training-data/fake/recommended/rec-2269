1. despite being toothless, the man taking my order had one of those friendly, unpretentious smiles that I could totally get down with 2. never liked cheeze whiz... until I ate it on a Pat's sandwich 3. please note the lack of neon lights on this establishment 4. now note the douchebaggery going on over at Geno's 5. the paperbags are waxed - PURE GENIUS - don't wanna risk that delicious sandwich greasing it way out of a weakened corner 6. meat is well seasoned without being oversalted, even when combined with aforementioned cheeze whiz 7. the bread is pretty damn good all in all, A++ would eat again
