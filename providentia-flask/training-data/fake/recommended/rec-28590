Hold your horses. I'm from Texas and I've been avoiding barbeque in New York City like the plague. It just does not compare -- no sir, no way. This is the exception, y'all. Brisket that's so tender, it falls apart in your mouth. Ribs that just slide off the bone. Holy sh*t. This place is just as good, if not better, than some of the best places in Texas. This is how barbeque should be done, and if you've ever craved the legit stuff -- add this place to your list and come soon. Apart from the amazing meat, the sides are just as delicious from the cole slaw to the potato salad, and even the pickles! And if you see pie on the menu -- get it. I will be back! Soon, and often.
