Had the pleasure of dining at Argyles last night. The fish & chips were very good. Service was good. Paid the extra $3.00 for cod instead of Swai, 16.00 total. My wife had the shepherds pie, also very good. Disappointed in the appetizers. Crab stuffed clams oreganato were bland and pasty. No seasoning at all. The potato pancakes were also disappointing. They were frozen miniature Micky D's patties. The 2 oz serving of coleslaw was server at room temperature? We had 3 dinners and my daughter had mozzarella. sticks for dinner.1 Soda. $80.00 total. If the appetizers and sides were better I might have gone with 4 stars.
