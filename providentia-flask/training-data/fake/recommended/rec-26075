Stopped in for dinner tonight to check it out as it was recommended by an Indian friend of mine. He was right! The food is amazing. We both had the Chicken Tikka Roll which was amazing, and she had the Achari Paneer roll which I highly recommend too. Â The sauce in the red bottle is spicy hot!! Four rolls left us stuffed! Welcome to the neighborhood!!!
