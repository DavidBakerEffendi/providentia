Honesty Good Food Good Service Good Price Point on Food Great Portion Size Honesty - My girlfriend miscalculated the bill and left a 40% tip.....The waitress (Anna H. according to the bill) came and informed us of the miscalculation! **That in its self earns my repeat business** Good Food and Good Portions - I had the Mushroom crusted Chicken and Sweet Pea risotto with chipollini onions. The portion size was really large for what I was expecting from the West Village and the taste was decadent/rich . The only element keeping this meal from a "Great" rating was the slight over salting of the sauce. My girlfriend ordered the Wednesday night special of Leg of Lamb and it also was a generous portion that tasted great! I would eat both again in a heartbeat. Great Service - First Kudos again for honesty!!!!!! Second the server was very attentive to our needs without being pesky and the busboy or actually busMAN expeditiously refilled waters and offered bread. To say the least the place was packed and we really enjoyed the service. The only thing Anna could have done better was understand the food but all in all she was Great! Thanks Anna and Extra Virgin for a great experience! We will definitely be back :0)
