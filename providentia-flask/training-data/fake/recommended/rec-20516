Great to watch the game, but suggest asking the beer prices before ordering.   I ordered a Yuengling (originates in Pottstown, PA) and was charged $5.75, same price as a Corona (from Mexico).  When I confronted the manager he told me "tough luck, our distributor charges for import. You should have asked before you ordered"  I left before the game was over...
