Granted there is not a lot of space for seating. but it's a cute place, I love the bar seating just wish there was more. I went there with my boss one night and I ordered a few rolls and tofu and she ordered a few rolls as well. we had to wait around to grab a seat because there were 4 people in one corner and 3 in another. (did i mention this place is tiny?) There was 1 table though that two girls where sitting and chatting away. clearly finished meals, empty plates and drinks, laughing away and taking their sweet time while we stood and waited. how rude. but it's not the restaurants fault for having rude customers. We got our food and finally found a seat when the one guy by himself finish and quickly cleared up space and politely left it clean too. I'm a big fan of their tiger roll, but not so much their sashimi, of which I've had better but it's still ok. the tofu is always great it's the reason I brought my boss here. I wish it had more seating available, maybe we can move the 2 giant drink coolers behind the counter and have customers just order them from there? Then more bar seating can be put in. Don't change the sushi, it's delicious!
