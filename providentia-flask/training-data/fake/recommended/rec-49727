Came with friends on a Saturday night-- packed, but seating was fairly prompt. Lychee sangria was yummy. Service was quick. We shared the shrimp dumplings steamed, chicken pad thai, coconut calamari, shrimp panang curry, and my friend ordered a tofu dish which she loved. All was very tasty.. Though the dumplings had way too much bread-like stuffing. We even tried dessert-- chocolate brownie cake and green tea ice cream worked surprisingly well together. I'd come back-- maybe change your plates (they were too damned big for the table) and throw out your drunken patrons (several hot messes walking around falling all over people/tables at 9:30pm).
