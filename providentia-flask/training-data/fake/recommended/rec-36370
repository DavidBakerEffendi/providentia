From the same restaurant group as Jane, I have to say I like Jane's menu better only because I prefer more fish options, but the skate was really good and I ate every morsel! Â I was deeply impressed with how accommodating they are. This included moving us into a booth when I asked for another chair to put my leg up due to a knee injury and bringing olive oil for the bread to replace the butter when I mentioned I had a dairy allergy. This restaurant is definitely the place to be on a Saturday night and the front entrance was crowded with so many people I was nervous how I was going to get out. I didn't even have to say 'excuse me' before a waiter guided us back to the emergency exit. I left feeling extremely satisfied!
