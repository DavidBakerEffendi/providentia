I've been wanting to go to this place for a long time and when a good buddy came into town I finally made it happen. Their selection is ridiculous. It took us 15 minutes before we can decide on our first drink. Despite how awesome their selection is, I am really not into the way they pour the drinks. Smallest pours ever.
