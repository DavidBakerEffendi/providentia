OMG! OMG! OMG! This restaurant elevated brunch to a whole new level. It did not disappoint. I can truly trust the Food Network when they recommend restaurants. The service staff was very friendly and well informed of the menu. Our server recommended suitable choices for brunch that went along with my diet. I was surprised at their interpretation of the Amish Chicken Breast Salad! Though I still regret not trying the Baked Brioche French Toast with Butterscotch Sabayon, I still had a very satisfying meal. A definite destination place for me next time I am in town. It is a place where the food does indeed feed the soul. (09/01/2012)
