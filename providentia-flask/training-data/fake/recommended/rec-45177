I'm surprised earlier reviews did not mention Halvorson's back deck. In the summertime, the deck is the spot. I went to college at UVM and Halvorson's was always a favorite of mine. The Halvorita? Yes, please! Good vibes, good fare, and reasonably priced. Check it out on the northern end of Church St.
