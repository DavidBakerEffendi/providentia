This is an ordinary restaurant and bar. The food is just ok, and the portions are small. The wine list is laughable and drinks by the glass are a fortune. I used to go here because it was the only no smoking bar in the area. Now that there is no smoking throughout NJ there is no reason for me to return. There are better choices in the area.
