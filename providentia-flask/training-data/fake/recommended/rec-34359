Really well prepared, fresh, and tasty Italian. They make their own pasta from scratch- you can taste a world of difference. Â Service is good, very relaxed environment so they're not trying to flip tables but rather give you a nice dining experience. The fresh bread with olive oil and cheese was a nice spin on the usual bread and oil combo. Spinach ricotta ravioli was fantastic! Would definitely recommend.
