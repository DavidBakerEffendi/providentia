This is an adorable little cafe in the 9th Square area of New Haven.  The owners are really warm and welcoming, and the cafe is a great spot for studying, since they play the music softly enough.  I can't speak to their other food, because I have become completely addicted to their egg sandwich and cafe mocha, and have it every single time I'm in New Haven.  They're so good, I would give them 6 stars if I could!
