I went with a group of friends and overall, enjoyed my experience. Nizi Sushi is obviously very popular in the area because it was definitely full when we we were there. I got the chicken teriyaki box, which was pretty good, though nothing spectacular. We also got a bowl of tofu as well as miso soup. I thought the tofu was unnecessary, but whatever. However, I wish that you could customize the roll box with rolls of your personal choosing. I didn't order it because I didn't want half of the rolls that it came with. Two things that I didn't really like: Nizi is a little overpriced for lunch food and you can only have 2 people at a table use a credit card, which doesn't make much sense to me. So, make sure someone brings cash if you're going as a group!
