This place is really great for basic, flavorful good food.  Service is good, but a little slow.  Very clean and cheery place.  But, if you expect spicy Indian food, this is not your place.  It is not "exotic" or somehow amazing, so don't expect that.  It is good food, decent, and suitable for people who like international food.  The noodle dishes are very good.  Curry is good, but is unremarkable.  I did not try the spicy curry, so I don't know about that.  It gets 4 stars, because as a whole package it deserves it.
