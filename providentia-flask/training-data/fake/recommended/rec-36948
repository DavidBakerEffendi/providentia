The one time I went here, 2 preconceptions went out the window.  1) It's not anywhere near as expensive as I thought it would be, which was a nice surprise, though it's hardly a trip to the diner.  2) It's not as amazing as I thought it would be, either.  I got a steak, can't remember the cut, but I do remember being completely underwhelmed, which kind of bummed me out.  I had a really intense blood orange martini, though, which was great albeit a bit unexpectedly pungent when tried by my tablemates.  So it's alright, service was decent and the waitstaff nice, but it seems like one of those places to go just to say you've been there at least once.
