This place is soooo cute. It's right around the block from me so, when my friends and I want to grab a quick, fairly priced drink, this is the place we always agree on. Extremely charming but romantic as well and, the perfect place for a nightcap after a first or second date! They have a good menu (their mac n' cheese is AMAZING!!!!). Great service and some of those bartenders aren't bad to look at! Definitely a do over!!
