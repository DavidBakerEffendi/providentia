Had dinner here last night with my new team (just started a new job this week) As it was a work function, price will not be mentioned. So the company and conversation was awesome (and I'm not just sucking up) the wine was tasty and free flowing (a pinot noir) and the lemon drop shots were pretty good too. Because of the large group we were working off of a prix fixe menu, a few selections from the regular menu, but not all. I began with the Salad of herby lentils, green beans, avocado, toasted pecans & baby gem with pomegranate molasses and avocado oil vinaigrette. The dressing had nice flavor, and the beans were cooked just right (still a little crunchy). If I was actually a fan of lentils this would have been a great dish. Main course was the Olive oil poached Tasmanian sea trout with vanilla celeriac puree, Chinese broccoli and saffron quince compote. While the waitress said the trout was more salmon like than trout like, I found that the trout resembled arctic char best. For the record, I don't like arctic char, but that was not the reason I disliked this dish. It tasted fishy. And ok, it's fish, but it tasted fishy in a put your fork down for fear of revisiting your meal later kind of way, so I did just that and ate the accompaniments. The broccoli and vanilla celeriac puree were both good, the puree most resembled smooth mashed potatoes, with a hint of sweetness. The saffron quince compote tasted like sticky applesauce, I wasn't a fan. Sadly it seems that the menu reads much better than the food tasted which is a problem I have run into lately at a few places. I suppose the striking writers have to make a living somehow, but I just wish it wasn't at the expense of my pallette. May go back with a smaller group to really explore the menu, but I am not running, by any means.
