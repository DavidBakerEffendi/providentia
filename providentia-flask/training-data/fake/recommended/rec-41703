What a lovely joint. Simple menu made up of deliciousness. The pizza was remarkable. We had friends in from Maine and they wanted some New York pizza. Being the adventurers we are, we decided to try a new place. We were not expecting such an extravagant experience, but Brooklyn never ceases to impress. We each ordered a pie, and upon first look thought we couldn't possibly finish 4, but we easily did. Service is friendly and the atmosphere is outstanding. We will be back, and love that we found another amazing spot in our neighborhood.
