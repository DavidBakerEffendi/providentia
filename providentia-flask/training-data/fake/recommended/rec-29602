One of the Best Ramen Places in NYC. The broth of the ramen is full of flavor. there appetizer are delicious, the ambiance of the place is interesting. I was seated at the counter where we got to see everyone prepare all the food. Everyone there looks like they were all having fun and that they were all friend. I wish my work was like that. Great place to drink and chat with friends, not a place for kids or old people. For a Bowl of Ramen you are looking at about $14, which some would say is over priced. Also from being out of town we have to take a Taxi to get there. So you got to take in transportation cost into effect. But you know what? I would pay the $14 and would pay Taxi Ride just to eat there again. Â  For those that love Ramen, try it and make a decision for yourself.
