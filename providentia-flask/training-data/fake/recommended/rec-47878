Vinnie's Apizza of Woodmont in the early 70's was the high water mark for pizza in my life. Since their closing, Domenic's has been the absolute best place in the area for really good pizza. The old Mama T's on the north side of Rt. 1 in Milford was a close second. A wonderful little place that's been around forever. Remember Grand Union? They were here right across the parking lot making pizza back then. Their pizza is truly fantastic.Thin crust, cooked just right every time and quickly. 15 minutes each and every time you call or stop in and order. Enough time to cruise across the street and sit on a bench at the beach & watch the waves, or hit The Dive Bar and/or Oyster River Tavern both located within throwing distance for a quick pop or three. Why would you go anywhere else? I'm think I'm going to get a job at the small bike shop next to Grand Uni..., er, Dollar Store, live in my classic old RV mid-parking lot, and love life. Baybrook rules! This place is so worthy of 5 stars. I'll gladly pay $1100 for a large pie here any Saturday night. ;)
