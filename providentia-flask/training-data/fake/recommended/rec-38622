My fiancé digs this place because they have an enormous selection of beer and pork schnitzel that he claims is filling, fattening, and perfect.  I dig this place because it has a shocking amount of vegan options for a place that the fella loves, and I would go here even if I didn't know him.  And not only do those vegan options exist, they're usually dang tasty to boot!   The seasoned fries with vegan aioli are delicious, as is the vegan spring roll (I think I could eat like, six of these in sitting).  The sweet potato hummus is interesting and tasty, and I really love that they have an always-fresh and generous organic side salad with house made vinaigrette to lighten up all the rest of the heavy but oh-so-delectable fare.   The only vegetarian option I've had here that I wasn't so into was the "meatloaf".  It was airy and crumbly and a little bland; the only thing I could taste were the unpleasantly large chunks of nuts mixed in.  But who cares about that when there are all the vegan options above in addition to some fun vegan BBQ "wings" and a mushroom risotto?  Not me, and you shouldn't either.  Try it out, and bring your favorite vegetarian AND omnivore friends.  Don't worry about your wallet--everything is really reasonably priced. Bonus points go to this place for being cool enough to host two Vegan Drinks Philly events so far!
