Can't say enough good things about Morgan's.  Definitely is my go to spot in the neighborhood.  The BBQ there is fantastic, which for any type of a commercial type establishment is hard to pull off.   The staff is nice.  The drinks are good and cold.  I love that you can sit outside and the front also opens up so it feels like you're outside.
