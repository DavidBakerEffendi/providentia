Wonderful.  We visited on a cold night and the two heaters in the front windows did little to help, but with scarves wrapped around our necks and hats on, we had an amazing meal. The bead: 3 different kinds, all amazing and well worth the order, with caraway butter! The olives: delicious, spicy peppers added a great deal.  Downside: too many of the same olive (just one variety) and the radishes were dry and bland The meat and cheese plates: amazing The Sweet Potatoes: not my favorite, but good (it's just a potato with sour cream) The Green Salad: amazing! Very, very good and the peppers were flavorful and spicy. The Fish: the polenta was the best part; the fish was prepared very well, it just didn't stand out The Steak: amazing, although the mushrooms were pretty bland The oxtail stuffed pasta: killer, killer good; hand made obviously The Dessert: completely forgettable.  Something like a cold cake on a crumb base with orange jello and super, super, super, super salty caramel.  It lacked the composition that most all other dishes had and was too frozen to taste like anything anyhow Delicious, a little over priced, overall just a treat.  The bathroom has cloth walls and a ceramic, insulated powerline bulb in it.  The patio looks great, and has a firepit that wasn't going when we visited.  The food was killer, service was great!
