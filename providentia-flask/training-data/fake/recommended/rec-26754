Highly recommended for vegetarians.  Half order of vegetarian wings - $9, chips and salsa - $1, happy hour maragarita $2.50.  Great spicy food at a nice price.  Everything I have tried is good, I just love this place.  The grilled corn is ridiculously good. They have a FourSquare loytaly special, free margarita on every 3rd checkin.
