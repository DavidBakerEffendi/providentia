Before I complain, let me say a few nice things. The tandoori chicken was wonderful, amazing, delicious, and  I say that as someone who usually doesn't like chicken. The decor is fun - the lighting is really dramatic and beautiful.  I think the sunken area in the middle is a bit too kitschy, but that's just me. All the other tapas we had there were, well, not bad, but nothing better than the sort of thing I typically cook at home.  And certainly not worth $10 each. All in all, I might recommend this restaurant if the food cost a fifth or less of what it does, but there's no justifying this quality at this price. As a side note, I ordered a Guinness, and it might be my fault for not looking closely enough at the beer menu, but what I got was a Guinness Draught, which looks like a Guinness but tastes like a mixture of mayonnaise and wet gravel.
