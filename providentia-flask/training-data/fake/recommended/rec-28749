Count Ingredients, Not Calories. A Hu Kitchen guiding principle and refreshing confirmation of common sense. I had a yummy roast veg and chevre wrapped in a collard green leaf 'sandwich'. Designed by a very friendly sandwich chef according to my ingredient preferences. Similarly, the barista suggested I try her fave frothy coconut milk cappuccino. Not something I would've thought of but surprisingly pleasant. Not exactly a cheap lunch at $12 a wrap but worth it if you value flavour and quality. The rotisserie chicken I spied will have me back within the week. And I'll be devouring the skin too - calories don't count.
