Butter soaked bread (in the best way) and lots of flavor inside. You must try the veggie roll. I'm sure it's no one's first choice when there are meat and potato options, but trust me on this! It doesn't taste like vegetables at all. There's the usually spiciness we all know and love, but there's also a hint of sweetness. It's my new go-to.
