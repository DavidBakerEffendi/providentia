Food was very good except don't order the special appetizer. The tuna app was a total ripoff. $16 for 4 tiny pieces of lettuces with tiny slivers of tuna. It was absolutely ridiculous. Otherwise the calamari was good although small portions and the chicken and pork chop were yummy. Go but stick to the menu items.
