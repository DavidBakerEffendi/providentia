After trying the Umami Burger Truffle Burger at Googamooga in May 2013, I was obsessed with going to the new location in Manhattan. Just went on Sunday for lunch, and there was no wait, which was nice. Right to the food, we had the truffle burger and the "original". Both were DELICIOUS. My only gripe - they weren't very hot when they came to the table. Definitely warm, but not hot, so we sort of ate them fast because I have a personal issue with eating cold food. Also, our server was pretty like "meh" and the atmosphere in the upstairs, during a slow lunch period, was fairly whatever as well. We also had fried pickles as an appetizer, and they turned out to be pickle spears instead of the typical "chips". They were okay - but the sauce needed some heat or something. They were sorta bland and boring. I'd definitely come back, maybe for dinner, and see if the overall experience isn't better. IN SHORT - BURGERS GOOD. WANT HOT THOUGH. SERVICE MEH. END COMMUNICATION.
