I had heard about Balthazar for years but it wasn't until this weekend that my brother took me on a tour of three of Keith McNally's restaurants including Pulino's and Shiller's. I was not disappointed. We had a 12:45 reservation on Sunday and had to wait 15 minutes before being seated. Our server was attentive and we ordered the bread basked with pastries including a croissant, brioche, cinnamon roll, chocolate bread, and nut raisin bread to start. Some people got onion soup, others got salads. It all looked good. Three of us had Benedicts and I got the Florentine (which I didn't love because it was too saucy), The hustle bustle atmosphere is really fun and I have to commend them for being so incredibly attentive!
