Bathroom gets plus 2 stars by itself.  One of the most creative, spacious, and clean bathrooms I've been to.  There's a mini cartoon story plastered as the wallpaper that repeats around the entire bathroom.  You're gonna have to check it out yourself because I might never get Elite status if I post my first yelp pictures of a bathroom.  Real talk, it's one bed, a mini shower and a little more real estate away from becoming a micro apartment in NYC at $1500/month.  There's only one bathroom here, so presumably, it explains why there's usually a line but I think it's just people enjoying their sweet time observing the bathroom and taking pictures in there like me as well.   With that being said, there is some good Italian comfort food to be had here.  They have three kinds of calamari, and we got the "MAD" and "Grilled"- both very solid choices.  The calamari isn't overly breaded, and was well seasoned.  For the pasta, I got the "Pescatore" because my seafood diet is extreme and this dish really hit the spot.  Plenty of seafood and a good marinara sauce to go with it.  The menu is as basic and simple as it gets but the food is pretty good.  You really can't go wrong with whatever you get. The service was very nice and the waitress answered any questions we had about the drinks or food on the already simple menu.  The space and ambience is nice for a date and even accommodating for a large group.  After all, you're suppose to feel as if you're home and knowing that the wonderful bathroom is going to be there for you further supports that belief.
