I ordered a lunch special consisting of spring rolls, chicken pad see eew and a bottled water through Eat 24. Let's talk about that though. Most lunch specials only come with a starter and the entree. This one gives you the choice of water or soda or thai iced tea, I think. So awesome. All for less than $10. My food was ready before I got there and I was maybe a 10 min walk away. I couldn't even begin to tell you what makes perfect pad see eew (fail, I know) but I know that I haven't been to a place that makes it as flawlessly as Soi 30 Thai and this place comes extremely close. Maybe it would have been spot on if I had eaten it fresh out of the wok instead of having to wait almost an hour until I got home. But I was amazed and will certainly be back when I'm in the area.
