We have been to Ocha many, many times.  Since Tomo was forced to close his restaurant in Little Falls, Ocha, by default, is the best sushi in the area.  It is always fresh and tasty.  I saw some reviews complaining about the service, but we've never had any problems and, in fact, love the friendly service at Ocha.  My only complaint is that that prices are a little on the high side for the size of the pieces/rolls.  Not outrageous, but higher than most other places in the area; I don't mind paying for quality (and, with sushi, I would never substitute quantity for quality), but prices at Ocha are higher than Tomo's were, and his sushi was an even higher quality.  In any event, if you're looking for Sushi in the Caldwell area, go to Ocha; none of the other area restaurants come close.
