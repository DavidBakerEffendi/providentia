You HAVE to go here for brunch and try the House Eggs....accompanying it with this beverage called The Black Velvet. (Guinness and champagne...it sounds funny - but it is delightful. Actually, their taps are so cold and so clean - I think their Guiness is the best pint in NY.) For desert go for the date cake or MY favorite... the grilled doughnuts. :) Dinner time is really special as well....live music... so cute. Â Just don't go right at 8:30 on a Friday or Saturday or you may have to wait a minute. p.s. the staff is great.
