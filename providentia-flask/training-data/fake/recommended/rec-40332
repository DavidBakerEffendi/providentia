Their shakes are good but the service sucks. They are so stingy with napkins! It's like they cut their own trees in the back and make them there or something! Their steak empanadas are horrible.  I'm Colombian so maybe my standards for empanadas are a bit higher but god....They are not what they used to be.i remember the first banana king on 21st ave in paterson back when I was like 9 years old. It was awesome! I still like their pinchos and their chicken arepas. Their salchipapa. But the buñuelos are too big for my taste...and the pan the quesos are often over cooked. The empanadas taste like they have been there for days. Sigh...
