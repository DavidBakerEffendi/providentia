Great service, beautiful atmosphere, but the food sort of misses the mark (relative to the high bar set by little owl).  The veggies - cauliflower in particular - starred the show.  Had the stone fruit salad, which was topped by a gazpacho.  Honestly, the total effect was mostly acidic - not as deliciously flavorful as you would expect from a midsummer fruit salad.  I had the halibut, which was non-memorable.  Finally, for dessert, my husband and i got the flourless cake (good) and two scoops of gelato.  The marscapone gelato is awesome.  husband loved the passionfruit (but he loves passionfruit) and the banana chip, i could pass on those two.  I'd say the dessert was the best course.  Had a couple glasses of wine, again, nothing to really remember.  I'm giving Market table a 4 instead of a 3 because we took over a four-top table thinking two friends would join, and they ended up being so late that we met them afterwards for drinks.  MT staff were very gracious about that, hence the extra star.   Overall: would not head back unless we were already in neighborhood and craving a very straightforward fish-and-veggies meal.
