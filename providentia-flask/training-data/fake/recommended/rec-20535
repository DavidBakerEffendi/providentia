Overall: My food was cooked and served poorly - some things were overdone and some things were let to sit out too long before serving (pork buns aren't as great when your tongue is wading through cold pork fat). I think this place should get credit for novelty and bringing street food up a notch, but ultimately it's the food that counts: some of the dishes not only missed my high expectations of Ssam Bar, they failed by the standards of well-prepared food in general. Rundown of my dishes: Oyster - great, the flavor of the sea combined with the sour, pickly flavor of kimchi wass perfect Kimchi apples and bacon (jowl) - Bacon was wayyyyy overpowering (salty), even when cut into tiny chunks. You could barely taste the maple in the labneh. the idea of these flavors together is genius, but the dish was a fail. Duck - okay, overcooked and a little dry. Pork buns - great, not transcendental. mine were cold when they arrived (I've had then warm before on a different visit) - such an amateur move and unacceptable for a place like ssam bar (or any restaurant in general). Pork and rice cakes - great, but nothing different from what you'd get at any place in K-town. the only difference was the crispy rice cakes, which were fried on one side so they were chewy and crunchy Pig's head - I appreciate the attempt to use offal, but this crap was too gamey, with a very off flavor. But the texture was great, very creamy Brussel sprouts - WTF? way too fried - they tasted more like days-old frying oil than they did brussels, which have a very strong flavor in the first place. The sauce, which was basically a Vietnamese Nuoc Cham, was watery and non-existent. I've had better Nuoc Cham at crap Vietnamese take out places
