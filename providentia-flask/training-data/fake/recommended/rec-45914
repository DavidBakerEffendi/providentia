I am pulling for this newly opened restaurant because it is close and very good. Sushi is above average in my book. This was my first visit. They've only been open a short time and I feel they'll get even better. I totally appreciated that my vegetarian sushi choices did not a have a fish taste. Nice clean tasting food. I look forward to trying more things
