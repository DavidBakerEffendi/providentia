Very good curry here.  As many have stated, this location is much smaller than its midtown counterpart.  But the food is just as good.  You will not be disappointed. I always like to visit this place when in NYC and am very glad they added this location close to the NYU campus in lower Manhattan. Not many seats here so if you go during peak meal times, will be hard to find seat.  But this is close to Washington Park that you can get it to and eat there on a nice day.
