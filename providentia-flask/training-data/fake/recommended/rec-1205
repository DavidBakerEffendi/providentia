I'll be as fair as I can be. My friends and I went to Opa on a Friday at 5pm for the happy hour menu.  One of my friends is not an easy-to-deal-with customer.  She's demanding and very critical.  So I know that overall and all things considered, we weren't the best customers.  The place allowed us to have out happy hour outside of its designated area.  That was a very good thing from the restaurant since they didn't have to do that for use, particularly since my friend was being obnoxiously demanding. The server was very professional, though she came across a little fake ("It's fun to serve happy hour outside the area." Really?, Fun? Whatever). Anyway, she did put up with my friend and kept her cool, even thought I could feel her aggravation with us.  So I believe she was extremely professional dealing with us.  I made sure that at least I tipped her well. The main issue was the poor quality and time it took to get the food.  The food was insanely overpriced for what we got, one of my fries wasn't cooked, and it took forever to get our food (maybe this is something that restaurants do to 'difficult customers', who knows?).  I asked for a Lager beer and I got the dark instead, and they sent one too many of the appetizers we ordered. The drinks were served sporadically, so by the time I got my (actually not-too-cold and wrong kind of) beer, some of my friends were already done with their drinks. The decor of the place is very nice and the atmosphere felt good.  But overall, the experience wasn't that great.  Not sure I would have had a better experience had my obnoxious friend wasn't with us.
