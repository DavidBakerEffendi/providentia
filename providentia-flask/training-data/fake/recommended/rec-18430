Wholesome, healthy, tasty. Once you've had it once, it's easier than you think to walk right past the Wendy's and McDonald's right next door (if you love fast food like me!). Try the basque shrimp or Balkan "burger" (which is closer to a whole wheat chicken wrap), and start with the pozole roja soup.
