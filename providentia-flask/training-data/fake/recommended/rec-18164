We have to go back, Kate, We have to go back! Since I went here in the weeks prior to the Lost finale, I found myself thinking this after eating lunch at Ten Stone. I went here on a recommendation from a friend, and I'd say it met all my expectations. The bar had a nice, open-air feel and is full of warm, bright colors. While the variety on the menu was decent, the beer list is awesome. However, as it was lunch, I just went for a cider (which they had in a bottle). I chose the Grilled Cheese on a Pretzel with honey mustard glaze as my meal and it was very good. I'd like to check this place out again later in the day. But as long as I can go back for the Grilled Cheese Pretzel, I'll be content.
