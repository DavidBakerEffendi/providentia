I came here because I wanted a place with a view, and the service and food really left an impression on me. The view is okay at night (you have to sit at the northern end to see the lights; the southern end has a dark view of the east river and a view of an ugly building on the FDR), the interior is lovely. Smaller tables are along the windows and have the best views, and some of the larger tables have partial views as well. The dining room is spacious and quiet. The food was excellent. The people at my table got pork chops, lamb, steak and fish. Everyone loved the food. The pork eaters said these were the best pork chops they had tasted. The sorbet was delicious, especially the pear sorbet. Beignets were a little rubbery. The service here is truly superb and made the delicious meal and lovely setting all the more memorable. The server was very knowledgeable and helpful. We asked about the greenhouse and he explained which ingredients in our dishes were from the garden and what crops we could look forward to when we come back in the spring time. We asked one of the guys to take our picture, and he was so thoughtful, suggesting that we go onto the terrace where there would be less of a glare. The guys even helped the ladies with their coats.
