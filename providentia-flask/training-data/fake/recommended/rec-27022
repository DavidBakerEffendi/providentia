I am comparing this to SF Bay standards...and this place NAILS IT. Star 1: if you are lucky, you'll get seated in the special "back room" beyond the bathrooms...this takes the prohibition-era bar setting to a WHOLE NOTHER LEVEL. Stand down, Bourbon & Branch. Stars 2 & 3: The food & drinks are exceptional. Personally, I think the cocktails outdid your typical high-end cocktail in the SF Bay Area - #shitireallydidjustgothere. If you aren't into vegan/vegetarian food, their dishes might be off to you, but I loved the poutine (butternut squash gravy) and mushroom burger. Star 4: Excellent live music. Star 5: Great crowd. Honestly, if you are trying to figure out what to do tonight & are considering going here...save yourself the neurotic energy of having to make a decision and JUST GO TO DUINO DUENDE!
