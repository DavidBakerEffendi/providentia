They are very serious about their dress code. BF thought he can get away w wearing a pair of nice jeans. Nope! He had to Macy's to buy a pair of pants. Food was good, services was great, the whole experience was not worth $1300 for 2. Disappointed...thought I was going to get a food orgasm...Boooooooooo!!!!!!!!
