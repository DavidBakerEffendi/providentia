Came here with my mom and had the lunch special. The coconut soup and dumpling appetizers were delicious, as was the Pad Kee Mao noodles (like drunken noodles) Â that my mom ordered . I wasn't a huge fan of the chicken satay - it was cut differently from what I was expecting and was just okay. The Penang tofu curry that I ordered was a little too peanut-y. Overall yummy, but it depends on what you get.
