The first time I came here was for a bday for a 9:30pm reservation, with Valerie S.  I  agreed with her review about "I felt like if their kitchen closed so earlier. they shouldn't have allowed a 9:30 reservation or should have notified us when we first were seated to set our expectations for the rest of the night." A couple of us in the party were vegetarian so we tried a few things - the highlights include,  fried goat cheese with lavender-honey (i never enjoyed goat cheese until I tried this), crispy brussel sprouts (the apples and walnuts really complimented the brussel sprouts) and some pizza thing (fontina!_.  All were really tasty!   I went again 2 years later (about) at 9:30 also but didn't feel that same pressure.  It was a weeknight and it was PACKED!  This time though, the brussel sprouts were too salty for my liking, but at least the crispiness was good.  The fried goat cheese was as yummy as I remembered!  The sangria here is also quite tasty. :)
