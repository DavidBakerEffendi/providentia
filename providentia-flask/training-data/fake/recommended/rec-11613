Go here for drinks, or dessert. the food/menu was pretentious: Ridiculously opaque menu, with mostly uninteresting food, presented beautifully. I had a corn stuff ravioli, my poor husband got some tortured excuse for a vegetarian entree, and my mother in law fared best, which a fresh fish option that she was happy with. the desserts (blue berry pie, and some pretentiously named brownie Sunday ) were delicious. The alcohal/wine selections were great. I won't go there to eat again, but might go there for drinks.
