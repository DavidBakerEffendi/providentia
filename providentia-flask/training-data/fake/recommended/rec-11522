Nice addition to the East Village. Delicious food and the cocktail drinks were also very good. It's a little cramped but this is the East Village. I've been here twice, the first time in the late summer we had the tasting menu, and last week we had a la carte, which we really enjoyed. Finally, there are two sophisticated restaurants that I can go to in the EV where I feel like an adult (this one and East 12th Osteria for topnotch Italian food). I'm hoping there will be more of these kinds of places in my neighborhood.
