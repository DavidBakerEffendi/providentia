first of all, i went here during a mid week afternoon around 1pm.  the place was dead.  there was 3 customers who were already seated and had their food. i ordered al pastor, which was 4 pork tacos for $10.  you cannot order single tacos.  i asked the lady how long  and she said it will be out in under 5 minutes, because i only get 45 mins for lunch.  18 mins later, my food was done.  18 MINUTES.  How is that possible? the tacos were not THAT good.  the chipotle sauce was not even spicy.  I was highly dissapointed after reading some of the reviews on here. i will Not be returning.
