I visited Good Dog as part of my quest to eat all of the good food and drink all of the good beer in Philly in one weekend.  (Obviously, that's unpossible, but I like to try!) I loved the environment. I'm an aging punk rocker and it's always great to see people with Misfits shirts and tattoos filling a place.  At the same time, since it was 2pm on a Saturday, there was a family with a small child there and it totally wasn't out of place.   The ambiance was cool, including a great mix of music playing.  As you might expect, there were tons of pictures of dogs on the wall.  Apparently Good Dog has a dog photo contest every year, and these appeared to be the entrants.   The beer list was solid, but not as extensive as I might've hoped.  I think there were about 10 beers on top and a handful of bottles and cans.  I usually expect a bit more selection from someplace when I am looking for a true beer bar, but the things they do have are solid choices. I kept hearing about how good the burgers were.  I was kind of disappointed to see they actually only had 2 meat burgers on the menu.  Since I'm not a fan of "stinky" cheeses, I didn't opt for the burger stuffed with Roquefort.  My friend did get it and liked it, but said it wasn't MIND BOGGLING.  I got the regular burger and had a similar reaction.  The fries are a mixture of regular fries and sweet potato fries - which is good if you like sweet potato fries, but I don't.  I did love that they brought out aioli for the fries automatically though.   The service was pretty good in the beginning, but our server kind of disappeared around the time we were getting ready to leave.  It wasn't a big deal, but we did wait for our check for about 10-15 minutes.   Overall, Good Dog didn't live up to the hype for me, but I wouldn't mind going back.
