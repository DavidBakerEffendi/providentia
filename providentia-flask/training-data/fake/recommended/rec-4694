I came here for lunch with my family last week when we were visiting Burlington for the day. Admittedly, we came here to get another stamp on our Vermont Brewer's Challenge Passport. However, we were pleasantly surprised by not only how good the beer was, but the food as well. For the beer, I had their raspberry and their sour ales. Both were great - I'm generally anti-fruit beer as it can quickly turn wine cooler nasty, but this raspberry was well executed. Perfect balance of beer taste meets real fruit taste. Boom. As for the food, the grass fed beef burger and sweet potato fries, while simple, are delicious. Perfectly cooked to order and a great accompaniment to my boozy vacation lunch. The outdoor seating area is great. If you're sitting near the edge you can see down to the water.
