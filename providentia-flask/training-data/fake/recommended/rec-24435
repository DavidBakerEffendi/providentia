What a charming, whimsical place! I live one street over and am thrilled to have this option on the days I'm too lazy to cook but still want a light option. The combo is the way to go with a choice of two rice balls, miso soup, and a couple of side dishes for $9.50. I like meat so my favorite rice balls are the Hawaiian (Spam with a spicy kick!) and sukiyaki beef. As for the miso, I've enjoyed the tofu gnocchi, mushroom and the BLT (bacon in miso? Yes!) And do yourself a favor and try the sesame cookie and the chocolate roll cake. I kid you not, their roll cake, filled with very light, not too sweet choco mousse now rivals the crepe layer cake of Lady M. The service is very friendly, the ambiance peaceful. Stop by and try it!
