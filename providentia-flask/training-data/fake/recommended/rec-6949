I was staying nearby on a business trip.  For a quick meal I went to Palermo's.  Fortunately they sell the tomato pies and pizzas by the slice if you don't want to buy a whole pie.  Really delicious pies and the service was friendly and helpful.  Later that week I went back and tried the Chicken Parmesan.  Delicious and plentiful.  I highly recommend  this place.
