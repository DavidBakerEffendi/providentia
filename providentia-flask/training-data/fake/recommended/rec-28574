I stopped by this diner on a Thursday night on the way up to Vermont and I'm glad I opted for the diner over McDonald's. The tuna melt and fries that I ordered hit the spot...the tuna was hot all the way through the scoop (if you're a frequent tuna melt enthusiast, you know what I mean) and the fries were golden brown. My husband ordered a Gyro. It was meh. Since Athenian is a Greek Diner, we expected an authentic Gyro, but it looked more like a bunch of ingredients placed on a plate, nothing cohesive about it. It was really kind of sad.
