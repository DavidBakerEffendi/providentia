La Boca is a welcome addition to the North End. Everything is prepared fresh and there are a TON of local options. The food was awesome. The chef knows how to mix amazing flavors together. The Saltimbocca is so flavorful. Our waitress recommended the perfect local brew to accompany our meal. It was impossible to decide among all of the incredible flavor combos. The ham and artichoke was fabulous. Who knew you could enjoy pizza without sauce or cheese??  A wonderful local place and I pray they are successful!  Try it, you'll love it!!
