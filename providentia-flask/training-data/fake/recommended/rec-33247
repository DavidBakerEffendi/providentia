I went here for lunch on my graduation day. They had excellent food and service. I made a reservation online and the table was ready when we arrived. Most of us ordered the prix fix which was a good deal for around $18 I believe for a drink, appetizer, and entree with the option of adding a dessert for an additional $4. Their portobello mushroom appetizer was delicious with a generous portion of mushroom. The calamari appetizer also looked generous and tasty. The only issue with the appetizers was my mother ordered the mussels and everyone else had received their appetizers and were trying to politely wait for her to receive hers but apparently they made a mistake ordering it so we had all completed our appetizers by the time hers had finally arrived. Then our entrees arrived while she was finishing her appetizer but besides that, the service and timing was fine. They kept our drinks filled and were attentive to any request. I would definitely return especially for this lunch deal.
