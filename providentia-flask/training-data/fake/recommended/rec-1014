This place is o-kay. Not bad at all, but I have had better mexican food. We tried the guacamole, it was huge and comes in a unique bowl. If you're a guacamole fan, i'd say definitely try this place out. The Mahi Mahi tacos were good, beef enchiladas were okay, I've had better margaritas. Overall, my experience with this place did not live up to all the hype. Food was mediocre, nothing to write home about.
