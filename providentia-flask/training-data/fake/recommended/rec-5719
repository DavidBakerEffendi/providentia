These are the sandwiches dreams are made of. Now, I've been twice and the first time they were out of roast pork, so we "settled" for pulled pork.  It was delicious and I was left with a hunger that can only be satisfied with more DiNic's. Last weekend I had the chance to return for the roasted pork.  There was a line, at 3 pm and my stomach was starting to eat itself, but I was undeterred. Michael G. asked if we could split one and I politely declined (actually it was an emphatic refusal - alas, my eyes will always be larger than my tummy).  The moment came - two roast pork sandwiches with provolone and broccoli rabe plz! oh, and a diet coke (nevermind that I was up until 4:00 am the previous evening reading @50cent's twitter feed...). I unwrapped it and started in.  You can't leave them too long or the juice from the pork will reduce the substantial bun to mush. If you get it to go, get to it fast! So so good, but I should have shared one (Michael G. is so wise).  I nearly finished it (2-3 bites were sadly left behind), but at the cost of being full hours later and unable to finish my dinner. Whatever, I'll be back and this time I will skip supper.
