We had the $29 tasting menu. It was excellent and an amazing value. Each of the three "courses" actually consisted of multiple dishes, every one of which was very good to outstanding. We were stuffed. The margaritas were excellent too. Very good service. In total, under $200 for four people with 1-2 drinks each, the tasting menu, and a shared dessert. You can't eat this well in Center City at that price.
