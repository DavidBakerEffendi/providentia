Ode to pre and post-holiday season office lunch outings! Let me count the calories :) We seem to always end up eating at awesome places and Osteria was no exception. I was excited to eat here after reading Philadelphia magazine's nod to the restaurant as one Philly's best. But. Even still, you know I had to check Yelp first to see if the "real" people thought that all of that excitement was warranted. Â Luckily Yelp liked Osteria too. And so do I. Osteria wasn't terribly busy at the peak of lunch hour (i.e. 12:30 p.m. on Friday). Our party of five was seated immediately by the friendly hostess. The restaurant has a beautiful rustic design and is unpretentious. Three delicious breads were brought out by our awesome waiter and devoured quickly by my awesome colleagues. I had to stop myself after the third slice (don't judge me; 12:30 is a late lunch for me). My colleagues raved about the grilled octopus, which I didn't try, but it looked delicious. I ordered the Parma pizza. It was great but basic with arugula and prosciutto. I wish I had been more ambitious and gone for the Lombarda pizza but there's always next time. The post-lunch coffee was above average as was the polenta and pecan dessert - Jesus Mary Joseph and John...would've enjoyed it too. I can't wait to eat here again 5/5.
