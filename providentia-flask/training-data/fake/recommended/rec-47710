Ultra-fresh Duvel on draught in a cozy pub with lots of character...and characters. Many other Belgian draughts and bottles that are hard to find in the U.S. BXL is usually my last stop before heading back to the hotel and I have never eaten here. If you're pub crawling along 2nd Ave in Midtown East, put BXL on your list. And be wary of the Duvel. Like its eponymous demon, this strong golden ale is enticing and sneaks up on you.
