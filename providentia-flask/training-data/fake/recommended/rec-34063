Went for lunch and got the set of spicy ramen (can't remember the name) with a side rice and smoked eel.  it was very very good!  The ramen had a great spicy taste while the broth was very "slurpable" and delicious; a great combination of flavors that makes you want to kick yourself in the face for all the times you ate Maruchan. The ambiance was very nice.  The wait staff are very nice and cute.  What more could you want? The wait can be a bit too much sometimes.  The prices are "NY" prices.  The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is that I am slighted by paying 500 yen for a steaming mouthgasm bowl of ramen when I was visiting Kyoto.
