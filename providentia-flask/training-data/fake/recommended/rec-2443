This is an amazing place. I almost hate to review it because it was perfectly quiet and chill and if it fills up with lots of students and people, then it wouldn't be. But now - it's perfect...Free wifi. Free top-ups on coffee. And the coffee is good. Get one of the seats at the table by the window, be super productive, thank me later.
