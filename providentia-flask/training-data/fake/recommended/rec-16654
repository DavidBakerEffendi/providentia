I saw the reviews about the Tasty Hand Pulled Noodles Inc so I figure give the place a try.  I've tried the noodles in China which were amazing, been hooked on it and have been looking for a place that's somewhat comparable.  This place seats about 25 people or so, I can imagine it getting packed during lunch and dinner time. This places have various types of noodles that you can pair up with you dish, ranging from the hand pulled to knife peeled noodles.  I ordered the Fujanese Wonton meatball with the hand pulled noodles.  The wonton balls are smaller than the shrimp wonton's that you see in Cantonese style cooking.  The broth wasn't that bad, definitely flavorful, but I was done after a few spoonfuls.  The hand pulled noodles were good.  I wouldn't mind going back and giving other things a try at this place.
