Best falafel at the best price. $2.50 for a pita full. The tabouleh is good too. Don't expect to sit; it's literally one table in a stand that just cranks out the food, so get your pita and go sit in the park. And don't let the long line dissuade you; it moves really fast - from placing the order to food in your hand is less than five minutes. I prefer going here during the day, because when the drunks start showing up from the MacDouche-l Street bars, it's not worth the hassle.
