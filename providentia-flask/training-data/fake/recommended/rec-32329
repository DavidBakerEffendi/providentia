Based upon some Yelp reviews, I expected to LOVE this place. I wanted to, really. We stopped in the other day for an early dinner of PYT burgers after the first day of school. My teens loved theirs ... Buffalo Chicken burger was thumbs up!  I ordered the Lobster burger (medium rare) and flavors were great, but burger was verging on medium.  I was hungry and did not want to wait any longer, so I didn't complain.  Fries were fine. The tabletop was rickety and loose, flies were buzzing, and the service was OK. I do have to mention that the hostess was friendly and seemed sincere and acknowledged us as soon as we approached the front door. Sitting outside while watching the Phillies on the big screen TV could be fun. Seems more like a drinking establishment than a food-focused restaurant.  We would go back and try to sit outside to see if the experience is better.
