Came here with 3 friends after one of them insisted we come here because the burgers are 'ahhmaaaazing'. Came in and saw a line! Immediately I am ready to walk out the door, because I hate lines. I am told by one of my friends that I can stand online with a drink in my hand - and she proceeded to hand me my 'usual'. Â Ahhh much better. We got seated in about 15 minutes. We did get skipped once because one of the members of our party went outside for a minute and I guess they don't seat incomplete parties? Whatever. We got a table less then 5 minutes later. Considering we were drinking I didn't think of it as waiting on line, more like waiting at the bar. I got the bistro burger which is their bacon cheeseburger. I ordered it medium and... it was actually served medium! Well seasoned, juicy and delicious. My only peeve was that the patty was too thick - I would have liked it flatter. I had trouble keeping the whole burger situation together because it was really bulky! We got 2 orders of fries to share for the table and it was more then enough for 4 people. The fries themselves were ok - good but not as good as the burgers. Will be back for more deliciousness!
