Really nice bar - classy and not pretentious. Totally felt like I was in a movie... sitting at a romantic, dim bar with craft beer and a lots of men. Yes I swear, my friend and I were the only females (besides our waitress) in the backroom. So ladies, if you're on the hunt... this bar is the right choice. Lots of craft beers on tap. I am totally clueless when it comes to fancy beers but our waitress was super helpful after I described what I wanted. The service (management, busboys, waitress) was so pleasant and gave the place a homey feel. The pumpkin beer and German pilsner were both delicious! The meat and cheese tray is an excellent deal as well (2 meats + 2 cheeses + walnuts/toasted bread). I shall definitely be back!
