Can't figure out why PAts gets more starts than it's 'rival'....which are essentially the same thing...so one has chooped meat and one has slices, not a true competition in my mind. Maybe this is attributed to them being there first....hmmm... Kinda like Genos East and Giordanos in Chi...same stinking pizza.... Neither knocks your socks off any more than an Al's beef in Chi! Not amazing as you build it up to be.... So: *lots of bread, kinda skimpy on the meat *not enough cheese wiz! *being really rude and yelling at me to move along, not cute or funny to me.... *letting my sandwich get cold while I wait in separate/continuous lines to get a drink and fries and paying all over again, LAME *cash only, come ON!! Â People are paying with their phones these days, knock it off! Had to try it once, wouldn't go back.... a better sammie can be had at the reading market at Dinicks,,,
