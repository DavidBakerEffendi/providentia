I came here a few weeks ago with my husband on a really cold night.  The place is hidden and so cute!  So cozy too!  The service was great and the food was phenomenal.   I had the fried oysters and they were so delicious!!  We shared a bowl of the corn chowder and I literally licked the bowl clean!  I had the tuna burger which was really good.  My husband had the red snapper and it was really good too.  A tad bland though.  But we are gonna try everything on the menu here!
