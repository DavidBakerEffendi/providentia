I randomly stumbled into this gastro-pub because it was within walking distance of the Franklin Institute Science Museum.  They had excellent seating areas, and service was quick and helpful. The beer selection was definitely of higher quality then most small gastro-pubs, and the clientelle was respectful even though there was college football playing (and the desired teams were all losing.) Everyone in my party was completely happy with their food selections, which included the Veggie Burger, the Cajun Fries, the Homemade Tomato Soup, The Kite & Key Burger, the Garden Salad with Chicken, and the Garlic Chili Wings. The server was helpful, friendly, and expedient.  Really not much else you can ask for from a small pub. The only issue keeping me from giving this place 5 stars was the very poor neighborhood surrounding it, not exactly the place you want to be late at night by yourself.
