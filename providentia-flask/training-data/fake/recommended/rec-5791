I should know better than to expect much from Stephen Starr restaurants by now...Sorry but it's true! Went to Continental Midtown for Happy Hour today with a colleague from out of town.  Our waitress was not terribly pleasant, even informing us how much she dislikes happy hour (um, sorry to hear that, but I think you're working in the wrong place then!).   Happy hour prices were ok, food was ok but the worst part was their restroom.  I was really taken aback that a place like the Continental, which prides itself on being chic and high-quality, would have a bathroom in such a state--without exaggerating, when I went in today around 6 pm, it was as gross as the bathrooms at Market East or the bus station.  Two thumbs down for that Continental!  Don't charge me $14 for a martini and then skimp on cleaning services in the baño!!
