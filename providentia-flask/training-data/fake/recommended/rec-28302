I love this place. That being said, the blonde Irish waitress has got to go. She is always unnecessarily rude to me and my friends. I went here on my roommate's birthday, my roommate who is the sweetest nicest person in the world, because it is her favorite bar in Astoria and we had to leave after one drink because of that waitress. We had a large group and were standing next to the corner booth that only had two gentlemen in it. The guys were gone for a while, smoking or something, and my roommate sat on the side of their booth, where they weren't even sitting, and that waitress appeared out of no where to yell at her. My roommate explained she was going to ask the guys if she could sit there with them when they got back, but that they had been gone a while. That waitress b*tched her out, saying it was "against the law." Really?!? The law of Sweet Afton? The guys came back and my roommate explained the story to them and they were more than willing to have her join them at the booth, but at that point the waitress was going off on another one of our friends for touching some flowers in a vase on the bar, so we had to get out of there. I wish I could say this was an off night for her, but she has always got an issue with someone every time I come to this bar. Wish she would get deported.
