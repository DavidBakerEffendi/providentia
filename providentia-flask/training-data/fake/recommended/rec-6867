Went to Kefi in March 2009 after reading the New York Times review, which turned out to be pretty spot-on. We arrived for our reservation an hour early and they were able to accommodate us. The restaurant was very large and the decor was pleasant. Service was fair, but the waiters seemed a bit cocky. The bread given on the table was good; as was the olive oil. Our food came out a bit too fast and seemed rushed. For an appetizer we had the meatballs and the warm feta with pita. The warm feta was too salty and had the same vegetable mix on top that they seem to use in every dish. As for the meatballs they also covered in the same sauce that seems to be used in the pasta dishes. For an entree we both had the flat pasta with braised rabbit. The rabbit was good but had some bones left in it. About 30% of the dish consisted of cioppolini onions, which were overbearing. The prices were fair, but we would most likely not go out of our way to come back.
