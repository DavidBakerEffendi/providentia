The food was delicious.  We ordered the charcuterie (various cured meats, country pate and chicken liver pate), escargot in a hazelnut butter, macaroni and cheese and a beet and roqufort salad.  All of the above were wonderful.  The perfect afternoon lunch included a couple of glasses of white wine.  The one issue with the place was the service.  We received our charcuterie, but had still not received our wine or our bread, which of course is essential.  the waiter appeared to be running around, but not accomplishing much. Too bad.   Regardless the next time I am in Philly I wouldn't hesitate for one min. to return.  I'll just hope that the service has improved by then.
