A heaven on earth for foodies like me. Reading Terminal has something for everyone. Salads, sandwiches, wraps, pizzas, gyros, and crepes are just a handful of the many types of food offered here. I go to the Flying Monkey Bakery and Meltkraft Grilled Cheese when I want to indulge, and to Tootsie's when I am feeling healthy.
