I've only come here to restore balance to the force.  It's a Halal cart we're talking about here - they churn out pounds of questionable hot meat, tons of fat, salt, barely seasoned rice, hot sauce that kicks your asshole, soggy pita to sop up your shame after finishing the whole thing... okay, so actually all of that sounds pretty good to me.  And yet, it's just good, not change-your-layover good, not "fuck every other food cart that ever was" good.  There are some other places in Manhattan that do halal at comparable quality and price that aren't astronomically famous.   It's... good though!
