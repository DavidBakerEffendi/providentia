This is one of the few reasons why I would still want to be in Philly.  The broth and the freshness of these pulled noodles are definitely difficult to find....ANYWHERE IN THE US!  This was the first, middle, and last spot we visited while spending a long weekend in Philly.   They have a full menu of hand drawn or shaved noodles with your very exotic to very regular meats.  The prices are extremely reasonable at $8 for a HUGE bowl of noodles.  The boyfriend and I split one bowl of hand drawn noodles and tried their fried dumplings and dow mew (snow pea shoots) and both were also well prepared.  We tried their beef tendon and slice beef noodle and they give plentiful meat and veggies to accompany their noodle soup.  The highlight is definitely their pulled noodles.   I'm not sure if I will ever be going back to Philly but this is a very pleasant memory and I hope others have the chance to try too!
