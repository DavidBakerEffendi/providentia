I was really impressed with this place. The price-to-quality ratio is decidedly the biggest draw here. The bar area is a little outdated, but the dinning area had quite the ambiance. As for the food the ceviche, skirt steak and ropa vieja were all done very well. Drinks were a little too sweet in my opinion. Will probably stick to beer next time as there is no wine list. Definitely will return or order in from them in the near future.
