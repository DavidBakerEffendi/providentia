As a mac-n-cheese guru, I leaped at the chance to go here for a birthday dinner: mostly because I knew friends would pay, but also to experience mac n cheese spring rolls! Sadly, it took over an hour to seat 3 people! Yes it was a Friday night, but seeing group after group after group after couple after lone person get seated, all the while wasting away the hours on my 24th birthday made me slightly irritated at this establishment. After ordering a round of drinks (the caiprihinia straight up is goood!), I dove into the spring rolls. NOM NOM NOM. That gouda dipping sauce is offensively delicious. Main courses were large which I liked after waiting 70+ minutes; I had the pork chop medium rare, was a little too tough and a little too heavy on the smoke factor for my taste. Friends had the mahi-mahi (overkill on the avocado, but I love avocado so I didn't mind too much) and the steak (bloody and juicy). Dessert was the white chocolate bread pudding. NOM NOM. Yes only two noms, mostly because at this point I was happily bloated. Price is reasonable for a schwanky Chelsea eatery, definitely more upscale then the name impllies. Would I come here again? Possibly, but I'll end up making mac n cheese spring rolls in my own kitchen - thanks for the idea!
