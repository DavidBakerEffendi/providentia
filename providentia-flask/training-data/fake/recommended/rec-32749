i think this has become my new go-to place whenever i visit my gf in CT. Â they have a diverse taco selection, but each taco is cheap enough that you can try pretty much try everything in one meal - great value. i enjoyed the pork belly taco, because let's face it, you can never go wrong with pork/fat, but i was particularly blown away by the duck taco. the rendered duck fat makes it that much more savory. even the desserts were excellent, particularly the chocolate tamale, which is basically a chocolate lava cake wrapped in a tamale. eat with a side of icecream, it's a great combo. we actually got the 2 desserts "on the house" because it took a while for them to come out, which is a good segue into the service there: very attentive. i also really liked the ambiance there...it's quite cozy. unfortunately their next door neighbor barcelona has been disappointing my last few times there (ridiculously slow service), so i think that again, bartaco will be my new go-to place for a satisfying meal when i'm visiting CT.
