Fantastic burrito that is a step above Qdoba. I love Qdoba. Place gets slammed at lunch hours during the week. The guac and fried pita chips are delicious. Usually quick and you never spend more than $10-$12 per person. The staff is friendly, I think the owners are often working. They place good music, have a disco ball and have a few beers to choose from.
