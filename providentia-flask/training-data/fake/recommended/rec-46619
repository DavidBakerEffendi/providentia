I wanted to try Agno since it first opened and finally got around to it. I like another reviewer psyched myself up and was disappointed. I ordered the salad with falafel, my 3 toppings were roasted carrots, quinoa tabouli, and broccolini fennel salad. I had the lemon tahini and kalamata olive sauces. Everything was good except for the falafel and sauces. I've never had falafel that dry before. The tiny amount of sauce received was not enough to help. Falafel does not need to be baked long since the inside does not need to be cooked. The olive sauce was good but not the tahini. The spinach was very fresh and the toppings were all tasty. I would go again but get the chicken or vegetables.
