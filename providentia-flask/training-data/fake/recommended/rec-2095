So much fun. Last night I went for some cheese fries. I am diabetic and my sugar was low. The kid behind me kept elbowing me in the back. I asked him to stop. He and his two friends started screaming at me and pushing me. I get to the window and the guy tells me to get lost, we ain't serving you. Well let me just say, F**K OFF, Geno's. What a joke. And the food Â is awful as well.
