Worst place ever !!! Went there for brunch and ordered scrambles with mushrooms spinach and feta and apparently I got a bowl full of eggs with little green bugs at the bottom! Very disgusting. Had eggs sunny side up but it was cold and rubbery! Had them remake it so they gave me runny slimy eggs instead !! Way to go Butter Bug Channel !! Eeeeeeeew
