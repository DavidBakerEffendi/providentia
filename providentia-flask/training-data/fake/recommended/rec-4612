I came here for lunch with my co-workers. The food was pretty decent and it did not take too long to come out considering the size of our group. Despite it being a pizza place, I had a philly cheesesteak sandwich with mushrooms and onions. It was a good sized sandwich! If you want French fries don't forget to order them! They do not come with the sandwiches. It was pretty busy in there and I think the waitstaff was spread a little thin so refills on water were hard to come by. It does seem to be a Yale staple though. Lots of Yale memorabilia and pictures all over the place.
