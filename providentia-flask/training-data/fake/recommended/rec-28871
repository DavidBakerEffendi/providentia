We chose Barbuzzo based on these Yelp reviews.  SO glad we did!  I loved everything about it.  The service was great, the food was great, the ambiance was great. I took the train to Market East Station.  Barbuzzo was a short 5 minute walk away.  The hostess was friendly and prompt.  The restaurant was crowded, but somehow it didn't feel like it once we were seated.  We had a lovely waiter who was helpful and present, but not in our faces.  He wasn't pushy, even though every reservation was taken.  I liked it that they don't over reserve - leaving us the opportunity to enjoy our meal and our time together.  We never felt rushed.  We enjoyed wine, a the first course of Tomato Crostini and Farm Salad.  So delicious. Our second course were the meatballs and a pizza. And we had the caramel salt pudding bodino dish for dessert.  Divine. The evening was so great, and it was because of the lovely evening at Barbuzzo.  We will make reservations ahead of time again so that we can enjoy another great evening there soon!
