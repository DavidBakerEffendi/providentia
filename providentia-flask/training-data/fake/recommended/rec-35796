I LOVED this place! I just went for breakfast and the food was incredible. But even better was the couple that owns the place. They were so sweet and caring. I agree the place was very deceptive from the outside, I'm not sure I would have gone in had my friend not suggested it. The coffee was also exceptional, especially the iced mocha! DEFINITELY GIVE THIS PLACE A TRY!!!!
