I went with four of my absolute favorite people in the world, and you'd best believe that we all love food (not a coincidence). We spent a day wandering around Manhattan having what one might call a movable feast - Â a ten course meal with each course enjoyed at a different dining establishment. This is my idea of pure heaven. Malatesta was the chosen spot for our mid-afternoon "demitasse", and it was a very good choice indeed. A little slice of Italy right there in the west village. We sat at tables that were neither inside nor out, but right on the boundary between the two. We sipped espresso and munched on a caprese of the highest quality. The staff are adorable Italians. The atmosphere is delightfully chic. I would certainly go back for a full meal next time I'm in NYC.
