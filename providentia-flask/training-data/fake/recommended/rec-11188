i feel really really bad about this but the food totally stunk. it was wet with oil, flavorless, over cooked, and just flat. no gold flashdancers in my mouth at this place. the bar was beautifully simple and cool. the servers were attentive, attractive (is that bad to say, but they were all so pretty and nice), fast.....if they could just add some spice to the god damn food. it was as if someone grandma from the mid west was in that kitchen with cookin up mexican for a boat load of people with one spice packet and a bucket of lard. uggggh...so frustrating. it seems like a great place for a drink date and that would ba all at this point....come on guys-spice and crisp things up... i REALLY Â REALLY want to love you!!!
