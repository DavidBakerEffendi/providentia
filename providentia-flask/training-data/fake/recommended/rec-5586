Great food. Got the lobster Mac. That was 5 stars alone. Everything else was great including the dessert. My only gripe was the fact that our server was seriously rushing the hell out of us. The place was crowded and of course she probably wanted another table. More tables the more money but you should never make a table feel like they have to eat fast. Other than that, I would def go back when I return the Philly...
