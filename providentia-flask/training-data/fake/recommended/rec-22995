Just a terrible experience all around. Ordered a switchback and the bar tender said they were near the bottom of the keg so it would "be a little cloudy." What came out more closely resembled chocolate milk in consistency and color. When you work at a restaurant that serves $14 cheese burgers you do not offer people the dreggs of a keg. I drank a little of it to try and be a good sport but quickly sent it back. We then got attitude when asking that it be removed from the bill. The food was also not impressive. I ordered fish tacos that had zero taste aside from the stream of grease oozing out of the fried fish. The kids menu had a nacho option that we ordered for my son. I am not exaggerating when I say this was two handfuls of chips with about one handful of cheese throw on top ...FOR $9!
