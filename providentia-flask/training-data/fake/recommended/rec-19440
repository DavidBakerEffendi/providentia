We arrive around 1pm on Sunday for brunch & it was packed, but surprisingly we were seated within minutes. Our server was very friendly and made great recommendations. Â We loved the playlist they had going on; one great song after another! I ordered the eggs Benedict, which was AMAZING & I am a Benedict snob! It came with tomato, spinach, ham, & avocado, topped with the best hollandaise I have ever had (& my boyfriend agreed & he usually hates hollandaise). He ordered Lupe's dust buster mexi special which was also delicious! Sabrina's is hands down the best brunch I have had in a while!
