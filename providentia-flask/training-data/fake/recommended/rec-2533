I ordered take-out from this place and overall, I thought it was good. I was with a group of people and we ordered a few different types of meatballs and a variety of the sauces they offer.    The better meatballs were the beef (which does have pork) and chicken.  All the sauces were also good, but I'd say the mushroom gravy and pesto tasted the best. The overall concept is great and unique and it's nice that you have several options to choose from.  I don't think these are the most fantastic meatballs and not really worth all the hype, but it's a really good way to get several meatball options...there's definitely something for everyone.
