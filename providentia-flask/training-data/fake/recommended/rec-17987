These guys get how to do comfort food. Lots of good, earthy ingredients, well prepared. Fun place, excellent, friendly service. You had me at pork belly. One negative note...they need to buy martini classes. Serving a martini in a champagne glass is criminal and ruins the bouquet and sipping experience.
