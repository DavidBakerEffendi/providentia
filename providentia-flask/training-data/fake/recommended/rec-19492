I've been wanting to try this place for a while and finally got the chance today. It was pretty crowded but the line moved fast, just be sure to ask the person in front of you which line you're on since there are different lines depending on what you're ordering. I went in knowing what I wanted to try, and that was the pulled pork with a twist sandwich since everyone seemed to rave about it. This sandwich is made with pork, sweet plantains, mayo, and onions. I was a bit nervous because I wasn't sure if they were already prepared and I would then have to pick out all of the onions and scrape off the mayo. I absolutely hate MAYO!! I relaxed as soon as the sandwich guy asked me if I wanted everything, I quickly told him to omit the onions and mayo. The sandwich guy alone deserves 5 stars! I've never seen someone work that quickly on a sandwich, he was able to work on 3 different sandwiches at the same time and managed to remember what to put on each one correctly. The sandwich did not disappoint! The pork was seasoned correctly and tender, the plantains were sweet and the spicy green sauce added just the right kick. I intended to eat half of the sandwich and save the other half for dinner but ended up eating the whole thing. I can't wait to return again so I can stuff my face. If you're into Spanish food and pork, then this is a must try!
