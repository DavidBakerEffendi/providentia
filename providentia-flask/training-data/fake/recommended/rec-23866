I wa really excited about coming here with my friends, however they cancelled last minute so I treated my boyfriend to dinner. I loved margarita and my goat burrito which our waiter recommended. We took our dessert to go. The main problem with this place was the service and attitude of the hostess. We were seated next to a very loud table and while my boyfriend left out small table to go the bathroom, the ignorant lady next to him placed the plastic specials menu in his seat. I didn't realize it and neither did my boyfriend, who then sat on it. She didn't even bother to apologize for outing it on his seat just said can I have the other piece you're sitting on?   Well our night was ruined from that point on, and because he was pissed, my bf went to talk to the hostess. Her response to him was," we'll I moved here from Minnesota  and I had to get use to people being a-holes too, and you're just going to have to learn to deal with it" that is not an acceptable response to a customer. She didn't bother to mention it to manager. When we got up to leave, I simply asked the ignorant lady if it was that hard to give an apology. She then proceeded to say it wasn't her fault he shouldn't have say on it and them began to threaten and curse at us.  Needless to say we will not be going back. We both understand that the situation wasn't the restaurants fault, however the hostess should not have said what she said due To it being an unacceptable response in the food industry. She definitely could have handled that better or gotten a manager involved. It was also way to loud in there and I couldn't even have a conversation with my boyfriend.
