My wife and I have been recommending the Blue Point Grill for years.  The seafood is fresh and the prices are reasonable.  It addition, the place is BYOB!  When dining here we usually start our meal with oysters which are excellent.  We have dined here over the years at least a dozen times.  Myself, I usually opt for the Branzini which is a mild Mediterranean fish.  The place is rather small with seating outside during the summer when the weather permits.  Sometimes they also have small groups of musicians playing outside.  So, you can enjoy a bottle of wine while waiting for your table.  Parking is usually hard to find on the street but they have a small parking on the side between the restaurant and the Ivy Inn which is next door.  The Ivy is a dive bar but you can get a good cocktail here before your meal.  Once seated you enjoy a great meal without being rushed for the next seating.
