Awesome food, atmosphere and service.  Only complaint was the insanely rude hostess.  We were a party of 3 at the bar waiting for two more to arrive for dinner.  When our table was ready she came over and was like you have to close out asap, but our bartender was busy talking to other patrons, we weren't just going to interrupt him.  So i told her to give us the next table and she did.  She didn't even want to wait two minutes.  I would absolutely still go back but i will be sure to be a b*tch to her everytime.
