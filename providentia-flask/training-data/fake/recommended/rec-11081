WOW...This place was amazing. I got the Jambalaya and my boyfriend got the Train Wreck (steak, andouille, salami, fried onions, creole mayo). We also split the cajun fries.  Everything was delicious! amazing flavors.  Jambalaya was packed with chicken, andouille and shrimp. very good!  I was able to grab a couple bites of the train wreck. WOWZA. It was soooo goood! I couldnt believe my eyes when i saw the line stretching around the corner for the Dinics Roast Pork when you could have a train wreck ( i know the dinics is amazing too), this train wreck is prob the best sandwich i have ever eaten in this city. Forget all the gourmet burgers and the cheese steak shops. GET THE TRAIN WRECK. kind of reminded me a bit of a schmitter, but dare i say EVEN BETTER than the schmitter. this is an absolute must in this city! All Hail The Train Wreck fyi you will feel a little train wrecked after eating it! just look at the ingredients you know what you're getting in to! Just go for it.
