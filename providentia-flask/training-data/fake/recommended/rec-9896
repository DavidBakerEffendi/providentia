So good! My brother was right. The ramen was a winner. We first whetted our appetites with a Japanese cucumber seasoned with Ippudo's original sesame oil sauce. It didn't look like much, but was very delicious. For the ramen, I ordered their Akamura Modern. It was simply delicious. I described it as a flavorful meat slurry, which might sound unappetizing, but accurately describes the broth's texture and flavor in my food mind. I would happily return.
