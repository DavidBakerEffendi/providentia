So. Good. For a place that looks as fancy as Room Service, I'm surprised most of their menu is within $10-$12. There's a humongous chandelier just hanging out in the middle of the room, which adds a lovely touch of decadence I didn't expect walking in. There's usually a wait, so I would make reservations! I came here with my roommate around 9PM one Thursday night. We live less than a block away and have been eyeing the spot for weeks. We waited roughly 20min, which wasn't too bad, except the plastic chairs by the entrance were a bit wobbly and not classy like the rest of the restaurant. Two older gentlemen also tried to get us to join them for dinner--"no thanks" said my roommate (personally I wanted their business cards, but oh well). We were eventually seated and watch out--their tables ARE small and very close together. It IS loud. However, all of this is made up for by their impeccably fast service (did anyone else notice all the waitresses are incredibly gorgeous?) and delicious food. I had already eaten dinner, so I only got avocado rolls but my roommate's chicken fried rice was SO GOOD. I don't even like chicken fried rice! My avocado roll was pretty satisfying as a healthy snack, and cheap! Next time I'm definitely trying the pad thai and ordering a cocktail to boot. The decor and ambiance of this place make it my preferred Thai place on 9th ave. I'm just itching for an excuse to bring my friends from out of town!
