This place IS good, and it IS worth coming back to because you see menu improvements and the chef's growth. There are more items in the menu that have varying textures and interesting flavor combinations. There are some that work really well (the salad and the uni toast), and then there are some that may need some tweaking--the shaved foie with larger chunks of celementine? that seriously should go on the desert menu if you reduce the clementine in it. I'm looking forward to having that uni toast again, and seeing what else is new. I still think you can step up that dessert menu, Sat & Fat.
