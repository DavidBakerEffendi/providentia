I am beyond disappointed.  After waiting YEARS to visit Junior's after watching Diddy on Making the Band, I'm finally in NYC and had the chance to eat at Junior's this morning since we're staying at the Marriott right across the street.  Let me start by saying their were scads of employees working, well, scads that were supposed to be working, this morning.  Unfortunately, throughout our meal, the left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing.  We were told that Toby would be our waiter, however, we didn't lay eyes on him until we asked for our check.  The unfortunate guy who did wait on us was slow as molasses, didn't refill our coffee, and struggled to break a $100 bill on a $60 breakfast (for four).  Get it together, Junior's.  You've got the potential to be great, but the shabby service has got to go and your food wasn't top notch either.
