I'm Vietnamese and in my assessment of pho I look for tasty yet subtle broth and fresh noodles (not dried and rehydrated). The broth here is not as clear as my mom would make it. It's taste somewhat immature as in it hasn't developed long enough (good broth can take 24+ hours). Regardless, it is tasty and the best choice in jersey city for pho. The fresh noodles make a big difference. They are al-dente and have a good mouth feel. They could be a little chewer and softer but not bad. Came here before hurricane Irene would hit. Was suspect with the reviews but am pleased. The shakes are quite good. Fresh mango at 3.00 is a deal. The durian shake is quite good as well. Am happy we came here and it's nice to see a vietnamese restaurant run by Vietnamese. P.s. Wife says they have excellent mango shake. I agree.
