The avocado salad is delicious! The chicken is crispy and deliciously seasoned. I am not a fan of white meat and next time would ask for all dark meat as the breast was extremely dry! Love the decor but Very loud.. Fortunately we were seated upstairs! But still had to yell to be heard on a sun nite! Very quick service.. Good value as portions are large.
