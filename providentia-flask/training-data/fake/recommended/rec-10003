Delicious Bronte Burger! The place is super small, and we had to wait for a bit when my coworkers and I went for lunch on a Wednesday. The service is great though (Australian accents!), and I really enjoyed the food here. Not particularly memorable, but it's one of those places people talk about so you just go for the heck of trying it out once.
