I decided not to be shellfish and share my experiences at this wonderful establishment faithfully dedicated to the delicious murder of crustaceans. You get live, fresh, cooked lobster for like 9.99/lb AND its BYOB. Hit up Ikea, a few garden stores and you got yourself a nice little Saturday jaunt my friends.
