Warnings - 1. Be prepared to get close to people. Some that are hot, some that don't smell very nice. Place is tight. In the space way. But it's also tight in the other way, too. 2. Knowing some Mandarin is helpful. I'm sure the guy behind the counter hasn't seen too many Indian-American people talk Mandarin (and actually get the tones right). And if you do and aren't Chinese, be prepared to get looks from hot chicks. Took him a second to actually look up and see me before he took my order. Mando helps to get your order right. If you heed the aforementioned, you'll like this place. Everyone has already said it, but cheap dumplings. I must say that they are okay. Not amazing. Although they may seem more so when its freezing outside and the dumplings are piping hot off the pan. I liked the sesame pancake. Fresh made, perfect texture and consistency, only 75c (was 50). A nice treat when walking back to Grand St. or walking/biking the bridge. My order did take a bit longer than usual, and they forgot my pancake at first. Granted, they had a lot of orders, but they should get it right by now. A quick, inexpensive, rather tasty joint if you're in the mood or in the area.
