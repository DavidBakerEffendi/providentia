My wife and I used to be frequent patrons throughout the past 25+ years when we lived in Shelburne.  Always good food and fond memories.  Loved Pauline's.  We visited recently on while vacation from NM.   As the saying goes, "you can never go home". Food was not worth the price.  Salads dry and brittle.  My wife could not eat hers.  My mushroom dish was so loaded with balsamic vinegar it was uneatable.  Bread was dry and cold.  We complained to the waitress but there was no offer to send out a different dish or any compensation.  Nothing!  I left hungry, angry and never to return.  Goodby Pauline 's.
