I decided to try Trattoria L'incontro because of all the good reviews on yelp.  I  made the mistake of not reading the negative reviews.  Lesson learned. The service is fast and satisfactory but not fine.  They are trying in my opinion to do way too much at this restaurant.  Way to many specials and not attention to detail.   My meal was rather bland and not special looking.  Not sure if the pasta was homemade or out of a box.  I could not determine any distinct flavors at all.  I am not mentioning the specific dishes because it didn't matter at all.  We had 4 and they all were unimpressive.   I must say everyone in the restaurant seemed happy and they do pack them in.   Given that I don't think I will be back.
