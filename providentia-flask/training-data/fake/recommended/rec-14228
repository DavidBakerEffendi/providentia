I really like Penelope's but a one-hour wait for brunch?  Come on. It has a lovely rustic, warm interior.  The food is solid; anything with bacon will be very good.  I've wandered in at night, and prefer it then because no one is around.  Cookies and milk on a candlelit table are pretty romantic.  It's too bad I was there with a friend. I might have given 4 stars if it weren't for the insanity of weekend brunch wait times.  If you're hungry, walk over to 3rd avenue and go to any of the those restaurants.
