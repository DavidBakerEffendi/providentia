I recently went there for happy hour and appetizers, and overall had a good experience; the place is beautiful and has a great vibe. The mojito I had was good, but I wasn't impressed with the red sangria at all --very watery, and my friends' drinks were similar. As for the appetizers, the 2 empanadas I had were ok, but the Royal Palm Dates were excellent; dates+bacon+bleu cheese+almonds = delicious. As was their guacamole; the truffles really made a huge difference and I appreciated how well the plantain chips that came with it were done. However, I have to take this place down a few notches for the shrimp ceviche I also had -- absolutely disgusting. It was literally cocktail shrimp with cocktail sauce splayed over it with some basic as a garnish. Not only was it not ceviche, but it tasted terrible!
