The well done and rare beef pho (no. 32 on the menu) is voluminous and delicious.  The lime, basil, jalepenos, and sauce blend perfectly to create a soothing soup that is neither too salty nor too heavy.  The beef itself is mostly lean and the rare portions are very rare, so avoid this dish if rare beef is not your thing.  The bean sprouts are fresh and give the soup a lovely contrasting crunchy texture.  Add in the sweet coconut drink and you have one of the best bargain meals you can find anywhere.  I ordered takeout, which was blazingly fast, but will update once I return for a sit down meal.   And I WILL return!
