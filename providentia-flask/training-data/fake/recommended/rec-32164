A friend and I went up to Glastonbury to visit a friend and his family. We looked at the prices and could not believe how cheap it was in comparison to NYC. The hibachi was absolutely freaking awesome. Still craving hibachi, my friend and I went to Benihana's in NYC a few days later, paid double the price, and the quality of food was half as good. I am dying to go back here. Thanks Sakura!
