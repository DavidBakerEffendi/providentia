At first I was frustrated with the parking but I'm from the suburbs and not use to the street parking.  Ended up getting an awesome spot one block away. Walking in, I notice the wall 'o' wine and immediately enjoyed the atmosphere.  We were seated right away and our waiter greeted us the moment we sat down.  We chose the chefs tasting menu, the wine tasting was recommended but opted to get a bottle of wine instead since there were so many nice bottles.   Everything came out prompt, cheese platter was a tease, Lamb was freaking amazing and the Sea Bass was bar none.  Its important to me that the waiter keeps my water glass filled and this guy was on point.  In the beginning I informed him that my girlfriend was allergic to all nuts.  When our dessert came out, he immediately intervened before the  dish even hit the table due the crushed pistachios.  Well played sir!!!! All in all, great service, great food, great wine and surprisingly...great bathrooms!!!
