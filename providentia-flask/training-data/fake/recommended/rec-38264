My husband and I have driven and walked by this place several times on stops in New Haven, but last night we decided to try it - and we feel so lucky that we did. The place is awesome! It's beautiful, has a great vibe, our server was outstanding, and the food....holy mother, it was amazing. We started out with tableside guacamole which was the best we've ever had, moved on to the prickly pear/watermelon gazpacho which was delicious, and then shared the pork tacos (appetizer) and pork tenderloin entree. We ended with the spicy chocolate cake and cinnamon icecream and it was scrumptious. Seriously everything was perfect - the food was unique, fresh, and delicous. We will be coming back soon and often.
