Finally I am here. This is my friend's fav restaurant. I made a reservation one week in advanced to get good spot in weekend. I like the table close to the window. My friend prefer to sit at the bar so that he can watch when they cook. The restaurant is very small and crowded. The service is very good. We got there 5 mins earlier and the table is already ready. We ordered 6 tapas and one side, a glass of wine and a dessert. Check in with foursquare and you will get a free glass of wine. -skirt steak. I am not a fan of steak. But the sauce is so good. -Baby Squid Encebollados with Sherry Balsamico and Basil $15.00 Recommend by the waiter but we don't like it. -Foie Gras with Cinco Cebollas $19.00 This is my fav dish. I think it's the best foie gras I ever had. -Rabbit with Habanero Cuajada and Mono Kimchee $20.00 They cooked the rabbit in three different way in one dish. I don't think it's worthy for the price. -Razor Clams a la Plancha $16.00 This is a popular dish too. You will see it ok every table. Don't forget to dip the sauce with your bread. -Scallops with Miso Parsnip Butterscoth and Parsley Pur√©e Scallop is very good. I will recommend this dish. Dessert is ok. We got the potato as side but I think it's too oily.
