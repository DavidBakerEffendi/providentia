Excellent Thai food made with authentic ingredients. Definitely some of the best I've had in the USA. The noodles were tasty without being oily. The place is small and the wait for a table is long. We waited about an hour for a table for 2, but it was saturday night and they give you a call so you can go have a drink elsewhere while you wait.
