If Frankford Hall were in South Philly, I would likely spend many weeknights in their courtyard. As it is, I still venture north to grab a brew & a wurst, and generally have a great time. Its a definitely a perfect place for birthday outings- without the messy splitting of the check! Head to the beer station - pay up, drink up; head to the food station, pay up, grab a flag and they'll bring you German deliciousness wherever you are in their excellent courtyard of picnic tables, umbrellas, bonfires, and ping pong tables! Day or night, it's a great place to be, but check out the lights at night because the place is a party! Sometimes the atmosphere is a bit too... Bro? The bathroom is very hit or miss... But other times the crowd is great and a friendly pick-up game of ping pong ensues between groups. But if you can brave the bros, be sure to come early on the weekends or you'll forego the table and possibly be stuck waiting on the pavement outside to even get in the place! Oh, and hit the interior bar for a larger beer selection than the station outside- I always have much better luck there finding darker, delicious brews!
