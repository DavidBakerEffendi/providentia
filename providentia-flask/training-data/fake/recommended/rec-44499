Authentic Filipino food is not something I get to enjoy often.  I have a Filipino man friend and I've been to the Philippines with him, so I know what the real deal is.  Unfortunately, the real deal is not easy to find on the east coast. During our last trip to NYC, we stumbled upon this place and trekked over for brunch.  At first glance, I didn't have high expectations because I've never been to a good Filipino joint that wasn't turo-turo style.  My fears washed away quickly when the food arrived at the table beside ours, and I watched the waiter set down massive portions of delicious-smelling sizzling sisig and tapsilog. I thought I was going to be tortured watching the table beside us eat as we waited for our food, but our orders came out ASAP!  We shared a lumpia appetizer (delicious and perfectly seasoned!) and I got lechon kawali with garlic rice and my man friend got dasilog (milkfish with garlic rice and sunny side up eggs). All of it was AMAZING and tasted as good as his family's cooking in the Philippines!  The presentation was also nice -- something you don't see often in Filipino restaurants -- and I was so impressed that I took a picture of my meal.  One of the staff members (perhaps the owner?) saw me doing this and came over and offered to take a picture of my man friend and I dining because he said pictures of food alone are boring (haha).  If I had the stomach capacity of an army of teenage boys, I would have also ordered some halo halo for dessert, or maybe even a San Miguel or Red Horse beer to go along with my food. I am so, so glad we got to have Sunday brunch here.  I can't think of a better, friendlier place to eat some delicious, authentic Filipino food and enjoy the weekend!
