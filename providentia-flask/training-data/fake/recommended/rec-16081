We stopped in late on a Friday night for a glass of wine, such a great spot. Ambiance is so cozy and warm with a Nice wine list. We just got a snack to go with our wine, the focaccia with nutella from the "after hours" menu- it was a delicious treat. Our experience was so nice that night we decided to do lunch here the next day as we were in the neighborhood. We ordered the focaccia with sheep's milk riccota and black truffle honey for an app-Wow! We cleaned the plate and wanted another order. For our meals the Truffle gnocchi- as other reviews have said, it was probably some of the best I've had outside of Italy-fluffy light and so flavorful. Then the eggplant stuffed with ricotta and spinach- it was simple but quite tasty as well. Service was great too. Overall 2 gerat experiences. Definitely worth checking out, we will be back for sure!
