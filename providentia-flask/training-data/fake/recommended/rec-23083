This place only plays one song, but it's one of my favorites. THPN has the best beef noodle soup I've had in Manhattan. The broth, flecked with pickled mustard greens, is almost chewy in its toothsome depth. The noodles themselves are served perfectly al dente. A typical serving of meat in one of their soups is sparing, but it is quite flavorful. I'd recommend the oxtail soup to anyone.
