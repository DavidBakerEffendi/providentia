I have never been so underwhelmed.  The server was rude, dismissive, and impatient.  The mussels appetizer terribly sub par; my seafood pasta dish was tasteless, albeit fresh; and my sweetheart's meal, that poor man paid close to $20 for a kiddie meal. His heart sank when they placed the tiny portion in front of him that tasted like it may have come from a box. We had heard a lot of great things about this place, so we were really disappointed.  Having been a server myself for five years I usually take poor service with a grain of salt; who knows, he could have been having a rough night.  However, this character was just plain rude!  We weren't ready to order after looking at the menu for two minutes, yet we were ready to put in our appetizer, to which he said in a testy retort, "uh, the chef wants us to put the entire order in at once!"  I even explained that we had never been there before.  Well, he walked away, returned 30 seconds later and asked for our drink order, (I guess perusing the menu for the appropriate wine/meal paring was something he just couldn't wait for).  I swear we really weren't taking that long!  Once he received our meal order, well, he was done with us! Thankfully we weren't thirsty, because he definitely wasn't in the mood to bring us another beverage!  Poor food + poor attitude = overrated and not worth it!
