Went for brunch this past Sunday, and was absolutely satisfied. Were told there would be a 10-15 minute wait, my name was called about 5 minutes later.. always a plus! I opted for the Huevos Rancheros Skillet & my boyfriend got the Steak & Eggs. His came out with a decent size portion of steak, that was cooked to perfection (medium-rare), 2 scrambled egg & toast.. also came with a tasty horseradish sauce for the meat. He wiped his plate clean! My breakfast was above & beyond what I was expecting. had refried black beans layered w blue corn tortilla rounds (almost like a lasanga idea) with my (perfectly cooked, medium) fried eggs on top, home fries & fresh guacamole + pico de gallo. When I took that first bite of tortilla/egg/bean & smeared some guac & pico on it I must've said "oh, my god.. MMmmmmm" 3 times! The flavor was so so good. Home fries were some of the best I've ever had. I was more than happy with my brunch. We'll be back to try their dinner next time we're in Burlington, for sure.. (& probably go for brunch the following morning!) Â ;)
