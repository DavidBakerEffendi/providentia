I love ilili.  My only complaint is that every time I eat here, I end up over-ordering!  And slightly tipsy from the excellent cocktails.  The space is large, modern, and dimly lit.  Service is prompt and polite.  Possibly because of the large number of tables, I've never had any trouble getting a reservation, even when making last minute plans.  Although everything that I've tried has been good, I highly recommend the sweet cheese, the feta rolls with mint, and the roasted eggplant.  The hummus and tabouleh were good but not great. Cockails are unusual and extremely strong.  My favorite is "From Beruit with Love" a vodka based drink with fresh basil which is very sweet and refreshing.  It also comes in a cup the size of a bowl.  I'm not sure that I would come here for a first or second date, because it does get kind of loud and lacks that "intimate" vibe, but it's good for friends, couples, and groups.  In a city with a million restaurants to try, I keep going back to ilili.
