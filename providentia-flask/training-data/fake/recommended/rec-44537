Filipino food in the East Village, NYC! I'm so glad I found this place. Coming from San Francisco, CA., where many awesome Filipino restaurants are, Â I was expecting mediocre. However, it was not. The food was great and the waiter was nice. I didn't give them a full 5 star rating because the service was a bit slow (but what Filipino restaurant isn't slow)?
