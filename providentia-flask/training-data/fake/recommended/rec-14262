So I think this is the first time I've ever gone to an eating establishment on 10th ave and it was sooo worth it!  It's easy to miss the place because it's so small or maybe i'm just blind.  Anyhow, started here really early, like 6pm early so we had no problem getting seats.  The waitress/hostess was super friendly and helpful in picking our wine.  The place is def small but cozy and we were seated right across from the kitchen.   So here's the deal on the food, we went with a few specials and a couple of things on the menu: -especiale numero uno - tuna fish ball croquettas: not the official name but thats how i remember them.  my date didn't take to them because he thought they were too fishy but i didnt mind them.  Nothing to call home about. -numero dos - setas: some kind of thinly sliced mushroom with little cubes of manchego, tomato (i think) and olive oil.  THis dish was so simple yet so good.   - numero tres - SUCKLING PIG: hands down favorite dish of the night.  Waitress warned it would take about 25 minutes to make but we were in no hurry and it is sooo worth it.  it was quite a big portion too.  i think it was the leg/thigh part  of the pig and the skin was crispy and sweet.  Didn't taste too fatty at all, although i'm sure there was plenty of it.  The meat was falling off the bone..it was just YUM-O!!!!! Then the dishes we had from the menu were the - razor clams and cockles - or rather just cockles because they ran out of razor clams.  typical dish, good garlic butter sauce - lamb skewers - juicy pieces of lamb that come with warm crusty bread.  thumbs up! - tortilla espanola - I always get this dish because you can never go wrong and tia pol didn't go wrong.   Overall, really liked this place.  Great to come with a date or just to catch up with a friend over some good food and wine.   Oh AND the tables has hooks under them.  Fo
