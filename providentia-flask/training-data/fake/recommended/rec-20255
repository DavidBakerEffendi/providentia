Tell me, what can beat the price of $15 for a lobster roll?  Nothing I tell you... NOTHING... The lobster roll was small and it comes with a bag of Cape Cod potato chips.  There are two kinds - a Maine one (cold lobster meat with mayo) and a Connecticut one (warm lobster meat with butter).  I had the Maine one and I was very happy with it.  It was not overloaded with mayo and the meat was cooked very well. We also decided to try the shrimp roll for 8 buckaroos.  The shrimp roll was light and has a hint of spice.  It is also served cold on a warm roll.  It was not as tasty as the lobster roll but a decent sandwich if you're not a fan of lobster.  It also comes with a side of Cape Cod potato chips. If you're around the area, it's a must try!
