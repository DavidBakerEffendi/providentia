This joint is the creation of Mark Iacono and takes the place of a soda fountain once known for making some of the last real egg creams in Brooklyn. Locals can take comfort, however, in the fact that Mr. Iacono was raised in the neighborhood and still lives around the corner. Not only that, but much of the equipment---including the espresso machine---comes from Leonardo's Pizza, which was sadly replaced by a Dunkin' Donuts in October of 2005. The recipes, too, are from the neighborhood, having come from Mr. Iacono's grandma and aunts. The space, much of it built out by Mr. Iacono himself, feels like a large homey kitchen that, oh, just happens to have a pizza oven in it. Mr. Iacono prepares his pies in full view of the dining room on a marble-top work table. He tops them with a fresh-tasting sauce made from canned San Marzano tomatoes; a cheese combo of regular fresh and imported buffalo mozzarellas and a generous dusting of just-grated grana padano. He adds to that a judicious bit of garlic and basil before sliding his pies into his self-built gas-assisted wood-fired oven. The oven, he estimates, hovers around 800 degrees, and it cooks the pies in somewhere between two to four minutes, depending on the heat. It all makes a thin, crisp, amazing pie.
