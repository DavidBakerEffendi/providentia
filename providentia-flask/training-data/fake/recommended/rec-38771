Hip beer garden just around the corner from the Girard stop on the El. We were drawn to the Hall on memorial day weekend, and lucked out. Choice of sitting in the sun in long, shared picnic benches, or in the shade at tall bar stools with large ceiling fans makes it a comfortable outdoor space on hot summer days and nights. We enjoyed wheat beer, Munich lager, and the Spaten Oktoberfest equally in large stein glasses. The bratwurst was delicious, with very spicy mustard and kraut. Kids were running around the family-friendly garden, and folks were enjoying ping pong games in the sunny garden. The pints are expensive, but over-sized. Will return this summer!
