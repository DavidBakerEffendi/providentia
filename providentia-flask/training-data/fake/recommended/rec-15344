The tour guide from Independence Hall suggested Sonny's. I noticed they pull their beef directly out of the refrigerator and cook it fresh for each order. Fries and rings made fresh. Big dollops of Cheeze Whiz to smother everything. Wait until your food cools a bit and eat the coagulated cheeze, it's so good! The guys behind the counter are working hard and they are friendly. One of my great experiences in Philly.
