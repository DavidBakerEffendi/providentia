they have leffe brune. that alone will keep me going back. about 15 beers on tap, none of which are the usual ones, and about 30 different beers by the bottle. add a fairly decent-sized wine selection, and some belgian beer bar pub grub, and they have a pretty decent spot going for them. it's not a date spot. nor is it really a fri/sat night party spot. a good after-work spot that will definitely please the beer lovers. more of a bar for friendly gatherings (large groups included) in comfy clothes. the lighting is a bit too bright, making it always feel like it's 3pm in the afternoon (not always a bad thing). never too crowded. a good place for trying out all different sorts of beers in their proper glasses. but have you ever been to a spot that you felt had a mixed up image? it's nice, but it's a bit too comfortable. it's comfortable but too bare to be THAT comfortable. it's 11pm outside, 3pm inside. i haven't sat in the back restaurant area, but in terms of the bar, something hasn't quite 'solidified' yet. i certainly hope it will.
