My favorite place for a fun dinner .. Great BYOB place! Bring anything from wine to rum because they have great mixers from sangria to punches. Food is always great and huge portions. With girls we usually split Â some large dishes and order lots of tapas. Goat cheese fritters: so good with a little sweetness it's like the perfect wine accompaniment Pernil con tostones: delicious Chicken lollipops: crispy I add a bit of lime juice over for some more acid kick Churasco: Med rare skirt steak juicy and flavorful Paella: huge dish we take most of it home but full of tons of seafood mussels scallops clams fish and squid Tres leches and Mango Flan are both the perfect ending!
