I'm writing this review and eating my lamb over rice platter with both hands shaking vigorously because I'm so hungry. I read reviews of this cart before going there, and you guys are right, this cart definitely does not disappoint. The meat and rice are tasty, the white sauce rocks and I'm so glad I did not ask for more hot sauce (because it *is* really spicy). I really like the white sauce. The only issue I have is with the plastic fork they provide. Food this good ought to be eaten with a shovel.
