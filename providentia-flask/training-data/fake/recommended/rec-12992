I've lived down the street from Bistango for over a year, and have walked by numerous times, but I never thought to eat there. .. Until last night when my friend suggested we go there for dinner.  So we did and I'm regretting not going sooner. They have a decent wine list that's reasonably priced, so we started off with a bottle of wine.  They give you a piece of bread served with oil and garlic that's really good!  We shared the calamari, which was sautéed and served with roasted tomatoes.  I got the gnocchi for my main dish, which I loved.  The portion wasn't too big, and it came in a creamy pesto sauce with chucks of goat cheese and sundried tomatoes.   My friend got the cavatelli with sausage, which I didn't try at all, but she seemed to enjoy.  Overall I really enjoyed my meal there.  The food was good, and the staff was attentive and friendly.  I definitely plan on going back!
