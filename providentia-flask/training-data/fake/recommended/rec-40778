Jones is awesome. Familiar foods with an upscale twist. Stephen Star's restaurants don't dissapoint. They have a damn good veggie burger. The baked macaroni and cheese....oh my god. Has the bread crumbs on top and everything. Comfort food in a setting designed after Elvis Presley's den at Graceland.
