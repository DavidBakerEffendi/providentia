Wow. This is a review for a burger takeout. I had the "Bistro Burger", we picked it up and ate it about 15 minutes after it was made. And even with that time elapsed front he moment it left the grill, I still loved it. It was a decent burger. Very simple, unassuming. Only con was it was so small I could've eaten 3 of those on my "hungry" days. But it's the best $9 burger I've had in the city in a while.. really.
