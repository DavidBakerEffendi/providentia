The collard green salad with egg on top great . The spicy chicken wings crispy and just right with the peppers and  seasoned salt they serve with it . The cavatellii with greens needed more greens and Iess salt  . The chicken & waffles is nice and crispy and moist . Unfortunately the waffle is very sweet ( that's without the syrup) . But some people like that . A dessert waffle really . Will be back though and try the great looking hamburgers . The staff was very friendly and the chef  asked if we enjoyed our meal . A warning When it fills it gets very noisy . Great ceiling effect with lights and mirrors makes the space seem larger too.  The portions were good size . We left very full . A casual  ambiance .
