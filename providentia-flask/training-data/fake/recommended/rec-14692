I almost passed by it because it's so subtly marked with a peach on the windows with no other signs.  We arrived for an early mid-week dinner, so we were able to get seats right away.  They have this one long bar in the middle, and half way down the guests can actually sit on the side of the bar that the staff is...  It's a little weird.  I felt a bit cramped, with nowhere to put my coat or bag. Ok, on to the food... barron point oysters w/kimchi consommé - oysters were pretty good, but nothing special.  kimchi flavor was barely noticeable. long island fluke w/lemon, celery, nori - yum! i love the celery flavor and the fluke was delicious.  great combination of flavors. santa barbara uni w/beet tapioca, whipped tofu, scallions - omg, who would've thought uni and beets?  the uni was very fresh and super good and the flavors just went together really well.  a surprisingly good combo! apple kimchee w/bacon - pretty tasty, but i wasn't blown away steamed pork buns - oh the famous pork buns.. and yes, they are delish!  now, if you're just here for the pork buns, save yourself some time and go next door to milk bar to get them :) broadbent's country ham - so simple, yet so good. crispy pig's head - when i saw this on the menu, i was picturing a real pig's head....which of course didnt seem so appetizing.  good thing we ordered it anyways because it wasn't as scary as I had imagined and was quite good. Overall a very good meal and I would definitely go back again.  I'm glad I was finally able to try one of the Momofuku restaurants!  Now only if I could get a reservation at Ko next time...
