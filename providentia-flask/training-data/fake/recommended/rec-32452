Don't be fooled by the name.  This is a great restaurant located in Old Wethersfield. Housed in one of the town's Early American homes. Quite a pleasant surprise and very affordable !   Stopped in for some appetizers and drinks with friends. Ordered a plate of nachos and some dirty wings. Both were better than I've ever had.  Waitress was perfect.  We had a great experience. Will certainly be back.
