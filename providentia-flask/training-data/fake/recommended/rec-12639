We have this tradition with my friend to come here once a year for the pancakes and bacon in February. Its a very long wait, but we always felt it was absolutely worth it for the annual fix of indulgent, good food. Well this year the unfriendly, snarky attitude of the hostess absolutely ruined the otherwise perfectly wonderful day off. Will have to find another place next year. The food is good - but not worth the 2 hour wait plus attitude.
