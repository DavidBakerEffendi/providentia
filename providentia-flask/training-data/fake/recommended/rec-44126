Fogo De Chao is, to put it bluntly, a meat orgy. In your mouth. I've been here twice, and both times I tried to come up with a magical strategy that would allow me to somehow continue to eat more. Both times I failed miserably, and had to be rolled out in a cart (figuratively speaking) and languish in a meat-coma for hours afterwords. Oh yeah, the salad bar is pretty good too.
