Small joint, limited seating. You have to stand in line, in the middle of the place in order to sit. Weird and crowded as people try to get to the single bathroom. After sitting, you have a quick decision as they only have a few choices. Tasty burger but nothing spectacular. Although busy, they didn't kick us out when we were finished which is always a plus.
