Super dim lighting makes this place a no-no for the insta-loving diner, such as myself, but it does create a rustic romance feel. The staff was super friendly and very attentive. I came here with two friends for dinner.  We ordered the mac and cheese and two of the meatloaf sandwiches that have been the star of almost every other review.  I actually was not a huge fan of the meatloaf.  It was plated so pretty too, but there was some sort of sauce or pickle on the loaf and it had an almost sour/pickled taste.  (This was also my first time ever having meatloaf so maybe that is what it just tastes like?).  On top of the loaf was a heaping pile of onion rings that were super yummy.  I really wish I got a picture of it, it was the prettiest meatloaf sandwich I ever saw.  I was actually the only one who didn't like it.  The bread was also super fresh. For dessert, we ordered the fresh doughnuts.  They came out piping hot (which I loved) and had a coating of powdered sugar on them.  They were amazing.  Not too sweet at all and the perfect end to a meal.
