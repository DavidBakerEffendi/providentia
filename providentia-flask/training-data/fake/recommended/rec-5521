I don't know what changes have occurred at the Bayonne diner, but if you value your taste buds, PLEASE stay away. Upon entering, you'll notice that several of the booths are in disrepair. The one that we were seated at, if you laid a pen flat on the table, it would roll off on it's own into the isle. For breakfast, I ordered OJ and my friend ordered Coffee. The OJ is watered down, and somewhat sketchy as they server it to you in your own non-labeled container. The coffee? Forget it. It tasted watered down and like it was filtered through someone's sock. The meal. Wow. The food was bland tasting, and my friend's waffle wasn't completely cooked through (still gooey in the center). Mind you, we were there at 7 in the morning. There is no excuse. This, sadly, was not an isolated incident. We've both been there multiple times for breakfast and each and every time received the same low quality food. BEWARE!
