Bobbys Burgers is a great addition to the University City area scene for a good lunch or dinner. Their servers are always kind and enthusiastic. While it is a little pricey, the food is always delicious. May want to avoid it when it is super crowded though, because it can take a while for your food when it's packed. I usually like to go with the Buffalo burger w/ provolone. One good tip: always order your burger a little more well done than you would like it... their scale seems to lean a little on the rare side.
