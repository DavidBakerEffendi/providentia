Cafe Orlin is one of the best brunch places in New York, and certainly in the Top 3 in the East Village. It's not an easy seat to get on weekends, especially on a sunny day when you want to sit outside, but the food is worth the in-door seating. Nothing in the East Village really compares. One of the best items on the breakfast/brunch menu is their Eggs Blackstone, which is eggs, bacon, rye toast and salad, topped with stewed and roasted tomatoes. There is something really Middle Eastern and savory you can't not love. And for under $12, you also get a swallow of orange juice (4 oz.) and your choice of an Americano, Latte or Cappuccino. What makes the food at Cafe Orlin so good is that it takes your typical Eggs Benedict or even pancakes, and infuses it with succulent and creative Mediterranean flourishes. Pancakes, for instance, get pumpkin infused in the batter, and topped with cinnamon yogurt. For the less adventurous, you can order two eggs any style, accompanied with home fries, rye toast and salad for $6, and add two Merguez sausage links for $4. For cheap eats with impressive flavors, there's nothing better than Cafe Orlin.
