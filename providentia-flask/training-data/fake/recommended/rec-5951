Great atmosphere (although the seating is a bit crowded), service was fantastic (waiter carrying drinks on his head was pretty cool).  I didn't think it was really that authentic, but maybe that's because I'm more used to Tex-Mex.  My mojito wasn't as good as the one I had a Cuba Libre, but still pretty good.  The fish stuffed with guacamole in mango sauce was GREAT!  My friends also loved their steaks.  We got taquitos with grasshoppers inside - interesting, very crunchy, not a lot of taste in the grasshoppers but there was a lot of garlicky guacamole to add some taste to the dish.  Overall a place worth visiting, especially if you can sit outside on a nice day.
