A perfect Korean hot spot for lunch, a snack, or an extremely affordable quickie dinner.   I always feel rushed when I enter because when you browse the row of containers, you are in the walkway, and if you're not in the walkway, you are on the line to pay, which is directly parallel.  Very crowded, very fast, but it kind of makes it fun, just grab and go! Each container's price varies but I'm pretty sure you won't ever go over $10. I'd say if you are going to spend over $10.00 here, go eat at one of the other surrounding restaurants. I bought some jap chae, potato croquettes, a vitamin water and 2 rainbow rice cakes and it cost me about $8.  It would have been cheaper but I'm a sucker for cute desert-y things. I stay away from the open food bar (and all open food bars in general), so I'm no help in that area!
