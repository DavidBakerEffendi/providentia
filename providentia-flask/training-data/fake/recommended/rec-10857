As you can tell by the other reviews, this place is really a disaster: Â miserable service, over-priced food, incompetent service. Our steamed dishes came out room temperature as if they'd been sitting around for 20 minutes which they probably were. The shrimp were ridiculously over-cooked. I'm embarrassed to say how much we payed for a steam basket. Sad, given that the concept seems to have so much potential. But this place is a failure on every level.
