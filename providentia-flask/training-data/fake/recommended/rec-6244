I've been meaning to try out Redhead forrrreeeever and finally went there this past week. I really liked the ambiance- it's cozy and comfortable and has a neighborhood feel. The cocktails were also pretty good- I got the ginger snap and my boyfriend got the gotham. I made fun of him for having a girl glass, but was put in my place when I tasted his drink and realized it was better (stronger? to me that's the same thing) than mine. I hate it when that happens. But...that is neither here nor there. The food was also really good...with the exception of the bacon peanut brittle. Maybe it's because I was expecting it to be, you know, bacon peanut brittle in bigger pieces, instead of in a small bowl that basically looked like peanuts with bacon mixed in. It was still good, but I wasn't that impressed and will probably never order it again. However, the burger was really, really delicious- the meat was super tender and cooked perfectly. The chips were also really tasty (although, when are they not?). We also got the flatbread with duck prosciutto and that was really good as well- a very balanced mix of cheese, mushrooms, onions, and a little prosciutto, I'm excited to go back and try out the other things on the menu :)
