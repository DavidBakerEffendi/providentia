This restaurant has amazing food and service. There were only a few things that made me really regret going here. One of them was the fact that all the employees were dressed upscale casual, except one which had cheetah print yoga paints and a rainbow colored crazy shirt and as a manager of a restaurant that didn't sit well with me. Another thing that really threw me off with that place, just take a look up and you will see at least an inch of dust caked on the ceiling fans.
