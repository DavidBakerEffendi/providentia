Chicken Provence is definitely the best spot of NYC if you are looking for tasty homemade food. The chicken is tender, juicy and 100% natural, the sides are to die for. The wonderful owners Ben & Sandrine make you feel instantly at home. I have tried almost everything on the menu : DELISH. Do not forget to try the desserts, they are out of this world ( my favorites : Tarte Tatin and the Carrot Cake). A must go place conveniently located in Murray Hill!!!
