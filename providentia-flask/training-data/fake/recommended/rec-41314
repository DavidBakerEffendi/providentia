This place is good, but I giggle every time I hear (or read) people raving about the white sauce. It's just mayonnaise! I asked one of the cooks what was in it, and he replied, "Mayonnaise." I proceeded to ask if there were spices in it, and he told me, "Just salt and pepper." Anyways, I'm not a huge fan of this "white sauce". I think other places often use yogurt-based, lighter sauces. But you serve it yourself, so just don't take too much at first. Same goes for the red, spicy sauce. The chicken platter has pretty big pieces of chicken, so I appreciate that. But the lamb is just ground lamb. So disappointing. [Kwik Meal has real pieces of lamb, so go there if you are a lamb person. They also have delicious falafel pitas. I am a Kwik Meal fan, if you couldn't tell] I'll give them that their portions are huge, so you definitely get more than your money's worth. Everything is ~$6.
