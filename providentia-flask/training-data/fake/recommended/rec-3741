Have I just fellated God? It's expensive but unpretentious. I suggest it for an anniversary date or bday...Rustic, romantic interior. Service was amazing (waiter was cute). Wine list is great. I ordered the beef carpaccio and the grilled sea bream with edamame, miso and shiitake mushrooms. The beef carpaccio was divine but I am a sucker for that dish no matter what and the sea bream was a perfect balance of sweet, salty, fatty--yet it was all filling and light.
