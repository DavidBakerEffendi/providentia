This gem in Williamsburg is well worth a visit. A group of four of us went to the Brooklyn Brewery for the tour and then looked around for a late lunch. Our son looked this place up on his phone. It was busy, quite small but they made a place for us. It is not licenced so take a bottle if you are so inclined. My wife had the Jambalaya which I reckon was the pick of the meals, very tasty and quite a good size (she could not finish it and they asked if she wanted a box to go). We sat at the from window which was nice to watch the passing parade on Berry Street...
