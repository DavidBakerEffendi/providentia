Went to Balthazar last week with friends and family. I loved it from the minute I walked in. The atmosphere was wonderful...it is a wide open space with columns and service stations with fresh crusty bread arranged, waiting to be served. It can be a bit loud so perfect for groups that like to talk and laugh! The service great...our waitress made some wonderful suggestions, was pleasant and knowledgeable. The food spectacular -Appetiezer - warm goat cheese and carmalized onion tort...spectacular! The main courses ordered - grilled chicken paillard, grilled brook trout salad, duck confit - all wonderful. The desserts exceptional - we tried the creme brulee and the Profiteroles - a perfect finish. The wine...lovely! I can't wait to go back! Note: lunch is a bit pricey....do not miss the experience...save and go to enjoy an afternoon in France!
