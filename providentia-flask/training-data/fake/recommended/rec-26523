My daughter and I had the weekday $8.99 buffet - This is Excellent value for money, as there are some 40 + items available. There were several tasty vegetarian choices, including garlic-chilli vegetables, okra, and many other yummy dishes. there was also 6 types of non veg items too, including chicken biryani, tandoori chicken, butter chicken, mutton and lamb. The dessert choices had fruit, paisan but my fave was Mysore pak. I felt $15 would have been an oK price. After I paid the bill and was in my car the waiter came out running and handed me a $20 bill that dropped out of my wallet - so the people are very honest too! I will certainly be back with my family...
