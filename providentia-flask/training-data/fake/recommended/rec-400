So these are the times you wish the Yelp stars can be categorized.  First time to Nai this week and it is a really fun place - great young crowd, super-nice/responsive/helpful wait staff, great assortment on the menu, and very decent prices for food and drink. 5 stars for all of that.  Lots of birthday dinners going on so certainly a fun place to come with a crowd.   My only disappointment came with the tapas itself....much of it simply average...definitely not bad...but just average.  Would have like to seen a bit more creatively & sophistication with the construction of each dish instead of layers simply being slapped together.  All the food came quickly so perhaps that was the trade-off.   Likely to return but my expectations have been adjusted.
