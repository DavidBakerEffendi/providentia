Perfect location downtown right next to Bushnell Park. Name is deceiving they have WAY more than fruit. Amazing quality fresh cooked lunch meals at a great price. I love the spring rolls with shrimp and peanut sauce, and the chicken and rice dish. The best part is the fruit salad. They have all different sizes and you can customize what fruit which they slice fresh to order...amazing. No mushy melon with skimpy strawberries here! Oh yeah, and they have Pho, need I say more? Fast and friendly, family owned, just consistent in everything they do. Only con is cash only, but I highly recommend walking over on your lunch break or grabbing a snack if you're a downtown resident.
