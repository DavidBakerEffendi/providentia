We ended up here after trying to eat at Takashi which was packed and we were told to wait one hour. Really?? An hour?? Whatever... Fortunately, I had done some research in the area and saw the reviews for this restaurant. Immediately after I walked through the door I knew I was in the right place. The place is like a small romantic cafe taken out of a movie in Paris. GREAT vibe, friendly people. We were immediately greeted by the staff and were given a great table. We wanted to order light, so my wife ordered 2 salads: one with foie gras and the duck salad with truffle oil. Both were great. I had the onion soup (ok, defnitely could be better), and then the meatball sliders which were incredible. We finished with the beignets which closed the evening right on. I will absolutely visit this place again. Thanks for an unpretentious evening with great food. Much needed in NYC
