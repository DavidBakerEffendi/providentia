One of my favorite brunch places in the city. Small, unprententious and the food is great and much more value for money than other places in the city (cough cough Jane). If you don't mind waiting 30-60 mins any given weekend, the penny egg sandwich with pesto will not disappoint. The baked goods are also worth a try (scones, cupcakes, red velvet cake). Salmon dish with poached eggs is my second favorite on the brunch menu.
