Room service is great! Food The food is very tasty and has great presentation.  I love their chicken pad thai and calamari!  I've gone here a few times with friends and they always love the food. There are also lunch specials if you come during lunch Drinks I have gotten a few drinks here - in addition to the normal drink selection they also have some drinks with Asian style - i.e. drinks with Asian fruits, Asian fusion drinks and Asian beers. One of my favorites has to be the lychee sangria!  And if you don't drink the Thai Iced Tea is also very tasty! Prices The prices for food are relatively cheap, and even cheaper if you go during lunch.  The prices for drinks are your typical NYC prices at about $10-$13 per drink. Service The service is great, the staff is very attentive - sometimes too attentive? Decor The decor and ambiance has a nice intimate feel, yet is trendy at the same time - I love the giant chandelier in the middle of the room. Wait Time They do take reservations here, however you need to have the entire party there before they seat you. Typically there is no wait during lunch and weekdays, however you will probably have to wait on a Friday/Saturday night.
