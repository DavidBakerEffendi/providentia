I first discovered Robataya a few years ago when they just opened. You almost feel like being in Japan! If you bring an out of town guest, it's best to sit by the robataya grill/bar area where you can watch the 2 chefs cooking and interact with the customers. It's great izakaya (Japanese pub) food with fresh ingredients. Slightly pricier than other izakaya around east village but the quality is better. You can select your market fresh food directly from the counter where you sit and the chef will cook it in front of your eyes! They also announce all your selections to the chef when you order and the whole house hears it. Kind of fun! The Kamameshi rice is the best, very comforting. I went there for lunch recently and it was nice and sparse. Their sky light makes the place look like a garden outdoors. Lunch deal is pretty good. They frequently post special promotions such as March $38 for 6 courses of Omakase meal from 6-7pm. That's a great deal! And of course happy hours.
