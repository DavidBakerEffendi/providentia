I'm generally not a big fan of ramen noodles but this place has continued to impressed me.  Most ramen noodles are too greasy for my taste.  Their miso and shoyu fall into that category (too greasy for my taste).  I have found a great liking for their Mayu Ramen.  The roasted leeks, garlic oil, red ginger, and bamboo shoots give it a cleaner taste that's hard to find in many places while retaining the deep pork broth.   I like their steamed dumpling for appetizers but my absolute favorite is Takoyaki.  I would describe it as a salty miniature octopus corn dog.  If you like octopus it's a must try!
