I wanted to love Easter brunch at Fare, but I wasn't impressed.  The menu sounded great, and the veggie omelet of the day (shitake, snap pea, and romano (??)) was just what I had in mind.  I ordered it with no cheese and egg whites (hey, I like to eat healthy).  They got the order correct, but it came out dripping in oil and undercooked.  When I say dripping in oil, I mean it had a shiny oily glaze all over, and I only tasted olive oil when biting into the egg.  Even worse, after a few bites I noticed a clear, runny goo inside... yep, uncooked egg white.  Not appetizing.  The mushrooms and snap peas were good, but I was about done with the omelet after that.   At 2pm there weren't too many patrons left, so I can't blame the poorly cooked omelet on an overwhelmed chef. Side were good - sweet potatoes, greens and tasty toast.  My parents' meals were satisfactory, but nothing to write home about. I'll probably give Fare another go for dinner sometime, but brunch was disappointing.
