Good legitimate coffee house with reasonable prices - a far cry better than Starbucks, at any rate (which isn't hard to accomplish when it comes to actual coffee, not fancy blended drinks). I actually went into this place for the first time for a college interview - the interviewer let me choose the location and I decided that Starbucks a) was overdone and b) had terrible coffee, and this place, from what my friends told me, would not be a bad option. Great comfortable chairs and I liked the atmosphere. I had a double espresso, no sugar or cream, and it came out just like actual coffee should: with a rich bitter taste. My interviewer had a latte - obviously I can't tell you how it tasted, but he enjoyed it and complimented me on my choice of venue. It was a great experience.
