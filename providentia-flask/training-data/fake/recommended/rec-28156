Came here for lunch one day during the work week. It's pretty easy to miss this place because I passed it twice and had to ask someone! So it's a pretty nice dive bar place with a few TV's to watch sports and it's got a nice selection of beers. I had the beef sliders which were real tasty and my guest had the chicken skewers which were very good. We ordered a basket of french fries which we liked. The service was pleasant. I can see myself coming here again if I'm around the Empire State building area of the city.
