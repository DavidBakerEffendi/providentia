I would love to come to this place every single day but I fear for my life everytime I park my car (I go at night). Tacos are awesome (Chicken, Bistec, and Al Pastor) but the one that was right on the money were their Tortas. I tried their fried chicken and steak torta and not only did I feel fat but I also was ready to go to heaven. Trust me, I would have died happy right then and there. My vegetarian friend loved their cheese quesadilla and burrito. The cheese was stringy and flavorful. I lived in Arizona for a good 3.5 years and been to Mexico a couple of times and this place is as authentic as it gets in Philly!
