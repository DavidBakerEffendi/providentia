This is by far one of my most favorite restaurants anywhere. A bit pricey but I don't care. My wife and I have tried several other Brazilian steakhouses and this is our favorite. We liked na'brasa but Fogo's seasoning is to die for. The drinks are a bit high as we paid almost $11 per drink so I think we will be skipping those. We have been here 3 times so far and can't wait to go back. Try to find Parking on the street or you'll pay $10 down at the corner.
