Love it here. Their strawberry and nutella crepe is wonderful but my all time favorite is the chicken, mozz, spinach and onion crepe. I always get the salad dressing on the side and dip the crepe into it. There is not much seating unless the weather is nice and then you can eat outside. But it is definitely worth the wait and it is high quality food. The only downfall of this place which has been said in other reviews, is that they only take cash =(
