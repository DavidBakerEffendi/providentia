I went here with a couple of friends for brunch on a Sunday. We got to the restaurant close to closing time, so we didn't have to wait for a table, but the kitchen was out of a couple dishes. I ordered the baked eggs, which were good. My friends ordered the huevos rancheros and French omelette. We tried each other's dishes and agreed that the baked eggs were the best. I think they could've been a bit better though. It was missing something -- maybe more seasoning. For dessert, we had baked apple crisp and a small cheeseboard. The baked apple crisp came with vanilla ice cream, and after eating a few spoonfuls, we noticed that the apples looked more like peaches. I think the server brought us the wrong dessert. It was pretty tasty though, so we didn't complain. I liked the cheeseboard. We got a generous portion of cheese for the price. The cheese was served with a jam, crusty bread, and a fruit sauce. I really liked the jam and bread. The fruit sauce was eh. It looked like soy sauce, and tasted a bit like molasses, which I am not a fan of. My friends also got some French press coffee, which they said was pretty good. They're coffee drinkers, so if they say a certain coffee's good, it most likely is. The servers were friendly, and our dishes came quickly. Everything was plated beautifully and the portions were good for the prices. Our drinks, dishes, and check were brought to us by different servers (I think one of our servers was from France!). My only complaints are that the servers forgot to bring us more water when we requested it, and it took a while for us to get our check, even though it wasn't that busy. Atmosphere-wise, the place was pretty nice and home-y. It's about a seven minute walk away from the closest subway stop. I want to comment on the bathroom now, but I didn't use it. I'll probably come here again.
