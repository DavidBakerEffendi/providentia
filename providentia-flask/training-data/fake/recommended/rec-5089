Wow. A Japanese food 'experience'. Great vibe. Service was excellent. Interesting food prepared right in front of you. Snapper was great. Crab was tasty, but not something I'd go for again. Shishito peppers kicked ass. For something decidedly different than your local sushi bar, go to Robataya. If you don't know your sake, drink beer---they'll recommend something great, but it can get pricey in a hurry.
