My favorite sunny breakfast nook right beside City Planter. Family-owned, great energy and GREAT people. They want you to sit in the best spot in the house, the window seat. Or outside, on a warm day. French/Lebanese fusion, and true European cafe! The Ananas Salad is amazing... (Arugula w/ Pineapple, Pesto Shrimp, Avocado, Green Beans, Mango, & Grilled Halloumi cheese, and Sweet Potato Fries!) and the Petit Steak (Steak & Potato Hash w/ Sunny Side-Up Eggs, Diced Apples & Mangoes, Truffle oil, Balsamic and Avocado.) Finish with a cup of coffee and get two Pistachio Macarons To-Go!
