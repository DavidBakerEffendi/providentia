So happy to have stumbled upon this cafe last week.  I enjoyed a cold-press coffee that was fantastic, as well as a beautiful and tasty salad -- arugula, avacado, grape tomatoes, goat cheese, pine nuts -- it truly hit the spot. Loved the french doors opening onto Newkirk.  Open breeze, inviting, and the greenery (they have a hanging wall-garden) makes one feel a bit removed from the bustle of nearby roads. Strongly encourage all in the neighborhood to check this place out!  You will not be disappointed.
