what an awesome little spot!! go on a cold winter night- feels like you've been transported to a cozy winter cabin far far away from the city. while the scene is enough to make the trip (their backyard is awesome year round- chiminea and s'mores out back on the cold nights!!) the food happens to be knock-your-socks-off good. listen really closely to what the server has to say about each dish- there's so much detail- you can really tell how much work and thought goes into each creation. straight up classy stuff served in a very homey, unassuming way. awesome wine list, too!
