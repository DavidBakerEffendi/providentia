So my first experience at green eggs located on Dickinson st.was not so great.. The food was good but the service was lousy n they have not so good attitudes.. The wait was ridiculous.. Don't think I will return anytime soon, unless they were to change their attitudes.                             Disappointed,                                           Gina C..
