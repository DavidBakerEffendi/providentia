I used to be an avid Momofuku lover. However, after awhile my meals there fell flat. Ippudo is currently my favorite noodle spot in the area but like every other review mentions: it is just too damn crowded! I was able to have dinner with a friend one night during the week with only a 10 minute wait and we went right when the doors opened (5:00). The noodles are delicious and you don't have to get all the add ons to have an yummy meal. Just get there early!!
