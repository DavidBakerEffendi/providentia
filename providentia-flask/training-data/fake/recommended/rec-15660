I came here with a client; after a long day of NYC walking, we came here for dinner.  The drinks were nice, service was decent.  However when my client asked for balsamic vinegar to go with the bread and olive oil, that took a while to come. Not something I expect from a $$$$ restaurant.  While everyone order pasta, I order the roast pork.  When the dishes arrived, the pasta dish was the size of appetizers, very very small.  My friend order the special with the truffles.  It was ok and she was left hungry.  Her 11 yr old son order two dishes and fished it all.  My pork was delicious but I was the only one with a decent size dish.  My husband had the squash ravioli, it was 4 pieces or ravioli! Never have a been to an Italian restaurant and left feeling still a bit hungry.   The ambiance was nice an relax and I believe connected to a hotel so has the perfect classy side of Gramercy Park.  The staff was polite but not super attentive and not keep to noticing the little things.  Certainly not worth the price as I left with not much to remember the meal for save for the company I was with.
