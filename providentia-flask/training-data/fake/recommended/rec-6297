Completely confused about the hubub here. This place was mediocre at best. C'mon folks, don't you have higher standards for Lebanese / Mediterranean? Maybe not, since Lebanese food is hard to come by in NYC... frankly I have had better from Whole Foods. Anyway, atmosphere downstairs was fine, but I guess if you are over age 29 and not super-hip nor super-hot (neither of which I am any longer) you get shuffled to the upstairs area, which is atmospherically snooze-ville. Although the acoustics are a bit better than downstairs, I imagine, given the lower ceiling. Pros: We were seated on time. The waitstaff was fine, if not the usual. It was our guys' first night but he did ok. Not sure if it was truly his first night though, or the old trick waitstaff uses to excuse a screw-up (ie: forgotten drinks, or unusually delayed entrees.) But, whatev. Cons: Our dinner was plain, well... just plain. Nothing was worse than the lamb sausage I must say. Somewhat like over-microwaved meatballs. Nil on flavor. I almost cannot recall anything else we had because of the 6 or so mezze we ordered, nothing stood out to me. I would not say avoid this place at all costs, but darn, there are a lot more atmospheric and tasty spots to hunker down at in Flatiron than ilili. PS - Points though for the restaurant name being a palindrome. But that's my only, and final, high-five to ilili.
