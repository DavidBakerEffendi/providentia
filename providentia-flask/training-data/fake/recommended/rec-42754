Where have you been all of my life???? I'm not a fan of chicken with breakfast food but this place has made me a believer. I had the biscuit French toast with a side of chicken and OMG I'm in love. They give you 4 ginormous pieces covered in strawberries and powdered sugar. The biscuit was soft and fluffy inside and ridiculously delicious. My friend swears by their mushroom smothered chicken and it looked delicious, but I wanted breakfast food...I was not disappointed. The only downside was that we were told the wait would be 30 minutes and it ended up being 90 but the food made up for it and it came out pretty quickly
