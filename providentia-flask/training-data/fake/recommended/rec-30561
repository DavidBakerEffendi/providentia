no, ippudo does not need another positive review - especially if that translates into a longer wait for my ramen!!! i (im)patiently waited for this restaurant to open...pacing in front of the doors wallpapered with NYC work certificates, stalking other blogs for opening dates.  and my gawd, it was worth the wait!!! the pork buns are little slivers of heaven nestled in a soft white bun.  the ramen broth as one reviewer described it is "melted pork fat goodness."  the bakaretsu tofu is a sweet rip on korean soondooboo jigae.   i have gone almost once a month since opening...and it has yet to disappoint.
