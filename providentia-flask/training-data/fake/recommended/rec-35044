Senorita's food is ok.  But I have been turned off by the staff's unfriendly attitude.  I used to order delivery a couple times a month or eat in with a friend.  Then prices went up and the delivery charge made it too expensive.  Someone else here described the staff as rigid about the menu and rules.  Once a person on the phone told me they would let me use my yelp coupon for a to-go order, but when I got there they refused to take it.  They were unyielding about this although I had been a regular customer who brought friends to their restaurant.  I don't feel like they care much about keeping their customers particularly.  They act like they don't recognize me, although I must have be in the restaurant thirty-five times.  They must have endless customers who like cheese a lot.  Now I go to a different Mexican place.  Like I said, the food is not bad.  The best thing about Senorita's are the chips and salsa, although the chips taste like they are fried in lard.
