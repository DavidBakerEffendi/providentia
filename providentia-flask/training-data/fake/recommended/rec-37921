Been here many times and its always good. Love the HUGE bowl of guacamole and free chips and salsa!  I'm a pig and can eat a lot. Typically at least 3-4 courses so i usually get the taco sampler or the enchiladas supreme with the chicken shrimp and bean...mmmm.   Love the atmosphere and the fact that it's always crowded, although the bathrooms down stairs are so awkward and hate the dim lighting. Haven't had the desserts here I believe, or I can't remember due to the drinks.  But i have gone to Capogiros across the street afterwards.. :)
