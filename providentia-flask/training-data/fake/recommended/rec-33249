I dined at Pinto this past Saturday night with my best friend.  We walked in around 8:30 and had to wait maybe 30 minutes if that.  The food was excellent.  I had the green curry with chicken which was spicy.  It had a really nice kick to it.  The flavors were amazing.  I also had a side of the bok choy and it was yummy as well.  My bestie had the pumpkin curry with shrimp and she loved it.  She ate the entire thing.  The portion size is extremely generous for the prices.  The restaurant itself is very small and you feel like you're dining with other guest but that's NYC for you.  It didn't bother us at all.  I would def return again.
