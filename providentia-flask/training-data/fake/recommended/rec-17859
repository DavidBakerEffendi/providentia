Amazing food, great service and atmosphere. My wife and oldest daughter had been telling me about this place, I finally was able to go in for breakfast. I think that they have Juan Valdez in the kitchen, I haven't had such a great cup of coffee in a long time! The portions are generous and the food delicious, oh and it's not pricey at all. I will definitely be coming back on a regular basis, not just my wife and daughters.
