I've given this place a few chances. I think they've come under new ownership lately, because nothing has been right for a year. My boyfriend got food poisoning there, they've brought me the wrong plate or beverage on occasion, and once when I was getting something to-go, they left it on the counter and forgot about me. Tonight was the last straw. We walk in before closing time, about 15 minutes, and the lady says with an attitude, "DO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS"? Um, yes, I do, ma'am, and I worked in restaurants for 15 years. If your open sign is on, you seat someone. I usually don't like to do that to people because I know how it feels, but her attitude. NEVER AGAIN will I eat there. And to top it all off, the food is subpar.
