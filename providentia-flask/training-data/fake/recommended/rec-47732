Try a handful of appetizers and sit at the bar. Bartenders are completely hit and miss, but the beer selection and sports viewing is decent. The Mac n cheese with pulled pork is just awful - don't do it. The wings are average, but you have to go with the blue cheese. If you're east coast you were going to anyways, but warning west coasters..... I think their ranch might be milk and dill weed.
