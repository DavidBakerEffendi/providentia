If you are a bum, you will want to park up in Chinatown and if you can get your hands on a Dollar, you can buy 4 pan fried pork and chive dumplings for a dollar.  Apparently it used to be 5 for a dollar and some people are putting up a stink but for the value, this is where it's at! As I ordered I was amazed that almost every item on the menu is less than $3.  An order of boiled vegetable dumplings....$2.   Peking Duck sesame bun......$2 I didn't understand how they could charge so cheap but then within 5-10 mins I was there they had over 15 people ordering with their heavy volume.  This place is small so it's best to order and eat on the go.   A must visit if you are in Chinatown!
