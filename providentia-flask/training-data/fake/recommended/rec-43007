I have been going to EO for the last 5 years. I have tried countless other bars but EO is special, a place I return to quite often. I live close by so may be it is a habit, but the place is always amazing. The decor and the way the place is laid out, makes for a fun night every time. One of the great things about this place are the bar tenders. These are true professionals and their cocktails are always among the best. I guess the fact that this place is owned by a group of former bar tenders shows.   Also the bouncers only let in the people who belong there. They are always courteous unlike other places and keep a vigilant eye on what is going on in the bar. You tend to become friends with them. I  always try to drop by just to have a chat with KC Smith who happens to be lead bouncer there and a major reason for this bar's continued success.
