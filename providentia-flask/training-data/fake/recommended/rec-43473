A sprig of parsley goes a long way.... My husband surprised me with a breakfast date at the Fountains for our anniversary this morning. While the food was delicious the presentation was severely lacking. I ordered an omelet and that's all I received. Not a piece of parsley or an orange slice to compliment the plate. We were surprised to find that this is the way they serve breakfast. Very disappointing, I was expecting more. Truly, I don't serve a plate of food at home without making the plate look appetizing, I took a photo and showed the maitre d and he explained that that was the way breakfast was served, not what I expected from a 5 star restaurant.
