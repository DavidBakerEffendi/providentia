The wine choices here are mid-range, and very good. The food is excellent, tasty, and not too heavy. I had a mushroom-based risotto, which was very flavorful as well as inexpensive. The desserts are amazing, and i would suggest leaving room for them. Or split one with a friend, the helping size for dessert is ample. A dinner here may cost you $30 per person before wine, but it is well worth it. Take a cab, however, because it is a several long blocks from any subway. Make reservations in advance. The ambiance here is very nice as well. The only drawback was the first-date couple that was sitting next to us. Apparently they both had too much wine, and chose to become the entertainment for the night. Luckily, by the time they found it prudent to start making out at their table, we had finished our food and were ready to bust out. This entertainment does not affect the star rating of this joint.
