This is the sicilian pizza I grew up on, it's the standard that I measure every piece of square pizza I eat. None of them ever compares. The San Marzano tomatoes, the Grande mozzarella, the fluffy crust and the saltiness of the sharp pecorino romano cheese or unparalleled in anything I have ever had. I have tried to make it at home and gotten 90% of the way there. Put it's a hard recipe to reproduce. But now living in Alabama it's as close as I will ever get!
