I had heard of the Halal Guys a lot, and I was excited to stop by them on my way home from doing some shopping (on a sunday around noon). There was a line as always, so I waiting for about 10min before getting served. I got the mix chicken and gyro on rice. The service was good. I got my food all packed up in a bag ready to go. The food was alright. It didn't blow my mind, and the amount of "white sauce" (mayo +??) is pretty terrifying. It's also pretty heavy, so I was only able to eat half of my plate before saving the rest for later. I am not sure why everyone is so excited about this particular food cart. Not bad but nothing exceptional.
