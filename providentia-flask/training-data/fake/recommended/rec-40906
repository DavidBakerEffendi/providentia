Friendly staff and great food. This place is new, impressive but very raw. Because I want to see it grow, I'll add my honest opinion. The selection of drinks is great but small, soda, tea or water. On the weekends there is Mexican hot chocolate, yet as a commuter, I need something interesting every weekday as well. My omelette was a bit runny and Needless to say it didn't get finished. However, the customer service blew me away. Five stars for conversation, attention and kindness.
