This place was a total disappointment. A friend and I were really excited to check it out this past weekend after reading all of the good reviews and foobooz coverage. Aside from it being BYOB and the friendly waitress and manager, I really don't have many positive things to say. Â When we arrived there was a wait, which was no biggie since it was Saturday night and we had no problem having a beer at Prohibition while we waited for a table. Our server was really nice and explained the menu items thoroughly. We decided to go with the Margherita to share, and a slice of Gorgonzola each. Then things went downhill. When our food arrived it was cold. The dough for the individual slices resembled Ellio's and even though the Marg had nice flavor it was pretty small for the price ($12). We tried to deal with the cold food, but decided to ask them to heat up the gorgonzola slices, since cold gorgonzola pizza is pretty gross. When the pizza returned a few minutes later it was visibly burnt (like blackened) and tasted much worse than before. The server clearly felt bad and the manager came over to apologize and let us know that she would take them off the bill, even offering to make us something else. By then the damage was done and we weren't feeling it anymore so we just paid for the Margherita finished our wine and left. With so many other great pizza options in Philadelphia (Zavino, Osteria, Pizza Brain, Luigi's in Fairmount...the list goes on) I hope that Bufad steps up their game. It's proximity to Prohibition and BYOB status won't be able to carry it as-is, sadly.
