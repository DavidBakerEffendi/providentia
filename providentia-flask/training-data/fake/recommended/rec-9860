Pates Et Traditions is a small, cozy French restaurant in the heart of Williamsburg that will make you feel like you're on the other side of the Atlantic. I came here in search for a good crepe on a Sunday afternoon and boy did I find it! Ordered the Sultan, which was bursting with all sorts of flavor, and left full and very satisfied. There isn't much else to say; if you're looking for a good crepe, you'll surely find one here.
