I was looking for a place to throw my fiancee's 30th birthday and a friend recommended ocabanon. I am really grateful to my friend as it turned out to be a home run. Everything was spot on - the food is delicious, they have a wide selections of wines and the service was great. We were a party of more than twenty and everybody had a great time and really enjoyed the food. We had the mezzanine for ourselves and we almost feel like we were at home. It is sometimes a bit daunting to organize parties for large group in the city as owners sometimes give you the attitude. Here it was just the opposite - everything was hassle free. The space is very warm and cozy, so be it a romantic dinner or a large group party, ocabanon is the perfect place. The owners have a good concept and a nice story to tell as well...Two of them have worked in three stars restaurants like Daniel and Le Bernardin, so you can rest asured those guys don't fool around with French cuisine! Thanks ocabanon for we all had a blast and my fiancee will cherish the memories of her big 3.0 party.
