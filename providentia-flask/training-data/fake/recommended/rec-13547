I'll start this off by saying that I've eaten here once before, on a Monday afternoon with a friend, and I had ordered one of the specials that day: a vanilla waffle with fresh raspberry syrup. It was awesome! HOWEVER: I live in the neighborhood, and this review is about my experience today. Saturday, right at 6 p.m. on the nose, my boyfriend and I cruised over. Right away, we were seated, as they had just opened up for dinner services. We had both wanted a beer and burger, which isn't high maintenance AT ALL. So we ordered from our server, and were promptly brought some of their delicious house made biscuits. Stellar. Next, our burgers were brought out; we had near identical orders, save from how we wanted the burgers cooked: medium well for myself, and medium rare for him. Upon first glance, they looked great when brought to the table. After biting into mine, i realized that it was COMPLETELY overcooked. Charred. Burnt to a nasty crisp. The outside was hard, while the inside was fine. My bf's was just as burnt, but not quite as badly as mine. Meanwhile, I had thought that I might be able to say something to our server....not a chance. She was across the cafe, loudly chatting with some co-workers. The biggest snag here? She did not come by our table ONCE after we had ordered. Friendly eye contact was made, and we thought she would. I would've understood this, had it been busy, but there were 3 other occupied tables in the restaurant. Completely unacceptable to not even inquire as to how our meal was, not to mention, we had managed to finish our (over priced) beers, and had not been asked if we wanted another. By the time we got the 44 dollar bill, I was BEYOND upset. We were so underwhelmed and pissed off that our server didn't seem to give a shit about us. THANKS. I guess when you're that over hyped, not everyone counts? NEGATIVE STARS for the burgers and shitty service. What the fuck Clinton Street Bakery. :(
