Hu is a great place to catch a fresh meal, especially if you are going grain free. We had the roast chicken, butternut squash with coconut sauce and some braised greens. The chia seed pudding rocks. Love the bar up front and the casual log seating was fun and our kids loved the novelty of it. Â We met by brother and his girlfriend here for lunch and she told me she has since been several times and really likes it. The staff is also super friendly and helpful. Love it!
