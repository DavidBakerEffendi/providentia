Tasty. Quick service. Not glamorous. Cash only. I've been here a number of times. Ramen - not the typical Japanese ramen. It's hand pulled so chewier. Knife-peeled wide noodles - my favorite type. Cucumber appetizer - very refreshing and goes well with the noodle soups. I'd recommend duck ramen or duck wide noodles, though other items are also very good.
