I first tried Max Brenner's 2nd Ave location in New York. I was falling all over myself in greedy girl giddiness, was overtaken by a sever food coma, and forgot to review it. I prefer the NYC location better than this one, but clearly I still enjoyed it. Went with a group of about 12 for a friends birthday, and tried a bit over everything. The food is solid - not amazing, not disappointing. If you can't decide, just get a salad so you don't feel guilty after you cram your face with chocolate. And if you're not going to cram your face with chocolate, why are you here? The dessert selection is a bit overwhelming (in the best way) if you're a chocolate lover. It gets it's own little book, which is more extensive than the food menu. Tried some of everyone's deserts, and they were all excellent. I'm a fan of the chocolate and carmel combos like the "sticky caramel chocolate concoction". The cake & shake and s'mores are great too. If you like chocolate, you really cannot go wrong here.
