By far my favorite brunch place ever! We got there early on Sunday morning at 9am and there was no wait for a table for two. Ordered their stuffed french toast and eggs benedict, which are the two most popular items according to our waitress. Since we weren't from Philadelphia, she suggested that we try the eggs benedict with scrapple as opposed to the traditional bacon. FYI, scrapple is made of pork scraps, which we didn't know until after we ordered it. Despite this, the eggs benedict were the best I've ever had! Maybe I was extraordinarily hungry that morning, but the breakfast potatoes that came with the dish were excellent as well. Next time though I'm definitely getting it with bacon. As for the french toast, they give such a large portion that I couldn't finish it. The syrup was vanilla bean flavored and not too sweet, but the stuffing in the french toast got too rich in the end. This is definitely a dish to share! The cafe is very cute with indoor and outdoor seating. Service was also excellent - they automatically split each dish we ordered into two plates so that it was easier to share. Will definitely be back when I'm in the area.
