After eating here one time I was hooked. The local Chinese places which I was always a fan of paled in comparison to this delicious and spicy food. It hits your wallet a lot more than Chinese but their shrimp won-ton soup, spicy noodles with tofu (and complimentary fried banana won-ton dessert) are always top-notch. (I dare you to smear that packet of red spicy goodness on your food. I double dare you.)
