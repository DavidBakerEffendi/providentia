This place is SO delicious and not just for a place that's cheap. It's actually just straight up great. The line isn't that long and even if there were a line, it would definitely be worth the wait. Get the chicken over rice. :) I only had the white sauce (cuz I can't handle spicy) but apparently the red sauce is pretty awesome.
