Sweet little spot in midtown.  We were a big party (11), which can be hard to seat in Manhattan. ..more so in such a tiny spot, but they were very gracious.  About ten minutes after being seated the place became packed, so time your visit carefully.  We just ordered a variety of dishes....the lamb biryani was excellent.  Chicken Tikka Masala was also excellent.  Some dishes had a touch of sweeetness, but it was still delicious.   Huge samosas and there were two per order.  The naan was fresh and hot...we particularly liked the garlic naan.  The restaurant is byob, with no corkage fee...a huge bonus.  The best part, lunch for 11 for leas than $130.
