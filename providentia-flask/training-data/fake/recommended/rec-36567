I came here for lunch with my team at work and the food was great!  Everyone left the table very satisfied, especially myself.  I ordered the beef carpacio salad and while I could have used a little bit more food to fill me up, it was excellent nonetheless.  If your looking for good quality american dishes, I recommend this place. The decor is very cute! While the large floral arrangements by the bathroom was poking my coworker in head the entire meal, the ambiance is just what I like.  Not too loud, great space, large windows for natural light and brick walls.
