It's 3pm on a Sunday.  I'm trying to pretend my headache is from caffeine, but it's from too much beer last night.  My boyfriend is almost unable to move from lack of food.  We don't even have to say it, we already know.  It's Gusto time. We sit in front of the window and the waitress with blonde, curly hair (whose name it would be too awkward for me to ask by this point) is wearing an Eagles jersey or a Phillies shirt.  She only asks if we want curly fries (she already knows we both want chicken finger wraps, yum), and we usually do.  She gets my drink order mixed up with my roommate who comes here often as well and sort of looks like me.  She brings us cups of ice and straws for our sodas. We leave satisfied and much more alive than we were when we came in.   We don't stray from this pattern too often, but occasionally we order pizza.  It's good, but eat it all now; it doesn't reheat well.  The fries (curly and regular) and onion rings are probably the most reasonably-priced and always-good option in the area.
