I was having such a nice breakfast here today - with the sweetest server on the planet - when a guy who must have been the owner or manager walked in, sat at the bar, and started barking supplier orders into his cel phone.  So much for tranquility.  Restaurant workers, take note:  Customers don't want to hear you yelling "Five chickens!  One rib-eye!  Fifteen cutlets!" or whatever when they're trying to savor coffee and eggs.  Thank you.
