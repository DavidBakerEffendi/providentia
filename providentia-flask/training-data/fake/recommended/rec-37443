My favorite restaurant, hands down.  My friends and I like to go here as a group and order family style... and it's the way to go as there are so many things to order, so little stomach space.  Don't just get the pizza, their pastas and entrees are all amazing.  Love the breast of lamb.  I trust Roberta's to make anything delicious, so I order things on a whim and have never been let down, including weird stuff like Watercress gelati.  We leave feeling super full and I'm always shocked at how little my wallet suffers to pay for that feeling.  The only down side is the long wait, but I hardly notice as I plan for it and get drinks at their outdoor bar while we wait.  Plan 45min ahead!
