The first thing that comes to mind about this place is that it seems like a typical yet quintessential NYC restaurant. It's a small cozy cafe on a small cozy street that serves small, cozy delicious plates of food. The people on yelp who complained about lack of space here should probably leave NYC. Nobody comes to this town seeking lots of personal space; we are here for character and flavor. There was plenty of breathing room here, and I could not hear our neighbors' conversations (ie, I wasn't eavesdropping) because it was pretty darn noisy. I came here on a busy Thursday evening, luckily with a reservation, and was promptly seated. Actually, I had a res for 4 people, and only 2 of us showed up, but the host managed to hide his disapproval and immediately sat us. The waitress was lovely and gave some good meal/drink suggestions for our meal. I had an excellent grilled calamari appetizer, as well as some yogurt-covered ceviche. Both were ridiculously tasty and fresh. I also tried the hummus, which was perfectly creamy and flavorful. For an entree, I tried the grilled dorade. It was ok, it had plenty of lemon and rosemary, but still tasted bland. I prefer the salt-grilled dorade at Peasant. I wish I'd ordered the lamb kebab special, that looked pretty amazing. The wine list was concise and to the point, making choosing a bottle easy and readily gulped down. Get the vin de allobroges. It's good stuff.
