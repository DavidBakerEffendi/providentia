I've had several dinners here on both weekdays and weekends. The place seems to be pretty popular, but I was able to find a table for two people with no wait every time I visited. Deco: The interior of this restaurant is pretty interesting with a myriad of bowls and dishes on the wall. Food: They are not great, but not too bad either. Their duck dishes are pretty good. Don't get the Pad Thai; you will taste the ketchup instead of the authentic sweet Pad Thai sauce. Service: An okay service. The female server is very attentive and nice, but the male server is kind of zoning out every time I visit here. Overall: You'll get a decent food at an affordable price. Not highly recommended, but one visit won't ruin you either.
