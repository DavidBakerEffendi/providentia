Amazing place, small but damn good food. Had the Amish Fried Chicken which was a special when I went and it was awesome. My girl had the steak and that was so good as well. Server suggested an awesome beer to pair with my fried chicken (Korzo Organic Ale) and he was spot on. Good for a date, ambiance is well suited for that. Aside from the size of the place and the fact that the fried chicken isn't a regular on the menu, little to be picky about, since they're two blocks from me incan forgive them.
