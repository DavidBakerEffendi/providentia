A++ Great food and great service. Perilla really went out of their way to assure we had a great time for my mom's 50th birthday dinner. Roasted Heirloom Carrots and mushroom sides were great. Fish special was great. Modern and relaxed decor, and again - exceptional service! Can't wait to come back to Perilla!
