First time at a Japanese bbq, but was not impressed. Pricey for the quality and quantity of meat, but an interesting experience nonetheless. I'm rating it two stars because waiter had a lot to learn (you don't take away dishes with food still left in them without asking) and found a very long hair mixed in my noodle dish. Â I may give them another chance because the manager was helpful.
