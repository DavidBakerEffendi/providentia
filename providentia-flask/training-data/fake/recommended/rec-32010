I ordered the melanzane pizza. The only good thing I can say is that there was a generous portion of eggplant on my pizza. If you've never had a really good pizza, you're going to think this place is a treat. If you take pizza seriously and want fresh, flavorful ingredients, don't head here with expectations of that. If you are a connoisseur of pizza, you may be disappointed. The service is very good. They have indoor and outdoor seating with casual decor. They only have about 10 items on the menu; half are pizzas, the other half are antipasti.
