Go get a Bronte sandwich! Go get a Bluey sandwich! Heck . . go get any of the damn sandwiches that come with an inclusive side salad dressed with one of the best salad dressings I've ever tasted! Run . . Don't walk! Their sandwiches are fantastic. Juicy, flavorful & served on crusty & moist toasted ciabatta bread! This place is as small as a large closet but soooo worth it. I crave this place!
