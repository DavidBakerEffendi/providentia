Vegetarian ramen was divine. Savory broth, just the right amount of seasonal veggies and when you are 1/2 way done, if you have done more noodle munching than broth slurping for 2 bucks you can order extra noodles and they come in a jiffy. Our 4 and 9 year old kids were crazy about the chicken wings. The kids got a "kid's ramen"which is the noodles and broth (we ordered theirs w/ miso). I didn't see it on the menu but when I asked if they had a kid size portion our super accommodating and friendly waiter mentioned this. It's $7. Mine was $13. They even offered kid chopsticks (that make shift rubber band contraption that Japanese restaurants sometimes put together). Listen up...KALE SALAD! I don't even like kale and it was sooo good.... miso dressing, raisins, sweet potato chips and bits of fried kale. I never thought I would crave kale. I'm thinkin' it now. Cash only. They have an ATM in the restaurant but I never trust those ATMs that aren't at a bank. Just sayin'. Bring cash from a bank and enjoy. You will probably have to wait for a table but you can do that, right? Your mama taught you that patience is a virtue...or was that the rabbit from the Chocolate Nesquik ads?
