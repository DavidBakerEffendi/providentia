I hope that this midtown gem is not too hidden and will be able to continue provide this  level quality of service and food for many years to come. My wife and I had dinner here this Sunday. The place was not crowded but still felt warm and inviting. When my wife made the reservation online she had requested an intimate table. The hostess had set aside a quiet table in the back for us. The adjacent table was also empty and the manager, noting our request" asked if we would like to sit next to each other, essentially using up an extra table of theirs. Although we declined, his gesture was very kind. Overall the wait staff was helpful and friendly. We had the goat cheese  gnocchi to start which we both felt was not what we expect - their didn't seem to be a starch based gnocchi in the bowl. I think it would be better called "gnocchi" (goat cheese balls). None the less, very good. we shared the duck and halibut. The duck was made exactly how I like it - meaty like a filet Mignon with a very nice crispy crust. I also like duck paired with something tart which made me a big fan of the red cabbage and  huckleberry bed it was served on. The thick cut halibut was cooked to perfection, juicy and flaky. The creamy ?cauliflower puree it was served with was perfect for a cold winter night. We broke the rules and paired our meal with a merlot recommended by our waiter which was wonderful. Although a little steep at $14 a glass, his heavy handed pour was on overall value. The desserts all looked good, we chose the ricotta creme brulee. I can appreciate a more savory dessert and this hit the spot. For my sweet side it was served with a caramelized apple.   To cap the night and make the most of one of our first nights out since having a baby 4 months ago, we made our way to the roof top lounge and curled up on a nice warm couch with some soul warming drinks.
