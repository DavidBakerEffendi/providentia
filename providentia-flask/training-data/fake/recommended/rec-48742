When my friend and I walked in to Up Thai, we promptly did a double take, making sure that this beautiful and modern place was, in fact, the same place we had looked up online before. We couldn't believe that a place this nice could have food for only $12-14 per dish, but it was the right place, and we were seated. We glanced over the menu and noisily tried to divine what "mock duck" might be, and an older couple seated next to us raved about it. It's fake meat, but has the same texture of duck, so they told us, and they get it all of the time, even though they'e not vegetarians. I ended up getting the Moo Dang, a rice dish with roast pork, pork belly, and Chinese sausage. I'm more of a chicken guy generally, but it sounded good. My friend got fried rice with mock duck. The presentation on the food was solid, and it may not look like much food at first, but the portions are actually really generous. The sausage was crazy good, something I didn't expect. The pork and pork belly were also great. The mock duck was okay, but I'm really not a fan of faux meat. I definitely see what the older couple was saying about it having an authentic texture, though, so a great and unique choice if you don't eat meat. Service was great as well. If you frequent the UES, you have to try this place - they could easily charge double what they do now, but I hope they keep their prices the same!
