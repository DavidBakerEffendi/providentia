Went here on a Deal from a site (Gilt? Groupon?).  The place is in the middle of an industrial block, all furriers and flowers.   Very easy deal.  We each get one thing from the first column of the menu, and one thing from the second column, and then desert, plus a bottle of wine (of their choice). There was no A/C and the front was wide open.   We walked to the back rooms, but it was way too stuffy back there, so we set at the small tables in front of the bar.   The wine was fine, and the food was quite good.  We started with the special appetizer and the cacciatorini, and then had the filet mignon and the special entree.  The mains were very good. The portions are a bit on the small size as an average, but perfect for us, given we had appetizer, main and dessert.   Service was very prompt and courteous, and we could overhear the bartender taking with the bar patrons.  He had them laughing hard.   I would go back, if the A/C was working.
