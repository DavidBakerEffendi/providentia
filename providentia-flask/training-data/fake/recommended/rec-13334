patriciasuh.com/2012/03/â€¦ I celebrate every special occasion in my life here at Casa Mono. My staple orders are Patatas Bravas, Rabbit, and Mono Salad. They used to have fluke but I dont think they do anymore. make sure you make reservations before visiting there, in this tiny space it is hard to fit us all that wants a piece of this amazing tapas house.
