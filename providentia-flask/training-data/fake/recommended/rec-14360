Decided to turn a day of errands around City into Pizza Crawl. For each stop, a slice at a Pizza place I haven't tried before. First stop was Artichoke. Liked the pizza joint atmosphere, liked eating my slice on a bench facing 14th Street. Generous portion, a bit pricey but the margherita was a winner. I was worried about too much "grease" as a couple of reviews mentioned, but not an issue.
