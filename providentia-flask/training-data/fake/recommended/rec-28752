OMG this place is a God send! My daughter and I stumbled upon this place last night, we already had dinner plans but Â our curiosity made us take a look inside. Greeted by everyone and over the top friendly staff. A guy from VA recommended we try the spinach with Cauliflower puree, it was fantastic , kinda tasted like mash potatoes. I will be back tomorrow, this could get addicting.... and they have bathrooms Big ones too
