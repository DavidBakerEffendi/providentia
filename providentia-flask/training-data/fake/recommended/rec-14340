Oh happy hour. How I love thee. The drinks are ridic strong. No joke. My second drink was seriously pure gin with a few strawberries at the bottom. I wasn't a huge fan of that drink, but def get the margarita. It is amazing. I ended up getting the shwarma, which is really great. It is actually pretty filling for one happy hour serving. My friend ended up going with the meat dumplings, which were great. She let me have one and they burst open when you bite them with this nice soup like liquid. For my second app, I ended up going for the dessert menu because I wanted to try the ilili candy bar. DO IT. You can order off the regular menu at the happy hour seating, which is nice.
