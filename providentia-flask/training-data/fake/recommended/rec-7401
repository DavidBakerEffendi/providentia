I come here all the time for lunch.  This joint is tiny yet quaint.  The menu is simple and they have a few specials posted along the wall.  Totto's broth is light but yummy.  The pork is very tender and the texture of the ramen is just right (not too soft or hard).  Judging by how spicy you like, you can ask for the spicey sauce on the side and add as you wish.  Instead of sitting in the tables, enjoy your meal on the stools wrapping the open kitchen and you get to see how they prepare your ramen.
