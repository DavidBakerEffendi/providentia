Shady and Co. rolled into Rao's on a recent friday and had the pleasure of being alone at the bar for quite some time. Gave us a chance to chat up Nick the Vest for some good tales while enjoying a cocktail or three. Sure enough, the place filled up and it was time to bring on the food. You've read it all before, but here it goes: seafood salad, meatballs, pasta with veal ragu, pasta w/ suasage and cabbage, lemon chicken, a little veal parm and a tartufo to close the deal. Some say its standard fare, but i disagree. Everything was delish, the service is great and the scene and vibe cannot be beat. A great NYC evening. All in 450$ for 4 with 1 bottle..
