I went here for the first time last night and it was phenomenal. I love Vietnamese food and this was certainly some of the best. I ordered Crispy Spring Roll Vermicelli. Not only were the spring rolls amazing and not to heavy, the vermicelli was refreshing. My friend ordered their chicken curry which was some of the best curry I've ever sampled. We're coming back next week! I also fell in love with the decor. They have a beautiful burnout-velvet floor lantern in their waiting room that I HAVE to have. I've been trying to find something similar online ever since I saw it. Where did you guys purchase your decor???
