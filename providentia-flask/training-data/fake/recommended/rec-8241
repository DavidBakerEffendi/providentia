After driving from Westport, CT to Haddonfield, NJ and getting stuck in traffic, I wasn't sure I was up for a trip into the city for a fine dining experience.  How glad I am that I rallied and joined my friends on a Monday night at Osteria. We were lucky enough to be accompanied by a new friend, Rick, who had dined at Osteria before, and he expertly steered us through the menu.  We started with four plates of appetizers: the parma pizza, the summer vegetable crudo, the wood grilled octopus, and a local vegetable antipasto, which was one of the house specials of the evening.  I've had wood grilled octopus before, and Osteria's was very good, if not the best I've tasted.  However, the parma pizza - with mozzarella, fontina, arugula, and prosciutto di parma -  was out-of-this-world amazing!  Definitely order this up for a starter on your next visit.   I enjoyed the chanterelle and bone marrow ravioli with bitto cheese as my entree, and it was the perfect size after all the appetizer courses.  The pasta was exquisite - obviously made in house and simply ethereal - it just melted in my mouth.  I will remember this dish forever.  The restaurant also brought us a treat on the house - a beet ravioli dish that was a close second to my pasta dish.  Nice touch! Everyone else enjoyed their courses - ranging from cannelloni to salmon to roasted suckling pig (a special) - but alas, we did not leave room for a taste of dessert. One final shout-out to our server, who's name escapes me (sorry!), but he was a master of pairing wines with our courses.  Kudos! If I'm ever back in the area (I'm from Atlanta), I would definitely return for more from this inventive chef.
