Osteria is a solid choice, with excellent food in a pretty cool atmosphere. Definitely a 4.5, but it didn't wow me enough for a 5. Order a pizza! In 95% of restaurants, I would say this decision would be a bad idea...but not at Osteria. Their pizzas are crispy and fantastic, from the traditional margherita to the even more awesome parma, which is topped with 2 types of cheese, arugula, and plenty of slices of prosciutto. If you want another app, the antipasto was delicious as well. For dinner, I had chicken alla griglia with prosciutto and peas. Yes, more salty pork, and I loved every minute of it. Your typical high-quality, flawless Vetri dish. My friend got the veal breast, which also was cooked to perfection, flavorful, and presented well. CORN! One other thing I had to mention...I came here last fall and had a pasta (gnocchi) dish with corn. First, you should be ordering pasta if you come here anyways because it is homemade and some of the best in town. Â More importantly though, if corn is in season, get it here! This isn't just any corn, but the perfectly ripe, most flavorful type that is picked in the morning before the sun comes up, thus protecting the full taste sensation of grade A sweet corn (I kid you not!). Trust me, there is a difference...and apparently the Vetris understand this and pay the attention to ensure that only the best ingredients make it in their dishes. Aside from all of this, our waitresses had an attitude problem. Yeah, the place was hopping and really loud, but don't take it out on the nice table!
