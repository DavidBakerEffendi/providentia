I would defiantly say try to make a reservation from 6pm and on. It's a small space and It was nice and full. The food is prepared fresh. I sat directly across the kitchen so I enjoyed seeing the food get prepared. The dishes were very well flavored and neatly plated. I had the mozzarella appetizer - loved it. The bronzini was excellent as well. It's a small menu so I suggest checking the menu first to make sure there are dishes you enjoy. Wait to hear the specials before you order, they have quite a few options. The server was friendly and helpful, that always makes or breaks my restaurant experience. Glad they have such great service.
