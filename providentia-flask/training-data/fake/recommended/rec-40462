Best BBQ downtown hands down. Note this place is cafeteria style do you can go anytime and not have to worry about waiting more than 30 min for a seat. The BBQ was amazing without being too heavy (not sure how they did that), portions were generous and the beer options are great. Well be coming back here often to try more of the menu.
