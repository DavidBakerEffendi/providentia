I'm sure this place doesn't need my review, but what the heck.  Here goes... I was told by several people that I needed to choose between either Pat's or Geno's when visiting Philadelphia.  By sheer chance, I ended up going to Geno's.  After all the hype, I was really expecting an amazing cheese steak sandwich.  In actuality, I thought the sandwich was just alright.  I was good, don't get me wrong; but I was expecting a mindblowingly tasty experience of orgasmic proportions based on everything that was told to me.  The meat was kind of bland and dry and the overall sandwich was kind of flat.  Again, nothing special about it at all. Truth be told, I think I've had a better cheese steak sandwich in Denver of all places.  There's a place off of Broadway that I still remember as being pretty amazing to this day after having visited years ago.  But who knows, maybe I was just exceptionally hungry when I tried that place.
