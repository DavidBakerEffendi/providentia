This place has good food and a fun atmosphere.  The staff is fun with the pompous hosts and everybody else trying to speak as much Japanese as possible...entertaining. So the food was good but I was not blown away by any means.  Had the pork steamed buns which was interesting with ice burg lettuce and mayo to give it an American sandwich sort of twist.  Also had the Ramen which was solid.  Overall a fun experience, not sure if I would go back.
