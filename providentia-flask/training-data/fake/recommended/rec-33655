This is a great neighborhood restaurant that is also worth a trip if you want to check out beautiful Brooklyn Heights.  Though not huge, the menu has lots of great choices and the atmosphere is cozy and romantic.  I'm not much of a mixed-drinks person but everyone I know swears by the cocktail list.
