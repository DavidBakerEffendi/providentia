I wanted to try Peking Duck for the first time, so my sister and I opted to go to Sang Kee since it was closest. We decided to order Dan Dan noodles and the Peking Duck. We asked if they could make the noodles very spicy .  Our noodles arrived to the table first. The portion was large (I probably could have made 3 meals out of it myself). However, the lacked flavor and I didn't taste a hint of spice. If that was their version of spicy, then I don't want to know what the regular order would have tasted like. The Peking duck was very good. I had nothing to compare it to since this was my first time. The meat was tender, the skin was crisp. My sister told me that the pancakes it is served with a supposed to be a little thicker. I'm definitely not in a rush to go back here. I think the Dan Dan Noodles at Han Dynasty are MUCH more flavorful. As far as the Peking Duck goes...I'd be willing to try some restaurants in  Chinatown before returning to Sang Kee (if I return..)
