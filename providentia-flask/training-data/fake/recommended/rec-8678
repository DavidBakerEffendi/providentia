D'Italia is your standard Italian-American restaurant. They have one of those ridiculous menus that's so long and varied that no one item is spectacular but I've never had anything that wasn't good. The sandwiches come with "cajun" fries but they're just the frozen Ore-Ida waffle fries you get at the supermarket.. without cajun seasoning. Cajun fries aren't Italian and it's disappointing to receive plain frozen fries anyway when you're expecting something more flavorful and zesty. D'Italia is a decent lunch/dinner choice as long as you're not expecting an authentic Italian meal.
