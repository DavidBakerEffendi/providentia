If ya crave fat bacon cheese burgers with lettuce and tomato and a mug a beer for less than ten bucks and a crowd that's probably got twenty bucks between all of 'em, this is your place...I come in loaded late night to bark with the cranky, but authentic characters tending bar... You gotta work a little to make 'em laugh but when ya do ya got a friend for life and a real NYC moment...Cheers, you moody bastards!!! And If I had to deal with that crowd I'd be a helluva lot grumpier!!
