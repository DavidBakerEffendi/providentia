It's the go-to business lunch place near my work. It's a beautiful place with great windows for the natural light to seep through. First time I came on business, I had a fried softshell crab over a salad. Now, I'm by no means a salad person but this salad was particularly good. Who am I kidding here? I was super duper good! Fresh cherry tomatoes and clean fava beans with some peppery arugula. Man, it was just good. It was also a fresh palate cleansing contrast to a perfectly fried softshell crab. Second time around, my brother had the softshell crab sandwich after I raved about their crab and I ventured to the angus steak with grits. It's been weeks and my brother still freaks out (in a good way) about that softshell crab and the bread because it tasted like they baked it the day of just to pair with the crab. He was even crazy about the fries. Pretty much a mind blowing experience for him. What about my steak? It was a little on the dry tough side, that may be my fault because I accidentally blurted out medium well instead of medium rare. I always have brain fart moments at critical decision junctures. Phooey. I also wasn't a fan of the cheesy grits. I'm not a huge fan of grits, I'll tolerate it but whatever kind of cheese they put in their was just off putting. I don't know what it was but I don't want to judge the restaurant forever just with this one meal. It probably was my own off choice. All in all, pretty good - go get yoself some CRABS! (not the genital kind, the softshell kind) haha I know I just had to go there.
