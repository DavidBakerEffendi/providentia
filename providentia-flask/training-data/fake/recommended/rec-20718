I will not go back to this place when I'm in NYC. The U.S. is very customer service driven, and this restaurant is on the opposite side of the spectrum. Don't get me wrong, the food was great, but the service was absolutely terrible.  We were told the wait would be 30 mins, we sat ever so patiently waiting, 30 mins came and gone, and we were told another 30 mins. 30 mins later, we were told another 30 mins. And you now know the rest of the story. The entire wait time was 2 hours, I s*** you not.  We watched everyone get seated before us, I was so disappointed, to say the least. I will not come back for several reasons: 1) Underestimation of time, completely off the charts 2.) Service was slow Enough said!
