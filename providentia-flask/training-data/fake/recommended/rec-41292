Ippudo is one of my favorite Ramen spots and if it weren't for the 2-2.5 hour long waits I would go every week. Their broth is delicious, rich and flavorful and I like how you can get extra noodles so you don't waste any broth. Their pork buns are also amazing - super soft cloud-like bun, tasty and tender pork! Sometimes you can luck out if you go with a large party because they save the large tables that seat 6-8 for big groups. To avoid the long wait - go a bit before they open and you might have to wait for 30 minutes (the line already starts before they open) but that's better than 2 hours...
