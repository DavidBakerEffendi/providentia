I'm always down when it comes to good tasting noodle. And this place's been hyped quite a bit, especially with Guy Fieri (from Food Channel) having to eat there before. However, I was kinda disappointed with this place. I got the Beef Hand Pulled Noodle ($5.50). It's decently good, the broth's not bad, the beef's alright and the noodle's made pretty well. You also got 7 different kinds of noodle to choose from - thick, thin, wide, knife-cut, etc. I like putting the hot sauce in my broth, it gives it a little kick without destroying the broth's flavor much. Overall - It's a decently good place to go for noodles. The noodle's made pretty well, but the rest (beef and broth) are just ok. I do think it's a bit overhyped since I've had better noodles in the states. FYI - This place's pretty small, hot & cramped; They're too cheap to blast the AC... Also, get ready to bump into people while getting into your seats.
