AMAZING food!  Pretty ambiance (although you should really request to sit in the center where the real decor is...not the far back with only sheets covering the walls :/).  The waiters were nice, however I'm giving this a 4/5 because the service was kind of slow.  If you're looking for massive portions (i.e like at Carmines) this is not your venue (unless you're willing to spend $60+).  However, if you're looking for amazing food that just quenches your hunger, you're at the right place.  Ask for extra garlic paste ($2 additional) and add it to everything you eat to maximize the dish's flavor.  My fav's, Lightly Fried Kebbah and Phoenician Fries.  Bon apetite!!
