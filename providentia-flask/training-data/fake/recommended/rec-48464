I really wanted to love this place and maybe if it wasn't a cold rainy day and I wasn't starving, I would be giving it a higher review. What I expected was traditional chinese food. What I got was a lighter version of it...now don't get me wrong, the vegetables were super fresh but the sauces were almost watered down so that it wasn't the type of flavor you come to expect from chinese food. My friend ordered the General Tso's chicken which was a much lighter and less flavorful version of the original and I ordered the vegetables and tofu in a brown sauce which was also the same. I do admit that the food was super fresh and I got plenty of tofu with my meal and they were not skimpy about that. Overall, if you are craving a more "diet" version of chinese food, this may be the place for you, but as of now, it doesn't satisfy the traditional chinese food craving. Staff was super nice and the place is still very new, so who knows... things may improve.
