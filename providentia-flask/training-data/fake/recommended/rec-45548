I was just back from Israel when I ate here with my daughter and I have to say the food was as good as the best of what we ate there -- and that's very good indeed. The chocolate almond dessert was one of the best things I ever ate. The fried sheep's cheese with golden raisins was over the top; I only wish I could have eaten my fair share. The service was a little scattered. I think we were served by every server there at one point or another, but it was certainly brisk. I liked the close-packed tables -- we made friends with our neighbors -- but someone else might not appreciate the lovefest.
