After trying a number of sushi and Japanese restaurants, I was thrilled to find Momoya. I usually only order delivery from them, which is always super fast. The quality of the food is amazing, the rolls are always tasty and the fish is amazingly fresh. I've had a few of the tempura rolls, and they are always crispy and never over-done. They have a great lunch deal- 3 rolls for like 10 bucks with a salad and soup. Seriously, for the quality of their sushi, this is a total steal!
