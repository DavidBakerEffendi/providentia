Went there last night with the boyfriend around 7:30pm. We were told that it would be 20 minutes wait. The host took our phone number and gave us a coupon for $1 off from draft beer from a bar across the street - which I thought was a nice and neighborhood friendly touch. We and got fried green tomato sandwich which was surprisingly yummy and refreshing. There were only 4 options for ramen: pork broth, soy broth, miso broth and vegetarian broth. Each comes with either pork or chicken topping. I got miso ramen and the boyfriend got pork ramen. The soup were good - a bit too salty and greasy for my taste but the noodles were chewy and delicious. My ramen came with perfectly poached egg, some corn, scallion and a few slices of pork. I will definitely come back but probably not soon because $12 for a bowl of ramen is rather steep.
