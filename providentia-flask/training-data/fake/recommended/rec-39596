Went here with a girlfriend on a steamy friday night, $6 Mojitos and Caipirianhas (my bad for the spelling!) was too much to resist-they dont' water ANYTHING down, and its fantastic. We ordered a few tapas, nothing fancy, the empanadas were good, you get three big ones, split in half to share, really good except for the seafood (not really my taste i think?) Quesadillas were good as well.... we had three or four drinks each, all at happy hour prices (UNTIL 8PM!)  so  i don't remember what else we ordered, except for the guacamole which is probably the best in the world. Our food bill was definitely more than our drinks bill, but it evened out, well worth it!
