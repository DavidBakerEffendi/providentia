We went here for "Brunch" with friends and were not disappointed.  It had somewhat limited traditional brunch menu (ie fancy omlettes, french toast or frittatas..etc) but the items they did have were amazing in flavor.  Some examples of items were a Breakfast Pizza--eggs, panchetta, potatoes and onions; Salmon pizza - Salmon,capers, creme fresh; omlette  of the day; and fried eggs.  In addition to excellent food their cocktail option were delicious and diverse.  I had a parini  (Captain Morgan, pear liquor and nutmeg) and my friend had a bruini  (Uncle Val's gin, eldaflower, and limes )---both very tasty!  The service was great and gave us a lot of "inside tips" that promote us to come back (Kudos in regards to self promotion).  Parking on site, which is a blessing in that area.  An area entitled "Puppies and Pizza" where you can eat outside with you dog and another called "Bikes and Beer"...SO COOL AND INNOVATIVE!  I wish them a lot of success and hope to go back soon.
