I am ADDICTED to the drinks and sweets.  I frequent the take out/coffee side of the restaurant at least three times a week; probably more.  My favorite drink is their Iced Chai tea latte.   It's a little pricier than starbucks but the service is quick and friendly.  My baristas have been exceptionally helpful and have even, at times, let me sample items that I considered buying.   So far my favorite sweets from their menu include: #1 Oatmeal Raisin Cookie ($1.50, the texture is a little crunchy but in a good way) #2  Madellines (buttery goodness) #3  Chocolate Chip Cookie #4  Mango soufle tart thing #5  Key lime pie tart
