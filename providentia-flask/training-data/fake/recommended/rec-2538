I had to give this a try to see what the hype is all about.  I must say that philly cheesesteaks (even the chicken) are pretty yummy.  The placed was packed!  I didn't like how they had the picture of the officer (supposedly) killed by Mumia Abu-Jamal.   We didn't have time to go across the street to try Pat's.  Maybe next time I'm in the city of brotherly love.
