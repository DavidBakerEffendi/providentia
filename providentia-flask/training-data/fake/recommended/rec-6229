Came here twice. First time I loved it! Great appetizers and great margaritas! Second time I did not have the same experience. We got there between 4pm-5pm and they were on change over or something and we were rushed to order. The food came out seconds later not sure if it was fresh or refried. And you could taste the difference. Will try again because 3 times is a charm. But be weary of catching that change over time.
