This place is really great. We got three things (corn soup, beef chow fun, grilled steak and chicken) and everything was tasty and HUGE. Seriously, we got enough food for two meals at least. We'll definitely be regulars. I heard they don't do delivery though, which is a shame. Also keep in mind--$15 credit minimum. Everything is pretty cheap, so bring cash!
