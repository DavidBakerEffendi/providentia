I'm learning to love Lebanese food!  It's no wonder why the restaurant is named, "Tell  me!"  What more yummy dishes can I eat?  Everything is a visual joy to the eye.  More importantly, each tender morsel will melt in your mouth for your taste buds to savor.  Whether you try the duck, lamb porterhouse or scallops, they will be perfectly cooked to the point that you just want to indulge in all the flavors.  Don't forget to end on a sweet note with the cheesecake, complemented with the strong rum cake.   Service was helpful and friendly.  I loved the mint cucumber lemonade as a starter to quench my thirst.  The other cocktails seemed to please my friends too.  Our only wish was that the service could be faster.  Then again, some things are worth waiting for =D  Parking can be tough on the street, so feel free  to cab it to dine with some alcohol!
