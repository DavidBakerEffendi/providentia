What?!? Starbucks? Uhhhhh Starbucks can eat turds cause Black and Brew, or B&B, or BB, or BeeBee BooBoo is where I now go for my morning coffee. First off the service there is always great, regardless of who has served me there I always end up in a good mood cause happy people make me happy, but sweet sweet awesome coffee does too. The vanilla cappuccino is my regular staple but the Red Eye is pretty great too. If you are really in the mood for something ridonculous, yes ridonculous, try the peanut butter, chocolate, coffee, banana drink, it'll blow your pants off. The food here is amazing, especially considering how quickly they get it made for you. The breakfast burritos are pretty freaking sweet and a great way to start off my morning with delicious food but not having it either cook it myself or pay out the nose for it. You should probably not go eat there though cause that means my small neighborhood coffee shop would get too crowded.
