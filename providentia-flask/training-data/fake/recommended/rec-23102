really nice experience at 7:45 on a Friday night. Though we were only two, our request to sit at a larger table was accommodated; we knew we'd be sharing a lot of food and a  small 2 top would not have worked:) Sushi pizza is always good, so was a very fresh yellowtail ceviche  with nice soy and ginger notes. From a 2 page list of special rolls we chose the Monster roll (strange but appealing combo of banana tempura with spicy tuna and spicy sauce), Caldwell roll (several different fish in soybean paper, without any of the spicy tuna/salmon/other fish found in many of the rolls). Also managed an eel avocado roll and a few regular pieces of tuna and yellowtail sushi. Really enjoyed the chicken mango vegetable combination from the Kitchen fusion menu. All in all, nice service, tons of choices and good if not exceptional food.
