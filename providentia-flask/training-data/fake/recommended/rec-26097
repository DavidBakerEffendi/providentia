If this is what room service is supposed to taste like, I'd rather drown in a vat of rising bread dough. Okay, so maybe I'm exaggerating. Just a tad. The calamari was great. The thing with that is, you can't really eff up calamari. My life motto is, "If the calamari is bad, they have bigger problems, my friend." (It's not perfect, sue me. Shaddup.) Papaya salad? Yew oh boyle. That's the sound of my face when I crinkle my nose and frown. Bland. BAM. Boring. BAM. You know what, I'm just going to stick to Thai Terminal. Gah, I love that place.
