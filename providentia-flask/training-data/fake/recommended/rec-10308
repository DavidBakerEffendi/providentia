Being new to Glastonbury, our first meal was Foxy pizza...and it was a hit!  Over the past few months, we have tried nearly all other pizza places in town, but nothing compares.  We won't be making this mistake any more -- only Foxy pizza for us!  Now, I only have to decide which is better: buffalo chicken or meatball.  Hmm...
