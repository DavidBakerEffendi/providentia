Yelp led a colleague and I to this little Italian job. We had the excellent service that we expected from reading reviews and enjoyed the intimate atmosphere. We had fresh caprese salad and escarole soup to start. Both authentically prepared. This was followed by Veal Paesano made with roasted peppers, mozzarella in a mushroom sauce. My colleague had the Shrimp primavera. Great sized portions, excellent food and "homey" service and great value (BYOB)! Nuff said?
