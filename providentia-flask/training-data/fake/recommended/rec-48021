I went to PT with my family in town visiting and it was an all-out success. The ambiance - warm and inviting - was perfect on a cold November day. We had the calamari as an appetizer and it was great. My family always has calimari, and while it was not the best I've ever had, it was two thumbs up all around. The dinner choices included ravioli, Bronzini, lamb, pork shank (special), and penne with meat sauce. All were fantastic. Service was great, and we got a free creme brûlée AND four shots of sambuca. I live nearby and plan on frequenting the place for sure.
