this place is indeed vegan-friendly, thanks to the owners for explaining that. so far as I can tell, they still don't have it on the menu but they in fact have a vegan crust, vegan sausage, and vegan cheese. Your vegan friends won't go hungry here. I can't believe I said in the original review that their pizza is not to do for. It IS actually to die for -- I hadn't had their vodka sauce pizza yet when I wrote that review. (I'm not vegan, just have a lot of vegan friends). that pizza is INCREDIBLE. some of the best pizza i've had in the city anywhere. ever. at certain times, they get super crowded and their waitstaff seems a little overwhelmed. but i guess that's anywhere in ny. service is always friendly and helpful. i wish they had that chili-infused olive oil that some pizza places have. but they'll bring powdered chili if you ask for it.
