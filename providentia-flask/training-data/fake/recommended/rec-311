Food was amazing! ordered oxtail, beef empanadas, and so much more. We had a party of 5 and with at least 4 cocktails the bills was under $200. In addition to the flamenco show, this place is a gem! Celebrated my birthday and I would take a star away because they had all the people who were celebrating their birthdays there get up and dance but I had so much fun it didn't matter. Definitely go there but make a reservation. This place fills up quick and runs out of room on the nights they have the flamenco show.
