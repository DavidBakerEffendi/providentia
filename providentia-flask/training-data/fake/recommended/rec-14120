I'm obsessed with this place...it's right around the corner from my apartment and it just makes me so happy! As I write this I'm enjoying a bowl with 1/2 chicken, 1/2 pork.  The meats are smoky and just perfect.  I also love the unusual (well, unusual to me) toppings (radishes, pickled onions, crumbled cheese).  I think the portions are huge - I have a pretty big appetite and I always have enough for two meals out of one of these bowls (total price - $8.75).  I've also tried the chili and it's fab...very flavorful. One other thing I'd like to add is that the staff is absolutely wonderful.  They are incredibly friendly and clearly take pride in what they do.  This is something that's rare to find at a "fast" food place in NYC. One final note - I always go at off times apparently, I've never waited in line.  It's Saturday at noon and I was the only person ordering and there were probably 6 people sitting.  There is never a line at night either.   Can never eat Chipotle again!
