I love love this pizza place, I have been coming here since my childhood. My mom always used to bring us here as a special treat and the owners seem like part of our family. I love the customer service as well as their ham, pastrami, tuna, turkey and genoa salami grinders and their sausage pizza. It is great to have a restaurant that treats customers with such familiarity and also have good food. What a combination.
