My fourth time at restaurant and I again ordered the eggplant rollatine and veal saltimbico. Place was very crowded and the entree wasn't quite as good. The veal wasn't pounded thin, brown outside of carrots not shaved off. Was still good but not 4 star. Inconsistent quality driven by volume in restaurant. Also, I ordered cappucino because it was presented nicely to the diners across with the cup on a plate with some cookies. Mine-just a cup with nothing else. Desserts very expensive for what they are. Will go back if not crowded. Service was good.
