Today a group of four tried 3 different well renown cheesesteak places; Pat's, Geno's, and Jim's. This restaurant was rude and placed 3rd of the three that we tried. The cheesesteaks were smaller had a smaller selection to pick from. I would rather go across the street to Geno's (2nd) or better yet to Jim's (1st) and wait in the line. Take out type of place.
