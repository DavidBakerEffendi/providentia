I was initially more attracted to the Pig for its ambiance than for its "hipness," mainly because standing around like a dork and being elbowed by people while hoping to see someone famous is not my idea of a fun night. Been here three or four times, once for a slightly drunken late-night dinner with a friend and then twice for drinks upstairs with people. The dinner was really good though I ordered the hamburger and was not brave enough to try the entrail-style dishes they offer. I respect that they are serving true British dishes, though. Very crowded regardless of when I have been, though it seems to matter less after a few cocktails. And yes, we saw famous people. All said, I'm told this place was once much better as far as ambiance is concerned. Now it attracts a lot of tourists.
