I never thought the day would come where I would say that it's getting easy to find pizza shops that suck in the 5 boroughs. Last Sunday, that argument was put on hold.  All thanks to my brother from another mother, who was initially brought up on Pizza Hut and Domino's but quickly got more educated on vintage NYC pizza than anyone I know, I was sent back in time to my childhood circa 1980s NYC when good pizza shops were as plentiful as the hookers in Times Square.  Denino's Pizzeria was my Delorean last Sunday. If you ever wanna find out what pizza tasted like in Mayor Koch's NYC, go to Denino's.  Because in 1980s NYC, you didn't have to ask for extra cheese on your pizza to see the cheese get long and stringy enough to hold double-dutch battles.  And you'll see the magic of time travel at Denino's when that large pizza meets your palate..crispy and crunchy, yet thick enough to handle gobs of cheese and not go limp as you fold that pizza slice and send it on its way to your stomach.  I also had the garlic bread with cheese and I think you need to do the same!  They oughta run pizza shop clinics there, and be sure to compel all Jersey pizzeria owners to attend. Definitely worth crossing 2 bridges and seeing that "CALL EZ PASS - LOW BAL" light at the toll booths.
