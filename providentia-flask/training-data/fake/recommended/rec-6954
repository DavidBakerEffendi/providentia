Good food.  The tomato pie was new to me,  but great.  Very light crust. I would avoid the wings (very small) and the Calmari (frozen).  The BYOB policy surprised me at first,  but I really like now. Plenty of seating,  but the parking is limited. The staff is friendly and fast.  I would go again for sure.
