I've come here a few times in the past and had nothing but great experinces; we always had great food and good service. On my last visit I probably had one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant!   We ordered our drinks and food, I had ordered a quiche and a mocha latte and my wife had ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and a hot chocolate.  The waitress brought our cafe drinks to us shortly after, which were both luke warm. After twenty minutes of waiting, the waitress came over to tell me that they were out of bacon and asked if it was okay to have ham instead; my quiche didn't even have bacon in it, it had spinach and feta cheese.  Being that I was already done with my latte I also asked her for a shake. Another twenty minites had past without the waitess stopping at our table to let us know that they were busy and our food would be out shortly. My wife actually had to get up and ask the waitress what was the wait was. So, after our forty minute wait our food finally came out.   My quiche was horrible, its like they didn't even bother to mix the egg, thr bottom of my quiche was one big piece of hardened egg yolk.   Not only was the food bad, we had finished our cafe drinks probably twenty minutes prior to our food coming out and were never asked if we wanted something else to drink.  So we had to eat our food with no drinks, not even water. So much for that shake I ordered. My wife once again had to get up, just to ask the waitess for the bill and to put the shake, that was just being made, in a to go cup.  Then I had to wait over five minutes at the counter just to pay the bill. I was super annoyed when I left and it wasn't the fact that there was a long wait, or even the fact that the food was sub-par.  It was the fact that not once did the waitness apologize for the long wait and not once did the waitess notify us that the kitchen was backed up. After being treated so poorly, I can clearly say that I'm not coming back here.
