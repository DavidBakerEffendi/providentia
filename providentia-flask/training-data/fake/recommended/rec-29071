So I used my feminine tactics (which mostly include pouting) to get my spouse to take a drive over to this place pretty late on Saturday night, apparently the idea of delicious steaks was too much for either one of us to pass up, because we waited in a long... huge.. line. Although the line was long, it moved pretty quickly. We had tons to keep us busy while we waited, from that guy selling us oils and incense to that other dude selling "clear" copies of DVDs. The workers kept the line flowing and had excellent memories because the combinations of condiments people were shouting out, were remembered with no problem. The steaks in this place are kind of pricey. A 1/2 cheese steak is 7.45. I am used to normal "hood" prices, around 5 bucks or so. Nonetheless the steaks were really good. I got a cheese steak and my spouse got a chicken steak. Mine was delicious.... with the works! Salt, pepper, ketchup, mayo, fried onions, hots and sweets and pickles. When i bit into it, I realize what all the fuss was about. These steaks are REEAAAAALLLLLY good. My husband said, his chicken cheese steak was good but he prefers Pagano's. His chief complaint was that his meat was NOT seasoned. He doesn't like to rely on the condiments to season the meat, which is a viable complaint. Too bad for him, because mine was deeeeeelish! My only issue, was the fact that they kind of wrapped my steak so fast alot of the meat kind of fell out, and when i unwrapped it, some dropped on the floor. I suspect this was due to the speed factor of the workers. Also... they guy making the steaks, told several customers that he had a tip jar, despite there being a sign that said "Tipping is NOT Allowed". interestingly enough, that sign was obscured by a sheet of paper. LOL. we left a four dollar tip, because we were literally in and out.
