Super cheap and tasty dumplings. Do not go here if you are picky about atmosphere or ambiance, or expect good customer service because you are 4 dumplings for $1 and at that price you are paying for food and nothing else. For less than $5, you can feed and fill up 2 people which is amazing in the land of expensive Manhattan eateries. The dumplings are fresh because we saw the lady in the back courtyard preparing and individually wrapping each dumpling.
