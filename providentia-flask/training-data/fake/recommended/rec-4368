The drinks selection is quite good, but the food, not so much. Stopped by here a short while back to get my mid-afternoon fix, and it was decent, I guess. The lassi/drink selection is really quite good, and I don't think that I've seen such a wide swath of selections outside of Edison, NJ, here in the US. The lassis themselves are well balanced, taste good, and certainly not for those on diets! But they're really good. The chaats and food selections, not so much. The food is pretty standard stuff, but I really was not a fan of the naans, which is a shame. Further, the chaat items are really not that great - there's other places in the locale that're much better for the food fare. But, if you're going here just for the drinks, you're in the right place!
