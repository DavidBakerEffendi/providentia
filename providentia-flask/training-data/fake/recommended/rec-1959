Johnny Brenda's looks like a place for Yelpers. While waiting to mosey over to The M Room for my boyfriend's show, a group of us posted up at Johnny Brenda's for food and beer. I enjoyed a very potent diet soda and my boyfriend's sister-in-law and I split a fennel & pear salad and a falafel sandwich. Both were delightful. There could have been more of that tasty cheese and almond slivers on the salad, but it was good, anyway. The falafel sandwich was light, with cute little falafels that were still flavorful and present. Hooray. I like the general ambiance, the service was friendly and relaxed, I liked our table with the lights in it, and the coasters they are currently using where you stick your finger through a hole in it, so it looks like a fat guys pep√© (needs to be seen to be believed) was a big hit.
