I checked this place out pretty randomly due to a promotion by my credit card company for visiting Michelin-rated restaurants in the city. We had about a 40-minute wait, and killed most of it with a short walk around the block and some time at the bar. When we were finally seated, we were told that there was only one burger left - my friend ended up ordering it, but I find that disappointing, since we weren't there at a late hour at all. In the end, my friend said his burger was amazing, and the fries that come with it was fantastic as well. Shame that no one else that evening had a chance to try it, especially because it's supposed to be one of the best. I ordered the Gnudi, which was awesome! It's one of the best things I've had at any restaurant, albeit it was a little bit rich. The deviled eggs as an appetizer were great as well. I knocked the stars off because (1) their best dish had run out, (2) the service was uneven. I received my main course about 5 or 6 minutes after my friend, and (3) we were seated next to an obnoxious couple (though that wasn't necessarily the restaurant's fault, but it didn't help). If I could, I'd give 3.5 stars, but I think giving 4 would be too much, especially for the standards I think they should live up to.
