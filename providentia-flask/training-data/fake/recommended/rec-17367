Terrible, Terrible, Terrible... I tried several times to give this place the benefit of the doubt. So now it is my duty to give you fine people the benefit of the don't. I've patronized this establishment 6 times. The best time I went there was the time I payed $18 for a passable cheeseburger and had some NYC priced hooch. That was my best outcome. One time I was asked to leave because I was wearing a tank top and "not drinking enough". Another time I was overcharged and took 3 phone calls to rectify it. This last time which will be the very last time I patronize this establishment: *We arrived @ 10:45. The server came to us @ 11:03 and told us the kitchen was closed. A couple which arrived after us was served food @ 11:26. The second time we saw the server she told me to be patient that they had to buy the Hennessy I ordered from the restaurant next door. The next Â time we saw the server she spilt a full drink on me handed a towel and did not apolgize. She came back and then told me she gave a free upgrade on my cognac as a way to make-up for her error. Now that is just stank. What it really looks like is they were too lazy and cheap to buy the Hennessy from next door. I called the day after to talk to the manager and was told to "call in a week". A week later I called and was hung up on. I could understand if I was a shrill jerk on the phone but I was chill with both of the people I spoke with. Come on Guys, I gave this place a bunch of tries. On a busy night it's a bunch of loud townies watching sports and trying to score with excessive drinkers from Montclair State University. On a slow night its old townies blathering on about their travels, art galleries and shit. This establishment has no character other than hustling money from people who don't care about how they are treated by the staff or by the pretentious *ssholes they have to encounter there. DON'T GO. Other than that the woodwork is impressive and the bathrooms are generally clean.
