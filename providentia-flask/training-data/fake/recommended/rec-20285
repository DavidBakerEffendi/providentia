A friend and I were in recently. We shared a bacon appetizer we'd both have rather eaten all of. (Next time we'll order two.) Then we sampled other delicacies while our eyes rolled back in our heads. We did it all while tasting bourbon after delicious bourbon. The staff is lovely and the menu is just right, so really you can't go wrong. Go. Sit. Meditate (or is it marinate?) in the soothing, bourbon-soaked aura that is Char No. 4.
