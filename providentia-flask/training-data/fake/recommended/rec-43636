I'm afraid to post my rave review knowing that this tiny spot will soon become the most popular wine bar in the neighborhood! Great wine selection at a fair price (Pinot Noir from NZ is excellent, they're right!) and there's a wide selection to get a little taste of everything from veggies to cheese to meat. Menu is reminiscent of Turks and Frogs, but definitely have charted their own course. We chose the lamb, eggplant and quinoa falafel and it was all well done. Staff is incredibly attentive, and it's clear that they've really put their heart into the place. Ideal for a date, night out with friends, or even just a glass of wine after work. Amazing!
