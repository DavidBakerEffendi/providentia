I have been going to S&A since about 1996 and I've always gotten great service and EXCELLENT food. Their homefries are out of this world! It is a secret recipe that steve won't give up - no matter how many times i ask him!! It is a small place so you may have to wait a little bit but the service is friendly and quick. I would suggest the Chicken Salad Panini! On Sundays, they only serve breakfast so then i would suggest the pancakes with a side of homefries. They used to be open for dinner but unfortunately they stopped dinner service. However, they do open up for special occasions and their dinner is just as good as their lunch/breakfast.
