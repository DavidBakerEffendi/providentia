Being a jet setter means you have been just about everywhere and done just about everything. I have been lucky to have traveled alot over the last 20 years. If its the streets of Guadalajara or Beijing, you find street food vendors offering just about anything to eat. After years of travel I have found my absolute favorite street food. Whenever I'm in NYC I can be found at the halal food cart at 53rd & 6th enjoying a hot plate of lamb over spicy rice covered with an incredible white sauce. All I have to say to Niki is "lamb plate" and she is always game. This Egyptian dish is so amazing you will only understand what I am talking about by just tasting it for yourself. Take a cab, take a bus, take a subway. How ever you get there just get there and experience halal food bliss.
