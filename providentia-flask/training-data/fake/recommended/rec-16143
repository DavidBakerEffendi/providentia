A friend had recommended this place to me eons ago, and I thought it was quite filled with suits during my initial visit and kinda stuffy (but who am I to judge).  So, never a cynic, I decided to give it another chance...(because that's me, the giver of second chances, ha!) met up some friends after work and I must say, good times.   After reading the past reviews, I decided to shy away from the main dishes and we ordered some appetizers.  However, the drinks were by far the stars of the night.  If you're looking for a great after work spot (honestly this is a good anytime spot...date spot, after dinner spot, etc.) , and wouldn't mind having financy covo's with random strangers (not that I have conversations with random strangers or that anything is wrong with that, just sayin') then this is the spot for you.
