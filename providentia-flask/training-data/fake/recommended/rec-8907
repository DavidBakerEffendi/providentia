Whoa, what a pleasant surprise. My bf randomly found ilili on Yelp and quickly made a reservation on a Friday night. The ambiance was super chic and the service was superb. After shopping during Black Friday, we were a bit underdressed but didn't feel out of place at all due to the friendly wait staff. The place is also HUGE and have a ton of staff. On to the food. We were a bit confused as to how much to order but our waiter gave us his honest opinion on some of the dishes and we ended up sharing the baba ghannouj, kerez kebab (lamb and beef meatballs), Brussels sprouts, and the ribeye. I'm not a steak person and didn't expect much from it but it definitely wowed me. My bf even said it was better ribeye than some of the steakhouses he's been to. My favorite of all was the Brussels sprouts. We were stuffed so I was able to bring the leftovers to work the next day and re-live its delicious glory. I would come back for the sprouts alone. I would also skip on the hummus and baba ghannouj, unless you're dying to have it. Overall, I'd definitely recommend ilili for the ambiance, service, and food. It's also perfect for a date!
