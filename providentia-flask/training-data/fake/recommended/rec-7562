I heard great things about this place, but my dining experience was less than great.  My boyfriend and I were really disappointed with the steak.  It was dry and tasteless.  We both agreed that we had had better steak at Applebees for a third of the price.  But it didn't end there...We also got the macaroni and cheese and mashed potato sides which were so bland and boring, I didn't even want the leftovers.  For a place that prides themselves on their steaks, they sure didn't deliver.
