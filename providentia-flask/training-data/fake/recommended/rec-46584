Appetizer:  The artichoke dish was great; whatever marinade was used I'd like to use myself.  Over and over and over. Entree:  One of the best sole dishes I've ever had- crust was just thick enough and perfectly salty from the capers.  Super efficient kitchen here.  Service was friendly and prompt-- an absolutely excellent experience.
