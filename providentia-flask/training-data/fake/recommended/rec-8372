OMG the fried chicken! It was amazing. Fried pickles were delicious too, and this is coming from someone who doesn't really like pickles. The mac and cheese was a little salty. Hush puppies were yummy. Collard greens were meh. Got the pecan pie and the sour cherry pear pie for dessert. Both were DELICIOUS!
