For the first time in Philadelphia, I took and pole and went with the majority! Everyone was saying, "go to Sonny's if you want a cheesesteak!" So I did and Sonny's did not disappoint!! Had a beef steak with American AND Whiz and it melted like butter!!! So good, didn't even mind the whiz dripping from the samdwitch!! Do NOT forget to try the Bacon Cheez Fries!!
