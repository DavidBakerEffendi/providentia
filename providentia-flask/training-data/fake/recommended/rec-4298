I went for the first time yesterday, and got the lamb sausage combo with fries and a drink for lunch.  First and foremost, when I was waiting for my order I began to sincerely regret placing it.  The reason is the place is filthy, and if what you can see is dirty, imagine what the rest looks like. The fries were limp and oily- not crisp or crunchy on the outside at all, so they were disappointing.  The hot dog bun was just out of a bag, which was unappetizing.  And the sausage wasn't even warm.  Sausages have fat content, and cold fat is not delicious.   Won't go again.
