So I've been here a few times now and got different things each time. The environment is inviting, dim enough lighting that it's cozy, and I also enjoy how it is not overly loud. I love the margaritas here! I think they delicious and authentic. Granted they are a little pricey, but I'm ok with paying a high price for a good quality drink.   The food is also really good. Flavorful, decent sized portions, and filling. The guacomole is a little bit over over priced for the amount of food you really get, but I guess if your splitting it with a couple of people it's reasonable. On another note, anything but their southwest cuisine here is average.  My boyfriend and I ordered mac and cheese and a burger here once and we were highly disappointed.. so I suggest sticking to what they do best and are known for food wise. Other than that I enjoy dining at Geronimo ' s, and I will gladly come back to dine and drink when I am in the New Haven area.
