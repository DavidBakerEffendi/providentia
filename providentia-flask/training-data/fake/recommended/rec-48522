Happy hour 'till 7. We went and had $3 pints and $5 apps. Buff chick tenders looked ok, were huge, and with fries. Way more than five bucks worth. I had calamari which was cooked well, lightly breaded. But was bummed when they could only offer me mayo with lemon and dill (aioli), or mayo with relish (tartar) on the side. I had them without either because both were mayo heavy ratios, and warm. Nice place though and will go back again to try something else. The bread is good.
