If I could give this place 2 1/2 stars I would.  The place is cute and has a trendy slopey feel.  But the food is just adequate as is the service.  Specifically, the food is  bland and uninspired.  There were seven of us.  I don't think anyone was wowed.  Appetizers inclulded such things as a plate with a sliced avocado and some lime dressing.  The torillas were little greasy disks.  The local lettuce salad had some fresh corn; this was a nice touch, but didn't make the plate with a couple of lettuce leaves worth $9.  The best dish at our table seemed to be the pork chop,  served with fresh pinto beans and rice.  The rest of the entrees were very small and pretty unimpressive.  I ordered chicken soup for $17, expecting a large bowl of fresh chicken soup, maybe with some greens and with a lot of flavor.  Instead I got a small bowl filled with rice, some very boiled chicken and a few cilantro sprigs.  I would have called it rice with broth and a garnish of chicken.  We did have some good wine, though this too was over-priced.  We didn't bother with desert since nothing sounded very good and I think we knew the portions would be less than satisfying.   Take a pass.
