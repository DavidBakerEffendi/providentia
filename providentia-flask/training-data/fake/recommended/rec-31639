Visited on a beautiful Saturday night and sat outside to soak it all in. If you are in the mood for Sangria, do not forget to bring the wine. There are plenty of shops on the street in case you forget. We had the appetizer sampler. Overall the food was average. Nothing surprises you and it leaves your taste buds slightly in satisfied. The empanadas were not bad though. For desert we had the cheesecake and tres leches. Probably should try something else if you're visiting. The coffee was good though. Service was friendly but rather slow. This may be because we choose to sit outside but it definitely took a long time for us to get our coffee and pay. Overall, nice casual spot but we would probably not return.
