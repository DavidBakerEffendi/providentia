I guess I got caught up the hype.  The food was ok.  I had the yogurt/granola combo.  Super heavy on the raisins.  Barely enough yogurt to cover it all.  I felt like a horse chewing on barley.    Friend had the blueberry pancakes.  They were very good.  Service was so-so.  Decor was nicer than usual.  I felt like it was on Cape Cod. All in all, decent, but not at all the gastronomic extravaganza everyone promised.
