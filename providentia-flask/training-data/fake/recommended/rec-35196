Wonderful Saturday lunch! We were the only non-Japanese diners, which is always a good sign. We're no experts in ordering, but the waitress helped us pick out divine octopus starter, tuna sashimi and two noodle dishes. Everything was incredible. One note:wine choices are very limited, but their house white (and great tea) was sufficient for us.
