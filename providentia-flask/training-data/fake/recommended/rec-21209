One of my favorite bahn mi joints in the city. The spicy pork is ridiculously good, filled with juicy meat and topped with pickled carrots, cucumber sticks, a smear of mayo and a few springs of cilantro. The bread is crusty with a pillowy interior and has always tasted freshly baked. But for the squeamish people out there: this is a no frills hole in the wall and the meat can be a bit chewy and/or fatty. For those who need higher quality pork, pick a place where they'll charge you $15 a sandwich. Personally, I like my bahn mi meat with a bit of a street side quality.
