Best new addition in the neighborhood in a very long time. It's awesome and, aside from the obviously delicious food, the staff is so cool. This place really "gets" the East Village and the casual dining experience we enjoy. No stuffy servers. In fact, no servers at all. You get in line and order then choose your seat in the large space with great windows and a cool crowd. Price is where it should be for our 'hood and the food is quality. I will say that the ribs were on the dry side and one of the times I ordered the brisket it was dryer than I prefer BUT the pros outweigh the cons. I have had every menu item at least once and the pulled pork would be my favorite meat, the baked beans are my favorite side though the cole slaw and edamame salad with goat cheese is excellent too. HUGE welcome to this establishment in the East Village!!!
