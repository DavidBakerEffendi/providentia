This was my 2nd Cheese steak of my trip. There is a huge line you have to stand in but it moves quickly. Ordering is pretty simple and there are not many options so it's easy to get what you want. I got a Cheese steak with provolone and onions. The bread was good and onions tasty. The meat could have more flavor and be less soggy. I got the cheese fries and they were good too. There really isn't much room for sitting and eating, you might have to go sit on the cement wall across the street. Overall I liked it and I would go here again.
