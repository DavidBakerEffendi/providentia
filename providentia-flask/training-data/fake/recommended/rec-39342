I haven't even ordered pizza in quite some time, but I took my family to Modern recently and it was as good as it has ever been.  While I certainly love Pepes and Sally's, I have to say that Modern is my favorite pizza place in New Haven (and really anywhere).  The pizza is almost always perfectly prepared with fresh ingredients.  The staff is friendly, and you can't beat the old school vibe inside.  If you want classic New Haven style pizza, and want to avoid the crazy lines at Pepes and Sally's, then Modern is a can't miss.
