Finally, my favorite cuisine with a trendy ambience. It's very rare to find good Middle Eastern cuisine and a nice atmosphere. Their complimentary pita bread was light, fluffy, and fresh. I devoured my Fattoush (Lebanese Salad), it was light but had an adequate amount of flavor. My sister enjoyed the black iron shrimp and we both absolutely loved their Falafel. The dessert was exquisite, in fact we have decided that we need to go back multiple times until we try each one. We had ordered the Brioche Banana Bread Pudding, it was impeccable. I am the type of person who likes to try a bite or two, so it was sized perfectly. However, if you have a huge sweet tooth and appetite; I suggest ordering your own due to the fact that the serving size is on the smaller side. The reason I am giving ilili four stars instead of five is because in the pictures with dim lighting, the ambience seems more upscale than how it actually was in person. I also deducted one star because being Muslim, I wish it were halal since it is Middle Eastern cuisine. All in all, great experience though, I definitely plan on coming back again.
