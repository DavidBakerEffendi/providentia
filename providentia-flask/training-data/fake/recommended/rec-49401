Went in by myself last night for a late dinner and had a great meal. The warm fiddlehead fern and fingerling potato salad was lovely and creamy, though not the most well-presented. Came out looking like a messy glob of green. The marmite and honey baby back ribs were delicious and falling off the bone, but the accompanying broccoli was sad and overcooked and seemed like a badly thrown together combination. I loved the meat and the sauce but would've liked a little more care to have gone into the accompanying produce and flavors. Cara, the server was lovely and very friendly.
