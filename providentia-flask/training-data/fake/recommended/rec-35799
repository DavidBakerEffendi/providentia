I love being at the Hinge, i love the atompshere and i love how everyone who works there is always friendly.  Its not too expensive, I always eat there with one of my best friends and we usually go once a week, every month they change their menus which i think is creative. I know 2 people who currently work at the Hinge and one who is the Chef. My favorite dish i get there would have to be the Penne Vodka Pasta and the Chicken Paramaigna. I Lovee their Hot Chocolate and their Stawberry Lemonade. Their deserts are awesome as well including their Brownies and their Chocolate Cake.  I would reccomend anyone to try and eat there.
