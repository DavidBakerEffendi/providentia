Love, love, love this place and feel very fortunate to live very close, definitely my neighboorhood go-to place for a really nice dinner. Ingredients are always fresh, and the chefs are very creative without going overboard. Dec√≥r is so cozy, service attentive and friendly and prices very fair compared to other farm-to-table restos at this level. Always a great experience, make sure you get reservations!
