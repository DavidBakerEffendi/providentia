Decided to try this place as I was craving a hamburger ( well veggie burger), and followed others reviews and went to Tom's.   Great lively atmosphere, and everybody was friendly and very inviting.  Even though I placed a to-go order ( it was a great day out side and went to the park) the customer service is amazing. The food was great! I need to come back and try the breakfast menu next time.
