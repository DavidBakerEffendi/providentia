I *DO* love this place. And I'm reviewing mostly on the food. Top ramen and pork bun for sure. This is very authentic ramen and the broth is really savory! The pork belly is outright DELICIOUS and smoky tasting. I found the dark broth to be too salty and strong, but in the lighter broth, it's wonderful. However, the wait is a HUGE deterrent to making this a regular place. The space is large, and I know very popular, but I have never gone there where they didn't say there was an hour or more wait. Since they don't take reservations (unless you go in the middle of the day and they will then give you a reservation for 11pm), it makes it next to impossible to ever get a seat. And I'm not *that* much of a fan. I cannot tell you the number of times friends and I have wanted to go here and could not get a table. That's fine I guess, because it allows me to savor the many other excellent ramen, soba places nearby anywhere in the east village. So while I love their ramen, and it *is* worth eventually getting a reservation there early for late in the evening, it's not something you want to deal with when hungry. It's a beautiful place, but I wish they would make it a little easier to get a table. Maybe it makes them look highly sought after, but after this many years later, I am not as willing to play the game and more than happy to go to other places that are quieter and have just as tasty noodles. This is why it doesn't get 5 stars from me.
