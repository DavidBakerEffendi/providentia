I googled paleo foods in NYC and this restaurant popped up. So glad it did! I had the wild meatloaf and it was amazing. I also had a small side of their paleo Caesar salad... That too... Delicious! If you want good paleo friendly food come here. Just be prepared to pay NYC prices... My two smallish pieces of meatloaf and side salad came out to $15.xx Â still would go back and try new things.
