I moved to S.I. almost a year ago. And, I've still tried to visit various types of restaurants. Obviously, that's much harder than it was in Manhattan. Alas, Yelp certainly makes the process less arduous. So, when a friend from law school suggested we have lunch sometime, I wanted to try a German restuarant for the first time. Clint suggested Nurnberger Bierhaus and after looking at the Yelp reviews, I agreed to that choice. It's a quaint place with minimal frills, which is absolutey fine. The food itself was pretty good, athough I don't recall what I ordered. And, I tried a German beer, and it was nice. Overall, if you happen to be in S.I., NB is worth visiting for a German meal.
