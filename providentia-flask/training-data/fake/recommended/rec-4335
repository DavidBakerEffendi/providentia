First of all Frankford Hall is one of the great unsung public spaces in Philadelphia. Nestled in Fishtown at the corner of Girard and Frankford Ave, the huge courtyard with tables trees and music is a great place to hang with friends. The beer selection is great.. good German and american craft brews. The food has been up and down. This time I had an Illi's hot dog with a side of kraut along with a small Bavarian pretzel. I would have liked the hot dog to have a bit more char (even better if it had been split grilled) but it was quite tasty. The kraut was mild and had bits of carrot in it. Quite good considering I am not usually a kraut fan. All in all, this is a place to hang with friends, listen to music, play ping pong table tennis or cards. Philadelphia needs more of these kind of places. Thanks Stephen Starr.
