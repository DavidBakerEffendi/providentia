Loved the vibe and the employees. Every one of the employees was great, even the chef said What's Up as I passed by. Woah! The food was fine. I wouldn't order the same things as I did (pear salad, fried chicken, chicken liver tortellini), but I'd definitely come back, no problem. oh, here's my complaint: If you don't drink alcohol, the options are severely limited. Dude, sometimes I'm on the wagon!
