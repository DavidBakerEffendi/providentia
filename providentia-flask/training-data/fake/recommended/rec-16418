I had a birthday dinner at Public in 2004, they were very accommodating when we pushed back the reservation. The food was enjoyable and I went back another time with my parents, who also liked Public. I think my mother still has the hand soaps they used to have in the restroom. Fast forward to 2009, I hadn't been to Public in years. There were new restaurants to try in the area. I had been an admirer of their brunch menu for a while and finally took the plunge this weekend. I ordered the Turkish Eggs (delicious) and a side order of quinoa hash browns (divine). I tried the chorizo as well. Everything was excellent and the brunch prices were moderate. I will be going back before the summer is over. There are so many overrated brunch spots in the city, glad to know Public lives up to the hype.
