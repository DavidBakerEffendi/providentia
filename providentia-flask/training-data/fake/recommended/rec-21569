From the outside it looks like you might be able to buy drugs here, but it's a quaint spot with a very nice staff and Mexican shows on the 13 inch television. It's clean, never crowded, and cheap. The food is authentic and delicious, it's my favorite Mexican in the city, also makes a great lunch spot.
