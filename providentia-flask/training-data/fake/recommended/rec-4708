The service in this place is just awful. We came in, the customers gave us looks like we weren't supposed to be there. The girl who gave us our menus didn't even tell us her name and walked away. Then a while later our waitress came over, an older lady, and had an attitude the entire time we were ordering. We asked to be on seperate checks and got even more attitude and awful faces from this lady. The draft beer tasted pretty terrible so I returned it and she basically grabbed it from me. It's also advertised to have the best bar pie. It left a lot to be desired. All around bad experience and I will not be returning.
