Being from Austin I've always thought the best pancakes were kerby lanes gingerbread pancakes but this place has the most amazing cinnamon banana pancakes with assorted butters (that's right MULTIPLE types of flavored butters!) that I have conceded that, in fact, toms has the best pancakes. Also, great bang for your buck! Friendly and (mostly) fast service.
