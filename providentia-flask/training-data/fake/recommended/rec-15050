I will be spending my money elsewhere. While I have enjoyed the food here and they sometimes have some exceptional draft choices I feel forced to take my business somewhere it will be appreciated. Since Memphis Taproom is in one of my best friends neighborhood we frequent it often ( a dozen times a month) I have had it with the service.  My money and patronage apparently aren't as valuable since I am not heavily tattooed or a hipster.  Personally I drop between $75 to $100 per visit and get looked over by the bartender and passed without a glance by the servers. This attitude comes from the top (ownership) whom rather look cool then be cool. I will miss the food and beer but won't miss getting an attitude or leaving frustrated!
