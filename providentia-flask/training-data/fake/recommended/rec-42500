I totally forgot about Ruby's since I was off to school in Boston for 4 years but yesterday I just had a hankering for it. Sadly, it was a super hot 90 deg NYC day and Ruby's does not have air conditioning. That's the only reason I deducted a star because I was really hot while enjoying my really yummy meal. I always get the Bronte burger (which by the way is amazing!!) but today I wanted to try something new. I ended up getting their grilled chicken sandwich. This place makes it way better than any other chicken sandwich you've ever had becuz it is not the least bit dry. It is soooooo moist that juices are dripping out of it with every bite. Like all of their sandwiches, the bun is a really soft, rectangular shapes ciabatta-like bun instead of your typical round mushy bun. I also like that it's accompanied by a small arugula salad instead of french fries, keeping the health conscious in mind. It's an incredibly small store front so I've missed it my first time going there but now that I know how to get there, i'm almost kind of glad. It really is a unique gem in the neighborhood. Food is amazing, please go try it. PS... it only probably fits about 20 ppl max at a time so there may be a little bit of a wait.
