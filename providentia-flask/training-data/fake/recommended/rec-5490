Finally there is a reason to go to Chinatown for ramen soup! Like New York, some of the best ramen soup restaurants are scattered throughout Philly. Unlike New York, there is no real "Japantown" for all things Japanese. We have our areas of Korean and Vietnamese concentration, but Japanese people appear to be underrepresented in downtown Philly. Why that is is a mystery to me considering all of the sushi restaurants that exist. I know, I know, many sushi joints are owned by Chinese and Koreans who are cashing in on the sushi craze. The uninitiated will eat anything drizzled with spicy mayo on it. How authentic are ramen soup joints? Aren't they also owned by Chinese and Koreans? Maybe. Even so, some of them are making amazing food. Look at Terakawa. They claim "our chef's recipes originate from the Kumamoto region of Japan. The broth is simmered for two days. Due to the extensive cooking period, our broth has a deep, well developed flavor that can only be described by experiencing it." Their noodles are handmade and cooked al dente. I ordered an appetizer of Takoyaki, also known as octopus balls. These takoyaki are lightly fried Japanese mountain-potato balls filled with octopus. They're topped with Japanese barbeque sauce, Japanese mayo, and shaved fish. The dish was a delight to my senses. The signature Terakawa Ramen is filled with Heritage Berkshire Pork bone soup topped with roast pork, bamboo shoots, kikurage mushrooms, red ginger, chopped scallions, and a seasoned boiled egg. The broth is a bit saltier than Nom Nom and Ramen Bar, but the quality in the ingredients and preparation is all there. You also get a lot more food for your money at Terakawa. Budget conscious people will love this fact.
