Just Good Happy Hour. They have $6 drink specials.... but some of the drinks were good and then when re-ordered were not.  We had ginger mojito (good) green tea martiinis (really good the first round and really bad the second round... even after sending them to be "fixed")  The appetizers were ok. The free dumplings were meh but  at least they were free with the yelp check-in, so can't complain there.  The bruschetta, the fries and shrimp were pretty good. The buffalo wings were just sour hot sauce sauced... gross. The pork belly and steak were ok but the grilled chicken was amazingly flavorful and moist! 5 of us orderd that after 1 taste! The place is nice... def not ugly. The service left alot to be desired thugh. When I had to send my wings back, he didnt even offer me a replacement dish until we flagged him down and asked for something else. He disappeared so many times and even during mid-conversation... we were like what? The waiter didn't even know the dessert menu and changed the options on us after checking in the back, but he was sweet regardless. So maybe he's new? Would I go back? Not really, when there are so many other great places to try in nyc...
