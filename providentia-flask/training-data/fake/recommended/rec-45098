Would I be alive if it weren't for Mamoun's Falafel? It's not a hyperbolic question, but the answer belongs elsewhere. Reality can be cold and harsh, which is why it pains me to say that, when we get down to the heart of the matter, Mamoun's - much like Brando's much ballyhooed appearence as the delusional Colonel Kurtz in "Apocalypse Now" - just doesn't quite cut it for me. Much of the raves for Mamoun's are warranted - namely the ridiculously low prices that no doubt keep the financially challenged village crowd from being famished and the no-nonsense, get-your-food-and-move-the-fuck-outta-the-way quintessentially old school NYC service. But I've been disappointed several times by the falafel and the shwarma. The falafel itself is good, along with the tahini and the hummus, but the lettuce and tomato aren't the freshest. I have no doubt in my mind the pitas are store bought, namely because the dudes once gave me the pitas WITH the bag in which they came from. At least buy better quality. The shwarma can be super fatty - when it's not, it's pretty good. But the vegetable problem persists. Go for the chicken kebab - the chicken rocks. :::Waiting for the the hater mail to arrive::::
