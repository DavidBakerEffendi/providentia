Amazing off the beaten path restaurant--not ostentatious from the outside but the interior is charming and was surprisingly empty on a Saturday night. I imagine not for long when the word starts to spread. Service is very friendly--the host and our server were both very personable and helpful. Got the Parma pizza. The pizza crust is at the same time light and chewy, reminds me of a hole in the wall pizza place I used to go to in Italy. The pecorino was amazingly flavorful and went well with the slightly cooked prosciutto and baby arugula. I'm not a prosciutto or arugula fan in general but this was very well done. The pasta in both dishes we ordered was satisfyingly al dente, second only to Eataly where it is made in house. And the gratuitous cheese grater made us happy. I got the spaghetti and meatballs: the sauce was the right amount of tomatoey, but the meatballs were a bit ordinary. The sausage in my friends fennel dish was amazingly flavorful, and the fennel was just the right amount of garnish. The only thing I would say is the use of lemon could be brought down a bit for that dish, but my friend found it perfect. Overall a very happy experience. There is also a fancy bar despite this being a small joint--manned by dapper men in white jackets, and with many jars of accoutrement lined up for what I imagine is a wide variety of cocktails. Did not partake this time but definitely interested in seeing what they concoct on my next visit here--which will be soon.
