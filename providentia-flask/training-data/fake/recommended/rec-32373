On our first visit on a Friday night, we decided to try it based on reviews here.  Well, it's a mixed review.  It was busy and the bartenders moved at a glacial pace to keep patrons happy while they waited for tables....both in getting drinks & settling tabs. Next came dinner.  I can only imagine that the food is good enough to offset the poor service.  In 25 years, I have never been asked "is this the one you picked?" by the server for the bottle of wine we selected.  There was a straw wrapper in the bread basket.   Overall,  it took 2.5 hours to have dinner on a Friday night.  Not the worst, but not great.  Our appetizers were very good (octopus and grilled asparagus & shrimp with bacon) as were the entrees (duck breast and mixed mushroom risotto).   Would I go back?  Only very early or late in the evening.  Everyone on their staff needs training, that's without a doubt.  There were plenty of people there, just not enough that knew what they were doing.....
