Service - soooooooooo slow. Food -super delicious.  Especially the scallops. Price/value/was it worth it?  -- interestingly, the dinner portions are huge.  That never seems to happen in places like this. If you're looking for a more economical dinner, split an entree with your date and you'll both be filled up by the end.  If you're not, then order the cookies to finish the job.
