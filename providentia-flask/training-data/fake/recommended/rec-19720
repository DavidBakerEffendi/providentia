I love this joint.  Food, service, atmosphere- all very good.  Reasonably priced for the neighborhood.  I read other reviews, and clearly other people eat more ramen than I do, but I thought it was great, I don't have a lot to compare other than other food I have eaten, and this was delicious.   The pork buns were good.  The sushi is good.  Free beer with a check-in.  It's great.
