Wow... Out of this world... Burgers..Fries..Onion Ring... Loved that the patties weren't overcooked... It was still nice and juicy when served... Didn't care too much for the sweet potato fries cuz it's topped with brown sugar which made it a little too sweet.. O, and that "mexican sprite".. don't fall for it!! It's just a Sprite bottle with Spanish words!!!
