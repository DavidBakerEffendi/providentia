I've frequented Il Bambino for everything from brunch to coffee to dinner. I adore the atmosphere of this cafe/restaurant and if you can, during the spring and summer try to sit out back. Now for the food... Panini: Organized in order of price, which is very helpful. They are all fantastic, and there are usually some great specials too. My favorites on the menu are: Mozzarella with tomato fresca and basil pesto, Prosciutto with Gorgonzola dolce and fig spread (sweet, crispy, savory... delicious), and my absolute fave is the Roast chicken with Mozzarella, arugula and spicy mayo. That one is to die for - I crave it all the time. Brunch menu: The Fun Guy (get it? ;) panini with roast mushrooms, scrambled eggs, parmesan and truffle aioli (fancy) is decadent, and my favorite on the menu. The Notorious P.I.G.(Smoked bacon, scrambled eggs, artisan cheddar, truffle spread), is also rockin, so I highly recommend. Additional things: The nutella or Peanut butter Hot chocolate is incredible. They also have great alcoholic beverages, and the prices on almost everything are extremely reasonable. They also deliver, if you're ever desperate for a panini, which I have been on more than one occasion. Highly recommend for all occasions!
