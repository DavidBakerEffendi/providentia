I mean... where do I begin?  It's definitely always crowded and hard to sometimes get a table within 30 minutes during dinner.  However, the food is always spot on.  Opt for the family jewels, always a welcome addition.  The polenta was cooked perfectly and tasted heavenly.  The prices are affordable and the staff always is willing to help.  Drinks are fine, nothing crazy. Would only come here for food anway. The late night hours are perfect and it is usually less crowded.   Seating at this location can be a little difficult with groups of 4 or more.  Otherwise... no reason you shouldn't go.
