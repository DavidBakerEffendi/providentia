One of the best meals I have had in a long time! Three of us tried the lunch pre fixe menu. Every course of the meal was delectable, just the right portion (this is not one of those French meals where you leave hungry :-)), Â and perfectly cooked! They have an enchanting selection of seasonal dishes for each course to appeal to a wide variety of palettes. One of my friends, who was dining with us, and has eaten there before, noted that their menu changes at least every season. We are hoping to go back again soon, or at least next season! My selections: Course 1: Carpaccio, Young Big Eye Tuna & Striped Amber Jack, Prepared in a Mediterranean manner (FAVORITE 2), Course 2: Porcini Flan, Alaska Live Dungeness Crab, Black Truffle Dash (MY FAVORITE 1), Course 3: New Zealand White Fallow Venison with Black Truffle Gnocci, Blue Kale, Brussels Sprout Leaves (AMAZING!), Course 4: Chilled Coconut Soup with Pineapple Granite, Organic Yogurt Sorbet Palette Cleanser (OK), Course 5: Hot Caramelized Anjou Pear, Valrhona Chocalate, Biscuit Breton, Hot Toffee Sauce, Rosemary & Tahitian Vanilla Ice Cream (LOVED) I highly recommend this place!
