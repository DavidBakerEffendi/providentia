It is very rare that a restaurant improves - generally speaking, the trajectory of quality at any establishment is either a flat line or gently downward. But improvement is exactly what has happened here, because unlike the mediocre and forgettable pizza I ate at Flatbread in 2008, our most recent dinner was breathtakingly good. In contrast to the Vermont Tap House, which strives to make the simplest Neapolitan-style pizza from the most basic ingredients, Flatbread seems determined to make the construction of a pie as complex as possible. Multiple cheeses, many spices, weird combinations - this is easy to get wrong, but they seem to be succeeding. I'm not sure I can identify all the herbs they put on our meal, a "15 inch Medicine Wheel flatbread", which in other less imaginative restaurants would be called a "large cheese pizza", but they were delicious. The crust was just chewy enough, and nicely charred. The waitress was attentive and very helpful, and the only hiccup in the experience was our arrival - they close between 3PM and 5PM, and we arrived at 4:57. While I understand this was on us, it was odd to be sent to wait outside for three minutes when there were people seated in the restaurant and at the bar.
