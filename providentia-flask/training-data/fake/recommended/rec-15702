Perfect place for a first date if you wanna look like a classy broad like myself. Love the outdoor garden seating, it has a great ambiance. My date was a few minutes behind me so I waited at the bar. The host was super friendly and made conversation with me while I waited. I ended up ordering their brunch special which included an entree, one side item and a(n) (alcoholic) brunch beverage all for a reasonable price. The food and drink was tasty as well as a large and satisfying portion. The date was terrible in itself but it was worth getting through to discover this little gem. Will definitely return!
