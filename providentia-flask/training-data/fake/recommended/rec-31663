Loved the food but a bit pricey. Maybe I'm getting old but a lot of Rutherford restaurants used to be more affordable for a week night dinner. If you can catch a groupon deal or restaurant.com deal definitely come here. They'll make your wine into sangria. The empanadas are great, entrees good too. Been here twice and wasn't disappointed. It's not very big so you may have to wait.
