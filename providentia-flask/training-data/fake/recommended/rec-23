I love this place for its coffeeshop feel without being a coffee shop. It's a great place to study with high ceilings and giant windows so it feels spacious without having that much square footage. Their internet is fast and they have a little bar for those of us who like to occasionally stand and study. While the service is a little slow, it's not ridiculous and most of the baristas are very friendly. I haven't had a negative experience here yet. The food is delicious. They have omelettes and toast related things, and soups along with their coffees and teas so I can literally be here all day as long as it's not too busy and never have to leave. I'm a fan of the veggie chili and their occasional wrap, but still have to try more off the menu.
