Room Service is the perfect spot if you're looking for a trendy NYC night, with great food and with reasonable prices. The highlights: -GREAT Ambiance.  The atmosphere is fun, trendy, and upscale.  Both fun and funky at the same time.  Dimly lit and expertly decoracted.  Not your average Thai restaurant with an uninspired interior.     -Fast and Attentive service.  The staff was friendly, fast, and unpretentious. -Good drinks.  Cocktail menu looked extensive, but I stuck with beer.  They have a few Asian beers on tap, as well as a couple standards like Stella. -Excellent menu.  We orderd a bunch of items and shared them. Highlights of food are: ---Apps: Kani Summer Roll is delicious and very minty.  Assorted Golden Fritters were also very good.  Nice balance of healthy and fried foods. ---Entrees:  Room Service Pad Thai was unique and delicious.  My favorite dish of the night, and I'm not even a fan of standard Pad Thai.  Thai Mango Blackened Fish was good, but not the best dish of the night.  The non-specialty entrees were excellent as well.  Really enjoyed the Panang curry and the Pad Se Ew.  I wanted to try the Basil Fried Rice, but was too full. -Prices:  Just right.  We had a ton of food (both apps and entrees) and a cocktail.  Total price per person was under $30, which didn't seem possible.  Certainly reasonable for Manhattan. -Space:  This is the only CON.  The space is long and narrow.  The bar was super crowded and the restaurant is hard to navigate when busy. I'll definitely be back to Room Service.  It far exceeds any other Thai I've had in Midtown.  Highly recommend.
