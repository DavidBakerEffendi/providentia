Since we moved from living 2 blocks from Stamna, it sporadically triggers fond memories of good meals enjoyed here.  A great family atmosphere with authentic Greek fare.  The wife loves the chicken soup and we both love the lemon potatoes and beets.  Never a bad meal here and the place that spawned our love of bifteki.  BYOB, reasonably priced, neighborhood feel...can't go wrong.
