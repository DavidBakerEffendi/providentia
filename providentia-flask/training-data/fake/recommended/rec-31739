Loved this little restaurant bar.  Esp the exposed brick inside.  Obsessed with the fall sangria. So much that I tried to recreate it to no avail. The others on my group had great meals that I sampled (the Croque Madame and eggs Benedict) but my chicken Caesar salad was kinda meh. I'd still go back though I just would t get that salad again.
