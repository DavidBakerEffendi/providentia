I had high hopes for the Brothers Moon as I loved the restaurant exterior and the idea of a local bakery.  The meal was we had was somewhat lackluster and the service seemed slow.  The bakery selection was sparse and the muffin I did order was really too greasy.  I keep telling myself to try them again but then talk myself out of it when there are better places in the area.
