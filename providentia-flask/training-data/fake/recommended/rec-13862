Meh. Maybe I'm not a real cheesesteak fan, but I didn't think that this was anything special. I never really liked the "wiz" nacho-like cheese they put on the sandwiches so I got a provolone cheesesteak to compare the "wiz" cheesesteak. Honestly, I can say I've had better cheesesteaks from the Great Steak Co. chain restaurant. If I was in Philly and I passed by this place, I might stop by if the line isn't too long and if I was feeling like eating a steak sandwich but I wouldn't go out of my way to get another one though. It's kind of expensive for just a sandwich (8$ at the time of this review). Parking is kind of a pain in the butt.
