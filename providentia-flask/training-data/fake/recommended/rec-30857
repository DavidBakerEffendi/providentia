We had dinner on New Year's Eve upon recommendation from a local chef. We arrived and were told that we had about a 90 minute wait. I take that as a good sign and was very optimistic. We ordered some beers and wine, then settled in near the bar for what we thought would be a long wait. Within 30 minutes we were sitting and had our appetizers sent to our table. The bread, that came with each app, was warm and crunchy, melting the provided butter just enough to soak in. We had ordered a cheese plate, Testa, duck prosciutto and the bread with butter. The duck prosciutto was a nice pile of strips, shaved and just the right amount of meat and fat. Our cheese plate featured a creamy Dorset and blue Dumbarton, both were excellent. Lastly, was a serving of testa di coppa; an excellent head cheese that had an earthy quality from the fennel pollen. Pizzas. What we were so excited for, were up next. We ordered the Darkwing, Good Girl, Amatriciana, Beastmaster and a standard Margherita pizza. The Darkwing featured duck and a young white cheddar, chadoka, which played perfectly off each other. The Good Girl and Beastmaster, both feature spicy pork sausage. They do not kid when they say spicy. Don't get me wrong, it was good but when you are used to grocery store pork sausage being labeled as "hot" and it is not, this caught me off guard. I will say, the Margherita was one of the best I have ever had, taking into account, I have been to Italy and had several versions of it. Their dough is just the right crust on the outside with a very chewy center. Epic experience with Brooklyn pizza. Will definitely go back and if you are anywhere near Bushwick, go. Run. Don't walk.
