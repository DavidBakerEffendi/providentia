Jadis is, hands down, a wine-bar must for anyone in New York City. They have a great selection of wine and amazing food. But it's the phenomenal staff that really sets this hidden gem apart from other establishments. I highly recommend booking your next large event there. Just wrapped up my 30th birthday celebration and could not have been happier. Unseen to casual patron just walking through the front door, Jadis has a fantastic lounge in the back with couches and sectionals just waiting to be sat on as you sip on a glass of prosecco and nibble on a mushroom truffle puff pastry. If you haven't checked out this place you really should. I've gone several times and have never been disappointed. You won't either.
