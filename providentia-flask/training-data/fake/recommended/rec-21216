3 stars for food, but 4 stars since the mojitos are so good - they have the best mojito's ever!  Love the bartender here - he makes a strong but delicious drink.  The mojitos are fresh mint, sugar and lime and he really takes his time muddling them together so it ends up being perfect . We ordered: Spicy Lemon Shrimp - good size shrimps and really tasty Calabreza Sausage - the sausage is smaller than you would think - about the size of a penny sliced thin.  I think the flavor is really good with the onions, but it can feel a little dry - it almost needs a sauce Feijoada - this is a traditional black bean pork stew I was a little skeptical of initially but was actually my favorite thing we had.  It's great if you soak it up with some bread, too! Love sitting at the bar - cozy atmosphere, although they do close on the earlier side.  They were pretty empty by the time we left at 12:30 on a Friday night...
