I would've given this place 5 stars had it not been for our man-bitch server with the glasses. But otherwise 5 stars for the stunning decor and excellent dishes. We ordered the tom yum soup, pad thai, red curry, massaman curry, red snapper over eggplant, basil noodles, and the pineapple fried rice. Our group of six passed everything around and devoured every last morsel. Â With a few rounds of beers and food, the bill came to a grand total of $160 inclusive of tax and tip. I highly recommend dining at this restaurant!
