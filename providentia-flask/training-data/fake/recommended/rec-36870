My first visit to NYC would not be complete without eating at Grimaldi's. Luckily for our small party of 2, we were able to sit immediately. After we dodged the evil eyes from hoards of people in large groups, we were seated at our cozy small table. Knowing that we were going to have Italian fare later that evening, hubby and I decided on a small pizza with garlic, sausage, pepporini, roasted red peppers and olives (p.s. for next time: olives are kalamata). When the pizza arrived, we thought they had mistaken our order for what, in my opinion, would be considered Large. Nope, this was definitely the small! The pizza was UBER delicious. I'm a total fan of this place and will return return!
