Came here on a Monday night around 8 pm and I couldn't believe how busy it was. Â For a party of 3 we had to wait so we grabbed some drinks at the bar. They have great Mojitos, the Mango and Pomegranate flavors were tasty, but not so much the Green Tea. The Lychee Sangria was delicious. It tastes just like juice so not sure if you alcoholics will like it. The bartender was really sweet and friendly. We ordered the following: - Assorted Golden Fritters - Curry Puff - Lemon Grass Soup (great for a cold day) - Thai Blackened Striped Bass - Massaman Curry - Lotus Seeds Massaman - Thai Iced Tea I use to judge Thai places based on how good their Pad Thai was so I guess I have to throw that out. This place has bad Pad Thai, but the rest of the dishes I've tried so far has been pretty tasty.
