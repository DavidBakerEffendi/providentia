Awesome, totally awesome. Food is so good. Been there maybe 10 times over the past 2 years and it's still on my top 3 in CT list. Have had almost all of the apps and most of the entrees also and they were all very good to outstanding. The drinks are off the hook too. A bit pricy but totally worth every penny. 4 drinks 1 app & 2 entrees over $100 including tip. Definitely make a reservation because the word is out. Bathroom kinda clean but could be much cleaner.
