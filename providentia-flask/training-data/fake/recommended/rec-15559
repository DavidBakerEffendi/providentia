You must experience la pulperia! I love all their cocktails, they have both sweet and spicy! And their cerviches are to die for. Especially the salmon cerviche! Their Brazilian fisherman's stew was delicious! Their oysters were not great but the whole dinner experience was something special. If you have a big table, order the seafood tower, for $170 it seems pricey but looks amazing. Â Service was great and ended with the tres leche dessert and a shot of their brandy milkshake on the house!
