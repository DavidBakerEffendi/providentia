There are well executed belgian fries in NYC. The sauces are amazing. Go for roasted garlic and eggplant, but be adventurous to pick the third. The fries and sauces were so good I didnt' care about having a small cockroach hanging out on my arm for a few seconds. I just wiped it off and continued eating. Don't think the place is dirty- the roach just probably ended up in there flying through the door. Amazingly, none of the 3 other people, including 2 girls, cared about it either. They just carried on with the feast and even considered ordering another batch. Yes, it's that good.
