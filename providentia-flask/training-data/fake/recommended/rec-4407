El Camino has become one of my favorite spots in Northern Liberties.  After a couple dozen visits under my belt, I still say they have the best margaritas in town!  The food is always super fresh, the service is awesome, the prices are reasonable.   My only negative comment about El Camino has more to do with the management's response to yelpers.  They recently let my favorite (and their best) server go partially because of the negative reviews here.  I'll be going in less often now because they let their best server go to appease a small group rather than actually take a step back and look at the real issues. I guess no one can please everyone all of the time. Oh, and don't miss the fried pickles and pig wings!!
