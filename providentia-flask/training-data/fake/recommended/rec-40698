I toyed between 4 and 5 stars for a while. I really wish it was possibly to give half stars, as I'd prefer to give 4.5 stars. Because I really love this place. LOVE it. I've yet to have a bad meal here. The food really is amazing. My 2 favorites are the burger (with bleu cheese) and the King Rarebit. I always get a side of the habanero sauce for my fries too, even though they are only supposed to come with the onion rings. This is my go to when people come to visit me (I'm within walking distance, so it's convenient too) and everyone has loved the food as well. So the reason I can't bring myself to give it 5 stars? The staff is either hot or cold. I've had some really lovely, wonderful servers here and I've had ones where I felt almost ashamed for being there. Particularly when the beer list is written very small on the far side of the wall and the lights are super dim for dinner service, please don't just point at it when we ask you what the beers are. We obviously can't see that damn far. This is your JOB. But, this will not keep me from coming back. The food is just too damn good and I have faith that at least half the time I will get one of the wonderful servers. I'm always willing to update this review...
