Never in my life have I experienced service as rude, arrogant and pretentious as the staff here. My friends arrived at this restaurant before I did so we were waiting to be seated upon my arrival. I got there and just as I got there, the waitress suddenly gave our table to some other party that just arrived, even though my friends had been waiting there for a while. We decided to wait by the bar (they call it a milk bar? Is that supposed to be a Clockwork Orange reference?), and I attempted to order a whiskey on the rocks. I didn't particularly care what kind as I was feeling rather stressed out so I asked for Jameson. Okay, they don't have Jameson so I asked out waitress to just pick a cheaper one for me as I handed her back the drinks menu. "No, you just don't get it." She replied as she rolled her eyes and passed me back the menu, "We have a very specific selection." Well, I'm sorry I'm not pretentious enough about Whiskey for you. When we finally got a table, the waitress at our table was a lot better, and by better I mean not condescending and not making me feel unwelcome. We ordered our food and I don't think I've ever paid that much for so little food in my life. Normally oyster orders come in three's or four's, but here they come in one's. Now the food itself was absolutely excellent. The pork buns were moist and sweet and the duck I ordered was savory and even a hint of sweet. I sampled some of the other dishes from among our party, and there was nothing short of excellent. Although, this one of the best dinners I've had in some time, I was so offended by the service that I'm really not sure if I will ever come here again. Given the attitude we received from the staff there, I'm sure they don't give a fuck since they wouldn't want me there anyway.
