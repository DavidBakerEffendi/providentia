We went here last night to celebrate my husband being home from a long business trip.  We had our well-behaved 4 year old twins with us, and we felt very welcome.   The food was delicious: very authentic, perfectly cooked pasta, awesome triangolo salad , fabulous homemade wine, and yummy, light subtlety delicious cannoli.   I studied in Italy, and think if myself as a connesseur, this place is the real deal.   We, of course, had ordered too much food, even though they did offer 1/2 portion pasta dishes for the kids (not indicated on the menu).  But that means we get to enjoy it again tonight!  I have never written a review before, but this place was so nice in every way, I had to share.
