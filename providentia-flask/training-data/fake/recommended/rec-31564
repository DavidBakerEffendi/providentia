This is hands down my favorite 'everyday' place to go. I'm a regular at La Riveria, and am always welcomed and made to feel like an old friend by the owners and staff. La Riveria doesn't try to be anything more than it is- Â AMAZING traditional Italian Cuisine at a fair price. The handwritten menus give an old world and comfortable feel that is just as wonderful at being at nonni's house for Sunday dinner with the family.
