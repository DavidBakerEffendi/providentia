I would second everything that Helen L said.   I used the $17 Groupon offer (whole chicken, 20 wings, half-rack of ribs), which was no problem and was exactly as advertised.  We also ordered some black beans. The staff (including the owner, Nick) were extremely friendly and responsive.  The space is basic linoleum floors and industrial tables and chairs, but extremely clean.  From the reviews, I imagined a hole-in-the-wall Chinese takeout-type place, but this is a large and comfortable restaurant space. The wings were very, very good....I'd come back just for those.  The ribs were OK...they are Memphis-style, dry with sauce on the side, and so not the fall-off-the-bone style we're more used to here.  The chicken was good, though burnt black in places.  The black beans were fine, could have been seasoned more. Overall, if I were in the area I'd come back for the wings...and maybe try the cheesecake, which they say is made in-house.
