I was in Brooklyn helping Sis out when we went shopping at Fairway. Looked up saw the place across the street from the parking lot. Next thing you know we are having dinner before shopping. Eat like no Tomorrow of the crab lobsterfest for 2 it was great. had a great time. Beer selection is pretty good too!
