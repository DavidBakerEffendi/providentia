I love this resturant, especially the avocado shake! The spring rolls are good here, but they still don't beat the spring rolls at The Vietnam resturant, but they are good, tasty, and fresh. All the food at Nam Phuong is fresh and very good. They make the best avocado shakes in the city, and yes, I have tasted other resturants' avocado shakes, and Nam Phuong, still came out on top. They have take-out which is great, but they also have free parking in their lot. There have been many times, where I have left Back to Reality Hair Designs on 22 street, (it's near Washington ave.), and went to Nam Phuong for dinner, and was very happy to drive in the parking lot, and just park. There is nothing worst, than being hungry and having to drive around for 30 minutes looking for a parking space! Great atmosphere, great food, free parking, and close to public transportation. My only wish is, that they stayed open later on the weekends. They close at 10pm.
