Fat Buddha is a great spot for a quick get together or ending your night out... Bartenders are great and friendly you feel welcomed from the moment you sit at the bar or at a table by a waiter/ waitress... Dj plays a little bit of everything but needs to update to a little bit of spanish music... Location is great because it is so close to the L train on First Ave... one block down and around the corner and your golden. If you need to grab a cab at 4 am you can because it is a busy street and one block up is 14 street. Overall Great Time... Many other nights will be spent here with me and my friends
