i had one of my most fun and interesting dining experiences here for the usual reasons - wine, food, french people, and very nice bathrooms. the food and wine menus were well thought out. the decor and the atmosphere were perfect for a very nice and fancy dinner with out-of-town friends. it's pricey! we loved the sunchoke soup, the trout, the duck, the wine, and the desserts. they were worth the splurge. their impressive bathrooms with their aromatic soaps were a source of many laughs for our french companions and, by extension, us. it's a great place to entertain guests!
