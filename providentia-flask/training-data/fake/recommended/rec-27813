Our beer-loving friends came to visit from North Dakota and requested great seafood.  Found Upstate on yelp and we had a great time and really enjoyed everything!  The place was packed, but our wait was short (and we were able to window-shop, etc. as they text you when your table is ready).  We enjoyed the craft beers, the charcuterie plate, awesome Long Island oysters (blue whale--if I remember the name correctly--were the best!!), the fettuccine with clams, the grilled scallops with mushrooms and zucchini, and the whiskey cake.  Service was on point, friendly and attentive.  An awesome dinner and we will definitely be back.  Our friends from ND absolutely loved everything. My fiancée said if we lived on the LES he would be there every day!
