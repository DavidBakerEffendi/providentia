I want to love this place, but it really is mediocre at best. Poor quality ingredients prepared reasonably well, served with friendly but mediocre service.  Now that Guero's Tacos is open a couple blocks away, I definitely can't see a reason to go here anymore. It is pretty cute and it is a very different kind of place than Guero's, of course, but the food there is so much better, it would still be hard to choose Chavela's.  The tacos are incredibly disappointing--dry, flavorless.  The plates are better, but not by much..
