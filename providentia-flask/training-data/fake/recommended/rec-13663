I'm a vegetarian. I had the veggie sesame pancake and it was really bad- I mean, the pancake "bread" itself is tasty- like very heavy, buttery, lightly crispy, soft bread. But the veggie stuffing inside was just some sliced carrots. WTF. I was hoping for the something more for the stuffing. DON'T have the veggie sesame pancake. Well, you can try it for the pancake alone. But the real reason you come here is the dumplings. I always have the 2 dollar veggie dumplings (a plate of 8 dumplings). The skin of the dumpling is thin- not thick like most dumplings you get. It's just made so the skin is still smoking hot from all that boiling and it's so satisfying. The stuffing- I don't know what's in there- it looks like green and brown mush (I'm guessing there's some kinda fake meat in there) and it's SO SO GOOD. I like to eat four of them when I just get it and then I like to save the rest for when they've cooled down so I can see how they taste when they're kinda cold. I gotta say- they taste better. I like the cold starchy dumpling with that cold red siarchan sauce. Ok. just go get it. P.S: I really like the owners- they're brisk, they're honest, they get the job done and they don't mess around with stupid small talk.
