Halal hits the spot ANY time of the day (and night). Whether it's pouring or blizzarding or hot as heck ... you're sure to find a line. Mixed platter + extra white sauce + just the right amount of hot sauce = perfection. Only first-timers drizzle on the hot sauce thinking they can handle it. But like the thousands of reviews before me, THIS AIN'T YOUR ORDINARY HOT SAUCE. Take it easy or else you'll suffer the next morning... Consider yourself warned. Now enjoy :D
