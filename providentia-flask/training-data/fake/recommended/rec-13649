Ate here last night with a table of 5. Tavern on Jane feels like a pub with locals chatting at the long bar, people squeezing past each other, it's casual, unpretentious, low key.  Don't let the pub-like atmosphere put you off - the food is excellent, and everything I tried was delicious.  We shared the fried oyster appetizer and Thai spicy shrimp which were both very good. My main was the almond crusted Salmon special with Brussel sprouts and spinach, now this dish was perfect!  Prices are well worth the food and if you can tolerate the noise, want somewhere with good service, friendly faces and are hungry don't wait another second. YUM!
