Another fine meal at this gem. This time, for the first time... maybe ever... I did not go for the cioppino. A friend and I shared some mussels in an excellent tomato broth (could have used more broth to sop up with bread, but that's just me), some delicious fried oysters, and a tuna burger. This was the first time I ever ordered the tuna burger, and I thought it was absolutely delicious. It's cooked black and blue so you get that delish sashmi-like inside and the smoky charred outside. Served with wasabi mayo and fries, it's a simple pleasure that really shouldn't taste as good as it does! UPDATE: (I figured a 4th actual update would be too much) THE THAI COD CURRY. Ooooooomg. I can't. So good. Also, staff is a pleasure. They actually remember you when you go in, and treat you like you're a guest at their home.
