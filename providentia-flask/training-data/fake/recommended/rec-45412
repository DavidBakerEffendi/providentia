Really excited to have this place in the hood! Went here the other day with a few friends. We arrived before the dinner rush (around 6:30) and our party of 4 was seated right away - although maybe we got lucky because within 30 minutes the guy at the door was putting people on a waiting list. It's in a beautiful space and the decor is comfy and creative. Love the milk bottle chandeliers! But more importantly, the food is great. The best things on the menu that night were well curated meat and cheese plate, a really unique and DELICIOUS charred fava bean dish, and an outstanding handmade pasta with ricotta. Everything looked and tasted like it was made with a lot of love. 2 fantastic bottles of wine and an amaro digestif later we were all in foodie heaven. Sort of want to go back every night to taste the new things on their ever-changing menu. And to drink some more of that amaro. Yum!
