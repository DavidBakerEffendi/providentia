Comfort food in all its splendor. This place is my reward for a long, tiring, hectic week. The fried pigtails, cornbread, kale salad, and country fried steak are all fantastic. The portions are enormous, you can easily split an entr√©e with one or two other people. The ambiance is laid back and spacious. The staff is polite and very accommodating. I recommend this place to anyone who is not vegan, because there is very little on the menu that does not contain either bacon or butter, except the kale salad. Warning: Coming here for dinner at 10pm on a Friday night still means about a 45 minute wait. Luckily, the bar is big, even if it's crowded.
