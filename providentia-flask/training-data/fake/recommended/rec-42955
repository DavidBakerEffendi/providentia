This is one of the few places that are still as old New York as you can get in 2011, McSorley's beer, thick wood bar, the register ahhh.. Not fancy at all, but after a long day/week at work sometimes you don't need fancy, you need relax and easy going, and you will find it here. I love their fries and sandwiches, the only thing is not my fave here is the burger patty I know a lot of people love the fat half cooked patty, but I barely eat meat so I prefer them thinner. Â But they have great grilled cheese sandwiches, with bacon yummy!!
