Finally, no more trips from Bklyn to the Harlem location. Great place and great location. The smell of BBQ is unbelievable. They just opened a few months ago and it was another fantastic meal. You must try the Donkey Punch which most ppl don't know about. Be careful, it does pack a punch. We went for a late lunch, early dinner. The pulled pork was awesome, smoky and tender. The ribs were good and the chicken was nice and moist. Had the BBQ fried rice and beans. Great combo to get and mix. My girl got the Tres Ninos, a good dish to get when you want to try a little of each. We had Taylor who was a lot of fun and is a true person. When you go, tell her Carlos and Rebeca say hi. She knows me as that guy. LOL. Get down there and try some BBQ and drinks... Go enjoy......
