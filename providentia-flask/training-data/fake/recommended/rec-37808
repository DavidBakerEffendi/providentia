I generally don't like to make comparisons but here we go: having just finished a meal with drinks at Zavino, I decided to stop in at Barbuzzo for (another) drink. I can't speak to the food here but I didn't get the same friendly neighborhood feel here as I did at Zavino. The atmosphere was nice as was the food I saw around me - and this is a subjective thing - but it just didn't seem as personable here as next door. Hope that makes sense.
