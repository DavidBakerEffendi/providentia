This place is awesome. Its a great NJ diner. Everything is good and the chefs make it all to order.. Fresh baked cakes fresh veggies good service great atmosphere and even a great decour with flat screens and everything... The only downfall is this is one of the pricier diner's in the area.... But much like alot of things you get what you pay for..... Try the specials the chefs at this place know what the hell they are doing....
