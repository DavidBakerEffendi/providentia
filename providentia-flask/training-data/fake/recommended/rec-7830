We were at this restaurant on Dec 30th in town getting a second diagnosis at the Hospital of the University of PA.  We were very appreciative of the great service by Alicia and her great recommendations for lunch.  We both are salad entrees. I had the salmon and my dining companion had the shrimp.  Looking for a cozy place that won't rush you with good locally grown and well prepared food. The White Dog Cafe is my go to place in West Philly.
