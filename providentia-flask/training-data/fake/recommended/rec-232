I absolutely LOVE this place! I've been coming here for about 4 years now. The wine bar itself is cute and intimate. It reminds me of somewhere in the West Village in that the staff are men wearing suspenders, there are chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, exposed brick walls, rustic tables, and dim lighting- not typical of the area. It is a great place to bring a date or go with a few friends. I would not recommend coming here with a large group, unless you ask to sit in their outdoor patio downstairs. All the food is excellent- I highly recommend the Pizza, Meatball Sliders, Stuffed Mushroom & Artichoke, Tuna Tartare, and Bruschetta Trio. I very much enjoy the wine selection they have as well- always something new to try. The staff is always friendly and welcoming. They are attentive and care about their customers. The things to be mindful of: the place is small so if it gets packed, there is less room to wait around. I recommend just grabbing a drink by the bar and usually you won't be waiting for very long. Also, I've noticed when you go on a Thurs or Fri night, it is much louder in the front room. If you're looking for a quiet little wine bar then I suggest going earlier in the week when it's not as busy (Monday-Wednesday). You can also ask to be seated in the back of the bar too. Overall, I think this place is great and I will keep coming back!
