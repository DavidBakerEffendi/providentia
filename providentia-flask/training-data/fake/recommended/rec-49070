Amazing meal start to finish: Firstly, great attentive service in this cosy restaurant. -Steak Tartar app - Better than Paris, high quality meat. - Lamb meatballs, so flavorful and well paired with couscous. Presentation was beautiful as a plus. - Brussels sprouts with Sriracha sauce. - Butternut squash was thanksgiving in a bowl. Best meal I've had all year!
