Their paninis are fresh and tasty for the most part. The thing that I don't like is that they don't take credit cards. They went through the hassle of installing an ATM machine, that way if you don't have cash, you can conveniently take it off from the ATM machine with a service fee of course, but why inconvenience your customers and just not accept credit cards?
