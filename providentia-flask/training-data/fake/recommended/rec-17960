Delicious fresh sushi and inventive variations like the scrumptious and addictive "Japanese Pizza".  The staff are so sweet and helpful.  After only our second visit they treated us like regulars, so now we are.  I've been eating sushi for decades and regularly dine at fine sushi restaurants in NYC, Los Angeles, and other cities, including Tokyo, and my husband and I are very pleased with the quality here. It's also an excellent value.
