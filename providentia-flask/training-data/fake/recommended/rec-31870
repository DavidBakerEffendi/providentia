Happy hour is the time to come sample the food here. The special discounts at the bar include fresh guacamole, flaunts de pollo- both tasty bargains at $6/each. Avoid the quesadillas at all costs. To drink, I recommend the "rosalitas" made from a machine also $6each. Â Though my wife and I spent $60, a couple could probably escape for under $40 and have a good time. On Monday happy hour is all night long.
