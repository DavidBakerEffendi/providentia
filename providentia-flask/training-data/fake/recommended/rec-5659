My boyfriend and I made it a point to try Parc when on vacation this summer from Washington, D.C. It was very close to our hotel in Center City and they had ample street parking just outside the building (just double check to make sure you have enough time on your meter!). We shared a delicious lunch of mac n' cheese au gratin, escargo, and club sandwiches.
