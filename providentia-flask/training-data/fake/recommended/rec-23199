Stopped here after climbing at the NJ Rock Gym. They are open late. The menu was vast. The paper placemat with ads was fun to play the word search game on with my company. I don't know why, but I ordered a Reuben Wrap. Not that it was bad or anything, it just seems like a really odd choice in retrospect. That, and I also subbed celery for my fries (I got 2 tiny pieces of celery). And ordered a coffee. It was an odd meal, but I enjoyed it enough. I'm pretty sure the waiter thought I was crazy, but he smiled every now and then so I think he at least found me amusing. He was also very skeptical of my out-of-state license when I ordered a beer after my meal. I was actually surprised they served alcohol here, but not much for choices of beer from what I remember. Espresso machine was broken!
