Was there really a wait? With any restaurant that puts out great food, I don't think I would mind waiting one bit. That, and my friends and I just went around the corner for some drinks. The service was done right. As we walked to our table, the staff continuously greeted us. There was no attitude of indifference or arrogance, except for smiles and greetings in what I assume was Japanese. I expected to be crammed into a tight area with a bunch of people around us, but we were seated at a table in the corner and it was surprisingly spacious. The servers were also very attentive in making sure our waters were full and errthang. As for the food - I ordered the first item under the specialty appetizers (it was fried chicken with some ponzu sauce) - this was fried very well. The batter was light and crispy. As for my ramen, I ordered the Akamaru ramen (I don't know what this meant except I knew it was a character's name in a popular Manga...ha..ha..) I have been to a handful of ramen shops, and Ippudo easily tops them all. I eat fairly quickly and as I was waiting for my friends to finish, I kept drinking the broth. I'm very glad I came here for dinner last night.
