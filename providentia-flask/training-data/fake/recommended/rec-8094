I'll add to the overwhelming abundance of 3 star reviews.  Doc Magrogan's is expensive and average, a corporate lunch or dinner-at-4-with-your-grandparents kind of place.  It's the Olive Garden of raw bars: reliable but unadventurous and uninspiring. I've visited once for happy hour, once for buck-a-shuck oysters, and once for a meal.  Happy hour and buck-a-shuck were worthwhile.  The bartenders were helpful and friendly, the oysters were fresh and flavorful, and the drinks were well mixed.   +1 for helpful descriptions of the various oyster options, but -2 for no prices on the oyster menu.  Don't make customers ask about prices; it's uncomfortable and irritating.  This ain't the Ritz. Dinner was not worth the $30+ tab (pre-drinks, tax, and tip) per person.  The fish portions were very small, which would be fine if the fish (I think I had salmon?) was well-seasoned or in any way interesting.  It was not.  The service was entirely disinterested.  The ambiance was... fine.  I'll probably come back for buck-a-shuck but there's no way you'll catch me back for a meal (corporate lunches aside).
