The food is incredible. It's so good I keep going back regardless of the consistently terrible service. If you want good service, go when it is empty, otherwise don't go if your stomach is completely empty. While it often/almost always takes a while to get your food, it is always worth it. Soooo delicious. I had seaweed salad and then shared the sushi boat for one and a seafood dragon with my dad and it was plenty of food.
