I was unimpressed with both my meal and the service, which was offhanded and a little rude. I saw notices on the menu and my receipt not to tip according to the custom in Japan, so I didn't leave a tip. I hope this was right. At any rate it doesn't really matter because I hate the food here starting with the tonsoku. Tonsoku, if you're not aware, is pig's feet. I am generally vegetarian, but not strict, so I'll venture out and order red meat on occasion. Do not order the tonsoku if your diet is anything like mine. While they had fried the outside of the pork skin to a crisp, resulting in a pork rind flavor that wasn't bad, the rest of the pig feet was all fat. It was marinated, grilled fat, but not something that a person who only eats lean meat can handle. It's too bad, I really wanted to like this. Most of the positive reviews here for tonkosu are from either Asian people who likely grew up with this stuff or diehard meat lovers or both. For me, my gut is still deciding whether to accept or reject this meal. Thankfully, the tonsoku is not an entree and you'll need to order something else to fill up. I opted for the scallion pancake wrap with ground pork. While the scallion pancake tasted similar to ones you can get at Shanghai-style Chinese restaurants, whoever thought wrapping a bundle of raw lettuce in there needs to go back to culinary school. It was terrible. The only thing that helped it go down the gulch is the green peppery ponzu sauce in a bottle that looks like dark wasabi. This sauce that you can buy at most Japanese supermarkets was easily the best thing I tasted tonight. For beverage I had something called "muscat cider". It was very good and hopefully all natural. All in all, I had a disappointing meal and can't understand why they have reservations booked weeks in advance. I might come back to try the hotpot during winter and allow this restaurant to redeem itself to my stomach.
