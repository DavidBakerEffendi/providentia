Great food and always a smiling host despite the wait.. Â Couple things however; 1. The wasabi is like clay. Anyone who knows real sushi knows fresh wasabi should melt in the soy sauce 2. Keep it simple, American sushi places love to over do it and put so many sauces on their sushi (including the shriracha mayo in everything which is so old school). Keep it fresh and simple. And always try to reduce the amount of items you have no menu
