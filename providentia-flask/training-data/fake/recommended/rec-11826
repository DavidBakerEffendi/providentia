Scarpetta was a wonderful restaurant. The soft lighting and natural wood gave the restaurant a very warm ambiance. My friend and I were seated in the main dining area where I think most people with reservations are seated. The food was exceptional. We could not decide what to offer so we decided to get two pastas, two entrees and two desserts. Our server was very kind and made sure everything was split into two separate plates/ It was a lot of food but we enjoyed all of it! The pastas were delicious especially the black tagliolini. As for the entrees, the branzino and the pork were phenomenal. I really had nothing to complain about!
