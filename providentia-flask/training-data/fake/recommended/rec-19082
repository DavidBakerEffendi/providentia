I love this place, the sandwiches are fresh and tasty; the perfect Sunday lunch. After a weekend of over-indulgence, a meal at Hanco's is perfectly simple and delicious. Â You'll feel like you're doing yourself a favor. Though the place itself is quite small, you can grab a table inside or out, and go for a walk to digest. Or take your food to go and sit in Cobble Hill park, or on the promenade, for a beautiful afternoon!
