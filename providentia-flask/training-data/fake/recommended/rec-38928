It's a little out off the beaten path so I usually forget it exists but I love this place. Great Harvest is definitely worth the trip. Everything seems like it's right out of the oven. Go early if you're looking for your favorites - the regulars grab the best stuff by afternoon so sometimes they run out. Highly recommend. Like everyone else said - I'm surprised there are so few reviews here.
