I've been to Spasso on several occasions and have never had a bad experience. The Bronzino which is a white fish that is served and filleted tableside is excellent as well as many of their other dishes. The staff is extremely friendly and will make you any custom dish you wish to eat as well. The desserts and traditional italian dishes are excellent as well. I especially like to get the Gnocchi Gorgonzola as an appetizer for the table as well. The prices are very fair and they have a very good wine list too. *The menu at Spasso is almost exactly the same as Bellini which is a BYOB in the center of town. If you want to drink your own wine check out Bellini*
