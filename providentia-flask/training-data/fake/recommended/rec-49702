Incredible food ruined by stuck up waiter. I've been here about three times already for brunch and every damned time we get the same waiter named Greg. On a Sunday morning I want my brunch served by a smiling wait staff--not by a pretty boy who can't seem to stop running his hands through his hair. He never seems to smile either. Not sure what his deal is...but anyway, on to the food... The food was great! I had the merguez and eggs...the sausage was nice and juicy and the eggs were also great. BEWARE OF THE PANCAKES. If you order them thinking they are your typical thin pancakes that you will stack and baptize in Vermont maple syrup then you will be in for a rude awakening. These bad boys are HUGE. Think about 4" thick. Besides being too big to appreciate, they didn't even taste good. The outside was crispy and the inside was very soft and hot. Yet as much as I love the food, I won't come back, only because I like to feel welcome when I go somewhere and spend my money. However, give credit where credit is due. This place gets a solid 4 stars for the food.
