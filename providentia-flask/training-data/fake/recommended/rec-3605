Had been meaning to go for some time!? However, most of the dishes were really very unexceptional. My poor daughters burger should have been sent back but we were afraid to do so. The service was friendly and attentive at all times. We sat at the very first table so of course were being watch by what I can only image is the grandmother owner. My pancakes were the only dish I would recommend and it came with favored butters as well. I ended up sharing with no problem my pancakes with my poor (sans burger) daughter. Â  I have no real proof for what I am about to report so draw your own conclusions. Four of us got sick within less than 12 ours of eating. I was bedridden unable to look at food. Unfortunately, this place has the strength of being a diner but along with this all the negatives of a diner as well. Example: when using the washroom I noticed that when I entered the room my hands felt wet. After completing my assignment I realized the connection. There were no hand towels and the only way to dry was a slight breeze coming out from what I would have a hard time to call a hand dryer. I have always had problems with food places that do not have hot water or proper ways to dry your hands. I really don't want to shake hands with people with wet hands when I am eating out. So buyer beware. I hope Tom's that truly is a neighborhood favorite reads this and reacts to right an easy to fix wrong. It's a fun place but we certainly will never return after this experience. Sorry
