Heard nothing but great things about the food here. I was not impressed with the Alfredo which I've never disliked, anywhere and also bummed that they didn't peel the skin off the eggplant which was sliced nice and thin though, that was good to see. The cannolis were awesome, they were out of tiramisu.
