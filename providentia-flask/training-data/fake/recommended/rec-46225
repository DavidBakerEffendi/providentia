I really don't know who these people are that think they can get away with whatever they want like dogs in a pocket book but if you expect a dynamite meal at a fair price served by the best waitresses around, take my word for it, here is the place to be. Their sister place ,the Brookside, up the road a piece is every bit as good. You can do no wrong at either. By all means, grab some desserts! Nick is the Bakery King, Bar none! George, John & Mike hope this helps business. Keep up the good work. I'd starve to death without you. [(;-D
