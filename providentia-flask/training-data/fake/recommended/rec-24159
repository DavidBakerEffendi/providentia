My boyfriend and I really love this place, but I would love it more if they had kept the vegetarian seitan/cheesesteak sandwich. I get it, the chef does what he wants, but lots and lots of people love this sandwich including my non-vegetarian boyfriend. The pamboza is good, and interesting, but not great. Â The seitan was great! The best I have had. I love Point Breeze, I love that this bar is in Point Breeze! I love the beer selection and the food including the onion rings, but the return of the seitan sandwich would make this my favorite place to go! [End Whining]
