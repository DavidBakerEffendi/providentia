If you don't take reservation on weekends or at all, please tell people up front.  Don't send conflicting messages over the phone, "Oh, please call back on the day."  "Oh, please call back in the evening if you are coming in the evening."  "Oh, we are all booked, but call when you are on the way."  "Oh, we can't put your name down over the phone."  When you are actually there, the waiter just does not care if you are waiting outside in the cold and does not even bother asking your name or number or letting you know how long it might be. Waited more 1.5 hours just to get a table.  If you are a group larger than 4, please do not bother on a weekend.  It's just a shame when you have to be so disappointed even before your dinner starts.  By the time I sat down, my appetite had long gone.  Who cared how the food tasted at that point.
