2.5/5 Overall, we enjoyed the Alla Spina semi-outdoor space and found it perfect for a summer evening. We arrived around 5 and the bartender was a bit flustered, although there weren't many people in the restaurant. He spoke harshly and loudly to the kitchen staff, which was off-putting. It was unprofessional for customers to witness such discontent among the staff. The oysters were good and affordable. We were a bit confused as to what was included in the happy hour drink menu and ended up selecting full-priced drinks. The $14 wine was a bit underwhelming, but the mixed drink was well-crafted, although too bitter for me. We might give it another try.
