I come here from time to time with my wife to eat bratwurst or krainerwurst with sauerkraut or potatoes. The prices are ridiculously cheap for the quality of the food. The beer selection isn't as good as other beer houses but it's enough. Service has always been excellent and in terms of friendliness of staff it's the best I've had in Ridgewood so far (I've lived in the area for 2 years now). Iv'e never witnessed the extended menu they sometimes mention but the basic one is good enough. The wife and I will keep visiting this place for dinner from time to time.
