My girlfriend and I went to this place for our anniversary diner and had a variety of tapas and a bottle of wine and the one word that describes this place is: OVERRATED! Â The dishes are too small and although pretty good none really had the "wow" factor we though we were in for, furthermore as much as I like to see the chef(s) prepare my food in front of me I like to sit at a table and be able to relax and enjoy my food rather than at a bar where my chair is constantly bumped every time the waitress passes by. In a few words is you want to sit in a tight, cramped bar and leave hungry all while dropping over 125 bucks per person then this definitely is the place for you.
