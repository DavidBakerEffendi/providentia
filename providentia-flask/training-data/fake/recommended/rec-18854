This is a really cute sushi shop, and very authentic looking! Although it's quite small, so it doesn't have much seating. It's a great place to go for a nice date or intimate conversation. I ordered the sushi combo, which came with 8 pieces of assorted nigiri! It was excellently prepared, and the pieces of fish were quite large! (I like the generosity, but they also seemed to outbalance the amount of rice given) It was rather pricy, but worth it for the great quality.
