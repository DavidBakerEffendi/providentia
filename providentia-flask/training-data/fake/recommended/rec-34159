First things first: Open Door is awesome. More people need to come through. Open Door, being a gastropub, caters to the likes of fine food AND alcohol. The food is always amazing everytime I come. My favorite has to be the chicken p esto sandwich, the beet carpacchio salad, the rice and beans, and the chip trio which has friend corn chips, eggplant and plantains. Soooo delicious. Im going to state right now, that if you have had a "bad" experience, its worth another try. Open Door strives to impress. Nick, the owner, is very personable, getting to know each and everyone of his customers. He trains his staff on the rule that a happy staff gives way to a happy customer; a pleasant experience. The Â bar may get rowdy, but what can you expect from people having a good time? The bar creates an atmosphere, most definitely. Gerard is a fantastic bartender always anticipating and ready for your next beverage, Billy will amuse you with his charm and his fun puns and jokes, always ready to put a smile on your face. Wyatt is able to do all, (it may be his awesome beard,) Hes always ready to please, and bend over backwards. And lets not forget Thomas, friendly, always on his grind, experimental -always ready to create something new and different. The staff is great. The food is great. The alcohol always delicious. With a name like Open Door, they cater to everyone. Young, old, from LIC or Timbuktu, always ready and happy to serve you, the only wish to be a part of a community, to connect and be connected. This place deserves more service, hence the 5 stars.
