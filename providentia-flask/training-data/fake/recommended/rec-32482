A bunch of us from work popped in for a holiday lunch and a overall I found the experience to be pretty mediocre.  I ordered broiled scallops, It came with two sides -- a small cup of sliced potatoes and onion, and another cup of mashed butternut squash -- as well as fresh bread covered with honey-butter and served with more butter on the side.  The scallops were done perfectly, unfortunately I still have two complaints.  The first is that they seemed less broiled and more boiled or steamed -- there was just so much water in the serving bowl.  The second is that i found several small bits of shell in my food.  Not cool.  The sides were good, especially the squash, which was outstanding.  The bread, too, was very good, though sweet.   Parking was good, and they weren't too crowded during the lunch hours.  Unfortunately, they aren't cheap.  A lunch portion of scallops was $17 for maybe 8 smallish sea scallops -- money that probably could have been spent elsewhere for a better lunch.  Overall, this Chowder Pot is not bad, though there are much better seafood joints to be found.
