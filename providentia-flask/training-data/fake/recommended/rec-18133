Have gone here several times with my girlfriend, as well as once for a big birthday party. For the price the food is terrific - but I'd say that anyone who makes a special trip from outside the neighborhood might be left scratching their head about Vientiane. If you live nearby, or find yourself outside, this restaurant and are hungry you honestly could not do better. Don't forget two things before going: it's BYOB and it's cash only. There's an ATM in the corner deli if you ever end up short of money and the closest wine and spirits store is at 49th and Baltimore.
