Went to this place around 2am in the morning and didn't have to wait that long in line! There were two carts at 53rd and 6th and we weren't sure which one was the original cart, but decided to go to the one with more people. Â The aroma of the food smelled delicious as you walk toward the cart and even stronger once you are officially in front of the cart. Once we ordered the food, we knew we came to the right place because more people started coming and lined up for the incredible dish! We got the chicken and lamb and got the white and hot sauces on the side. Since it was freezing cold, we took the food home to eat. I usually don't eat lamb, but the grounded lamb in this dish was really good and didn't have that distinct smell at all. I think that the combination of the chicken, rice, lamb, pita bread and sauces were really good together. I'm sure that if we ate it fresh off the cart, it would have been better, but it was still really good. The hot sauce was crazy SPICY but once I started eating it, I couldn't stop! Then about 2 minutes later, the hot sauce kicked in and I swear my throat was on fire! I would definitely come back since the portions are good the prices are reasonable and the hot sauce is addicting!
