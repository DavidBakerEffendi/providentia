One of the most spectacular dining experiences I've ever had.  No contest. From beginning to end, I was amazed.  Everything from the tasting menu (a bargain at $95) was delicious - I had the best lobster I've ever tasted - and our waiter constantly brought us little plates of appetizers and sides, "compliments of the chef".  Before dessert, we were served a "Pink Grapefruit Soup" to clear our palates...even this icy, refreshing "soup" was bursting with flavor.   On our way out the door, we were handed little gift boxes that contained individual portions of lemon cake.  As if I wasn't in love with Bouley already!  If I could give out six stars on this thing, that last little gesture would've definitely earned a star of its own.
