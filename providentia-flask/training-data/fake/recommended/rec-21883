This place was great and I wish it was in my neighborhood.  The lady that runs it was super sweet.  The filet mignon was HUGE and yummy and $25!  All the food was great and the best part was the 80s pop music.  It was awesome.  Oh and the table of 6 girls next to us that EACH showed up with a magnum of Cavet Pinot Grigio - they were awesome too and ready to party.  I overheard one of them say, as they were enjoying their appetizers, "BTW I love tuna tartare!"  I didn't know people really spoke like that outside of tv shows that were making fun of them...  The BYO is awesome!  And this will forever be my pre-theater place.
