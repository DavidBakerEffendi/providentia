The service was great. The one gentleman who was at the bar also tended to the tables and was polite as well as attentive. The pulled pork sliders were delicious and the steak sandwich was Â great. Not greasy and the cheese was just the right amount. The street potato fries may have been the frozen kind, but were cooked well. The Mac and cheese was bland. Tastes like the boxed kind with breadcrumbs on it. Overall a great place. Would definitely go back for the pulled pork sliders.
