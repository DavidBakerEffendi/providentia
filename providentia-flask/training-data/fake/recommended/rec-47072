Loses two stars for food and food value. I had high hopes for FDR. It looks exceptionally well from the street and inside for that matter. They've hired an excellent designer. I think those few blocks have been starving for somewhere new to eat, which is why it may be receiving such high reviews? The service was top notch as well. I'm pretty sure there was a one to one employee to patron ratio... and no kids! ;) As a vegetarian, I know it is a slight risk attending a french-ish restaurant, but I was 'invited' by their (one) veggie option on the entree menu. I got the butter lettuce salad to start, which was pretty good. Who could hate butter lettuce with some nice dill accents? My date for the evening also had high praises for the artichoke soup. My entree of egg noodles with mushroom and eggplant ragu fell short. It was super bland and such a small portion, I left hungry despite my salad and beer. If you're only going to have one vegetarian option on a menu, it should be outstanding. My date got the plate of pork and barely touched the sausage. Didn't press too hard for details on that. I'd be a little nicer if the price point was where it should be. I just feel as though it's not worth it. 50 bucks later and still a bit hungry...and my head didn't explode from awesome flavor? Money better spent at Audry Calire. (still curious to try their brunch, when that happens)
