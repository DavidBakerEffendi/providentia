Absolutely terrible!  The worst customer service!  The bartender with the curly dark blonde hair basically ignored us... Cared more about eating her own food with her fingers then to wait on anyone.  She was handling money and then handling cups and straws with her dirty hands!!  They charged $3 for a bottle of water!  The shots were outrageously priced and were the size of a thimble!   My friends ordered food and when it arrived, the bartender set it at the back of the bar and forgot about it!  They had to ask about it and by that time, it had gotten cold!  I am appalled that they tried to charge $10 to park there AND charged $10 to get in!   In today's economy... Good luck getting people to come back to this place! Today I drove by there and watched people getting arrested in the parking lot.  That was pleasant.
