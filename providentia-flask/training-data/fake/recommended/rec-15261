Oh dear lord, the CHEESECAKE!!!!!  THIS is truly New York style cheesecake at its finest!  The rest of the food is amazing too, but the cheesecake is definitely the crowning glory of this place.  Right next door to the Miskoff Theater, this is a common place for theater goers to stop after The Lion King, so expect to see lots of families with kids in here.  My son and I stopped in after the show because we were starving, and didn't have to wait more than about 5 minutes, even though they were very busy.   The food is kind of pricey, and none of the sandwiches come with any sides (fries are extra), but the portions are HUGE!  I wasn't even able to eat half of my roast beef, and left most of the fries on the table.  Not because they weren't good, but because my stomach can only hold so much!   I got the cheesecake to go, as I was NOT going to leave there without it, and it made a great late night snack back at the hotel.   I definitely recommend Junior's to anyone in the Manhattan area/theater district who's looking for a lot of food for the money.   Oh yeah...the staff were really friendly too....sorry, but that really is an afterthought, coming after the cheesecake (did I mention it's REALLY good?) and the rest of the food!
