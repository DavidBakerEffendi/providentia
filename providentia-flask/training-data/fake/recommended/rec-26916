I love the fact that this place is open 24 hours and in a really great location. The ambiance is great too - not too traditional for a diner, with lots of beautiful photos and Latin music playing. The food and drinks are great, though the service was a bit slow and they overcharged us on one item. Go for the food, especially if you like Latin American cuisine. But don't expect five star service. Also, the prices are just slightly higher than they should be considering that it is in fact a diner.
