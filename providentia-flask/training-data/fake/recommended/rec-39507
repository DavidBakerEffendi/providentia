I was strolling around Alphabet City trying to find a random spot to eat. Came across Yuca Bar and my first thought 'too loud for me tonight' but the wonderful smell and good ambiance really caught my attention.   The service was really good. Plates were cleared right away, they don't wait till the whole is done. If you're done it's cleared. The staff made themselves available and were friendly. We were greeted with pleasant smiles and little jokes.  The music is loud. I could still hear my boyfriend across the table but couldn't the two tables away. This was great. The choice of music is Latin which very appropriate. They have a very cool mix; I heard Marron5 with slow merengue beat.   The food was too die for! Initially I didn't have a big appetite. But the presentation and the servings are great! The tapas aren't tiny bit size and neither are the entrees. I was too full to try dessert but I'm sure that would have been fabulous. He order 'Aprepa con Carne' and 'Quesadilla' chicken I ordered 'Puerquito Cubano'. All amazinggg. Beware with the Puerquito, it really is just that. Absolutely loved the mashed sweet plantains. And a lot of cilantro on top with the onions hmmhmm.  It's a hidden gem that shouldn't be!
