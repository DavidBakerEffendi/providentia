For a meal other than lunch, you'll probably walk away hungry. But for tapas, this place is delicious, the service is wonderful, and the atmosphere is great. If he's there, ask for Nick as your server. He was amazing. I'm on a special diet right now, and without me telling him that, he figured out my needs, made a bunch of suggestions, and even arranged a special dessert for me (just fruit, but hey! It wasn't on the menu). I hope this bar knows what they have in that guy and they promote him quickly.
