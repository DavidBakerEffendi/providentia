I remembered having hand drawn/shaved noodles several years ago when I visited china, the tastes was phenomenal and unforgettable. Philly chinatown opened up a few spots, I've  tried all of them, i was disappointed. The. Yummy opened up, thought I'd give hand drawn noodles another shot. Restaurant was really clean and organized, service was really good (best I've had in Chinatown) best part is, they speak English!!!! I love it.   Anyways, this place was unbelievable! Noodle were silky, the broth was a bit oily to my liking but that's the "Lan Zhou style" but the flavors and texture was perfect. I'm definitely going back. This spot is perfect durning the winter.
