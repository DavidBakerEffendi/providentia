I love this place. I asked my wife what she wanted to do for our anniversary and what she wanted to eat.  She said she wanted a new experience and steak.  Fogo de Chao fit the bill perfectly. We walked in and found ourselves walking past the salad bar which was on the side of a huge dining area where men with giant skewers of meat were quickly weaving in and out of tables.  We were surprised to find another two rooms for dining in the rear of the restaurant - this place is huge! So we sat down, ordered our wine (you have to have a bottle of red to go with all the steak), and headed up to the salad bar.  We filled our plates halfway, then returned to our table.  The we both turned our buttons from red to green, and several men with steak, lamb, pork, steak, and more steak showed up.  So we piled on. The fillet mignon was outstanding, but for me, the lamb chops were the best.  I've never had such good lamb chops in my entire life!  Also provided with the meal were mashed potatoes, polenta, and fried bananas, all of which were very good. We had a great dining experience, but in retrospect I would have done some things differently.  First, there is a menu that shows what meats are offered.  When I go back (and I will), I will peruse that menu before I turn my chip to green.  I'll make sure I know what I want and get that instead of just accepting whatever meats arrive.  I ended up not trying the lamb chops until I was full, and found that they were the best part of the whole meal for me.  Wow, I wish I would have known that sooner - I would have had several of those, and less of other cuts of meat. All in all though, this was a great place to eat, and more than that, an experience you will remember.  If your wife is also a carnivore, I would recommend this restaurant for a special occasion dinner.  Though not really a romantic atmosphere, it's definitely a fun place to eat!
