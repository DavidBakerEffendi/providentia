Such a great Brooklyn Diner experience, my sweet potato pancakes with strawberries and root beer float were glorious... I love the service here, while waiting in line we were even offered slices of orange, ginger biscuits and water. AND I saw the Suzanne Vega lyrics and autograph on the wall, is it really THE Tom's Diner?
