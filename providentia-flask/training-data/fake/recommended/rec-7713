So everyone is always talking about how legendary this place is and that it's a MUST New York thing. Decided to have a quick bite before meeting up with a friend the other day. The interior of the store is simple with a bit of history. The servers are all Hispanic but the Bartender wasn't which was good to add onto the American authenticity of the place. I ordered the signature Bistro Burger with Fries. I always get my meat done Medium Rare. The food came out in less than 10 minutes. The Burger was good but nothing super memorable and Fries were rather small but tasty. Basically it's a large beef patty with Bacon and American Cheese with onions, lettuce, and tomatoes with 2-3 sliced pickles. Service here is OK but understandable since this isn't a fancy place or anything like that. It's quite touristy since I saw many European and Japanese tourists while I was here. Downside probably is that the prices have gone waayyy up. For people waiting to try this place out, as of 2012 these are the prices (I'm breaking it down to make it easier): Bistro Burger: $7.75 Fries: $2.50 Diet Coke: $2.50 _______________ Total: $12.75+ Tax: $1.25 +Tip $2 = GRAND TOTAL: $16 I don't really think the price for the food I got was worth it. For $16, I would eat brunch at a nice restaurant down in Lower East Side with Table Service. Still think Shake Shack is MUCH MUCH Better.
