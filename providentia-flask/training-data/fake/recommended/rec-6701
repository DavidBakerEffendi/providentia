I tried this place for the first time with two of my school buddies.  I got a super cinnamon bagel w/ walnut raisin cc, toasted. It was really good! I highly recommend it. It was soft and sweet to my tasting. Got a chocolate milk to satisfy the sweetness.  Definitely a four star place only because I like my bagels filled wit a lot of cc but they barely gave me any cc =(. Anyways my friend got a pizza bagel which was really good also. It had gooey cheese with a soft bagel to go with it. All in all my experience at this cafe was great!
