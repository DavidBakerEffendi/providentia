I tried this place with a girlfriend. We were very much into talking, but our waiter was very patient with us. He explained everything we asked. They have a decent wine list. We tried three diferent cheeses. They come with grapes, nuts, jelly. It was delicious. The shrimp salad lacked flavor. I had trufle Gnocchi, which was delicious.
