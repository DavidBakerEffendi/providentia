I'm not really a "see and be seen" kind of girl. That said, give me a sunny 75-degree afternoon, an outdoor table across from Rittenhouse Square, and a delightful little cheese plate, and I'm game for pretty much anything.  While not personally my aesthetic, Parc is without question attractive: its decor, its food, its people; and while we invested only in a few cocktails and a cheese plate, both were up to snuff.  Our waiter was cheerful and balanced attentiveness with allowing us to linger quite deftly.  However, I'm not sure a cheese plate can truly carry the weight of more than 3 stars, and the cloud of pretension that hangs over the place is 2 stars worth of 'no thank you.'
