This place just got a fan. Stopped in for some suds and a bite last night after a viewing, so we were just looking to relax, cheer up, and unwind, and Kite & Key delivered. Huge beer list leaning heavily on the craft, especially in draft form, and I was extremely happy with the Dirty Bastard; normally when a bar has such variety I hop from beer to new beer, but last night I stuck with that dark s.o.b. for long haul. Food options were appealing, but as a swine lover I had to give their pulled pork a try. Sandwich comes with some shoestring fries that I should have upgraded to the soup du jour, but that was on me and my indecisiveness. As for the sammy, it is loaded with very tender meat, though I didn't get any crispy crust, but sometimes that's a good thing. They also throw a healthy and tasty dose of long hots on the pork that brought the perfect amount of heat to my eats, and, even if it's not my preferred style, a gooey slice of provolone that helped tie it all together. Friends got the garlic wings, which were very good (not so crispy, which I like, so some of you may need to ask for them well done), with a sweet and very mildly spicy sauce that had lots of breath destroying flavor. We also got a plate of nachos that was okay and great to pick at, but nothing was overly special about them. I really liked K&K, from the warm interior to the quite comfortable booth I sat in, the night was a success. The only small complaint I'd have was our server being a little strange: his service was timely and attentive, but a few times he came over to ask if we needed anything and when we said yes and turned to get the attention of a friend who didn't see his arrival, by the time we turned back he had drifted off. Still, we were never left wanting for very long, so it is a mild complaint at most.
