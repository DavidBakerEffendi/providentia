The greatest place in New York City. This establishment represents the vibe in the Big Apple. The food is amazing, and that is a given. Plus, you can go without your girlfriend! You will meet the coolest and nicest people on earth. Met a wonderful couple here. We chatted for a long time and I shared my wine. They took me to La Guardia in a brand new Jag at the end of the night. Will never forget it.
