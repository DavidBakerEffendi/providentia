It is hard to find a great meal in midtown- the neighborhood is just full of soups and dry overpriced sandwiches. So, it is great to find a restaurant like Caffe Linda close by! I ordered the penne pasta with sausage and I would have taken a picture of the yumminess, but I ate it before I had the chance. Really good food! My brain was most definitely in its happy place while I was eating this food. It is a little expensive...but what the hell, today is payday. Also, the waitstaff is pleasant, and our server had pretty eyes that were the shade of the ocean.
