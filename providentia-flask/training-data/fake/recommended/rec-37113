The place was awesome. Food was great and the drinks were pretty good and unique. The only problem was that there weren't much room and it was pretty packed. The music was okay... nothing to be pumped about. I just didn't know what I was listening to (songs I have never heard of and they were mostly remixes of old songs) and it was pretty loud too. There were like one or two people dancing on the extremely small dance floor. I went there for my birthday last year and even though the place wasn't made for a big group of people who wanted to dine and drink, we had a table and the workers over there were very accommodating. The people who work there were very nice and friendly. My group ordered so many drinks and dishes throughout the night. Our bill didn't come out to be as high as we thought. (they probably knocked down half the price) And we had complementary shots. Overall, it is a great place and I would go back there again, just for the food and drinks. They should really do something about the music though.
