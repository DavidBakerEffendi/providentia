$6 burgers?  With cheese and BACON?  Oh yes, please! I came for dinner around 5:30 (we actually went in around 5:45 not because there was a wait--there wasn't at all!--but we were both running a tad late).  We were seated after we caught the eye of the server behind the bar, and seated at some ghetto booth with wooden seats and flies buzzing EVERYWHERE.   There's no menu save for the one posted on the wall and it's TINY.  Just a few items and their prices.  After the server started listing the ingredients that go on the Bistro Burger, we stopped him at "bacon" and ordered two.  We passed on the shoestring fries (the only way they serve them).   The food came literally within 5 minutes.  I'm not sure how they did that, but it came hot.   The burger was bigger than my fist.  No, take that back, it came bigger than BOTH my fists.  The patty was at least twice the thickness of my palm, and it was topped with a bit o' lettuce and tomato.  And bacon.  Three glorious crispy strips just  begging to be crunched.   It did not disappoint.  For a burger with that much meat, with cheese AND bacon, for that price, you could easily afford a beer or two or 5.   Will definitely be coming back.
