On my recent trip to NYC I came across this place on a rainy afternoon. I walked in pleased by ambiance, and asked for a table for 2. My cousin and I sat, and were waited on immediately. Fresh bread basket with delicious butter and ice cold water was given to us along with our menus. As I read the menu, I couldn't really decide on one single item. French onion soup, a sandwich, a salad, seafood perhaps? HMMM...Well I was just really hungry so I gave their grilled chicken sandwich with frites a try. When I got my sandwich it was warm, on thick crusty bread with a nice side of frites. I liked this place so much I went back to have the french onion soup. It was a little toooo cheesy for me but the flavor was right on. This is a nice place for lunch with friends, or dinner with the parents and the significant other.
