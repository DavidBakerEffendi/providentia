Have been in Rahway for 3 years but have never been to the Waiting Room.  One time the wife and I walked in and it was too dark for her, so we bailed.  On a recent Friday evening, we wanted to go someplace within walking distance, so we tried the Waiting Room.  Plenty of tables, although there were a couple of big (noisy) groups.  We sat and someone was there immediately took our drink order and it came fast (just soft drinks). A waiter took our meal order and salads came pretty quick.  The salads were decent, nothing special.  We both ordered the ribs, except I got a full rack.  Ended up taking half the order home! It's a little loud inside, but not too bad.  We will probably be back.
