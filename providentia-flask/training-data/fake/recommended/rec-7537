Went for dinner with friends, the atmosphere is nice, the band was good but unfortunately the food wasn't. Â We ordered four appetizers to share and each a main. The calamari was not edible but was gladly returned and deducted, the chicken Caesar was horrible, chicken was very dry, in another trial it was ok but wouldn't order it again. My advice, stay in the lounge area for drinks and a light appetizer. Finally the chocolate souffle 13$ not good either, over cooked and dry. After calling to complain to the manager that didn't visit our table during our dinner, we got a gift card to retry the place. Went yesterday for lunch, another horrible experience, my husband returned his plate. I think we are done with thei place.
