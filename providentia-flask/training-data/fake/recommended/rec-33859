If you're looking for a review of the food at Xochitl (so-cheet), don't look at this poor kid. I can't afford to eat here. Don't get me wrong, after seeing sizzling plates of peppers and meat and cheese go by at this place, I'm dying to try the food. But unless some handsome suitor wants to sweep me off my feet with a Xochitl meal (any takers?), I won't be eating there anytime soon. What I really want to talk about... is margs. Every night. Xochitl lounge. Happy Hour. Half priced margs. Now if you scoff at the thought of a cheap margarita costing $5, hold your snide comments until you try one. They make them with just the essentials: tequila, cuantro, fresh squeezed lime, and ice. No sour mix to kill your stomach later on. They're delicious. And they're kickin. Just a warning though... one margarita is never enough, but three is usually too many. Learned that the hard way. If anything, go just to see the British bartender downstairs. Talk about tall drink of water. Er... tequila.
