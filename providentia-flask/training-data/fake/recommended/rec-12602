Hands-down, THE best breakfast place in NYC. Be prepared to wait when you go here. I had read in an article that the food is "anything but ordinary," and let me tell you. they were right! They use cage-free eggs and chickens, as well as local produce that tastes so fresh! I have honestly NEVER had eggs benedict that tasted so heavenly! The hollandaise was so creamy and flavorful, and the entire meal just melts in your mouth. I also had a hot chocolate, which was so velvety and perfectly sweetened. NOTE: they also have the best pancakes in town! They are extremely fluffy and definitely filling. It is my #1 must-have in NYC.
