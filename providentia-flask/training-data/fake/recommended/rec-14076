I could just be giving it 5 stars because it was 4 am and I was drunk and starving, but remembering chicken and rice right now is making me drool! Tim L. is right; the hot sauce is CRAZY. What I did was cover my aluminum plate in white sauce squiggles and then only a single line of hot sauce; don't forget to mix it up! Otherwise you end up like my friend with a whole mouthful of hot sauce and chicken that you have to spit out. Thank god for the $1 water bottle cart ten feet away. The chicken is delicious, the rice is cooked well (and not hard or gross) and I can't live without the white sauce. I would've taken home the rest of my food back to my hotel if we had a microwave just so I could eat it in the morning. This place also had about 100 people in line at 4 am! Ridiculous! Definitely a place to try after bar-hopping or clubbing; I think we were catching a crowd of NYU students who had just finished finals. I am definitely coming back when I'm in NYC - if only it were in LA!
