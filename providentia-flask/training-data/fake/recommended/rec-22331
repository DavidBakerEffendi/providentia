I normally am not up for waiting more than 30 mins to get seated but we had nothing better to do on a Friday night in the thriving metropolis of Milford, CT... So we plopped ourselves at the bar & waited... 1 hour later, we were seated. Now I have to say if not for the ridiculous hour long wait I'd give this place a solid 4 stars. Decor was pretty cool, the service was great, & the food was on point. The Veggie burger was up there with some of my favorites and the sweet potato fries were divine. My boyfriend ordered the most monstrous, delicious looking meaty burger that he devoured in record time. If I was a huge meat eater, I'm sure it would have rocked my world. Needless to say, I recommend this place for sure, just be ready to wait.
