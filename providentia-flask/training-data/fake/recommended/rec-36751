Very cool atmosphere, especially cavernous, like Phantom of the Opera, downstairs. Solid menu and fresh ingredients -- I've never been disappointed in the three times I've been here. True, there's nothing radical or inventive in terms of the dishes, but solid always. I've had the chicken wrapped in prosciutto and with fontina cheese on a Tuesday, a special that was yummy. There is a daily risotto that has always been good. We like the melon with proscuitto starter (can you tell I like prosciutto)? Great place for groups or for date night with that NY dramatic feel. The prices are reasonable as well. Again, this is no culinary masterpiece haven but good food and good times
