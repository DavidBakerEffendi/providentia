This place was incredible. Literally one of the best meals I've had all year. We made a reservation to be on the safe side (even Sunday night it filled up) for 7:30. We got there a little early and were promptly seated. The waitstaff was very attentive and professional throughout the meal. For dinner, we each had pasta dishes. I had the rigatoni with sausage and peppers in marinara sauce. Fresh and delicious. Perfect big portion. My entire plate was cleaned. This dish was excellent and I would definitely order it again. My boyfriend had the gnocchi with 12 hour cooked braised beef(?). It was by far the best gnocchi I've ever had. My boyfriend, an avid gnocchi eater, said it was the best he's had in the last 5-6 years, and insisted we come here every Sunday from now on. Just incredible. Out of this world. Plus, the sauce was delicious. For dessert, I ordered the tiramisu, and my boyfriend ordered the creme brûlée. I thought the tiramisu was fantastic, homemade, deliciousness. However, the creme brûlée was to die for. AMAZING. All in all, everything was fantastic and homemade. Giorgio himself comes around to every table to check on patrons, which is a nice touch. Waitstaff was great. Food was heaven. Can't wait to come back :)
