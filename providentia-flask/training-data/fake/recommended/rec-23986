Ideally, this would be a 4.5 star rating. Xochitl has become our go to for birthday dinners. I've eaten here three time, twice for their Day of the Dead menu. The four course $35, prefixe menu has always been a charmer. Along with the guacamole made tableside in the mortar and pestle. Everytime I leave stuffed, and fully satisfied. To clarify, this is not what I would classify as 'mexican food.' For that I walk five blocks in any direction in south philly, and find myself with a bangin meal for under ten. Xochitl is more of a haute-mexican, with old style flavors. Just don't come expecting a burrito. EDIT: Okay, they changed their menu. Not cool.
