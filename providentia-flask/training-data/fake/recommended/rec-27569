This is basically a Korean deli. It is not the absolute best Korean food in K-town, but it offers decent versions of all the basics at good prices. I come here when I'm passing by K-town by myself and want to take some Korean food home. They have a good selections of side dishes to pick from and individual portions of rice in the warmer. It's easy to get a bunch of things for $10 and make two meals out of it. There are four sections from which to grab food: a hot buffet that costs $6.99/lb; prepackaged warm foods (like dukkbeogi and kimchi fried rice); a hot soup station; cold packaged foods, like kimbap, kimchi, porridge and side dishes. Since I usually take things to go I tend to grab from the cold food station. Their myeolchi (sardines) is really good, as is their kimchijeon (kimchi pancake). The former is only $3 and the latter $2. This should give you an idea of how affordable it is. Once again-- this is certainly not the best food in ktown. If you want better kimchi, or noodles, or dukkbeogi or kimbap, etc, you can find it somewhere else. But for the vast selection at these prices, Woorijip is a find. I wouldn't take a friend here for lunch, but I will continue to go here when I am in a rush and want some cheap (and relatively tasty) Korean food.
