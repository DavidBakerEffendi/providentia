This Chinese food is a literally my life. There is no describing how they make it but it's so good that if I could I would marry it. My favorite aspect of  this restaurant is a little kid which is one of the sons of the people that work there who answers the phone in cute voice and asks if he can take my order and then when you go to pick it up your order he is there  too. PANDA HOUSE CHINESE FOOD IS THE BEST CHIESE FOOD EVER
