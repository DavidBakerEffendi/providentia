GREAT!!!  Great specialty pizza, great prices, fast and courteous service.  What else could you ask for?! Make sure you order one of the pizzas off the menu -- don't order a "pepperoni & mushroom".  We had the Joey and it was fantastic.  If I lived in Philly I would be eating here at least a couple times per month.
