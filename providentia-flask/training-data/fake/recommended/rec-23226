I've been to [the new] Dim Sum Garden about five times.  I really want to give it 3.5 stars because I feel it's slowly slipping due to the high volume of people it gets.  Basically what I'm trying to say is that this Dim Sum Garden has a nice location, ambiance, and great food selection; however the quality of the food that really counts ie xiaolongbaos (soup dumplings) and scallion pancakes has slowly decreased. For the first couple of visits I thought I wouldn't return to the original Dim Sum Garden.  The restaurant was new, clean, and organized and the food was comparable to the original restaurant.  Waiters seemed to be more attentive than the original restaurant and were careful to get orders correct.  They also have started pushing "special" dishes of late.  Last visit I got a peanut noodle dish which, while good, was overpriced in my opinion (and my mom makes better). However the soup dumplings have lost some of their lustre of late.  I've found that the dough of the soup dumpling has become increasingly thick.  While this is nice for keeping the soup dumplings from spilling out prior to you eating them, it's a lazy preparation and not how good soup dumplings are prepared.  They are still very tasty, but if we're rating soup dumplings against soup dumplings this isn't a favorable characteristic.  I've also gotten what I'd consider "underfried" scallion pancakes where its not just completely fried through and a little soggy on the inside.   All in all this is still one of the better restaurants in Chinatown simply because of the xiaolongbao offering, but I've since started to frequent the original restaurant again.
