Horrendous, lazy service. My girlfriend and I wanted to order a quick bite to eat before a commitment we had to attend, but our order took entirely too long. When we changed our order to go, it took even longer to receive and the staff treated this as a nuisance. There were less than 20 people in the restaurant, yet we saw the chefs roll their eyes. When we finally got our bag, it looked like a takeout plastic bag from a food truck and was dripping from the bottom. Considering the food is overpriced anyways, I expected a little more presentation or at least silverware to enable us to eat our meals. We live in the area and will not be returning.
