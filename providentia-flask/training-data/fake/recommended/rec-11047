wow! what shall I say? We visited it 3 times within a week. Our friends brought their friends over there after they tried out the dishes. I was shocked to find such a great Chinese/Fusion restaurant here in Philly. The restaurant is clean and modern. The atmosphere feels great. The staff are nice, although during busy nights, they did get a little overwhelmed. We ordered spicy schuan dishes, like spicy beef and stripes, dandan noodle, mini wonton in chili oil, ma po toufu, string beans, fish fillet in hot sauce, all great! Every time we went there, we over-ate. :)) We haven't tried the fusion dishes so I can't give recommendations. But the spicing schuan dishes are awesome! must try! :) This is really a great business model all Chinese restaurants shall follow - clean and modern environment, great food, warm staff, and yet very affordable!
