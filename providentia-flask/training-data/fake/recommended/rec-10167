You should all check this place out if you're a local in NYC and you're craving some Thai food. The food was pretty good. We had the pad thai, pork chop, some kind of curry,and pineapple fried rice. First of all, the thai food here is not as authentic, in fact, I'd classify it as fusion. However, it's really good and it still left our mouths watering. The pad thai was good and the pork chop reminded me a lot about the Korean bbq dish - Kalbi. The meat could've been more tender, but it was definitely on the plus side. The curry was good but covered in bell peppers, so if you don't enjoy that, I wouldn't suggest getting it. The pineapple fried rice was my highlight of the day. It doesn't come in a pineapple shell like it does in many places, but it had just the right mix of sweet and flavor. The thai iced tea was on the minus side. A bit sweet, but it comes in a nice tall glass. I'd go with a different drink though. Overall - great place to check out. Wait staff are friendly, it's bustling, and it's a well-kept place for a good price. Each main dish ranges from $10-20 but you can definitely share.
