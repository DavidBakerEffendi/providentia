Love the craft cocktails and apps. This is my go to place for after work drinks out of the downtown hustle. The entrees are a bit pricy for me though I have been to the Mother's Day brunch. Ok for the first time but expected more from a brunch. Ask the bartenders to make you something special! Great Vermont liquors!
