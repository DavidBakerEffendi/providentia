Overpriced! I came here on a Monday night and the bill for two people came to about $100 total for an appetizer, entree, and drink for each of us. I had the corn elote appetizer. It was more like watery salsa with a few corn kernels in it. I was debating asking for chips or something to eat it with. For an entree, I got the coconut plantain stew. It was supposed to have other veggies in it. It did not. It was plantains in sauce. After 2 bites it was just too much mushy banana-esque. I felt like I was eating baby food. My friend's chicken was good. She enjoyed it. Nothing amazing, nothing bad. Then again, it's chicken. Pretty standard. The sangria was lackluster. Seemed like they made it as an afterthought. It wasn't bad, but nothing good either. I'd stick to wine or beer. The food wasn't bad or horrible, but it definitely wasn't amazing. The restaurant just looks cute from the outside. I just don't get all the 4 and 5 star reviews. I feel like most of thes reviews are because the place is a cute Brooklyn brownstone. There is no way the food is 5 stars. I equate 5 stars to Momfuku or Per Se, meals that are unforgettable. I saw a review that says this is the person's favorite restaurant in New York. Â Seriously? Have you eaten out anywhere besides Time Square?
