I've been meaning to go here, but sometimes I just don't feel like spending a minimum of $10 for a meal, much less for lunch. Being how I'm going to be in the Bloomfield area longer than I originally planned, I figure it's inevitable that I try this place. Upon entering, you have to snake your way inside. This is actually good for those windy days. It makes the inside a little tight, but in the end it's worth it. However, it was a beautiful 80 degrees and breezy. I definitely had to dine outside. At first I tried ordering octopus meatballs. Unfortunately, they didn't have any due to unforeseen circumstances. I had a dozen different possibilities play out through my head, but either way, I had to move on. It's best they were honest and didn't end up serving overcooked or worse, dropped food. I ended up with the seafood salad. Octopus, squid, shrimp all grilled to perfection served over some greens. I don't remember there being feta or dolmades. Those are ubiquitous when it comes to Greek salads and quite honestly, I very much look forward to those yummy items. Helping me get in and out of there during my short lunch break was the very friendly and accommodating staff. Along the way, I was on my cell talking, asking for a pen and paper, etc. I was pretty bad. Quite frankly, I would have been annoyed with me. But they stood resilient. To top it off, I grabbed some delicious ouzo candy (non-alcoholic I think).
