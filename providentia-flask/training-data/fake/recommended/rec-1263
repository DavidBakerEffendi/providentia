This place is a pain to get to, and a pain to park. I knew that going into it, and I went anyway - straight from the airport, since I was staying in Jersey (tip: don't try to book a hotel the same week as the US Open). The staff could tell I was midwestern right off the bat which isn't too hard of a skill, but impressive enough (I did say Chei-cah-go, so that may have given it away). They were friendly in a gruff, hurry up and get out of the way way, but I think a lot of the northeast is like that. I just got a steak with extra wiz and it stayed toasty on my long dark drive across the river. And it was delicious in that you-need-to-try-it-even-though-its-a-tourist-trap-Â­and-probably-not-as-good-as-you-think way. I thought it was great. Yes, it may not be the best steak in the area, but definitely lived up to what I had hoped it would be. Worth trying.
