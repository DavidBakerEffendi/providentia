Nice Irish pub, with great atmosphere and a delicious menu.  The service was quick and friendly.  The setup for the place is a little weird however.  In the middle of bar are these tables with lazy Susan looking elevated center tops.  This would make sense in a pizza or Chinese place...not in a Irish pub.  Also were bizarre standing only arch way table tops thingys which made the place somewhat of a maze.  But they did have 20 beers on tap and plenty of flat screens to watch the Yankees games.  All in all it was a Okay to Good experience on the Avioli scale.
