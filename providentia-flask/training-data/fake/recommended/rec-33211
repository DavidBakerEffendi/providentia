Hands down my FAVORITE restaurant in all of Brooklyn. Their happy hour is a great way to try out the menu, but it won't take long for you to decide you love the everything they serve. Not exaggerating... every single thing. I love it because I used to be a vegetarian and they have plenty of meat and meat free options, which suits my sometimes sensitive stomach. I've had all three paellas, and they are all fantastic. My favorite things on the menu are probably the bacon wrapped dates, the romesco dip, and goat cheese croquettes. Hang out with the bartender Thomas and he can describe in detail pretty much every dish. And he mixes a great cocktail! I've also been there for brunch and I really recommend their french toast or green eggs and lamb. Staff is always sweet and attentive, they have a coat rack in the corner so you don't have to drape your stuff over the back of your chair, and they give you little chocolates with your check!
