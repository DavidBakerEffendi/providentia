Ootoya's atmosphere transports me from the bustling streets of New York back to Asia - there's a quiet refinedness that's hard to describe that comes from the plain decor, elegantly presented, simple dishes, and polite but efficient service. Got the salmon saikyo lunch set (as did my friend), but I'd been meaning to check it out Â / eat here every time I come to New York, as my friend's office is next door. The chawanmushi/egg custard was divine - creamy, set perfectly, and still flavorful. I couldn't get enough of it, or the miso soup. The pickled vegetables were also done well and a good contrast to the grilled salmon and the warmth of the rest of the dishes. The salmon was also cooked pretty well - better than I've had at most restaurants, tbh, and then the glaze was delicious. It doesn't look like a lot of food coming out, but I was stuffed at the end, and could barely eat anymore. Docking a point for inconsistent service, but it's something that I'm pretty used to at Asian restaurants for some reason or another..
