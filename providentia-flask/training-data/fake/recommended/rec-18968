From their appetizers to their salads, to their entrees and wine list, everything's a must-try. I fell in love with their Quiches and have been craving for one ever since. Came here with the Besties for my birthday which was a last minute decision and I'm so glad we did. First off, the mushroom risotto was delicious, nicely prepared however the portion size was considerably small for the price Their Quiches on the other hand were generously portioned. I ordered the Poireaux Quiche; the Leek and Gruyere combination was phenomenon. I'll also highly recommend their Poulet Quiche, which consisted of Chicken, manchego, tomatoes & shallots. Even if you're not a fan of salads (like me..and maybe never will be), the Juliette Salad was absolutely amazing and will, for sure, change your mind! The salad came with chorizos (Spanish sausages) and perfectly cooked boiled eggs, with a Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing. Everything was full of flavor and decently priced and I'd say every penny was well worth it. All in all, I'm excited to go back, maybe the next time I'll bring someone special with me ; )
