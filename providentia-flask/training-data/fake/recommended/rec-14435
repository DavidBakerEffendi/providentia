Ok before I get to the good here is the bad....the waiting is terrible but the food is the best!! So call in your order! The Israeli salad is awesome but the Greek Salad is bigger and better... Their falafel is the best I have ever had!  I more of a traditional person but have tried the other two flavors and they too are amazing.   The falafel platter or the sandwich are my go to items on the menu!
