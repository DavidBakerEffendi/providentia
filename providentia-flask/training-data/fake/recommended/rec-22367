"Mexican food" in New Haven... ...that's like saying there's good Chinese food in Alaska - don't count on it! Stopped in for pitchers of sangria, margaritas and platters of nachos. If you're stuck at Yale and you're from the West Coast, this is the best of Mexico that you're going to get until Thanksgiving or Christmas break..if you're from anywhere but the West Coast, please don't use Viva's as a frame of reference of Mexican food - it really is better than this. Dark...divey...with a drunk man sleeping in a chair upon our arrival. Classy... ...but what do you care? Come here with your friends! DON'T bring your parents !
