Simply excellent. This spot is just around the corner from my office. Its kinda' hidden off 3rd Ave towards 2nd Ave. This place doesn't have a full bar so if you want a jack & coke you're probably out of luck. But they do have a vast near complete assortment of beers from Belgium. Kasteel cherry beer (8%). Good stuff. Just for a goof I had something called "Red Streak Apple cider" it was actually good. Every cider I've ever tasted has had that washbucket taste. Not a good thing. The calamari was flawless, melt in your mouth magnificence. And since I was drinking too long I decided to eat dinner here. I had the "Bouchee a la Reine". It was like a really upscale chicken pot pie. It was so good I was kinda angry that it took me years to "find" this place.
