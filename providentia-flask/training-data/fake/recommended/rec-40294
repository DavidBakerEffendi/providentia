Loved this spot!!  Tucked away in an old alley brick street in downtown Hartford.. this is such a cool spot.  The atmosphere is allllll BAR.  So basically, it is what it is.  $3 draft specials and warm bartenders give this place just the right feel.  The pub burger was awesome, too and perfectly cooked to order.  Oh yeah, one huge projection TV in the far end was perfect for sports. Enjoy! -Ian M.
