The server was horrific.  He screwed up my order, and brought me out a completely different entree then what I had asked for.  I decided it wasn't a big deal, and told him I'd eat instead of waiting around for another ridiculously long time.  He was indifferent and just flat-out rude.  Overpriced and just boring.
