I'm so glad my friend introduced me to this place! Fresh organic foods from farm to table. We ordered 2 appetizers: quinoa salad, tomato and cheese dish.  For entree, I got the mushroom pot pie which was bombarded and 3 different types of mushrooms in a whole wheat crust.   Good place for some organic foods and not feeling fat + guilty after eating.
