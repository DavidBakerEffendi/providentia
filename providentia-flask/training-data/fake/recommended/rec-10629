We love the wood pit. We frequent it when we get a hankering for good smoked southern bbq. I'm half southern and this is new jerseys best barbecue bar none. We bring friends here and recommend it to many. Our favorites are the pork ribs and brisket. I love the candied yams and corn bread. The owner is a lovely man and its a family business you're delighted to support. Highly recommend it
