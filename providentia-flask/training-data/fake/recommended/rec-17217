Cuban Pete's does not disappoint.  Just don't expect a quiet dinner.  If you come here it's for the party atmosphere, and as you walk down the corridor you are transported to a new world with great food and drinks.  Go wild!  I lean more towards the fish dishes as there is only so much you can do with beef.  I can't wait to visit again and again.
