I was tempted to go to Traif for dinner...until Cassandra M. mentioned Rye and her trusty BlackboardEats coupon. Discount? I'm in! We hopped into my car and drove over from the LES happily listening and humming to Sara Bareilles tunes. We walked into a gorgeous, dimly lit restaurant. Rye, once a factory, was fully restored (walls, ceiling, floor) and even obtained a 100 year old oak bar. What does that even mean and how do you do that? I don't know, but I'm impressed. The restaurant was empty but it was around 5:30 PM on a Sunday so no false pretense that this place was intentionally being avoided. We were being early birds with huge appetites ready to ravage some tasty morsels created by Chef Cal Elliott. Entrees (average price ~$25): House Smoked Fresh Bacon - grilled berkshire pork belly, brussel sprouts, white beans & lemon confit. + 3 HUGE, GENEROUS, JUICY, FATTY pieces of pork belly. I was a bit overwhelmed when I saw how much fat was actually on my plate. Okay, I was REALLY flabbergasted. Cass basically told me shut up and eat it. The savory, succulent, fatty juices exploded in my mouth and easily slipped down my throat. The brussel sprouts were also cooked well and had a nice crunch to eat bite. Would I order this again? YES. All Natural Chicken - sage butternut squash, pancetta risotto, swiss chard. + I appreciated and loved that the chicken was cooked perfectly and flavored well. The swiss chard was also heavenly and complimented each bite of chicken. Would I order this as my entree on my next visit? YES. I also ordered the shot and beer combo for $6. No cocktails or meatloaf/pork belly/short rib sandwiches this time around but they are definitely on my to eat/drink list. Especially since the sandwiches only run you $12-15. Reason #4325 to move to Brooklyn: Rye
