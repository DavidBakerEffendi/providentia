I ate here for the first time this past weekend, and I was pleasantly surprised. I had been going to a place that was recommended in Montclair. However, a sub-par experience there drove me to trying something new. Kamal palace is priced very competitively. The Food is excellent, and portion sizes are comparable to other Indian restaurants. We had Chana Masala (not on the menu directly, but they accommodated use) and Sag Panir. We also had the Veggie Sampler and plain naan. Everything was excellent, even the rice was cooked well and barely clumped together. The service is excellent here: they are very attentive, and they did not overlook any parts of our experience. Further, they provided the appetizer and waited until we were finished to bring the dinners. Only negative thing is it's a bit dim as far as lighting. I think some might like this. It wasn't overly distracting. The place was clean. Although the Parking lot is shared an a tad small, there are spots nearby on a side-street. I will certainly return.
