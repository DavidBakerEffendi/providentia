This is hands down my most favorite dining experience of all time!!!!! Setting: 1920's prohibition-era speakeasy with LIVE smooth jazz playing on stage. Music was enjoyable but not so loud that it interferes with dinner conversation. There's a smokey air to the room but I would bet it's a water-based vapor b/c there was no smell or effect on your breathing. Staff: The servers and entertainers are all super professional and I'm pretty sure they're all actors. They're dressed in costume and all seem so suave and debonair. Our waiter, Ed, was out of this world fantastic! He was pleasantly sarcastic and quick-witted. He had great menu suggestions and really seemed to love his job. Food: AH-MAZE-ING!!!!!! We ordered a little of everything for the appetizers, our own entrees and then split the desserts. I had the New England Chowder and my friend had the Scallops. No joke, I'm sure the dishwasher thinks we licked our plates clean. SO FANTASTIC Entertainment: Right as we were ordering dessert, one of the actors handed me an envelope containing directions and a key and I was instructed to discreetly leave the table. Since we were NOT attending "Sleep no more", I was surprised they included this experience. It was just a taste of the show and definitely made me want to go back for more. After Dinner: The rooftop was great for after-dinner drinks. They have multiple bars and it's quite beautiful with the garden and decor.
