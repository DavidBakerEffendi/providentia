In order to avoid bias, I will be brief in summing up the brunch experience: 11am on Sunday + 1.5 hours (seriously!) wait + good food = not worth it 11am on Sunday + 1.5 hours wait + good food + great weather + great friends to talk to while waiting = no regrets Next time we'll go someplace more reasonable though.
