I don't get the hang-up on authenticity.  I love the ssam dish here.  Sure it's not traditional ssam, but who cares?   Momofuku swapped out, one-for-one, the ingredients for a carnitas burrito.  Instead of carnitas, there's braised pork.  Instead of yellow rice there's white; instead of black or pinto beans there is edamame; instead of salsa there's kimchee.  The result is surprising and delicious.  I don't think anyone should attempt to use *authenticity* as a metric for this creation because it should be obvious that this is supposed to be something new.   Other dishes were remarkable.  Living in Northern California, I thought I had tried every incarnation of an artichoke dish, but the fried baby artichokes were a new level of good.  Pairing it with anchovies is not intuitive, and it worked.   But Momofuku did falter a little in some of the other dishes we tried.  The sea urchin with whipped tofu was almost splendid, but it was overly salted, and the plastic texture of tapioca balls didn't work with the other ingredients.  Also, the strawberry shortcake was uninspired.  There was another dish, too, but I can't remember it, which I guess says something about the dish.
