wow!!! the drinks are incredible!! i am so glad i researched where to go for my week long trip to nyc. if you like to drink(trust me) you will absolutely love this place! the food is just as great. try the bacon wrapped lamb chops or better yet...the elk loin! the crowd is cool and i enjoyed the music and atmosphere. a perfect place to go for a first date or to hang out with friends to drink. my server yael was great and kept the drinks coming. the drinks...i recommend the vesper(especially if you are a fan of 007). the yellowjacket has a nice kick and i quickly understood how it probably got it's name. for your date, get here the mara hari. this place takes bartending to another level. the only minor issue was the guy working the door with the sailor hat. he needs to be more professional. i was asked if i was there for drinks or dinner and i stated both. he replied by saying "no, seriously?" i told him i had a reservation and then he escorted me inside as if he did not believe me. i will be back next year in nyc and will return to this place at least once. open similar in l.a.!!
