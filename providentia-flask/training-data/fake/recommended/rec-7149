Really fun place to hang out, especially during the day when it's sunny and not crowded. Pros: -Most of all, the venue! Tons of picnic tables, very open space, with Jenga and ping pong. It was a nice day and we really enjoyed sitting basically outside. It was a great way to spend a lazy Saturday afternoon with friends. -Drinks! I enjoyed the beer, and also a S'more milkshake with Jack Daniels... wow. With a toasted marshmallow to boot! Cons: -Kind of far from most of my life. And it was a little pricey for the area. -The food menu wasn't very extensive, and I was starving (because, you know, it took an hour to get there :) ) -It was windy and the umbrellas kept falling over onto tables. Really?
