The food is pretty good, but service was really strange. At brunch, my friend ordered the same waffle, but I have a nut allergy so I asked for mine without the walnuts. My waffle came out with berries on top, his did not. He asked for berries and about 15-20 longgg minutes later, the server brought out a little dish of sliced melons. So weird. Not my first choice for brunch in the area, but I would go back.
