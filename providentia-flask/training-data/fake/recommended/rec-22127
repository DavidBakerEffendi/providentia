My second and most recent visit to Print was on Jan 1st, dinning with my husband. Our waiter (Patrick H.) was fantastic - very personable and knowledgeable about items on the menu, his recommendations really helped us choose between a few items that we were undecided on. Additionally, Reyna the restaurant manager, helped us choose a very nice wine to pair with our meal. I had the grilled quail and then the roasted rabbit for my main course. My husband had the goat cheese gnocchi followed by the duck breast. Everything was absolutely delicious! Amazing service and the atmosphere is perfect for friends, family or a date. All in all I would highly recommend Print. Delicious food and a warm and attentive staff all add up to a wonderful experience.
