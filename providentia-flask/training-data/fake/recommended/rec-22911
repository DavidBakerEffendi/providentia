Excellent thai food. I'd really give them a 4.5, but since that's not possible, I'll round up!  I got the yellow curry, which was super spicy, but had incredible flavor.  My mom is a huge pho tom fan and she said there's was the best she's had. My mom left her credit card there and didn't figure it out until the next day. The manager was super sweet and had it ready for us when we stopped by.  Anyway, a really great stop if you're in the area.
