Can't beat the $8 lunch even on weekends.  However, do not go for a quick bite.  Sat own for a 1 15 reservation. Waited 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us. Table that was seated next to us left in frustration. We had 3pm theatre TKTS so had plenty of time.  AYCD on Sunday brunch is only mimosas .. Not the overpriced cocktails. Food was just OK.  Coffee was horrible. Biggest complaint is when I arrived I used the restroom. Restaurant was still empty.  Told server no toilet paper.   Prior to leaving 2. 1/2 hours later ..used restroom again.. Still no toilet paper. won't be back.  Lots of much better Thai in area. Rather pay a few dollars more for better service and food. Also much smaller than pics appear. Tables are on top of each other.
