Not Good.  I ordered a plain pizza for delivery.  First of all the pizza was thin like a piece of paper.  IT COULD NOT EVEN HOLD THE SAUCE, which by the way was tasteless as if a can of crushed tomatoes was poured.  Full price for a pizza that was so thin?  I couldn't get over how thin it was, as if the owner was trying to save money and make two pies out of one.  Well I wont order from here again and will tell everyone to never order from here.  Lots of good places to get a pie.
