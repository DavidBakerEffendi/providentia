This place is amazing! It's cute and casual; nice for a meal with friends and suitable for a date. The first thing you notice is the charming decor that sets the ambiance of a quaint town in France, where you can enjoy delicious crêpes for your entrée and dessert. As for the food, it  was filling and delicious. I ordered the Bergere (goat cheese, swiss, fig, honey, caramelized onions, rosemary). Every bite was full of delectable flavors! ^_^ This is a place you must try, especially if you live in NY. I've gotten friends who visit NY to eat here and they love the food and the experience.   I'm definitely going back soon!
