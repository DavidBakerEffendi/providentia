Had my birthday dinner here with 12 of my friends and the service and food was fantastic. They were very accommodating and the $40 prix fixe was perfect amount of food for everyone. The prix fixe consisted of its popular dishes from the restaurant. I also enjoyed the pitchers of sangria although it wasn't very strong. My favorite dishes were the bacon wrapped dates, seafood paella, and lamb meatballs.
