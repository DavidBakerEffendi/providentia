Pepe Rosso is where you go when you're in SOHO or the honkytonk part of the Village near NYU and you just want to find a quick, affordable, no-frills, hearty meal.  This is a real neighborhood place, off the tourist radar.  It is called Pepe Rosso To Go for a reason, as the seating is very limited and quite cramped.  If you want to sit down and eat there, you know what you are getting yourself into.  As long as you accept the close company and see it as part of the Pepe's charm, you will have a good experience.  Also remember you are in SOHO, so there is always a classic NYC stoop or stair nearby too and on some nice nights, sitting on a stoop with your penne is a true NYC experience, especially with views of the Empire State Building from Sullivan St.  Service is fairly quick whether you are dining in or taking out.  I have only had the pasta dishes and all have been tasty, with al dente pasta, good natural sauce, and lots of real garlic (plus bread).  All in all, a great place for a delicious, cheap bite to eat. I'm a big fan of their "no diet coke, no skim milk, only real food" ethos too.
