Their meatball sandwiches are popular but I chose the mix and match meal: classic beef meatballs with spicy meat sauce, mashed potatoes, daily greens, sides of spaghetti and sauteed broccoli. Note I'm not a meatball fan due to past meals where uneven cooked meatballs ruined the dish and my appetite, so just saying how good the food is here. It was plenty of food and I didn't have space for dessert, only an affogato. I did start with their Manhattan and it was strong. Be careful if you've pregame somewhere else (yelp.com/biz/copper-and-â€¦) before coming here. Similarly, plan accordingly before coming here with your appetite. Go on an empty stomach as you may want to try a lot of things here. Luckily, a local brought us here but it is still easy to find. On a warm summer night, sit outside on the patio if you can. It was warm but luckily we had a breeze. The inside had A/C but I reckon it will cool your meal quickly.
