Classic thin crust pizza. It's hard to expand on over 3000 other reviews but just wanted to say how much we enjoyed it! We came on the Brooklyn Pizza Tour and our host told is that the cheese they use is such good quality you don't get that weird orange oil that you find on other pizzas. The 900 degree oven also allows for the rich flavors without burning the crust.
