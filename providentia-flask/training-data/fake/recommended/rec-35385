The pork buns and Bo Ssam were good, but the rest of the courses (I had the 5 course) didn't wow me.  The pickles were watery, (kimchee was good, though), and there was a bread with sliced prociutto-type dish followed by yet another bread dish (same kind of bread, even) with whipped lard and butter.  Why all the bread?  Also, pork shoulder costs about $1/pound so I think $200 for the Bo Ssam is a big mark-up.  I also didn't care for the oyster+pork pairing.  The cocktails are nice, but they don't give much (priced between $10-$15), and some come with a single gigantic ice cube that almost fills the entire glass, pushing your drink up the sides and giving the illusion that your glass has more liquid than it actually does. It's super loud in there with the music blaring, so I couldn't hear anything anyone at my table was saying.  Also, there is no jacket closet, so your winter jackets get stuffed into the windows at the top of the right wall.  The seats are wooden boxes so you may just want to sit on your jacket anyway...
