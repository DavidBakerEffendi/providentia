Some of the best falafel is the city. But its other options like the chicken and lamb are not to be missed either.   Consistency... a killer hot sauce.. and a meal for under $4 makes this place one that I go back to all the time.   Great for lunch or late night drunk food. Excellent for vegetarians.
