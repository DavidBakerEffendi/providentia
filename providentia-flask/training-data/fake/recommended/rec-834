Criteria for B-day dinner: BYO, casual, and close to home. Melograno met all 3 criteria so we strolled on over on a nice fall evening.  For a Thursday night the place was DEAD. The restaurant can probably hold 70- 80 people and there was only 1 other table occupied in the restaurant. I instantly became nervous but the sweet server helped calm my nerves with her friendly demeanor and knowledge of the menu.  We ordered a pasta dish to share and two entrees and were not surprised when the food came out quickly.  The pasta was excellent and I particularly liked the cream sauce balanced with pancetta and assorted cooked greens (spinach, kale, etc).   My chicken entree was bland and boring but my boyfriend's filet mignon dish was pretty tasty, especially his creamy polenta.   Overall we had a good time but didn't LOVE this place. It was pricey for the small portions we got and nothing really stood out except maybe the pasta dish.  If I came back I would only order pasta.
