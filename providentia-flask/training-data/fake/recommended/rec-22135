A grown up Broccoli rabe with anchovy, hard boiled egg, and Parmesan is to die for and they do a lasagna of the day - genius. I recently did their $30 tasting menu and absolutely recommend it. They'll let you make a few special requests for dishes you know you want to try (did I mention the broccoli rabe?) and it's a great way to sample the rest of the gems scattered throughout the menu. It's just fun to be surprised and brother-sister owners Fabrizio and Jackie are really friendly and will take the time to explain the dishes and ingredients as they bring each plate.
