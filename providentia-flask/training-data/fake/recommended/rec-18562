Excellent food!! We came here for lunch and had to wait a few minutes to be seated as it was quite busy.  Once we were seated, the waiter came after a few minutes and took our order. I had one of the Lunch specials and a cold Sake. The food came reasonably fast as I guess they are used to the lunch time rush. However, the food was cooked well and served well.  The sushi was fresh and the tempora was crispy.  Even the Sake was cool and refreshing. I would definitely come back here for lunch again.
