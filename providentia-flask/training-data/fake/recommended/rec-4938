Went the other day for a quick lunch as I had heard good things about this place .  My friend and I started with the in house made mozzarella.  While the texture was nice , we felt that the sour taste was indicative of a product past its prime.  We each ordered the three course lunch .  My friend ordered the arugula salad and I ordered the pear salad .   While my salad was edible , the arugula was terrible.  I have never seen arugula that yellow at the bottom of the prepackaged salad bags from the grocery store , let alone at a restaurant.   I dont know how the chef let himself let go of that salad to put it on the plate in good conscience.  Fortunately , the sharp, overly acidic salad dressing (also yellow) made eating the salad impossible, so there was no pressure to eat around the yellow arugula.  For the lunch entree , I ordered the duck confit and my friend the vegetable quesadilla. Both came with greasy ,limp, old fries.  Old and cold fries. The duck was wrapped in a tortilla , and was sweet and not appealing at all. i couldn't finish the first of the two roll ups.   But what makes me write this review, what made me so angry and what made us feel really ripped off and almost abused was the veggie quesadilla my friend ordered. The three pieces of vegetables that were in there were dripping in flare up grease.  You know when you're grilling some veggies and you get a major flare up and you have to throw away the vegetable because it gets covered in that black film ? Well, the chef didnt throw it away...he served it to us. It was mean and the taste stayed with me all day. I was so nauseous from that taste that I was sick as soon as I walked into my house.  I want to say that it was mean what the chef put out to us that day. There was no respect for food on our plates and I highly advise not going there.
