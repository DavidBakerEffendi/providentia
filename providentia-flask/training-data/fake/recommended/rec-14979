If you want a fine dining experience without it being far too fancy, Osteria is a great place to go. The rustic atmosphere, unique dishes, and spot-on service makes for a very special evening. I decided on the special that evening, which was a slow roasted pork shoulder with crispy pork skin on top. The pork shoulder was seasoned perfectly and was extremely tender. The crispy pork skin on top was a carnivore's cherry on top of a sunday - crispy, salty, and just plain delicious. Definitely a great place for special occasions or just a nice night out.
