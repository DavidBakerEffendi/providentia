After reading Stephen H's review on the side, no restaurant is perfect. If you get something you believe is not up to par, just send it back and order something else. No need to be a martyr, especially at this restaurant, where their philosophy is "If you are not happy with anything, tell us"  Enough said. Ever dream of walking the board walk going from stand to stand, but being in Essex County, it's a long ride?  Well, your dreams have come true with Calandra's Italian Village. You can strool into the bar/restaurant, stop by the bakery, order a pizza(I suggest the sausage), buy some Italian shirts or jackets, stop by the wine stand to select a case to take home, buy homemade soups and pastas at the refrigerator stand, purchase the best canned Italian tomatoes (Le Fede), have a quick soup and a sandwich at the deli, select drinks or cheeses, and before returning to your daily routine, enjoy homemade ice cream and Italian Gelato.  Make sure you enjoy the very high ceilings with the angels painted in certain places.  Oh, yes, if the weather is nice, you can eat out side.  The deli area has a number of tables so you can enjoy your lunch right there.  Or the pizza you ordered, bring that over to one of the tables and enjoy. I found the restaurant to be 4 Stars and the value excellent.  Good Italian food is not cheap, just like good Kosher food is not cheap. If you do not want quality food, do not come to Calandra's Italian Village. I really enjoy the wines. Make sure you follow them on Facebook and add your email to their coupon list.  They send out coupons weekly and tempt me to drive the 25 miles to use them. That is 25 miles one way.  And sometimes I do.
