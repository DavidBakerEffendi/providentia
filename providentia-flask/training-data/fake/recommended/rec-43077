Wow, I love this place!! I stopped by here last week after dinner because I keep seeing everyone review it. We went up the stairs, and snatched up the last empty table :) Looking through the menu, I seriously wanted to order everything! Finally decided on the sakura flan, but to my dismay the waitress told me that was not available that day. So I got the black sesame creme brulee and my friend go the french toast with red beans. The creme brulee was great, but a bit redundant. It had sesame ice cream on top and the creme brulee sesame filling tasted exactly like the ice cream. However, I am now obsessed with the french toast!! Imagine the most fragrant bakery ever, the creamiest bread that melts in your mouth, mixed with delicious red beans and whipped cream. Oh my god, it is the best ever and it will haunt you for days and make your mouth water just thinking about it!! Yes, I'll definitely be back. They also have an extensive beverage menu that I can't wait to try, and also a dinner set menu that seemed really good.
