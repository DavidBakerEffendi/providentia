Ever since Umami Burger moved to the East Coast, I was SO excited to visit. I kept reading incredible reviews of the burgers and truffle fries. No naturally, I made the trip over this afternoon. I had the original burger ($12) and the smushed potatoes ($4.50). The burger is cooked at the signature medium rare--I usually prefer medium, but this burger was juicy, melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The bun was soft and buttery and the mushrooms, onions, tomato, and parmesan crisp flavors all mixed together wonderfully. On of the best burgers I've ever had. The smushed potatoes were meaty potatoes smashed and fried to a crisp. They are complimented with a wonderful garlic aioli that looks like mayo but tastes like heaven. We also ordered the truffle fries, perfectly thin fries covered in a truffle/peppery cheese. The cheese was a little overwhelming but the fries were fantastic. Thanks for a great meal, Umami Burger!
