Great little (seriously, little) spot in Washington Sq West.  It's rare that I leave a sushi place stuffed, but after the old school roll and the lipstick roll (I think?) and sharing an order of the very good, light agedashi tofu, I was just that.   I wish I stopped at the Foodery first though.  Next time I'll come armed with some Hitachino XH.
