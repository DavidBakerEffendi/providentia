If you are looking for a restaurant pre-theater, this is it. I've tried most of the restaurants in this area, Becco, is my favorite. It's also a perfect spot for a large group. If you can get all at your table to indulge in their '3 pasta special' is all you can eat of 3 daily special pastas, salad or app choice, amazing bread selections & olives at $23/ per person & $25 bottle of wine, it is an inexpensive treat for NYC. Front dining near bar areas offer more ambiance. Wait staff is a delight. Food is served quickly, promptly, on time so you can get to your theater destination.
