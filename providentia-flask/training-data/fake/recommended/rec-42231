Good standard Turkish fair at reasonable prices. I found this on one of our recent visits to the Metropolitan Museum (10 min walk) and was happy I did. Everything we ate was tasty, though not spectacular. We had two different platters, feta cheese cigars, grilled octopus, and a few other dishes. Everything on the platters was good, the cigars and rice pilaf fine, but the octopus was a downer (it tasted like it came out of a can). One chief issue is that the menu consists mainly of appetizers and only a scant few main courses. I wish they had more main courses, perhaps the famous Turkish grilled meats. Other than that, we left with the thought of returning if and when in the area.
