Alright, so I know that everyone just loves Tom's. The decor is consistent with an old school NYC diner, but that's about the only truly memorable part of the restaurant. The service is shoddy, the food is mediocre and the lines on the weekend are just plain ridiculous Specifics, pros: 1. Decor - it's fun! 2. Pancakes - the pancakes are pretty friggin' good. If you are a pancake kind of person than you might as well try them out. Cons: 1. Lines on Saturdays (they're closed on Sunday, wtf?). Â This line is one of the longest I've seen even for hip clubs and bars in Manhattan. I don't get it. 2. Eggs. What is breakfast without eggs? Tom's is a breakfast spot that frequently botches the eggs. I've had them undercooked, overcooked and everything in between. I go for the over-easy eggs which are usually overcooked. My girlfriend goes for the scrambleds which are rubbery and flavorless. 3. Service. It's kind of endearing the first time, but after a while being served by a staff of completely inexperienced servers gets a little annoying. Once you are sat down it is not uncommon to be asked more than twice if you've been helped, the food rarely comes out at the same time, and the check will probably arrive before you are done eating. In the end I would say that Tom's is worth a visit at least once. However, don't expect the novelty to remain on the third visit. Oh yea, those crab cakes are pretty gross actually. Clearly frozen and thrown in the frier.
