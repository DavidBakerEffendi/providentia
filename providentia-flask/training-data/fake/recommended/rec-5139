Not really a fan of barbeque, so was not really expecting much.  The food is so delicious!  I got the pulled pork- it was so tender and smoky, but the taste wasn't overwhelming.  The roasted corn is like no other I have ever tasted.  Service was great and the food came out fast.  Prices are really fair too.  I went for dinner, but will definitely have to check out the brunch. One last note, I noticed a lot of people complaining about their running out of dishes.  As someone who takes their food seriously, I know it can be so disheartening to hear what you wanted was gone, especially since when I go somewhere I'm usually craving it like I'm 3 months pregnant.  That said, it seems to me the place has only been open for 2 months?  Perhaps you amateur food/restaurant critics don't know how hard it is to project what food you will need if you are brand new since you can't possibly forecast what business will be like.  Couple that with the high cost you need to recoup from opening and the goal to not let food go to waste (I think we can all agree with that one), sometimes restaurants run out early (and have way too much) before they find their groove.  It's not an excuse, I know, but perhaps you should cut them some slack.  Or maybe open your own restaurant and try to get it right; I doubt you could.
