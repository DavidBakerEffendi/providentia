4.5, but rounded up. I went here with a friend this weekend expecting mediocre bar-type fare, but our food and service were excellent. Waiter recommended the french onion soup dumplings, which were DELICIOUS. Shoestring fries were good, but could have benefitted from being a little thicker - you can barely taste them as thin as they come now. The mayonnaise that we asked for was delicious, much better than the mustard which was a little too spicy. The seared salmon that we ordered to split was absolutely wonderful, cooked to perfection and tasted buttery. The salad that came with was nice although a little too vinaigrette-y. But the salmon was so delicious. And the desert! Unbelievable cheesecake that was likely the best I've ever had. The PB&J ice-cream cookie came in a close second. The service was very attentive and helpful and I loved the decor (sort of a 1970's space vibe); we sat in the hanging wicker chairs and found it to be kind of cozy for a big, lively restaurant. Highly recommended.
