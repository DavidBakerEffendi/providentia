After reading countless reviews,  I was hungry and thus pretty excited to go to this place and try the nutella french toast.   The deal is this: it's only worth it if you're in town and you don't mind waiting 45 min or more for a table. The atmosphere and service is nice, and the food is just slightly above average and not due to taste, but due to freshness. So either the food quality decreased since people posted ,or it's inconsistently good, OR people just don't know how much better food can get lol. I am just  confused as to why so many people over-praised the food. My cupcake wasn't great; it was dry and nothing special. The people who work here are nice and all I am saying is that what I ordered wasn't fantastic, it was just not bad. The nutella french toast was OK/good , the egg sandwich w/ pesto sauce fine but bland. The home fries were OK but dry.  I don't think it was worth $30 but I wasn't upset for coming. It was a nice experience. I give it 3.5 stars. I would go here again to try a new menu item but maybe this time I'll go dinner and wait a bit.
