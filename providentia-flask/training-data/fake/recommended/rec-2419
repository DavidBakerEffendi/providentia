Three-and-a half stars for the food, and half a star for the styling/decor/name. I was torn between trying Katsu-hama and this place in a recent trip to NYC and due to ease of take-out, went with Go Go Curry! I happened to visit on the 15th which means I got coupons to come back and claim a free topping. Unfortunately I'm from out of town (anyone want one)? The curry sauce was pretty tasty with a decent amount of spiciness and the katsu breading was done just right. The meat (I had pork) left a little to be desired as it was a bit chewy/tough in parts. Would go back, though next time I'll be trying Katsu-hama first. (Also - the story behind "Go Go": The number "five" in Japanese is "Go" so "Go Go" represents "5 5" = 55, Matsui's number for the Yankees.)
