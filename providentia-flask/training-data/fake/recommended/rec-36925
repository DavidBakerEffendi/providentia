My favourite NYC restaurant from my recent visit.  When we entered the restaurant was packed (7 ish on a Friday) and the hostess told us there was a 2 hour wait for a table.  We really just wanted a drink and a few appetizers at the bar and lucked out with a cozy table in 5 minutes.  We had been shopping and had large parcels which they happily checked along with our coats.  Enjoyed a couple of glasses of wine, the escargots (wanted to lick the garlic butter from the dish) and the goat cheese tart.  Superb.
