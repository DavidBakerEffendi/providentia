This has been my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Philadelphia and I have been to a number of them. The best Vietnamese restaurant that I have ever been to was at Little Saigon, which is in Glendale, AZ. Back to the review, my wife and I didn't even sit down for dinner tonight because they don't have high chairs. Are you serious? How can you not have a high chair! We ended up going to Vietnam Palace, which was across the street and the food was very good and more importantly they had a high chair.
