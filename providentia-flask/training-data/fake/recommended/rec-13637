Breakfast is not a big part of my day, but since coming to Clinton St. Bakery, I've reconsidered a lifestyle change. The food here is VERY GOOD and trumps the normal stuff offered at all the other restaurants on Clinton St. As noted, the breakfast here is phenomenal - despite the rude service when it gets busy. Reminder: they do not take reservations. You are better off just buying take-out if there is a long wait. I had the steak and eggs, but I sampled off my friend's Bacon (DELICIOUS) and Blueberry Pancakes (Alright, but the homemade maple syrup seals the deal). Even though the entrees were a bit expensive for breakfast foods, you get a hefty amount of food. Watch out, the place only accepts cash. And a muffin goes for $2.25, which is overpriced even compared to Starbucks. My own meal came out to $24, with tip. Considering the hype, it's still unreasonable to charge this much for breakfast. It's a cool place to take food junkies and NYC visitors - but it's hard to say I'll come back for a laid-back meal. Minus 1 star for the rude service and overpriced menu items.
