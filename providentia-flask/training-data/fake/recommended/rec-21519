Philly Â oh Philly. How i love thee! Such a selection of places to eat with sooo little time. What to do what to do? Plan your day accordingly i always say. After a few places were super full we ended up here. Obviously after reading some yelp reviews...lol Silk City Diner looked like it would not dissappoint and everyone in our party collectively agreed. The wait was short and the food came quick and the service was good. Not great....just good. It is hard to find great service now adays but it is what it is. Sitting outside on such a beautiful day is highly recommeneded. Everything on the menu looked amazing! I had a traditional breakfast platter with eggs, bacon and some whole wheat toast and home fries. All i can say is that it was delicous and i wanted seconds! thirds! and yes even fourths! I was soo enamored with my breakfast that i really didn't pay attention to the other dishes on the table. : ) Silk City Diner - see you on my next visit! Long live breakfast!
