Can't complain about this place. It has great chicken/lamb with rice combo mixed with white and hot sauce. The hot sauce is pretty kickin so if you can't eat spicy, I'd either ask for just a little or skip it. There's also another car on the other corner with guys in the same outfit that I'm guessing is probably the same guys, but it seems like no one lines up there. I'm not sure why as I'm sure the other one is just as good (I'll have to try next time and find out). But for $6, you can't beat it. It's good as leftovers also if you can't finish it!
