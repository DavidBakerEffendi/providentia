Luckily we were seated promptly because out old Mothers could not wait.  We were all hungry and this proved to be fortuitous as the portions were huge.  The Caesar salads were plenty big enough to share with a home made tasting dressing and ample anchovy topping.  My choice of Angel Hair pasta with scallops and a vodka cream sauce was a bit heavy   and overdone.  It benefited from the addition of more marinara sauce and some vegetables.  My husbands chicken parm was also over sauced, too thin chicken pieces and  too much breading.  Our companions snapper served over a bed of spinach with a lemon sauce was fresh and generous.  The waitress who looked like Sandra Bullock was friendly and adorable in that Vermonty way.
