This Stewart's feels like it was left in the 70's...which is awesome!  It's a little drive up restaurant with picnic tables outside and bar-style seating inside.  The employees were friendly to the point where it felt like you were eating in a friend's restaurant.  It doesn't have air conditioning, so they had the doors propped open.  Not a big deal unless it's super hot out, but for the elderly/heat sensitive people, I wouldn't recommend coming here on a hot and humid summer day. Onto the food..!  I ordered a California Cheeseburger (mayo, lettuce, tomato, onion) and onion rings.  My boyfriend ordered the cheeseburger and a hot dog.  All the food is very simple, but made fresh to order and is so so cheap.  I couldn't get over the prices.  Our entire meal (we each had a drink) was $15.  The food tastes like someone's home barbecue...not out of this world, but simple and well done. I would love to eat here every day if my arteries wouldn't burst open, but I definitely will be going back soon to try a root beer float!
