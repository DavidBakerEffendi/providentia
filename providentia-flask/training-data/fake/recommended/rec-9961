A coworker took me here for lunch. We ended up having a sushi bento box. Its not your typical box, it comes with noodles, 2 sumai, soup, salad and we asked for spicy tuna rolls. We were enjoying our good and all of a sudden a swarm of fruit flies start buzzing by us. It was gross. We quickly finished our food and ran out. This place would have gotten 5 stars, great spicy tuna and price, but I had to deduct some stars for the fruit flies. I'm glad it was at the end of our food.
