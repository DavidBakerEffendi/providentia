Great food, great drinks (the lychee martini is delish). The waiting time can be bizarre. I've been here 4 times, all during the weekend evening hours, and been told waiting times ranging from 1 hour 45 minutes to two (yes, 2), minutes. There is an awful lot of yelling that takes place which is tiresome after a while but overall the service is great and worth a reasonable wait.
