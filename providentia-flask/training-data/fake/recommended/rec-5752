The only reason that I ever come back here is for the lobster mac n' cheese. Otherwise, I'm so disturbed by the service at Continental. Without fail, all of the staff is so rude. From the hostesses to the waitstaff to the manager (who openly maligns patrons on the floor with the staff). I went there today and requested a booth, even though I was one person. Yes, I know that that's pretty uncommon, especially if it's fairly busy. The answer I got was that those booths were reserved for other parties. Ummm, Thursday at 2 PM, there are three separate booths reserved for parties of four?! Riiiiight. Anyway, I said I'll take what you got when you got something. After fifteen minutes pass, I go back over to the hostess station and ask again to be sat at one of the many booths that are open. She reiterates that those are reserved and another hostess chimes in and asks if I could be seated in a swinging chair. Given that I had put my name down initially, I said "well, I put my name down, so yea that would be nice." Then I asked, "how long has that been open? I was given one of those remote reservation pagers and was never paged." They replied "well, something's ready now." RUDE! As I was seated, I told the hostess that I knew what I wanted to eat and asked for her to send the waiter over asap. So ten minutes later, and after having several waiters pass me - I had to grab two separate hosts/managers to ask for my waiter. When my waiter finally came, he made no apology. Throughout my meal, he neglected to ask me if he could get me anything or even if I was ok. I left no tip. He deserved none. It was horrendous. As much as I love food and that lobster mac n cheese, I can't deal with that nonsense - not to mention this place is expensive!!!! Run, don't walk, away from Continental Midtown. Bad service is one thing, but terrible service is quite another.
