By far the best breakfast/brunch i have had in nyc. I went on Wednesday morning so there was not wait! My husband had the Ricotta pancakes, w/ honeycomb butter, banana, blueberries, strawberries. OMG I cant tell you how good they were. It was Heaven sent! I had the toast and eggs with bacon and steak. The steak was so savory and delicious! The eggs where light and fluffy. This place is a NYC must!
