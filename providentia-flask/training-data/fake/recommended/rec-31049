I kept passing this restaurant on the way to the city and finally stopped in. They have a great menu and trendy style. The pizza is the best I've had in the city, the past was very fresh and unique. Make sure you get some sangria! Highly recommend In Riva, can't wait for the outdoor area opens so I can bring my dog!
