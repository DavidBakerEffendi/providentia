Mehek is okay. It's not great. Been a few times-- the service is pretty good and the staff is pretty friendly. Here's a list of discontents: -They charge for rice, although if you ask for it, or ask for more they don't tell you they're charging you. -They didn't have our table ready when we called in the reservation a few hours earlier and we had to wait, which isn't that awful but is pretty annoying and shows a general lack of professionalism. -And the kicker is that they don't use ghee, which is standard in even Americanized Indian food restaurants and unheard of in more authentic Indian restaurants. I asked the waitress what kind of ghee they used, expecting either "clarified" or "unclarified," but she just said they don't use it. So if you can, high-tail it to a better Indian restaurant. But if you have to come here, don't sweat it-- it's not that bad.
