Awesome addition to downtown Princeton! No need to fly to Paris anymore... This is an amazing place . The concept of the interior /decor/tables and even the silverware :all top notch. It is a self service but the food is brought to your table.very nice and organised system. Servers very kind indeed. Crepes -very high quality. Coffee A+. Prices very reasonable.I predict long lines and a great success.
