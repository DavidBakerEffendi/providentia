I love this restaurant in New York City. 5 stars are not enough to review this restaurant. I have been there only twice for special occasions about 5 years ago. It is not affordable for me, plus I see they raised the price of tasting menu, so it is hard to go back there again, but I am desperately want to go back there. Lunch during week is much cheaper than dinner time, so someday when I can take off from work, I will go there. Their food is amazing! I ordered chef's tasting menu both time I went there. Food cooked with fresh ingredients served artistically on plates and amuse your eyes. Then, when I ate it, I felt like different ingredients met in your mouth and played music in my mouth. Moreover, they serve amuse bouche and cute small sweets complementary. Wait staff's attitude is very professional. When I went there for a birthday celebration, a waiter saw us looking a a birthday card Â and brought a piece of cake with a candle although we didn't ask for it. What a wonderful service! After we ate amazing food and finished the payment, still our amazing experience had not finished yet. As we walked to the exit, they gave us bread which their bakery made. I was surprised by their great service.
