I really liked it here. My family & I came here for Mother's Day dinner & had a great time. Everyone was extremely nice & attentive & the restaurant is very cute/kitschy & very old school Japanese. We walked in right (w/no reservations) when they 1st opened, so we were the 1st customers in there. We didn't realize it was more like a Japanese tapas place, which was a refreshing change b/c we usually go to the standard Japanese sushi places that are all over the city. We had 7 of us in our party & ordered like 1/2 the menu. Everything was delicious & the presentation of each dish was very cute. I guess my only complaint is that the portions were pretty small so we wound up ordering multiple orders of some of the dishes. But we did eventually get full & the bill was higher than we expected, but it was totally worth it for the great service we got & the quality of the food. Added Plus: We ordered green tea ice cream for dessert & they had a Mother's Day special that gave all Moms free green tea ice cream, so my Mom & my sis' mother-in-law got their's on the house :-). Side Note: The bathroom! Oh the bathroom! It was so nice & cozy in there & because we went on a day when NYC got battered w/cold winds, it was nice to just go in there to do my business amidst a warm, immaculately clean bathroom. And they had 1 of those Japanese toilet seats w/the seat warmer & buttons that clean your booty for you. Which I was kinda "mehhh" about trying ... until that night. If someone was waiting to use the bathroom outside, they would've heard me yelp (no pun intended lol) from surprise when 1 of the sprays hit my backside & tickled me to death! I was furiously hitting the "Stop" button until it stopped but my a** was ticklish the rest of the night & it made for a good laugh :-).
