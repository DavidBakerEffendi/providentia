I had been waiting for this place to open for a few months now and finally had a chance to go. I must say I wasn't disappointed. It has an old world Irish New York theme. It's separated into two sections. The tap room is more relaxed, and allows standing. They have beer, bottled punches, whiskey and several other kinds of unique drinks. It's the perfect way to start the night. The upstairs, called the Parlor, is more for sitting down and enjoying a good cocktail with friends. The drinks are complex and strong. I enjoyed every drink I had. The menu is huge, and separated into categories such as punches, bishops, sours, fizzes etc. They also reference some of the books from the golden age of cocktails, such as The Flowing Bowl or Cooling Cups and Dainty Drinks. The atmosphere is excellent. The music was perfect. Not to loud, but fit the space perfectly.They also have a piano, so I am looking forward to some live music in the future. Overall I am looking forward to hopefully visiting this bar again for many years to come.
