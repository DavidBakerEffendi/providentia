I ordered food here like a dozen times, before I actually walked in. Their tacos make me happy inside, their soooo good. Delivery is pretty fast and reliable. The restaurant itself has a great Mexican decor. When I actually came in to eat, they're was a slight confusion on my seating , because they thought Â I was doing takeout , but the girl in the front the hostess, got the blunt of the anger of the manager for not notifying her I was a customer which I obviously explained to her when I walked in. All together it was good, the hot sauce I ordered was literally fire, I had to drink 3 bottles of their water to just be able to relax. I wish I got a warning on hot their hot sauce can be, but I love my food, so I can't complain. The fish tacos are great I was pesco - vegetarian at the time it was a delight. I'm hungry just thinking about it!
