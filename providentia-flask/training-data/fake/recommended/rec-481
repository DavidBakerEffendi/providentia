Truffle mac and cheese - fail.  If you like a RICH cheesy mac and cheese, do not get this dish.  Unless you're a truffle fiend.  Else, the mac reminded me of a simple Kraft mac and cheese i've made, without the good rich cheesy Velveeta cheese packet.   Lobster brioche was ok.  Bacon and leaves overpowered the lobster, so what's the point?  I'd rather have a straight up simple lobster roll personally.  I didn't mind that in addition to some lobster pieces that they also used parts of the lobster claw that you'd normally discard (the rubbery "wrist" of the claw), but, i just couldn't taste the lobster flavor through it all. Service was good.
