My sister and I came here on a Friday night, 7pm. Sat at a table.in the bar area. Reindeer punch: very good!! I'd order again Typhoon: good, alittle sweet for me Ordered fried cauliflower,too black pepper taste for my like, but I thought it was overall good. Also got hummus plate, really tasty pita chips.
