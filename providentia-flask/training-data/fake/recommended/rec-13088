chicken n rice will always taste the same from any cart, but seriously these guys put some other shit in their food and their chicken n rice taste like crack. this is probably the most unhealthiest dish you could eat, but if you're ever up for a late night snack, got the munchies, you're drunk, or if you want to gain five pounds, come to this halal cart cause its sooo good! white sauce and a few drips of that hot sauce, does the trick :) they upped their price to $7 i think... i remember it was like... $5 back in the day... :( (aka like 2 years ago) anyways, once they got popular, they upped their price and what's more confusing, some other halal guys started claiming they were the famous halal cart so, u know what, i really can't help you there, but seriously one of those carts, whichever has the longer line i suppose provides the best plate of chicken'/lamb & rice :)
