Came here with a friend and we weren't sure of what we wanted so we split THREE burgers. Of course the classic Umami, the truffle and the manly. All three were good. The manly is very filling be sure to have an appetite. It's got tons of flavor since it has bacon and onions. The classic is unusually good but the truffle won my heart and will keep me coming back for more. It's everything your want from a truffle burger - freshness and foodgasmic truffle flavor. Truffle fries of course came with our order and these were crackkkk. Drinks - the market is hands down one of the most delicious drinks I've had in a while.
