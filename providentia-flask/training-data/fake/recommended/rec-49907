This is THE place for beer in Philadelphia.  Not only do they consistently throw rare, high-quality beers on tap from all over, but they put them ALL on half-off happy hour special.  Most of my proudest beer moments occurred near their fireplace: a pint of Lagunitas Maximus for $1.75 (this shit is 7.5%ABV too), a goblet of kasteel cuvée du chateau for $4.50 (a decade old and still cheaper than you can get kenzinger in a lot of places), or a goblet of Russian River Consecration for 3.25 (usually $20 for a 12 oz bottle).  Devil's den is a legendary beer bar because they do this shit on the regular like it's nothing.  I have never encountered a place in the world that puts up like they do. That being said, I would probably never go there anytime other than a weekday between 5 and 7.  And you could probably do without the food, although the mussels are dope after a few rounds, and they finally brought the duck fries back.  My sister and I always get so pumped after we see our check. And they always have something like Spaten Lager or Franziskaner too if you're not the adventurous type.  But then again, their happy hour is a good excuse to try out something new.
