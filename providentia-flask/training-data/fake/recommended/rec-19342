Some work to be done on consistency.  Food ok great choices just not always consistent.  Beet pasta great twist but taste more like a dessert.  Drinks are good, pricy but good.  Service is ok.  Hotel guests seem to fancy this place for convenience.  Cheese Plate is usually a great find here and chefs own made sausage.  The entree just need some kick.   Dont bother with dessert, just blah.  Attampt at classics epic fail.
