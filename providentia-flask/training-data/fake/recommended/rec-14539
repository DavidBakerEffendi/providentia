I live a block away and was beyond happy when they opened as I work from home and there is absolutely no inexpensive options around this area. Cafe habana is kind of low but I am not waiting in line for lunch. I went in twice this week. Once yesterday and got the fancy prince. I was impressed as my assumption was that it was going to suck  as many inexpensive pizza places do but no it was pretty good for a really good price. I than tried the original prince pizza  today and again it was delicious. so happy we finally have an inexpensive option to eat around here that doesnt suck! woohoo! Almost forgot to mention no mins on credit cards cha ching and yes thank you god for not only taking cash!!
