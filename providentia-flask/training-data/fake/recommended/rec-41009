I knew I wouldn't be disappointed! Perfect birthday dinner at Moto tonight. Great food (order the cold asparagus and the organic chicken!), well-priced, attentive, pleasant staff, and the space is just warm and welcoming overall. It's small but cozy...and we walked right in at 8 and got a table for 2...no wait. Oh, and live music starts around 9pm! The only downside: I was too stuffed to order dessert. I'm dying to try the date cake. No worries--I'll definitely be back sooner than later.
