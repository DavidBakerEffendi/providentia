GREAT food. Great cocktails. great bar. Service is not nearly asbad as some people / reviews would make you think. Also, even if it was, it'd be worth it. Incredible half roasted chicken, fantastic meatloaf sandwiche, best brussel sprouts and asparagus and cauliflower gratin i've ever had, and pretty much everything I've ever eaten here has been top of the pops. They make a helluva old fashioned as well.
