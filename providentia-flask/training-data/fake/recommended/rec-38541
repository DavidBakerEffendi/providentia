My favorite thing about this place is the atmosphere. I know it's a restaurant, but I almost want to approach it more int he context of a bar with a pizza oven. The drinks are good and they have a decent happy hour. I like the pizza, but I shy away from the ones with lots of toppings because they can get soggy...I think it's better the next day!
