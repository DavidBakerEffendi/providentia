so this is a great run of the mill brunch spot in the village. prices are reasonable. oj is fresh squeezed. ambiance is mellow. i prefer hashbrowns but when places will make their homefries crispy-- i can deal. also the pancakes were excellent! it looked like a short wait for the outside terrace (great weather) but no wait inside with AC! the menu has a Mediterranean flair to it -- i think lunch here would be divine.
