How have I never written about this place?  What can be said that hasn't already been said in the 303 reviews before me? Probably not much.   Always on the list of the top places I take out of town guests.  This place caters to both meatatarians and leafatarians.  The bronte burger is my fave burger this side of Manhattan and the pumpkin salad surprisingly is something I find my body craving.   The one downside is that the spot is small so when you get there during rush fooding hours, it may take a few minutes to be seated.  But fear not, you're within Nolita and there are a couple cute shops right next door that you can peek your head into. This place is also cash only, so make sure you check out an ATM before heading in.
