Everything from the ambiance, service and of course the food is absolutely top notch. It's an experience that far exceeded my expectations which were high to begin with. Bread basket was delicious that I could not turn down a second offering. Spaghetti, best I've ever had hands down; Duck Fois gras ravioli very rich and unique. Dessert consisted of ricotta cheesecake with honey gelato & a chocolate cake so rich and delicious I wanted to slam my face into the table and die a happy man. Absolutely recommended to make reservations as it fills up quickly.
