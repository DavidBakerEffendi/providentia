So I really enjoy Isabella's food every time I go, but both times I have gone there has been something non-food related that just did not sit well with me. The first time I went my friend and I were squished in a corner table upstairs. It was very uncomfortable, but the omelet I had was good! This past weekend I went back and though we were put in a more comfortable table, our server was very unfriendly. One thing to note is that brunch comes with coffee or tea AND your choice of juice or brunch cocktail (bellini, mimosa, screwdriver, bloody mary). Of course they don't tell you this unless you ask (although it is in fine print in the menu). Half way through our meal we asked our waitress, "cocktails do come with our meal, right?" She mumbled "mmm hmmm." Then my friend asked "which ones come with it?" She replied "screwdrivers, mimosas and bloody marys." Now I knew that more than those came with it. I said "aren't bellinis included" to which she replied "yeah." Luckily the food was good (i had the mushroom and herb omelet with egg whites), but the service was unpleasant and slow. I would give the food 4 stars and the service 2 which is why I rounded to 3 :).
