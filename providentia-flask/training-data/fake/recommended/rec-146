I never write any reviews, but felt compelled to after today's experience to warn others of the decline in quality of the restaurant's food.  I've eaten here multiple times over the past 4 years and have always enjoyed their dishes such as the crispy whole fish, seafood nest, soups, and sushi rolls.  My family and I went today to celebrate my husband and mother's birthday and ordered the crispy whole fish, seafood nest, royal duck, Bangkok tower, and various soups (wonton, hot and sour, and miso).  My mom enjoyed her hot and sour soup, but the broth for the wonton and miso were way too salty.  Whereas the seafood nest had no flavor and the seafood (lobster tail, scallops, and shrimp) was overcooked and rubbery.  The royal duck was also overdone and tasted almost like jerky and the meat in the Bangkok tower had a burnt aftertaste.  Fortunately, the crispy fish was okay, but not as good as the one I've eaten there in the past.  The service was a bit spotty as well.  We asked to be served family style which they said of course to, but after bringing out the main dishes, the server took away all of our plates.  And upon being served our sushi roll, the server gave us only one pair of chopsticks and a single dipping dish to share between the 4 of us.  After we asked for more dipping dishes, the server proceeded to bring us only one large plate.  One of the previous reviews mention that the restaurant is under new management and it shows.  It's unfortunate, because this use to be such a good authentic Chinese restaurant.
