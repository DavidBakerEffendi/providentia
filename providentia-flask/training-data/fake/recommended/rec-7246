Ive been here a couple of times, and each time the experience is great. Ive come here for lunch and dinner and lunch time seems the best time to go and not be crowded into a corner table. Ive read a couple of reviews about the service being emotionless... But like really what are people expecting these servers to do? Lick their ass? They are attentive (didn't let my water cup go empty) didn't let the empty plates sit there, were courtesy AND wore gloves the whole time something i haven't seen another restaurant do. The spicy basil pad thai is great sometimes a bit salty but nothing crazy. It was great, i really enjoyed it and the calamari was delicious also. Also its kinda easy to walk right by this place, look out for the grey sign.
