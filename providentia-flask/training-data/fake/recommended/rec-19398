We had one morning in Philadelphia and I found this brunch place using Foursquare.  We navigated there, unsure we were on the right route, but WOW, am I glad we made the effort. My kids are not a daring group of people and they were hesitant about the experience until their food came.  Did their tune change in a heartbeat! They ordered pancakes and couldn't stop raving about them.  I ordered the Barking Chihuahua which was amazing and huge.   Service was fantastic.  The atmosphere was wonderful.  I really can't say enough nice things about this place.  The coffee was stronger than I prefer but I can't take off stars for that since it's my preference. If you are visiting or a Philly resident you should try this place.  I guarantee you will love it!
