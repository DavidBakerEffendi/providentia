I love the ambience here! It has a very elegant Indian vibe. As a vegetarian I can always find plenty of options. I've eaten here several times and have tried most menu items. My personal favorites are the crispy cauliflower which has just the right amount if spice, the malai kofta and the dal makhani! The staff is always super pleasant and the service on point. I've also enjoyed drinks at the bar several times. The bartender is very friendly and makes great suggestions.
