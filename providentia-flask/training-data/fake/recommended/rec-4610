For their prices, this is my favorite sushi restaurant in the New Haven area. It's rare to go there and have everything NOT be half price. Seriously, half off all sushi and sashimi every weeknight, 4 pm until close, and then all day Sunday? Ridiculous! And tasty. Friendly staff and bartenders. I've only sat in the restaurant, not the hibachi side so I can't vouch for the hibachi food or 'show.' Â They offer a small, private parking lot in the back which can sometimes fill up.
