You are homeless.  It is a sad story really.  You lost your job at the local meat packing plant because you were caught hoarding cuts of meat in your over-sized yellow rubber pants.  You pleaded with your boss to keep you on, and told him of how you were simply trying to feed your family.  He wouldn't have it.  Like Donald Trump he pointed at you from across his board room table and told you, "You're Fired!." You're wife left you for one of your former co-workers who could still get away with sneaking prime cuts of beef.  You turn to alcohol to ease your heart ache.  Your only friend is Jack Daniels, and eventually he leaves as well, leaving you with a guy named Vladimir.   You are evicted and you home is now a cardboard box placed over a vent on the corner of Broad and Walnut.  Your lone possession is your trusty six string.  You aren't good.  You never were. But with plenty of free time, you write humorous songs about your own misfortune. You begin playing these songs for passerby's who laugh.  It is unclear if they are laughing at your songs or you personally.  It doesn't matter, they are giving you money.  $4.95 is your daily earning, enough you get a large sandwich or hoagie from Grill Master Deli.  You are now satisfied and toss around the idea of going on tour.  You decide to practice all day and night until someone notices your talent.  You get drunk instead.  You are homeless and it is a sad story really.
