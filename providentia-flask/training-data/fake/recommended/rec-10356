This is a great place to come for a quick, cost-efficient bite.  It's very casual and vibrant.  The empanada options are very creative and there are choices for all sorts of diets, including sweet and savory options.  I recently had the "Romeo and Juliet" which is mozzarella cheese and guava.  This is a pairing I had never seen before, but it was really good!   I take off a star only because the restaurant is extremely small and even if you are lucky enough to get a seat, you will still feel a bit cramped and rushed.
