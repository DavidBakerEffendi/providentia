Could not be more disappointed. Waited for three trips to NYC to get reservation always booked. Atmosphere was great nice neighborhood feeling. The food was mediocre . Baked clams were dry with a lot of sand. Seafood salad was fresh but lacked taste. Chicken scarpiello had no bite or zing. My whole fish Branzino was loaded with garlic and bones after our waiter " de boned" it. Yes he took the spine but left all the rest. Â not sure what everyone is raving about!!
