As a ramen-lover, I was so excited when this place first opened up. The first few visits were just to die for - soooo delicious! Then as what happens with most restaurants, they lost their touch.  Either the master chef who came over to train all the others has left the country, or they just started slacking. My favorite - the Akamaru - is still delicious, but I rather go sit at the bar and have some of those AMAZING pork buns, sip some sake, and call it a night.  :)
