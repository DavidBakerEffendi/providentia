Delicious food selections! Start with the cheese board and a bottle of wine and savor every bite! I tried the Skate special and it was so amazing. My friends at the table let me try their Stripped Bass and it was also very good. The portions for the entrees are pretty large so a side is not necessary but I ordered brussels sprouts and really enjoyed them. The setting is so relaxing and perfect for a dinner night with friends. Our server (Craig) was very friendly and made our experience even better! He helped us make menu selections but it was not easy because everything sounded (and tasted) delicious. The only downfall is that there is only beer and wine served. I think a few cocktails would add to the experience but overall I really did love it and can't wait to go again soon.
