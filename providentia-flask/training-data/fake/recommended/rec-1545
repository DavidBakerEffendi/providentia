What a waste of time and money.  I'm 50yrs old and my friends from Philadelphia had told me all my life; hey we shold go to Geno's yadda yadda for years whenever I would visit. over the last 30years whenever the Grateful Dead would play the spectrum or other bands in nearby venues.   I went yesterday with my girlfriend for the first time and it was the worst experience for food I have ever had.  I can make a better steak sandwich myself.  To be fair, the bread was ok.  But the grease bomb they serve is nothing but a long stay in the bathroom awaiting you several hours later.  Hey; I'm all for belly bombs (White Castle comes to mind) but it should be when expected not a result of hype and tasteless "meat" and a slop of carmalized onions.  Their frys, while proclaiming "freedom" are nothing but the cheapest frozen fry they can find and dump into uninspired oil.  I would never reccomend this place to anyone.  I'd rather go to Nathan's in coney island.  At least what they sell tastes good! (one last thing... what is up with that hot sauce? - it is not for the weak kneed - but man, ya gotta give warning on that - that is a present that re-presents itself upon expulsion as well)
