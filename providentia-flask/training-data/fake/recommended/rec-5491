I came here for their Grand Opening event on a Friday. They were offering a complimentary 2 hour open bar and a food buffet so I expected a lot of people. Surprisingly we only waited in line to get in for about 5 minutes. Once we got inside it didn't seem too crowded because there were so many different rooms and bars so everyone was able to spread out. I liked the fact that there was a room downstairs and 4 different rooms upstairs because it made getting a drink at the bar much easier. The inside looks the same as the Dark Horse Pub which preceded Cavanaugh's Headhouse Square in this space- they didn't make many changes. Â There are better bars in Philly that I prefer over this place but it's not a terrible place to get together with friends to watch a game. There are plenty of TVs and space to spread out.
