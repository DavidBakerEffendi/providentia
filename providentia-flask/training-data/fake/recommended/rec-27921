Really enjoyed brunch here this weekend. It's a small place.  It was nice and open in the front and allowed you to really take in the nice weather while we ate. The baguettes that they brought out were hot with a nice crust and delicious. Second serving we asked for was the same and we were pretty sure they were  baking them up fresh right there. We started with the cheese plate which was a generous serving. I had the lobster sliders. So yummy! My friend had the eggs Benedict with lobster. What can I say, it was a lobster kind of day. We also split a pitcher of bellinis and had the chocolate cake for dessert. The cake was a little dense for me but I think that's just my personal taste. It was a lovely little brunch spot with nice wait staff and tasty food. I'd definitely recommend to others.
