Getting in line as early as possible on a weekend is the best strategy when visiting this highly sought after breakfast hot spot.  I got there at 8:20 a.m. on a Saturday morning and didn't get seated until 9:10 a.m. (I was probably one of the first five groups waiting in line, not to mention it was a rainy day).  The website says first seating is at 8:30 a.m.  even though it opens at 9 a.m.  This was not the case.  The waitstaff casually took their time eating their own breakfast while wet hungry customers waited outside. Once seated, you can understand the hype about Clinton St. Baking Company and why customers go through such lengths to eat here.  My husband got the blueberry pancakes after reading all the outstanding reviews and boy, was that the right choice!  This is a must-get dish when going for breakfast.  I'm not a big pancake lover, but these were the best I have ever tasted.  The flavors, the texture, and everything about these pancakes were top notch.  I got the potato pancakes which were very good, but not on the same level as the blueberry pancakes.  The rosemary sausage was excellent, cooked just-right, and the flavor was incredible.   I'm not sure it's an every weekend stop, but if you're in NY, Clinton St. Baking Company is a must try.  Remember, get there early.....
