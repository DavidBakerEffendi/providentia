Four of us went here for restaurant week this year and I'm just sad I hadn't been here before.  The food is mind-blowingly good.  I had spanakopita as my first course and my friends had the greek salad and both were delicious.  For my main course I had a lemon roast chicken with orzo dish and my friends had lamb chops.  Absolutely delectable.  Our waiter was an interesting man who, when asked what he would recommend, responded with "everything is good.  you will like everything."  So, while he's not a good person to check with if you're indecisive, was completely correct about everything being delicious.  I had the baklava for dessert while my friends had a flan type dish and I have to say that, while both were good, mine was really, really good.  Definitely going back here!
