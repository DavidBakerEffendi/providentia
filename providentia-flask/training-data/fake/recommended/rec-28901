Nice place to go for a long breakfast or lunch and sit and enjoy the city and you get a Really nice view of the park. Food is good and light not too many options but a variety. Dessert was great. The only negative I would say is the service, our waters were always getting refilled and drinks, bread, and food were brought at a decent time but our waitress never did a check back when our entrees came and never really showed any interest in us or to do her job well.
