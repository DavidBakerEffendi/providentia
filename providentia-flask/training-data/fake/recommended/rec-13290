I love this place. I usually get the falafel platter (you pay $1 more if you want mixed falafel, not just one type). Taim has rotating "special" falafels, so definitely try those after the trying the usual 3 types. The falafel is fried, which doesn't make it the healthiest, but it's well worth it. Â  This location has some bar seating, but not an ideal place for a large group to come and sit to eat.
