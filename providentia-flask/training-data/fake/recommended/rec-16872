The Mile's burger was amazing!!! Juicy and delicious! Also, you can't beat half priced on Wednesdays plus it's BYOB! The staff was very friendly. My only complaint is that it was sooo hot in there and there were a lot of fruit flies :/ But the restaurant was really clean so I think the bugs were just coming in because of the door being open. I will definitely go back and hopefully they will have the AC on! :)
