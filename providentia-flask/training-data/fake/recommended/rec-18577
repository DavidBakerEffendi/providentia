My friend from the hood took me here. New joint on the block next to the Tuck Shop and Ten Degrees (love 'em both). Great stuff and great prices! Fresh, delicious meats. I had the pork and spicy chorizo tacos, my friend had some veggie stuff (darn vegetarians and their vegetables n stuff) and she loved it. Beer is super cheap (4 bucks like the old days in the East Village), rockin' music, nice fella behind the counter. Hey, its a great lil' taco joint! What more can you ask for?
