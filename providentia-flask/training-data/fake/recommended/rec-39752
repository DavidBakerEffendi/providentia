This place is an excellent italian restaurant. West villiage is packed with italian restaurants but this place stands out.  Food is homemade and delicious.  The place itself is adorable inside and location is great right by Hudson River in W. Village.  You get a real european vibe when eating here since waitstaff are obviously all italian and extremely friendly.  A pet peeve of mine is when I go into italian restaurants and the cooks in the back are mexican, etc.  I'm not saying different cultures can't be chefs...but you don't see italians cooking at the sushi bar in japanese restaurants now do you?  I love that this place is as authentic as you get.  One of my favorite italian restaurants in nyc  xo
