Soo good. Too bad they are only open between 7pm-5am, as I would buy it ALL day if I could. What can I say that no one else has said? Don't be an asshole. The guy in front of me was a drunk asshole and said some sh*t Â to the Halal guys and they almost didn't give him his platter. Ask for the Mixed Platter (they automatically default to chicken and lamb). Have your money ready. Best to make sure you ask for it To-Go as well, so that you can take what you don't finish with you.
