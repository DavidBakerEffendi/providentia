This venue kind of reminds me of a Brazilian Singha's Famous Pizza. They know what their demographic likes and delivers it in pizza encasing- think heart of palm, cucumbers, corn, eggs, Brazilian cheese (similar to cream cheese). Is it the highest form of pizza artistry imaginable? No, but you shouldn't come here for that. What you should come here for is the Pizza, the Corinithians football game in the background, the guarana soft drinks and the really down to earth wait staff. And the Pizza, lest I forget that.
