I can't believe I haven't reviewed my favorite brunch place in Brooklyn yet. I've never had a bad experience here, coming about once a month for almost a year.   There is usually a wait for brunch, regardless of what time you come.  But the way that the host handles the people waiting is wonderful - the wait time quoted is always accurate (for better or worse), there's no inside spot to wait but everyone is usually happy to wait outside since the food is so good. I've gotten a few different egg dishes, and various sides, all have been delicious.  My favorite by far is the burekas with scrambled eggs.  The burekas are these little pastries filled with feta cheese, olives and other deliciousness.  I'm not a big fan of Israeli salad, but it's very fresh and my girlfriend is always happy to have my share.  The labneh cheese is my fav.  It's great to eat with anything, eggs, crispy dough, straight off the fork.  The crispy dough is the only thing that's been underwhelming - mostly it's just a bit oily for my taste. On my last visit I got a potato pancake as a side and it was great.  Very large, well seasoned, all around awesome. The price is pretty good considering all the egg dishes come with coffee.  Sometimes I'll get a mimosa, but this isn't a great place for drunk-brunch since most drinks are $8+ and there's no drink special. I could come here every weekend.
