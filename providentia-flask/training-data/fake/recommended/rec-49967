I can't believe I haven't written a review for Omar's Cafe! I'm not always here because I do not live near by but whenever I am in the neighborhood I stop here. The Bistec sandwich is delicious, my tastebuds are in harmony with it when I bite in. They recently changed their sign but the previous sign said "Home of the Bistec sandwich" or something like that -- for your first time here please do try it . Get it with everything on top, (lettuce,tomato, crunchy string fries and cheese).  They make natural juices like orange and I always get it:  more recently I tried their hot chocolate and it was decent , it has a soft taste. They get a lot of customers so sometimes they take a little long but more often than not you don't have to wait more than 10-15minutes, the people who work there are nice.  A TIP: when you go to order don't be afraid to assert your self and be a little loud; on Saturdays the counter is usually lined up by customers , those customers order by phone or others will just yell out their order and you will wait.
