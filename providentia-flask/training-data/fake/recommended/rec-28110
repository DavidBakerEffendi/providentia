You need to run, not walk, to Il Bambino...and you immediately need to order the potato salad to start. The balance of the textural components of fried shallots, fingerling potatoes, truffle aioli, and shaved parmigiano had to have been created at the hands of god himself. Â  All of the crostinis are top notch and I've never had one I didn't love. Sometimes the paninis can be a bit rich, but what can you expect? A lot of sandwiches are heavy. Still awesome. I suggest going for a weekday dinner when it's a little quieter.
