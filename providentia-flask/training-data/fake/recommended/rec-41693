Wow, just wow.  My go to place and winner consistently.  It's almost like I'm daring this place to be horrible one day.  I'm daring the pizzas not to taste good.  I'm daring the four cheese pepperoni to not have the right combination of cheese.  I'm daring the arugula pizza with pancetta to not have the perfect combination of wow and tang. I'm daring the service to be horrible.  To not be attentive.  To not bring my drinks out on time (especially when I'm entertaining guests).   It's a whole lot of dares but none of them are ever crossed and I'm thankful to be a 10 minute walk away.  Keep doing what you're doing!
