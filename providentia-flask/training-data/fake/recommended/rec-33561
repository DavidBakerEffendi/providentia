I went last night for dinner with my wife.  The pork chop was delicious.  It was a nice portion, not huge.  The fluke was good but not exceptional.  The octopus appetizer and the beet salad were very tasty.  The wines paired nicely with our food.  This is a sophisticated, comfortable restaurant with no attitude and great food.  I highly recommend Jack the Horse Tavern.
