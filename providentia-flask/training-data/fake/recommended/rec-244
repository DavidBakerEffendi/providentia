This place is a solid 3 stars. The ambiance is simple without being sterile. It's a railroad shape but feels intimate rather than confining. The waitress was knowledgeable. We ordered the following: - gazpacho andalusia - 5 stars. This was somewhere between a salmorejo and a gazpacho. Well chilled, thick but drinkable, perfectly balanced. $9 for a cup. But, so rich you only need one for a table. - 2 orders of pimientos de padron - 4 stars. these delicious lightly fried until blistered peppers are delicious. I think they were about $9 an order and so we ordered two because I can eat a whole pile. - garlic mushrooms - 1 star. Would have been better as a soup. The mushrooms were poached and flavorless. Not worth $9. - pan con tomate with three toppings - 1 star. The whole point of this dish is crispy charred bread, rubbed with garlic, smeared with cool tomato. This was bland, cold toast, served with unripened tomato purée. They served the pan with three toppings - a tapenade, peppers and a fava bean purée which I believe was supposed to cover the flavorlessness of the bread. Not worth $9 - Fried chickpeas - 4 stars. Needed some lemon but was great. $5 Garlic shrimp - 1 star. Rubbery, overlooked, flavorless swimming in garlic and oil. It was more like oil poached rather than sautéed. Flavorless, meh! $12 We didn't drink any alcohol. I would go back to Tia pol for a company event. But, at $40 a person for tapas without alcohol it seems a bit much. Maybe get a slice of pizza and go here for the ambiance?
