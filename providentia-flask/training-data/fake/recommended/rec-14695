The food here is, as another reviewer said, "cheap, fast, and really tasty." Based on my time in Korea, it tastes authentic, but what do I know? The soup/noodle ladies are really cute and don't speak English. It's fast food that's fresh! You go in, take prepared food or food from the buffet, and sit down. You can even get Korean beer! The kimchi pancakes are really yummy. I don't eat the meat so I haven't tried the bulgogi or anything like that. The regular kimchi, though, is not really up to par. Not fresh enough. Definitely worth a lunch visit, though, particularly if you want to sample a lot of different types of Korean food.
