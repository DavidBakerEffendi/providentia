I have only been here one time, but I won't be returning.   There was an issue with the order and the food took about FORTY MINUTES to arrive.  The server apologized at first and eventually provided free drinks to the party; however, when the food arrived the food was not what we had ordered.  The food was ok, but the enjoyment of the food was clouded by the extended, and needless judging by the lack of business at the time, wait. If you must go I would recommend getting one of their mojitos.
