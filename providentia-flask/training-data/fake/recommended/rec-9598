Pio Pio is hands down some of the best Peruvian food joints I've been to! I went here on a weeknight during my vacation in New York, and was happy to see that they took reservations on Yelp! I heard about Pio Pio from a couple of folks before, so I wanted to see what the hype was all about. It definitely didn't disappoint! The ambience was very trendy! It felt like we were dining at a five-star restaurant. Really loved all the interior decor. Makes for a good date spot! Me and my best friend shared the Matador combo -- we were really ambitious. We were pretty shocked at the amount of plates that came out -- we seriously thought it wasn't going to end, haha. Needless to say, that combo is good for like 4 people, which makes Pio Pio really affordable -- between the two of us, we had leftovers that lasted for a few days. You get the bang for your buck, most definitely. The sangria was on point as well. Overall, you gotta check this place out! Make reservations ahead of time so you don't have to wait! And the other good thing is that there's a few locations in Manhattan you can go to!
