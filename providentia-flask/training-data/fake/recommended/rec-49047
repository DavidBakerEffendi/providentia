My daughter tends to be a picky eater so I spend quite a bit of time figuring out where we can eat that we can both enjoy, and is also a healthy food option.  Honeygrow fit those requirements quite well.  I was able to get a spicy tofu stir-fry with boston lettuce wraps, and she got fruit and honey.  We were both happy.  I love that you order at the Kiosk with little pictures and then the line behind the counter gets to work on your meal.  I would definitely frequent this place if I lived in Philadelphia.
