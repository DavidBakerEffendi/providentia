Delightful and cozy!  Always a great place to go post- SoulCycle or after dinner in the nabe.  I love their cheese and meat selections... as well as their risotto balls and meatballs.  We ordered the calamari salad this time, which was also very tasty. Great wines and excellent service.  It's a standard with this group... as I've had similar service and experiences at their High Line Outpost.
