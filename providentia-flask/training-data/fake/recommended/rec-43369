This is the surly response I got from Han Dynasty's management. Shocking. PS -- I checked their menu. ganbian sijidou = "four season beans" = what Han Dynasty calls "saut√©ed string beans w/ minced pork." All the same dish. I guess the staff doesn't know the menu too well either. Han Dynasty "I work at Han Dynasty on 108 Chestnut St. and Ive only seen the TV on for Eagles games with no volume. We also don't have four season beans on the menu and no dishes that are coated with sugar. You thinking of a different restaurant."
