I don't know if I'm allowed to use expletives in Yelp reviews but if I was sure I could, I'd say - this place is f**$&$^ amazing. Il Bambino is a tiny little casual gem on 31st Ave in Astoria - everything - and I mean everything - is consistently excellent and very affordable.  In particular, I recommend the soups (the Smoked Tomato is the yum), the Beet & Goat Cheese salad and ALL of the amazing Crostinis.   If you have a sweet tooth, they also have the only decent cupcakes in the neighborhood, which are always fresh and delivered from Crumbs.
