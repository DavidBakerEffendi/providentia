Went with a large group and sat in the wine cellar. I started with the grilled Caesar salad, it was grilled to perfection with just the right amount of dressing. Dinner was the Rossini burger, Kobe beef, foie gras and truffle cheese, mayo and mushrooms... In a word yummy. Capped off with the chocolate bread pudding, decadence at its best. Nick was our server and was attentive, gave recommendations and easily split the check. A great find in a remote location.
