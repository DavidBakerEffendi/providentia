I really like this place. I order from here often and I love their paneer. It is always soft and flavorful. The chicken is always juicy and flavorful. Indian spicy has a bit of spice so if you like it hot, be sure to ask them to make it hot! I'm getting close to ordering just about everything off the menu. Garlic naan, saag paneer and chicken makhini....mmmmmm I have donethe buffet once or twice but I really prefer ordering from the menu. They have a couple of dinners for 1, 2 or 3 and you can usually substitute items pretty easily. BYOB so pick up a nice bottle of wine and call it a wonderful evening!
