I feel bad giving it 3 stars as I have a hunch that I would love this place.  The atmosphere is so great in every way.  I was trying to be watch my wallet and went for the burger and just was not a huge fan of it or the fries but everything else on the menu and what i saw brought out looked good.  I think I will give it another shot so if anyone knows what to order let me know.
