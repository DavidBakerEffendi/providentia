Minetta is probably my favorite restaurant in New York to visit regularly. So, not necessarily the very best food per se, but the very best comforting, delicious, friendly food that you want to eat again and again. Also, the vibe is great--even if it's more touristy than it used to be, it's still a really intimate room, nice crowded-but-not-cramped vibe, they play great classic 60s and 70s music (not the most obvious stuff, well-edited selection). And they make the best burgers, the best steak, and the best french drip (lunch only) in the city, plus there's actually quite a bit of non-meat-heavy stuff on the menu if you're not in the mood for that. The bartenders are all awesome and a lot of fun, too. Basically, this feels like classic New York in the best sense--the kind of place you could imagine Frank Sinatra or Jay-Z rolling up to for a great night at one of the banquettes.
