My girlfriend and I went to max brenner after dinner to have dessert. It was awesome. The environment was fun and the smell of chocolate right when you walk in is even better. We got the hot chocolates and the European fondue for two which was a good choice. Filled us both up and we left happy. The seating is tight but it is well worth it.
