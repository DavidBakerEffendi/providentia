Tempura deviled eggs, cornish hen and waffles, pickleback spheres...it's a very interesting and very tasty menu.  I had read about it when they opened and had it on my list for a while and was definitely not disappointed.  We came with a party of 7 on a friday night and they were very accommodating.  Fun atmosphere that I would recommend if you're looking for something a little different, I'll be back. It's cash only and they don't take reservations, both things to be aware of before heading there.
