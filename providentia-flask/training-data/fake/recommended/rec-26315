I love this place! They give you A LOT of food, so much that one might be enough for two people! The chicken is so delicious, as is the flatbread. What I love most, though, is the hot sauce! It's very spicy, so a tiny bit goes a long way in spicing up your chicken and rice. The location is super convenient as well whether you're getting a quick lunch or a late night meal. This is a food cart, so there isn't any formal seating, but there are ledges of nearby buildings to sit on.
