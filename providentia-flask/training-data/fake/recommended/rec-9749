My girlfriend and I came during the San Gennaro Festival and were surprisingly seated pretty promptly. We sat outdoors and had a great view of the procession. The bread on the table was alright, kind of cold and mediocre, the focaccia was much better.   We ordered the Pollo Pastore and the Pollo Pelligrino.  Both of the chicken dishes were pretty amazing and flavorful spins on traditions dishes.  The only thing slacking was the side potatoes and vegetables which were pretty tough and not fresh seeming.  The service was pretty amazing considering the chaos of the festival. I am sure the food and service are even better on a regular weekend so we will be back.
