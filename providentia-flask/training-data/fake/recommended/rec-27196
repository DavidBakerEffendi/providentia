If I could give the service a zero I would. If you're Latino or a minority save yourself the trip! They obviously only want a certain clientele. When I walked in no one greeted my group. I was just standing there waiting for someone to say something. There were many empty tables yet it took 10 minutes to be seated. The host that sat us down was not friendly at all. The worst part is that they sat my group in the corner Â close to the exit, when there were plenty of seats available. In addition another group came in and they were told "Please sit anywhere." Im not sure if they were regulars or not but I felt discriminated. I was not informed of the specials although everyone at other tables were being told. When we asked the waiter why we were not told about the specials, his excuse was that Americans usually like to hear specials. Excuse me...I didn't know that nationality had to do with hearing specials! In addition the waiter slapped down the plates and refilled water very sloppy causing water to over flow on the sides of cup. The food is okay nothing spectacular. The paella valenciana was big but really salty. The crab cakes were bland. NEVER AGAIN FORNOS!! Go to Iberia down the block for much BETTER food, prices, and service!
