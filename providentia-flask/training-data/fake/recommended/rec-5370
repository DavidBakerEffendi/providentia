Went for brunch and it was delicious! Ordered the burger medium rare and it was VERY rare but still tasty! The DIY Bloody Mary bar had lots of treats but the vegetable juice they use is quite different, takes more like cucumber than a tomato juice. Service was good and staff was friendly. Would definitely return. :)
