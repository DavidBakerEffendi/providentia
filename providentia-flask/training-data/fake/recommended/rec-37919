!!  I second every positive comment on here.  I've been about eight times and Nan Zhou is consistently yum.  It's non-fancy traditional Chinese noodle soup.  PERIOD.  If you like sanitized Asian cuisine --- don't come here.  There is fat on the meat floating in your greens just as God intended.  And if you try to communicate anything fancy to your server, she will stare blankly and bring out the soup the way it is on the menu.  This is a good thing, b/c they do know best...  Try the fishball with shaved noodle and add an egg or two.  (smacks lips)
