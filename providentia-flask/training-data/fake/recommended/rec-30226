Cool, hip and to the point brunch service, but a word to the wise - a reservation will save your life here for brunch! Server was a bit of a stale bloke - could tell he wasn't up for chatting nor smiling - but hey - it was 10:30AM on a Sunday - who smiles at 10:30AM anyway, right? Started with the BLT Caesar - was deliciously smokey topped with the bacon infused vodka - perfect pick me up - a tad strong but the salad garnish that was stacked on top helped with the bite. The boyfriend had the Fried Egg Sandwich (two fried eggs, house-made Italian sausage, aged cheddar cheese, brioche bun, potato hash, jalapeno-cabbage slaw) he said it was delicious - he forgot to let me try it. I had the Huevos Rancheros (three baked eggs, black beans, ranchero sauce, Monterey jack cheese, lime creme fraiche, crispy tortillas, pickled jalape√±os) - I am a lover of Mexican style anything so this was right up my alley - I found my dish a tad soupy as I believe it is supposed to resemble a egg frittata - but perhaps not. Over all easy and delicious. Prices are good and the location is swell. Be sure to walk across the street and continue walking on the high line through Chealsea.
