This place has great fresh food. Awesome in my opinion for brunch or a quick break. I like the space and its good for a small group. I've had the burger and the steak which are both good and fresh. There is also a down stairs room that we had a small dinner party at. They bring in large trays of food and it's great for a birthday for 10-15 ppl.
