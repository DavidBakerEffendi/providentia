I should start by saying that I went to Yuca for dinner, not the brunch that seems to be so popular.   The wait staff, bar staff, and hostess were all very nice and accommodating, as well as surprisingly attentive given the noisy and crowded atmosphere.  We went on a Friday night and the place was packed mostly with people in their 20s and 30s getting hammered.  It was way too loud to have a good conversation, but that may have mostly been due to one particular (and really drunk) table that was in the restaurant.   Atmosphere was nice, good lighting, etc.  For dinner we ordered the Guacasalsa as well as the special of steak and shrimp fajitas.  The guacamole was really, really good and the chips that accompanied it were also excellent (a variety of plantains, corn chips, and something else delicious that I couldn't name).  For the fajitas I can't say much as I didn't eat them, but the people with me said that they were good.  Not mind blowing, but good. I should also put in my vegan 2 cents: the menu was ok for vegetarians.  As with restaurants of this type, the cheese all over everything makes it hard for vegans.  They had one appetizer and two entrees that were vegetarian, but I didn't ask how easily they could be made without cheese.  They also had two salads that appeared to be vegan and actually looked quite good.  Then, of course, there was the guacasalsa, mentioned above. Not a bad place, but nothing spectacular.  I think brunch would be nice, as the place would be a lot quieter.
