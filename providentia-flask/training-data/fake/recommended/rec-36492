Great, casual lunch spot in Soho! Came here with a friend for a quick mid-day bite before heading off to the airport to catch my flight. It was packed but luckily we were able to snag a small table without a reservation. I had the tagliatelle and it was perfection. The noodles were perfect, the sauce was rich but not over-bearing and wasn't too meaty. The portion size was jsut right for lunch too. The atmosphere was very relaxed and casual. Service was attentive. I will definitely be back soon :)
