I've been to Desi Chaat a lot and wanted to try another place, so I went down the street to Mood Cafe.  There is one guy behind the counter who spent a while asking me what sorts of food I liked and what spice I can handle.  I asked him to explain all of the ingredients and he went through them one by one.  It was very informative and interesting, and I appreciated his excitement and knowledge about the different flavors and combinations. We eventually decided on the crazy chaat, a blend of a lot of chaats.  I say "we" decided because he took my feedback - and perhaps my mood - into account.  I would venture to say the chaat was life-changing, but I'm also a huge fan of Indian food and chaat so count that as my bias.  In any event, because of the good vibes of this place and the ridiculously delicious food, I will surely be back.
