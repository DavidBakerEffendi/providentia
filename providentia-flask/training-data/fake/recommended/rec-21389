I rarely write reviews. However, I felt it necessary to write this, as my experience was so negative that it was difficult to enjoy my meal. My friends and I decided to go for brunch Sunday afternoon. I was 1 out of an 8-person party, though 1 member of our group did not eat and only drank water. As a sidenote, I used to be a server and understand that an extremely busy shift can entail a lot of situations that are (sometimes) out of your control. It WAS very busy, so a wait was very understandable. We received glasses of water while we waited for a table, which was very appreciated. After about 25-30 minutes of waiting, we were seated outside because it was the first table available. I would estimate that we sat for about 10 minutes before our waitress actually came to our table (she breezed by several other times, saying she'd be with us in a moment), and at that point another employee had brought half of our party more water. Already, the group and I were feeling restless, hungry, and a little annoyed. The waitress introduced herself, counted how many of us needed more water, and then took our drink order. It took another 10-15 minutes to receive our drinks (where only 1 out of the 8 was an alcoholic beverage). After this, she would disappear for moments on end. We actually had to ASK her if we could put our food order in, and then waited another 30-40 minutes. The food was good. However, the overall experience made us rush through the meal just so we could get the heck out of there. The waitress was inattentive and borderline rude. Again, I understand being busy - but it's important to be kind and as attentive as possible to your tables; this is especially so when you are attaching an obligatory 20% tip to the bill. The manager has already been notified, so I found it unnecessary to use the server's name. I hope this experience was a fluke, but I can't say I'll rush back to Silk City for food anytime soon.
