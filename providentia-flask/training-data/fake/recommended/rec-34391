Veritas is absolutely the best place to get pizza but also overall the best place to eat. Period. Ingredients are extremely fresh and pizzas are creative and amazing. The atmosphere is energetic, the drinks delicious and don't even get me started in the Nutella desserts. Anyone who is a fan of goat cheese MUST try the Mista Salad. Words cannot describe the taste. I love this place.
