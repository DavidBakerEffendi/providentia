Legit, but all the chaats i tasted were essentially exactly the same with like chicken or beer or a samosa added to it. Still amazing flavors. Particularly loved the dates. I guess he could tell I was new and didn't want to confuse it up that much. Melon lassi was toppppp notch. Place is so close to 5 stars. Ill definitely go back and try to get a little more diversity with my chaats
