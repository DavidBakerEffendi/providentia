I was a huge Ember Room fan, went there for years, always brought or suggested the Restaurant . Sadly, I went last night and discovered they changed the name and the menu. The waitress told us it was the same Chef but we were disappointed.  My favorite pastrami meatballs came out cold, the Pad Thai was bland and tasteless, no more Korean BBQ fried rice and the happy hr wine was reduced a "shot size" serving.  We left and both said "I guess that was our last time".  I'm bummed!
