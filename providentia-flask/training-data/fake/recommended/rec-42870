I've passed this place after brunch a couple of weeks ago and the decor was so. Lovely that I wanted to come for a meal one day. We came at 8 on a Sunday so there was no wait. The restaurant was dimly lit in candles = very romantic (gentlemen, note, this is a great date place). Food was phenomenal. I had the salmon appetizer while the date had swordfish. I can't really speak for his dish but I think he enjoyed it. And the whole star of the meal was the side Brussels sprout. I honestly could have just ordered that and be happy for life!!! Service was very friendly and attentive. Would def recommend to try it.
