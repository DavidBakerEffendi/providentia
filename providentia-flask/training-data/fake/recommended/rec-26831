Service is good. Good ambiance. But food is just ok, in fact, it was neither good nor Japanese. I really want to let the owner know, YAM NOODLE DOES NOT GO WELL WITH SUKIYAKI. ESPECIALLY BAD YAM NOODLE. If you're in doubt, SERVE RICE OR UDON WITH SUKIYAKI. Nabeyaki udon was tasteless too. I don't think this is a hard dish to do right. But seems that many restaurants just can't do it. YOU DONT THROW A Â BUNCH OF VEGGIE AND UDON TOGETHER, BOIL IT, AND CALL IT NABEYAKI!!!! Sushi is not good too. Have no flavor, nor was it fresh. I was very disappointed.
