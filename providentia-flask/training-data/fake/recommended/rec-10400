The atmosphere in the Ear Inn is as good as it gets. They have a great selection of beer. The dumplings are fabulous. The chicken pot pie is the best. But it all comes down to the service. Mickey is the best! Â He greets you with his kind smile everyone is yelling orders at him and he still keeps calm shows the utmost respect to everyone. If you ask for a cappuccino Mickey will explain kindly that they don't have cappuccino but his boss Martin has a cappuccino machine hidden in the kitchen and Mickey goes back in the kitchen and makes the cappuccino himself. The conversations with Mickey are always positive. He always talks about generous the owner is. I was in there Tuesday and the place was freezing. Mickey finally opened the doors to let the fresh air in. Thank You Ear Inn for a wonderful time. What would Martin do without Mickey?
