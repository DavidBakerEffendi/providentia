I have really mixed feelings about this place.  I have gone twice.  The first time the food took forever, it was cold and the waiter was an ass about it.  The second time it couldn't be more awesome.  The burger was hot and perfectly cooked.   I do like the line situation they have.  Its like going to the bar!  You wait and drink cheap beers with your friends and glare at those who dint know how the line works (which is admittedly confusing).
