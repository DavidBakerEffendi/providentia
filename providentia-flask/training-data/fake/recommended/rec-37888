I have been to Amici Milano many times, as I worked in Trenton for more than 34 years.  I always had very good food at this establishment.  Yesterday, a group of 6 retired employees met at Amici Milano for some lunchtime reminicising.  I was surprised at how dead it was at lunchtime.  We were the only patrons in the restaurant, and we stayed for 2 hours.  The food was not up to the standards that I remember.  I ordered a cup of vegetable soup, which tasted as if the base was leftover marinara sauce, thickened with cornstarch.  At least it was hot.  The chicken marsala came with a tiny side salad and a veggie of 'fried pickles'.  All of the guests were quizzical about the veggie.  Our entrees were brought to us - no one mentioned their food, except to say how awful the fried pickles were.  When the table was cleared, all of the pickles were returned to the kitchen, uneaten.  We told our fawning waitress just how bad the pickles were, and later she returned with six take-home portions of pasta in bolonese sauce.  Generally, I was not happy with my food.  The chicken was bland, and several people in our group left large portions of their meal uneaten on their plates.  After about an hour and a half, during our dessert course, the wait staff kept giving us the evil eye, asking us to leave.  We were the only party in the restaurant.  I know that huge numbers of state employees have retired, shrinking the pool of customers. but I was shocked to see just how empty the place was.  Maybe it's because the food has gone downhill.
