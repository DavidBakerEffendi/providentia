Decent burger, pretty and cozy decor, friendly service. However, the wait time for brunch was too long and the clientele overwhelmingly young and white (as was the staff). Feels like the kind of place that used to be unpretentious and local-friendly but has been taken over by well-to-do, out-of-state transplants. A shame.
