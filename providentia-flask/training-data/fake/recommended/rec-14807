I'm not from the Philly area, so I came here as a visitor.  This place makes me want to move to Philadelphia.  No joke. I could come here over and over for days and still not get tired of it.  It is a massive shrine to food and food lovers.  You can get raw cow and goat milk here - which is no easy task elsewhere.  There were always great specials on local produce and TONS of food stands with delicious ready-to-eat fare that ranged from cajun to sushi to calzones and fresh Pennsylvania Dutch pretzels. If you're coming in to the area, take a lunch stop here.  You won't regret it.  Be sure to factor in about an hour for wandering around and figuring out what delicious thing(s) you are going to stuff in your face.  I'd bring a bag with an ice pack, too, because you never know what you might pick up. I believe every vendor I went to accepted credit cards, but it won't hurt to have some cash handy.
