Ate here for my birthday.  Place was beyond packed, but I would soon learn why.  The food was amazing.  I had the fried chicken, with the roasted brussel sprouts.  Out of this world.  The pecan pie sundae is possibly the single greatest dessert I've ever eaten.  The bartenders are like scientists.  The staff was extremely nice and helpful.  Got the chance to meet the owner when we inquired about having a private function there.  Cannot say enough good things aboput this place
