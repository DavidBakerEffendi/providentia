We went to the bar behind the restaurant first and had some very good cocktails. We then went to the restaurant to have appetizers. The pork belly buns are to die for!!! Amazing! There are days I want to walk by and order some to go. They're 2 for $10 which isn't bad at all. I also tried their fried soft shell crab and it was also very good. Will be back.
