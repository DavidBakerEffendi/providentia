I have a newborn and from conception to now as an EBF baby, he is pretty much made of Ghandi fine Indian cuisine. I love the shrimp poori appetizer, naan (super fresh and fluffy!), lamb curry lunch box and the Saag panir is a great vegetarian option. I've had better samosas though. The owners are also awesome and friendly.
