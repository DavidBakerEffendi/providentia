I am so confused. Upon reading the numerous five star reviews, my boyfriend and I were excited to try this place. Receiving the food, I was surprised about the overall lack of quality. This place was just alright, not wonderful as previous reviewers have stated. We had the "crazy baba" (which was good), the shakshuka and a chicken dish which were both incredibly oily. The chicken had a nice crisp but lacked any flavor whatsoever. The shakshuka was absolutely terrible and completely covered in oil. I won't be trying this place again.
