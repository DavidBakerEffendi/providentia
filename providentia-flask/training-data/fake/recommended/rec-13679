This place has one thing and one thing only - french fries. To be more specific, Belgian style french fries with a variety of dipping sauces. Try the mango chutney dipping sauce. The sweetness of the mango chutney balances out the saltiness of the fries. If you're craving a snack any time of the day, Pommes Frites is a must. This is literally a hole in the wall so seating is extremely limited.
