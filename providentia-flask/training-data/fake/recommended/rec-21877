Had a fabulous meal here last week when I was in town. A client took me knowing I like healthy good food. Let just say that from the moment the waitress brought bread I was impressed. The Chef makes a mustard that is so out of control delish - I literally ate it with my fingers. The salad was perfection, followed by a family veggie taco recipe and finally the butterscotch pudding to take me over the edge in foodie bliss.  The chef came out to chat and he was super cool.  Terrific experience.  Highly recommend checking it out.
