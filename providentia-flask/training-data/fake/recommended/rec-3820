Yelpers,sweet yelpers, I am so disappointed in you. Did you guys REALLY like this chicken??  I got duped to the umpteenth power.  Clearly I love food, but I thought this chicken totally sucked. My bff (best foodie friend) and I were sooo looking forward to this and we were so let down.  The chicken had no flavor, ahem, ahem, let me clear my throat, NO flavor.  It was like eating a rice cake with cayenne pepper on it.  The bacon creamed corn was kerneled to perfection, ahem, ahem, let me clear my throat again, it was as if an ear of corn was shucked and mixed together with bacon and cream.  I couldn't even look at my food anymore and promptly put my napkin over my plate and called it a wash, ahem, ahem, one last time, *DEAD*. The glimmer of hope for the night was the Tiger Woods (half lemonade/iced tea), served in a Mason jar was great.  Not too sweet, not too sour.  The arugula side salad with what I could tell was homemade dressing was excellent as well.  I crossed my fingers hoping the bourbon brown butter cake did not disappoint.  Desserts always make me happy. Phew, it didn't!  I was so happy my night ended on a good note, and on that note, I will not be returning.
