The only reason I'm giving LIC Market 4 Stars is because they sat us at a table meant for four people, problem was we were 5 people. We were jammed in there when we were actually the first table to arrive for brunch. Oh well, they got pretty busy and didn't have any wiggle room, so whatevs. The waiter was pleasant for such an early shift and knew how to wait a table, he wasn't to pushy or overly friendly. They had tables waiting by the time we finished and they didn't try to rush us at all. Kudos, because some places will rush you out if they have too many people waiting! Besides such a great waiter, the food was excellent! The Stirred Eggs! Ahh 5 stars, the pancakes (which I only had a bite of my friend's) amazing! The coffee kept flowing! The water kept coming! The pumpkin butter with the bread basket? I need the recipe! Thanks for a great brunch! Â  I will be back to try the dinner menu!
