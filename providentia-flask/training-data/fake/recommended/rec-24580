horrible customer service! I tried to put in a reservation and then hostess put me on hold which sounded like they were transfering me to a line that kept ringing and ringing. When I had called back the second time and told the hostess about this in a very curious manner she had the audacity to hang up on me! I don't know how some people managed to still be employed with that kind of behavior! Blah.
