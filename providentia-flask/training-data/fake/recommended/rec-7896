Seriously... they took my chips!?!?! After paying a ridiculous amount for guac.. I was with chip in hand and she took the rest of the chips from the table!!! It took a solid 5 minutes for the whole situation to register.   Other than that, the food was really good.  The prices weren't that bad but we didnt order entrees and both left very full.  The drinks were PHENOMENAL!  I would go for their speciality drinks alone.   Overall, good food, great drinks and super atmosphere... you should at least TRY it.
