The French onion soup was not hot enough, but I was staring at the bowl and ate it anyway.  By the way, it was really, really good.  Great flavor- if it would've been hot, it would be the best I've ever had. Cheesesteak Sammy was quite good- great roll, meat and cheese. (my wife had the chicken cheesesteak and it sucked- but what did she really expect, flavor?) Pretty solid list of beers to choose from too... And it's the oldest bar in Philly!  Over 150 years old.
