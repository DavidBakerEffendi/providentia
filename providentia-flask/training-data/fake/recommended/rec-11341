This was out first time here. We stopped in for brunch on Saturday. We had a good meal. Our server (Colleen L) was cool, friendly and attentive. Libations: - Blood Orange Margarita on the rocks (w/ sugar):  EXCELLENT !! - Red Sangria: Good, a little different style of Sangria then I am used to, was a little too sweet but it grew on me. Food: - Complimentary side of chips and two kinds of Salsa:  very good - Guacamole:  It was more of a pureed consistency (I prefer my guac chunkier). I thought the portion was skimpy for $8.00. I would prefer the chips to have been served in a side bowl instead of them pre-dunking the chips in the guac. (the chips were warm and that made the guac warm..... I like my guac cold). - Huevos Revueltos: Kate loved this - Chicken Chimichangnga: The  tortilla kind of had a frost bitten taste to it. The innards were dry, I had to hit it up with a lot of hot sauce. Overall, the experience was good. This is coming in at 3 stars. We will return to try some of the other items on the menu.
