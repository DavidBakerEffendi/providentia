YUM. This place is awesome. I came here with my cousin and a friend after walking around the West Village looking for a place to have dinner. This place is small but cozy, and really cute. There was a medicine cabinet in the bathroom (TAKE A LOOK IN IT!) with toothpicks, altoids, tampons, and some other necessities that a lot of us would need on a date or...if you're a girl. The staff here is awesome. Our waiter was hilarious, and made our visit so much nicer. He saw that I was the only one with some of my drink left, so he brought the rest of the table some beer. So friendly!! They have a small beer and wine selection, but their offerings are all quite good. We didn't get any cocktails but our neighbors did and they looked delicious.The food was great and they have an interesting selection of entrees. I ordered the shrimp n grits and was SO happy. My cousin got the omelet and our friend ordered the roast chicken. No complaints anywhere. They brought us bread, butter, and pickles beforehand which made our hungry tummies quite happy. They also had a small dessert selection (including cheeses and digestifs) but we were too full for dessert (gasp). I would definitely go here again. Decent prices, great food, great environment, great service.
