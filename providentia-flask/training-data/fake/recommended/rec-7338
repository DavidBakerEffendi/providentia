The restaurant had an upscale romatic feel.  It was very dimly lit. Not what I expected after reading reviews.  The food was very mediocre.  The sardines were fishy.  The beef dumplings were hollowed out meatballs with grease in the middle and drowning in a yogurt sauce.  The lamb kabab was good but a little chewy.  The yogurt sauce from the dumplings complimented the kebab well.  The brussel sprouts were a little charred but they were my favorite.  My biggest gripe about this place is the service.  Our waiter was terrible.  When I questioned him about a dish, he gave me vague answers.  At one point, his eyes drifted to another table clearly not paying attention.  I will never be back here.
