The food here is delicious but beware of wait time on weekends.  They also do not take reservations so it's first come first served.  We waited roughly an hour and a half on a saturday night.  All that aside, the food was fantastic.  Also a great atmosphere, but not for those who like a quiet dinner.  There are many large parties here and it's also BYOB so there are many loud people.  Overall, the food is great and the atmosphere is fun and exciting.  Definitely a must try!!!!!
