Just had a lovely post Gagosian Gallery Â dinner here tonight. It's vibe was a just the right balance of subdued and bustle for conversation. First off, the dining room imparts a warm tone of intimacy and warmth, good for either date night or, as in my case, dinner with an old friend. As it got later in the evening, the dining room eased comfortably to a warmer glow. Service was attentive, we did not have a reservation but we were luckily seated and by the time we left, the dining room was near capacity, nice energy for a Thursday night. I had the chicken livers, advertised as fried. It was tasty and the sweet and sour sauce and herbs were nice counterpoints but if they had more crunch to them, the contrast would have been more compelling. My friend had the squash and it met her expectations. It was a healthy but satisfying alternative. Her salmon entree also was well done. Nice Indian spices and cooked to order. I had the skate, evenly browned imparting a nice bite. The fish was fresh and cooked just right. It was on a bed of escarole, fresh and light. Curiously it's red pepper flakes may have been too heavy handed for the fish. Panna cotta with fresh berries was very yummy and tasted like summer. It had great texture and the ginger essence was perfect. All in all a very nice dinner. This is my second visit and will be a reliable and enjoyable go to place. Menu is very interesting, would be hard to tire of it!
