Good place to eat a delicious burger, but maybe a bit overhyped.  The wait seemed a bit ridiculous for a burger, and the place wasn't even that nice (yes, I get that it's a bar, but I would have expected something a little nicer and bigger).  Our waiter was a little rude and seemed annoyed to be serving us.  However, of course, the burgers make up for it.  If you have some free time and are in the West Village, I'd stop by, but I wouldn't necessary go out of my way to come here.
