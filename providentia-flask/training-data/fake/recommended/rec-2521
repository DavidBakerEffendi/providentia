i have been back 4 times since the last review. each time worse then before. the last time, my friend and i sat down. no staff was there. we waited, and waited. finally a girl came over. my friend was starving. and ordered as soon as she came over. she snapped at him to wait for me to order. ok? then i ordered an iced t. looked at the menu. figured it out. and she never came back. we just left. there was maybe 4 other customers there. and 2 staff members. no service. it was lunch time. we didnt have all day. went down to palm market. got a wrap. i cant go back here. it just plain sucks. the food is just ok and by no means cheap. in this economy, i have to spend my money on places that deserve my business. the other 3 times i was there. the service was just too slow. they should have never let the gm go.
