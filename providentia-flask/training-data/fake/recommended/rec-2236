Had 4 different tapas here and enjoyed the restaurant. It's a small place but it's on a corner and open enough to give a nice alfresco feel. The decor and ambience was nice as well as the waitstaff. I had croquetas, the beet salad, the sepia (cuttlefish) and the goat...Don't remember the full names, but you get the picture... I love tapas style eating and eating with someone who likes to sample and share is always a treat. The food was generally good, but I had a few critiques and being a Manhattan restaurant I'm judging a little harsher than usual. The croquettes were a little bland and there was a lemon cream sauce that should have added enough tartness, but I just didn't like the combination. I actually preferred the lemon sauce with the sepia. This was the first time I had ever eaten cuttlefish, so I'm not sure if it was cooked well, but it tasted good to me. The beets were a little underdone and too crunchy for my taste, but the greens underneath were very good. The goat was decent and served in a square, "spam" style portion. I loved the taste, but the texture left a little to be desired, too soft would be the only way I could describe it. My dining partner had a lot of good things to say about it but I definitely left wanting more. I probably could go back and have a better experience, but 3 stars is all I'm prepared to give at this point.
