I'm El Camino's newest biggest fan. A friend and I stopped in for some late night dinner and drinks and were pleasantly surprised by the cozy interior, friendly staff, and reasonable prices. I had the taco salad (yum!), a margarita and some draft beers. My bill came to around $25, which I thought was totally reasonable. Also, a big shoutout to the staff. We came in at 1:00am (an hour until close) and both the host and waitress were awesome and welcoming. This little Mexican place fits the cozy vibe of No. Libs. for sure. I will be back!
