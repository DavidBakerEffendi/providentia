If I had to pick my last meal on earth..it would probably be a hot steaming foil plate of Halal on 53rd and 6th. This place is so amazing!!! On my short trip to NYC, I neglected all the fine dining restaurants just for this joint. Not only is it the best thing you will ever eat but it is so cheap and they are so generous with the portions!!!!!!! I ordered the chicken platter and omg...it was definitely worth waiting in 10 degree weather. This is the only place I would wait in line for. Everything is so fresh!!!! I mean, they cook it right in front of you. They also have a lamb combo but I'm not too fond of lamb. The white sauce and hot sauce drenched all over the rice, salad, pita, and meat are TO D-I-E FOR !!! They also offer more white/hot sauce in little containers if you want!!! If you ever visit NY or even live here and have yet to try it..you're missing out big time. YUM YUM YUM!!!
