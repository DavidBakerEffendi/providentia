This place surprised me greatly. It was already quite packed at 5:30pm on Thurs, not what I expected in this part of Midtown, my old work stomping ground. Could've be the networking event hosted that night, though. The drink specials are $5 for select beers/wine and $6 for select specialty cocktails, respectively. I had the Bohemian Rhapsody specialty with Bombay Sapphire, St. Germaine, cucumber and some other ingredients. Though I suspect it came in a smaller glass than usual, it was a refreshing and just the light but kind of powerful cocktail I was hoping for. My friend and I also ordered food: the Grilled Pizza with Pancetta. I thought the dough was a bit much and the pancetta extra crispy like burnt bacon, but who doesn't love ANY form of bacon?! (Oh vegetarians huh...) It was still a tasty combination and did its job to line the stomach. Though my rating is conservative (if only there were a 3.5 button!), I really did quite like the place. The bartenders and other staff knew how to not take themselves too seriously, and some were actually quite engaging (shout out to Sean). It has a Murray Hill vibe with all the suits I saw, which would suck in actual Murray Hill, but for some reason works here. From experience I know going for drinks in the 55th to 63rd ish area from B'way on west can be such a pain. There's nothing cheap but still clean, classy, and responsible young professional friendly in this area. I suspect this could be changing some, and Ivy's a sign of that change, so I hope they keep the good downtown vibes going. I'll be back for sure if I'm around again!
