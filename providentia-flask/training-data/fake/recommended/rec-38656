Maybe it's the forever-smiling staff or the gargantuan painting of wading horses on the wall, but Su Xing House is really special. Please do yourself a favor and try the fried rice cake appetizer.  I have daydreams about its sticky sweetness.  The menu here is pretty huge, and  usually I find that to be a bit daunting, but everything I've sampled is amazing.  Whether you're into tofu, fresh vegetables or seitan, Su Xing will definitely have something for you.
