I wanted to do 4 1/2 stars because 5 means the place is unbeatable....with that said... I moved to this area a few years ago and desperately missed my former sushi stand by which was unbelievable quality and quantity for the money.  This whole area had either good portion size but not so hot sushi, and if the sushi was good the portion sizes were mini/tiny or outrageously priced.   Sushi house has proven to be very consistent in their quality, without any skimping and they really don't have any other competition locally - They really do offer high quality sushi with definitely reasonable prices considering that quality.  Besides that, I love their specials and all the diverse choices they have.   The place is clean, very friendly and cheerful inside.  It is also nice enough for a date.  Parking is tricky but Church street usually works.  I love their spicy tuna/avocado salad, and their seafood soup. Delivery is usually very fast.
