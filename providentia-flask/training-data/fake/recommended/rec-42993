Mom says if you dont have anything nice to say don't say anything at all. But I have to warn you. Bronte Burger was okay. I kind of liked the sweet chili sauce. The side salad was swimming in dressing. The space was incredibly small, so don't go with a large group. Â  The more I looked around the more scared I got. Not very clean, I just couldn;t get comfortable here.
