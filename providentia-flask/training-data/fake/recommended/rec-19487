Will you please stop yelling!?! I don't even know what you're saying!! Ahhh ramen - Every proper Asian loves their noodle and this little person is no different. I guess I came on a good day since there was no wait. I loved the atmosphere and seeing a bunch of Caucasian New Yorkers yelling in Japanese was very amusing...for the first 5 minutes. Then with every order there was more yelling. The restaurant was full, so the yelling never stopped. I wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry - midway through my conversations I'd forget what I was saying because I'd look up to see who was yelling, lol. It added to the atmosphere though. One can't be upset for that. I had ordered the Tori noodles, which were amazing. The broth was light but had the most flavor I had ever had in a broth. For $2 you can add more noodles, but as the menu warns you, you need to make sure you saved enough broth for it. Steller deal. For desert, we had a tofu custard topped with a choice of sorbet. I was hesitant over ordering the tofu custard, but am glad I did. It had a very strong and rich custard flavor, but without the heaviness in the texture. It was amazing and I would highly recommend it to anyone. Asian stamp of approval.
