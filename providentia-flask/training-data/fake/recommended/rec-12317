Went with a friend during lunch time.  Got there around 12:15pm.  There was no wait, so thats great.  Its a pretty big place, it has two floors. We ordered the following Appetizers Sweet Potato Fries - Nothing special here, I was actually not too fond of it, but it was ok.  I wouldnt order it again. Smushed Potatoes - Also nothing too special here, but I definitely enjoyed eating this.  It looks like mini potatoes with comes with garlic aioli sauce.  I enjoyed this and would order it again. Entrees Both of us got the Umami Original Burger, I asked to remove the cheese as I'm not a cheese fan.  The burgers were made medium rare, but it looked pretty rare, which we were both concerned about but have ate medium rare steak before so we decided to just eat it as intended.  The burger itself was delicious, but personally could have used more flavor for me.  They did give 3 dipping sauces, one was some kind of garlic, another one was a spicy orange sauce and I forget the last one. Overall I think I could try this again, different burger and push it to be cooked Medium instead.  That or try the Ahi Tuna burger next time.
