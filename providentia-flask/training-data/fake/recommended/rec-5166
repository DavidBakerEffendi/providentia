Was excited to see a new BBQ place near my old apartment. Too bar it wasn't there while I was still living here. Went in with my old roommate and waited 10 minutes before anyone came up to seat us. After finally being seated, it was another 10 minutes before anyone brought over waters or menus. Finally we got to order. When the food finally came- our waitress disappeared again and we were forced to go up to the bar just to ask for napkins and plastic utensils. Once we saw our waitress across the restaurant I had to again get up to ask for real knives. Service aside, I will say the food was amazing. Well-priced and quite delicious. Unfortunately, I think I'll only be doing take-out from here on out.
