Everything about this place is great. The flavor, the portion size and the price. We shared Â basil chicken with wide wonton noodle. Excellent. Then we each had a bowl of coconut soup with noodles and and chicken. The broth was so good I could have eaten a gallon of it. None of the dishes are over $10. Most of the soups and noodle dishes are 6.95 and 7.95. I tried to find something, anything, to ding the place about but I could not. All I can do is gush. Highly recommended.
