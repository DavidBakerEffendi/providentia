So there aren't that many filipino food places left in Manhattan. That said, Grill 21 has been open for over a year now, and they make filipino food accessible to the masses. I tried the ginitang sitaw (first time), adobong pusit, and their crispy pata. Yum! I need to try breakfast, but I know I probably be a repeat offender. This will be saving me several trips to Queens to satisfy cravings! If you are in the East Village and want to try something new, this place is for you!
