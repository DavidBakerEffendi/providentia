This is going to be short and sweet. From beginning to the end I loved everything about. The service was impeccable. Our was waiter (Dae) was OUTSTANDING I could not have asked for better service. He was very helpful with our food choices and helping my boyfriend and I find the right drink. After test tasting some of their wines I didn't really like any of them so he went and told "maybe the drink manager" idk that we could not find something and she made something that was absolutely perfect and fit the taste that we were looking for. The food was delicious and it was just a great experience. I would say this is the best restaurant that I have visited with outstanding food, service and atmosphere.
