I LOOOOOOVE this place! This is one of the last real-food restaurants in NYC, I believe. I don't buy shoes, I don't buy clothes, don't get drunk at bars, but what I do like to spend my money on is FOOD, and boy, I'll tell you, this is the one restaurant in Brooklyn (possibly even NYC) that I can drop a few Jacksons on a luscious meal and feel like I've got my money's worth. First of all, the head chef has been on-site each time, every time I've been there. How many restaurants can say that? Usually, the main chef is never around and leaves it to his underlings to do all the work. Not so at Get Fresh. Chef supervises all dishes and even comes out to make sure you're enjoying it. Wonderful. Second of all, the food is locally and naturally sourced and prepared fresh on-site! Nothing will ever taste like it's reheated at this place. Plus, seasonings are always perfect, and food is perfectly cooked. All the meat is moist and flavorful, and the veggies are tender but not soggy. Third, staff is uber-friendly and accommodating. This and the Chocolate Room, also on 5th, are THE best htings in Park Slope!
