This place is very different. We had a few dishes here...fish, handmade pasta with pine nuts, mussels, a variety of cocktails, and cobbler in a cast iron pan for dessert. I really enjoyed the interesting feel. It was a very farm to table restaurant, with just the right touches. I recommend only for maybe a date night...or dinner with friends. Not the best place to take the kids.
