I really wanted to like this place. Alas, I went here for brunch last month, and the best part about it was the iced tea. I ordered the open-faced chicken sandwich on country bread.  What a mistake.  The chicken was bland and rubbery.  The bread sucked. I decided not to order dessert, as I was so disappointed in my meal.
