The food was so delicious I nearly shed a tear. (I see someone else actually did weep... I guess it's just that good.) The Vermont goat braised with toasted quinoa and honey-yoghurt sauce. The banana-pecan cake with *chocolate malt* ice cream. Wow. Yum. I went alone on a Thursday around 9 and they fit me in right away at the bar. The bartender was mildly friendly and very generous, offering me a complimentary glass of wine, and always checking at the right times whether I needed anything. Great concept here, which I really think needs to be incorporated at more restaurants ASAP - local food and information about the ingredient suppliers very visible on the menu. I want to know where the food I eat is coming from. Don't you?
