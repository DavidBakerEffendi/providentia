i had dinner here last weekend with a friend. minimalist decor, which my friend liked a lot. friendly/attentive wait staff. the co-owners (chefs?) were also nice. two dishes - swiss chard pancake and brussels sprouts leaves - were mediocre. and two dishes - seared scallop scampi and east coast halibut - were good. in short: overpriced for good, but not great food.
