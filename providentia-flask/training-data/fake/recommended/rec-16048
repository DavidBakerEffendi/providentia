This review is for a Saturday brunch. You walk in to the smell of waffles....(duh!). great start. Put our names down, and sat at the bar and I had the Macchiato. Definitely, one of the better Macchiatos I've had in recent times. Very bold and a lot of flavor. OK, It was sunny and somewhat warm outside, so we decided to sit outside in the small patio at the back of the restaurant. amazing. We waited for about 10 mins before we got seated by the super friendly Maitre D'. I had the baguette with nutella ($4) thinking it would be a small portion for that price, and also ordered the waffles. But it was an actual sized baguette. Hey, I wasn't complaining! Was just trying to figure out how to finish that and the waffles I ordered. I got the Gaufre Dame Blanche (waffles with belgian chocolate, vanilla ice cream and whipped cream). They were so decadent...I loved it. I'm normally more of a western-omelet-for-brunch kinda guy, but I don't regret this sinful decision I made. Amazing. Also, a couple of my friends got the omelet, and said the mashed potatoes on the side were to die for! You need the whole party to get seated and they don't take reservations for brunch. Still totally worth it.
