Johnny Brenda's is one of my favorite places to see a show. The sound is great and with the standing room near the stage and in the balcony, you can almost always get a good view. The menu pisses me off real bad. It's on a chalkboard near a window and there is constantly a glare on it. You have to dance around the dining room and stand at other people's tables until you're at just the right angle, and then you get to read things like PANINI. C'mon. Panini?! Anything could be on a panini. I don't want to nag my server and make them explain every item on the menu. Once you randomly order a nondescript plate of food, it's usually kind of decent. Their burgers are pretty good, a manageable size and juicy for a small patty. I do always have a great time at Johnny Brenda's. The location makes it a perfect place to start or end your night. The DJs in the downstairs usually play pretty fun stuff, the service is good and the beer list is great.
