This is a lovely neighborhood restaurant. I love that Zizi Limona does not adhere to one med country's particular cuisine, but rather includes tastes from a variety of countries.  The beer and wine selection also represents a mix of med countries, and my husband and I were very appreciative to sample a variety of beers specifically. First, they greet you with warm pita and tahini.  It's very tasty. For apps, we had the grilled eggplant, the gravlox, and the shishito peppers.  Of the three, the gravlox was the best.  The grilled eggplant app was smaller, so I'd skip it next time.  It still tasted delicious, though, so it doesn't decrease my star rating. We had a special salad that included grilled artichokes, black olives, yogurt sauce, arugula, and anchovy aioli. Then, we had shakshuka, which was equally scrumptious. Our servers were cheerful, attentive, and knowledgeable.  It's clean, relaxed and homey.   All in all, I highly recommend checking this place out!  We will be back...and soon!
