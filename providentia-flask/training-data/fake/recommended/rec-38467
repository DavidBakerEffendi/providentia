Lets be serious, the reason why people come here WAS for the unlimited sangria brunch.  The food itself is decent enough but definitely not worth a month wait; eggs and chorizo arent exactly the most thrilling food options. I went to brunch this past Sunday (post Irene) and was shocked to see how much the set up has changed.  The sangria is no longer self serve, the servers literally avoid eye contact so they don't have to continuously refill you.  Also as soon as youre done eating you're done drinking, they just stop and want no linger time. Granted I understand they dont want people sticking around for hours getting smashed but this just felt like an entirely different restaurant.  It's now located in a hotel that felt stuffy and a bit outdated. I definitely won't be waiting a month to come back here, if its a boozy brunch that you're looking for, look elsewhere....RIP old Calle Ocho
