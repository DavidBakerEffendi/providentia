I wish I could give this place less than one star. This was the worst experience I have ever had at a bar. I came here with friends on a Saturday night. There was no one checking IDs at the door, but the bartender asked to see them when my friends ordered. We're 23, yet the bartender accused them of having fake IDs. His exact quote was, "There's no way this is you" (even though it was). I wasn't drinking, and yet he asked to see my ID and also accused me of using a fake. Again, to be clear, these are legitimate IDs. I try to assure him that they are real, and he sarcastically notes, "Oh, I guess if you promise." He finally serves my friends with a roll of his eyes. We go to sit on stools towards the end of the bar, and quickly get reprimanded by another employee for trying to go to the garden, which was closed, even though that's not where we were headed. Overall, the employees, particularly the bartender, were condescending and rude. I will never return here. I recommend heading to a bar with employees who have actually learned the meaning of customer service.
