Best brunch I've had in ages. I got a head-start on one of my 2013 resolutions, which is to eat in other burroughs more often, and it was splendid. Brooklyn Star is across the street from the Lorimer St stop off the L train, which makes it a cinch to find. Word to the wise - get there when they open at noon, so you don't have to wait, and can start your delicious feast earlier. I opted for the chicken and waffles, which blew me away. Chicken is perfectly crispy, as are the waffles - there's also a hint of lemon in the waffle batter, which was the shiz. A surprise treat that accompanied my meal was a fresh half grapefruit that is glossed with a coat of hardened sugar (think the topping on creme brule). Heaven. I'll be back as soon as I'm able.
