The Charred Octopus is a good! The first time I had it, it was made perfectly. The 2nd time I had it, the texture/flavor/crunch was somewhat off. (From the first experience) On the initial bite, the octopus was perfectly crispy with a pinch of salty taste. As you bite into it, it becomes so soft and tender that it melts in your mouth. I had the Wild Skate fish, and it is more on the sour side. It was delicious and the potato foam was a great complement. Had the chocolate mousse and ended dinner there. Portions are small. Service was great!!! The waitress did not mind at all taking her time to answer all our curious questions about the food.
