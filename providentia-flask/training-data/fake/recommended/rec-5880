the one time i went here it was packed to the gills with people who had overactive elbows. i ordered four shot of a mid-range tequila for my friends and myself, and was flat-out appalled at the price. down the street a shot of a way better tequila was a few whole dollars cheaper. after being disgusted with the price and overcrowded atmosphere, we promptly left. if/when i go back here, i'll update the review.
