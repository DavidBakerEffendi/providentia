Jose's has a bit of a cult-like following, which I've never understood.  I live in the neighborhood, so I've ended up getting burritos from here at least a dozen times over the years.  They've always been moderately sized and suitably flavorful, but certainly never anything that I'd go out of my way to get,  I've tried their quesadillas and tacos as well, and they were perfectly average.  On the plus side, the staff is very friendly and service is quick.  I also really like the shack-in-the-wilderness space.  If you're in the neighborhood, a visit to Jose's isn't likely to disappoint, but El Jarocho remains my top pick for casual Mexican food in Philly.
