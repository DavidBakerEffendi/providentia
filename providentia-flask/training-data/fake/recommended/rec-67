Toast is such a cute place with a very cute name! I'm so happy this coffee shop on my block reopened...and they reopened for the better (formerly known as YOLO formerly known as Odd Fellows)! Everyone who works at Toast is so friendly and I love its bright atmosphere. Their coffee is strong and amazing. I'm a big fan of their Americanos and lattes.
