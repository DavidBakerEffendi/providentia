I was pleasantly surprised by this place.  It has really amazing ambiance and the food and service were both great.  This is a great little find for anyone wanting something unique, but not pretentious.  This place has a private little area where two or four could dine.  When I go next time, that will be my spot.  The drinks are done well and the prices were reasonable!  Great job in having the reservation tied in through Yelp.  It made the process very easy to book.
