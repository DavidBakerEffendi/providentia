This goes to the top of the list of the best cheap eats in Philly. This is a popular place for great noodles (especially the 'knife cut' noodles, which you could say is very thick and doughy, reminding me of a European style 'dumpling'). Tell me what's better than rich broth with tender meat (my favorite is the ox-tail) and pickled vegetables. At around $6, it can't be beat. Folks should be aware that this place is pretty small. Also, this is a more 'Northern' style of Chinese food, quite different from the rest of Chinatown which is still pretty heavily Cantonese influences.
