been coming here since it first opened.  its solid.  the burger is amazing, just had it again at lunch today, so tasty, better than dumont burger by far. owner/maitreD danny is great, always makes sure you are taken care of.  staff is great... especially the bartender with the long hair, he is a real bartender.  friendly but not fake about it, makes great drinks, is intelligent and funny.  love that guy. anyways, so glad this place is here and serves lunch now too!
