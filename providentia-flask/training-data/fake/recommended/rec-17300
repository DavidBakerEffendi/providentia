Costenera is awesome! While out with friends who weren't familiar with Peruvian food our waiter kindly walked us through the menu and by the end of the evening we were all fans. The Hauncaina Tasting and Pescado (ceviche) were the perfect blend of spicy freshness. My rotisserie chicken was succulent and perfectly seasoned, and the pan roasted Atlantic Cod was perfection. Our small group was having such a good time I looked to see if we were bothering the other diners only to see everyone was too busy enjoying themselves to notice. Excellent cuisine, gracious service, and a wonderfully inviting ambience.
