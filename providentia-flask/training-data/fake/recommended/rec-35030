First, please note that the yelp times are incorrect. This spot closes daily at 3 pm. They no longer have an evening shift. My partner gives this place 5 stars. He ordered the strawberry short cake pancakes with bacon and eggs. He loved his food, and he tends to fid something wrong with everything so that is saying a lot. I, on the other hand, am a vegan. There were a lot of vegan options, which is great. I had the belgian gluten free waffle and a side of vegan chili. The waffle was pretty good and moist. They served it with vegan butter which was also rich. The vegan chili was good, too. It tasted a lot like Aunt Amy's canned chili and looked like it. Wouldnt be surprised if that's exactly what it was. Id give this place a 3.5-4 stars just on what I ordered. Â  I also had fresh squeezed orange juice which was good. The staff was nice and friendly. I went around 2:30 pm and the place was virtually empty. It is definitely family/baby friendly. I would definitely go back and try some of their other dishes.
