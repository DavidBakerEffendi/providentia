Came here with a friend, ordered the $28 prix fixe which is a DEAL, almost to much food... well not almost, we both took a great deal home. But it was nice to try a number of different items. The Canallini beans were delicious, the salads delicious and the pasta really good.  Nothing that I would cross neighborhoods for, but I would 100% go back if I was nearby.  The wine on tap was a great addition as well. Service was super friendly and very casual.  The whole vibe was casual and kick back.  The server could have been a little more perceptive, but her demeanor worked with the vibe of the place.
