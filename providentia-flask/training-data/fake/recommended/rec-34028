I overheard a couple speaking about this place only this morning and come nightfall when deciding on where to eat, I thought about it again. So I had a look here on yelp - saw all the good reviews - and headed over. We were greeted to a loud and bustling restaurant cum bar with a cozy interior (but then again - that seems to be the norm here). Service was spot on, as was the food. We shared the skins, which were awesome and quite filling. The tako taco was somewhat a mixed fare: the ingredients were great, but the taco itself overpowered the delicate flavors of the filling (squid). A lot of dishes have somewhat japanese influences (or at least something japanese splashed over them). The chicken and waffles was pretty great, though too salty (as a european i find a lot of foodstuffs too salty here). The fish and chips was great but far too much food. Made me feel wasteful, but there's just no finishing a plate like that. The fish is a whole fish (a snapper if i recall correctly), and comes with enough chips to feed a third world country. For valentine's day they had this great gin coctail: a variation on a gin fizz, which was just perfect as well. In the end the bill did run up quite a bit, and having to pay cash left us having to go get some more, but they reassured us that they were getting that sorted.
