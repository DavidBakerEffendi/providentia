I had been meaning to visit the Hopewell Valley Bistro & In for a long time.  My parents had visited in the past and had nice things to say about the place.   My boyfriend and I visited tonight for dinner.  It was early Saturday evening and the place was almost full.   We began the meal with the salad bar which was very good and had nice items like raw green peppers and broccoli,  tomatoes, potato salad, beets, bean salad and of course lettuce.   My boyfriend had the Manhattan Clam Chowder, Chicken Paprika and I had the vegetable plate with Spinach, Spaetzel and mixed veggies (green beans and carrots).  The food was very good, I thought it was cheap that the chicken was only dark meat but my boyfriend didn't mind and enjoyed the food.  My vegetable plate was tasty and the spinach had a lot of nice garlic.   It took a while to get our food but we didn't mind since we weren't in a hurry and had the salad bar and the soup did arrive quickly.  I would plan to visit again.
