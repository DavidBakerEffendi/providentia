First of all I would like to say that the food was delicious and plentiful.  Also our waiter was great, attentive but not over bearing and had good menu suggestions. I am giving only 3 stars because of the hostess who helped seat us.  We got to the restaurant at 6pm on a Thursday night.  We were taking our adult children out for my son's birthday. (there was 5 of us)  Anyway, when we got there the place was relatively empty but they tried seating us in a side building that we had to go outside across a courtyard to access.  It was so cold inside and the first table she offered us was right next to the door.  We asked to sit away from the door and got a little attitude from her.  After sitting down we realized it was just too cold in this outer buildingso we went back across the courtyard and asked to be seated inside the main building.  After some eye rolling the hostess had the nerve to tell us we would have to wait for a table.  My daughter asked her how long the wait was but since there were so many open tables the hostess  had to seat us.  She was soooo rude and I wanted to complain right away to the manager but my kids didn't want a scene and I didn't want to ruin the night.  Having said all this we did have a great time but the management should know how unprofessional their hostess behaved  Also the music is fun but a little too loud.
