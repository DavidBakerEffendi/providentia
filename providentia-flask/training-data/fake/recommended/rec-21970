Cute little place and great service. We ordered the Fried Calmari as an appetizer.  Nice and yummy.  The hubs also ordered a Thai Iced Coffee and I guess it was good because he drank that really fast. The spiciness levels are pretty accurate so pay heed if you don't want your food too spicy. I got the Tofu Pad Thai as my entree.  I thought the noodles were a little too mushy but overall it was ok.  I don't think I would order that again. And the hubs ordered Pineapple Fried Rice - that was good! The dishes were only ok to me and I think I would stick to Penang in East Hanover for my Thai food fix.
