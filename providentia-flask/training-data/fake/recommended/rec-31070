Very unique concept but not worth the price.  Six of us had dinner with 1-2 drinks for some, shared 3 desserts and our bill was $560 plus tip.  For that price I prefer to choose from a menu and not have to go to a salad bar, and flag someone down for my entree.  Did anyone notice how rarely they brought the fillet mignon around? I asked 4 times for it and no one ever brought it even though they all said they would send someone "right over."  Did get a piece of sirloin that was very tough and the grilled pineapple dessert was so tough I couldn't cut it even with a knife! They really push the sausage and cheaper cuts of meat. Salad bar was good but not over the top. A dining experience that I won't be returning to any time soon.
