Jimmy's Diner = AMAZING!!!!  My absolute favorite brunch spot in New York City by far. Jimmy's won my heart over the first time I placed my foot in the door.  They have an incredible selection of comfort food, awesome bloody mary's (by awesome I mean best bloody mary I've ever had) and serve breakfast all day. My go to is the three egg scrambler with egg whites, kale, spinach, onions, jalapenos and guacamole. It also comes with your choice of home fries or grits and a substantial serving of cornbread. I usually get the home fries with mine, but the grits are pretty delicious too. =) If you do not have a gluten intolerance and love breakfast, please get the big boy. It has everything you hoped for and more. It entails 2 pancakes (they are out of this world - favorite pancakes in Brooklyn/Manhattan), 2 eggs, cheesy grits (so good with their maple syrup) or home fries, bacon or sausage, and corn bread. It's oh so good! On top of their amazing food, Jimmy's has a great vibe. The place is full of character, and it has an outstanding crew. They are very welcoming, fun to be around, and deliver great service. I promise if you try Jimmy's, you will be back in no time!
