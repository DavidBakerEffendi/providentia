Jean George's organic food restaurant.. This is my 3rd time within 4 months back to this restaurant.. spacious, almost everything white ambiance provide customer a casual elegant dinning experience, and of course, food is also delicious... from the juice bar: everything seems soo healthy and make you feel good.. i had a celery/ pear/ apple/ ginger mix juice... my usual detox drink from the dining room: * crudites w anchovy dips... highly recommend, if you are on a diet but still can't resist gourmet food ... * chicken liver toast *mackerel sashimi marinated w ginger and mint *akaushi cheese burger w herbed mayo, pickled japanese jalapenos and fries (my friend who worked at ABC carpet was bragging about this burger... worth to try) * black sea bass with chilies, herbs, red bliss potatoes and spinach (this dish is just an okay for me) dessert *market strawberries and juice, lime, meringue w sour cream poppy sorbet (if you like sweet with a touch of sourness, this refreshing dessert will be an ultimate choice)
