Great bar for pints, food, meeting friends. The ear inn was a longshoreman's bar, and has been slowly maturing at its location for over 100 years.  The bar is ancient and solid and the atmosphere is friendly and den like -- almost smoky like an old bar should be (just seems that way, there's no smoking there nowadays). For a bar, they really care about some of the food: the fish of the day is often a real treat.  Don't feel compelled to order food if you sit at a table: the waitresses are happy to serve you beer to your heart's content. Not for your chi-chi friends, but everyone else will appreciate.
