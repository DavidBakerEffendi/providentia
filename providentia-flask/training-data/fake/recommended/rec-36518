I went for a late brunch after shopping on Bleeker on my way back to the 1. I had the shakhuka and it was tasty, plus I got extra pita points at no charge to dip in the tasty Â and slightly spicy tomato based sauce. There were several dishes I would try on the menu and would definitely go back. This place is very very small and does cater to a little bit of everyone. This isn't the best place to bring in a stroller or a large group as there isn't much room. And to the snarky party who bitched every time a new patron walked in and let in some cold air- check your attitude at the door. For the less petty people out there, hope to see you at Meme sometime soon.
