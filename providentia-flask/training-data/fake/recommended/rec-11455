I agree with everything you people have said. You can't beat it, the prices are cheap the food is excellent, the rolls are fresh and very very clean. The staff was awesome and service excellent. The location of it is kind of crazy but that's part of the charm i guess. Overall if you couldn't tell I loved it!!
