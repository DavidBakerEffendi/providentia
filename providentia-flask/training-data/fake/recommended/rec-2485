So I came to Philly and took the cheesesteak challenge.  After watching a special on the food network, I knew I had to take the Pats vs. Geno's challenge.  After a short drive from the philly airport I found myself at Passyunk and 9th, the home of Pat's and Geno's.  I chose Pat's first, avoiding the mass of neon lights across the street.  I picked up my cheese wit, put it in the car and moved next door to Geno's where I got yet another cheese wit. I then ran back to my car, split them in half and dove in for the taste test that had been years in the making.  After a bite into each, there was an obvious winner, Pats handsdown blows geno's out of the water.  Although the meat from pats may have sat around slightly too long, it was still full of flavor and just plain delicious.  I know where to go when I come back to philly now.
