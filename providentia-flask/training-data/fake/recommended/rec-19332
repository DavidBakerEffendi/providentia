This cart saved my life the other night! After a long night at Johnny Utah's, I got a combo of chicken and lamb with rice and foolishly put a lot of hot sauce. I had a TERRIBLE experience. My soul jumped out of my skin! Seriously, if you need a yummy fix after a great night of fun make your way to 53rd and 6th.
