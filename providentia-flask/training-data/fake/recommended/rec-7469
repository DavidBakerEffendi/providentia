CASH ONLY! Came here for crepes with a girlfriend. What a cute little restaurant! There's all sorts of kooky knick knacks, presumably from their travels in France. I opted for an omelette because I have a mental block with savory crepes. My friend had the orientale crepe which she demolished (lol sorry C) and I had most of my omelette and side salad. The omelette was good, not phenomenal, so I regret not making an attempt at the crepes. We shared a sweet crepe for dessert. Delicious. Would definitely come again for dinner and probably in the summertime for outdoor seating!
