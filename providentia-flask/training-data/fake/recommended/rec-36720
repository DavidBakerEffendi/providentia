I was pleased to stumble upon this place while waiting for a bus in Hartford the other day. I had lunch here so it wasn't as crowded as I know it must be at night, but the food was great, I had a burger and sweet potato fries. Service was fine, but like I said it was lunchtime. I'd love to hang here for the evening, they have great selection of beer on tap, like the naughty nurse or Norwegian wood that I'd love to try. and sometimes they have live comeday and live music. It's def worth going here.
