Hands down the best Kati rolls I have ever tried! A bunch of friends and I went to NY for 5 days of which we ate here twice. That says a lot considering how many places there are to try in NY! They have a crazy variety of rolls such as chicken, paneer, aaloo, lamb and so many more. Really neatly wrapped and great in size. We were full from just 1 roll but the taste has us eating multiples! They stay open late and have fast service. Not really a nice sit down place, more of a fast food environment with restaurant quality food. If you are in NY- put this on your list- it's a must have!
