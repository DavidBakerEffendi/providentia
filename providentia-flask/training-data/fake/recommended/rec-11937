can't believe i haven't written a review for corner bistro yet~! been here a few times - place is known for their burgers. loooved living in the w.village, where this place was walking distance. open late. cheeseburgers are orgasmic. my gf got the bistro burger (w/bacon) no frills type of place. *2 thumbs up* you won't be disappointed!
