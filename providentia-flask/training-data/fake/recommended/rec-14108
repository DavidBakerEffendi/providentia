There's not really anything about this place that I can say that hasn't been said before: it's cheap, it's fast, and it's absolutely delicious.  The sandwiches are made fresh and come nearly instantly.  The only problem with the area is that it's constantly mobbed by people -- but hey, it's Chinatown.
