The food was delicious. The atmosphere was very diner esq which is fine just not what I was expecting. The photos on the wall grossed me out. The server was very nice. I would like to come back in the summer and sit outside. The free Lager was a bonus too. They also were knowledgeable about gluten free items on the menu which was good for my girlfriend.
