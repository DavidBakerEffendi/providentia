5 stars? Really? YES. REALLY!  The food is bloody amazing!  The service is spot on and the prices are reasonable for what you are served. There is no good reason not to come here (except that you might not be able to get a table).  Unlike some other places in Burlington you don't pay a premium to eat and drink local product. Not to say this is a cheap place to eat...but for the quality; it is a bargain.  Enjoy!
