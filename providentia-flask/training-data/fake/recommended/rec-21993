Still five stars... 1. Make a reservation 2. Bring wine 3. Enjoy a delish app like clams or mussels 4. Enjoy a 8oz piece of fresh fish 5. Enjoy a delish dessert 6. Pay $70 for two Blue Point is about 25 Min's from my house and has been on my top list of go to restaurants for several years now. Ive eaten here many many times. I love arriving and scanning the menu for something new. The menu changes daily so you will never get something too far out of season. The seafood market next door is owned by the same people so stop in there if you have not yet (see my review). I cannot stress enough, make a reservation. They can be booked up 100% even on a week night. They will open your wine for you while you wait if you do come in as a walk in.
