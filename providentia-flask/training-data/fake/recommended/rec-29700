They need to change the name of this restaurant to "Tourist Trap" because that's exactly what it is. The food is fine, but not extraordinary and definitely not worth the prices you see on the menu. You won't find a bottle of wine cheaper than $43 and if you want a carafe of the house wine, be ready to spend $30. Every entree on the dinner menu is $20 plus. The Zagat ratings went to this restaurant's head. You have to be a sucker to regularly patronize this place. But this establishment isn't for savvy New Yorkers, it's for clueless tourists. You should save your money and go to a steakhouse for the prices they charge here...unless you're looking to pay $55 for a $10 bottle of wine.
