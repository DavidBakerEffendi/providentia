If, like me, you think it's unbelievable that Cabin Porn doesn't update every second, step into the genuine article at this tucked away cafe right next to the scenic BQE. It's like nearby Portland fetishists Second Stop Cafe turned up to 11 without the grotesque hipster circus. It's Put A Bird On It to the nth degree, with dark wood, paisley wallpaper, Victorian paraphernalia, a weird little skylit porch space, typewriters riding pianos, and a fuckin fireplace. No coffee shop in the city except maybe Milk and Roses can touch HOSW for atmosphere. Every part of this place will charm the shit out of even the smallest, blackest heart of the biggest witch-house fan. Even the tiny, delicious sandwiches are adorable (try the fig, apple, and brie). I took the booth by the fireplace thinking it was just lame decor until the barista came by and lit it, instantly making it my favorite place in New York. And it's a good thing because otherwise HOSW can be drafty as hell. The place can be full but still quiet and cozy, and even on a Sunday there's usually a seat or two free. It breaks my heart but the coffee is not good. The regular drip and americano is just one solid step above diner quality. It hurts bad, but you could just go down Lorimer to Second Stop or Gimme and chug one of their quality cups and then set up camp at HOSW. The only other thing I would ever ask of it is maybe beer or wine, but if they had that I might never leave.
