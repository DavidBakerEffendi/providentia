Not sure exactly what I was expecting but I certainly expected more duck on the menu. I loved the charred eggplant wonderful flavor and its not often I see piri piri  on a menu. The one duck item is smoked duck (think charcuterie) over a salad, personally I thought it could have used a touch of salt but overall very good. Pipi kalau - short ribs were tasty my companions favorite dish.  The nuts were wonderful I'd like to figure out the recipe and have as a snack at home. Nice atmosphere with miss matched furnishings and a cozy local place feel.
