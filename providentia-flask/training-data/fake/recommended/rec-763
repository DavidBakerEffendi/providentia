The line was extremely long but moved quickly and everyone sitting around seemed to be really enjoying these tasty sandwiches. I got the Roast Pork, Provolone and Broccoli Rabe. The sandwich was very juicy and tasty but I was not a fan on the Broccoli Rabe (a little too strong for me). I would go for the Peppers instead of the Broccoli Rabe next time. The bread was fresh with perfectly melted provolone along with that juiciest pork.
