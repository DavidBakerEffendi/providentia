Went here on Saturday night with a friend who knows the owners/chef. score!  Sat at the bar and snacked on delicious olives drenched in oil and rosemary and lemon -- amazing. I seriously love love love the decor. It is super rustic with dim lighting and candles in lanterns all over the place. Very romantic but also good for a nice night with the ladies over several glasses of wines. You can sit outside, or inside at  a table, or by the bar in a long hightop (which is where we sat and I loved the more relaxed feel of that) Now the most important part - the food. Honestly, the only thing I can say is that every single bite was better than the next. Literally, I couldn't believe it just kept getting better. We had 3 apps, a salad, ravioli, and soft shell crab and the entrees were duck and chicken for two. Everything was cooked to perfection and out of this world. All the way down to the dessert (banana heaven something) and the little chocolote peanut butter treats at the end.  Drinks are great too -- I suggest theone involving cucumber and gin. oh and DO NOT forgot to get some bread and butter. Their special butter is mind blowing. Seriously, HEAVEN in  my mouth. I would go here every day if I could afford it.
