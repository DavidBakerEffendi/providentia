No wonder the chef was a runner-up, but I'm surprised he was even on tv with such lousy overall service, ambiance and food. The restaurant is tiny, maybe 400 square feet and the tables are communal, so be prepared to squash yourself into an uncomfortable seat.  The staff is horrible, they clearly hate their job and seem to hate each other as well.  They also move with the urgency of slugs.  Now, the food is really amazingly overpriced.  The scallop dish is once large scallop sliced into 10 pieces served with slivers of a pita.  The burger is 2 small sliders.  Skate wing is about 2 ounces of fish and over oily greens on top.  The pork buns were ok, but I was shocked that they served cherry chutney on the side and warned us about being careful that the pits were still in there.  How could you leave a choking and tooth hazard in the food?  The chefs couldn't even take the time to take the cherry pits out?  All the dishes I just mentioned were tiny and between $12-15.  Def not worth the overall experience and the tiny portions that were mediocre.
