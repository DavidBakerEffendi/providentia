Great food, great atmosphere, and very authentic! I came here with a friend and ordered the katsu filet donburi and the katsu filet curry. They're curry was definitely 5 star but their donburi only a 4. The curry was great, not too salty. The donburi was a bit bland, but that could have been compared to the curry. The filets were a perfect size for two girls with relatively small portion sizes, I would recommend the loin if you want leaner meat and/or more meat (the filet is 70 g and the loin is 240 g). They were also perfectly crispy! Definitely coming back to try the croquette.
