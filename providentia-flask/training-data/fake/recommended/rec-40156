My wife had seen on Yelp the rave reviews this place gets for its veggie burgers, so we decided to give it a try today. We each ordered a veggie burger- I thought it was okay- nothing to rave about. However, now my stomach feels totally bloated and cramped, and so does my wife's, and those burgers were the only thing we ate in common today. In summary, if you have a craving for veggie burgers that'll put you on the can for an hour, National Mechanics is the way to go.
