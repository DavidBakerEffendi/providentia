I love this local restaurant in the village.  delicious Italian food and great salads.  I have been to Malatesta at least 5 or 6 times....and plan to go back many more.  I love the pasta diavolina and the raviolis.  I have had their fish specials on several occasions and it was always real real tasty.  The artichoke and arugula salad special....fabulous.  Wine list: nondescript, but the chianti is fine if you like wine with dinner.  Foccacia bread: unimpressed....just a filler if you are starving when you arrive.  I'll be back again and again....until next time.
