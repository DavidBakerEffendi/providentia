This is my go-to West Philly jawn when I don't feel like making the trek to center city but I need some comfort food and a beer. I rarely get the pizza (it's decent but not incredible). The baked ziti is really good, as are most of their other pastas. The paninis are tasty, too. The laid-back bar staff are attentive and friendly, and even though it's in a college area, it's not overrun with undergrads. In the summer, it's a good spot to sit on the patio and drink a beer while surfing the free wireless. They also sell 6-packs and have a pretty decent beer selection.
