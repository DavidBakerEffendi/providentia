I attended a family, small group event with a five course dinner. The party room was shared with another event seperated by a shakey partition wall. Space was tight and we needed to walk through the other party to use the restrooms. The room was chilly and the chairs slightly uncomfortable. Overall, cleanliness was a little below average. The appetizers were the highlight and included antipasta salad and fried calamari. It was followed by a garden salad which was a mescilin mix with a grape tomato. The dried, sliced sub roll in the plastic green basket was the available bread. They had water, coke and diet coke, but no sprite? It is a BYOB and Sprite apparently. The penne in vodka was swimming and the tomato sauce was spicy. I had chicken parmesan that was complimented by green beans and a fried potato stick. The food was bland. I couldn't even guess what the fried potato was due to the lack of taste. I awarded the two stars because it was a family memory. I especially liked the Rotary podium in the men's room and the dirty napkin on the window.
