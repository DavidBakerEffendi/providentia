Continuing on my Mexican food pilgrimage, I came to Que Chula Es Puebla in search for something different. Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of the taco, the burrito, and whatever the usual is for the typical American palate. But on this day, there was no time for the "usual". It pains me to see others stick with their chicken tacos and claim their love for Mexican food. No bueno, stop that nonsense. STOP IT RIGHT NOW. Anyways, after I decided to do some exploring, I ordered their Que Chula Es Puebla especial platter. Let me explain what we're working with here. You get shrimp, rice, beans, avocado, and a small enchilada. Seems kind of normal, right? BUT WAIT, what? What is this? In addition to the mentioned items, you also get cecina, which is air-dried beef. You also have grilled cebollitas (spring onions) and nopales (cactus). Okay, now we're talking! Obviously I've already eaten the entire platter, and now I can share some thoughts. Can I tell you how much I loved the cebollitas and nopales? This is how good they are-- I never considered being a vegetarian my whole life because I cannot live without eating meat. But after my encounter with these onions and Â the cactus, I don't know if that idea still holds. Well then again, I really can't eat without a meat protein. But, you know, those onions were amazing. AH, I don't know! See how crazy they made me feel? I'm so confused now because how good they were. Anyways, if you ever go here yourself, ask for the nopales and the cebollitas. You can thank me later. TL;DR I went to get Mexican food I got a platter It had grilled onions and cactus My life has changed
