If you love fast-casual style restaurants with delicious, high quality pizza and that happen to have a great view of lower manhattan, this is the place for you. Come prepared to order your drinks and your pizza separately. Also be prepared for a bit of a chaotic weekend crowd- lots of families and strollers in addition to large friend groups and couples. You will most likely be sharing a long, picnic-style table with someone. It's a diverse crowd but we all unite for one thing - the love of great pizza. The selection of beers is small but perfectly paired with the pizza and the casual setting. A lot of people had salads in wooden bowls which looked really tantalizing - I'll have to try those next time. I got a San Pellegrino and a Margherita pizza while my husband got a Brooklyn summer ale and the Al Roker pizza. We will definitely come back!
