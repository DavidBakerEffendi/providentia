This place definitely delivers!!! I had a great experience here. I took my girlfriend here this weekend, and while the place is small, it's intimate, and very cute decor. Even in the bathroom, they had the old fashioned chain on the toilet bowl. Sat down, our waitress was very attentive. They had the menu, and the special was the seafood paella. Although, we passed on it, hopefully they have it again. There was a large party on the other side of the restaurant, to which I've caught a glimpse of it as I went to the bathroom. It looked delicious. We ordered a lamb appetizer, that came with some potatoes. Delicious! The meat melted in my mouth like butter, and the potatos were already salty. Not excessive, but just enough to be right. I ordered a Cabernet-Syrah blended mix wine, and I was thrilled to see that some of their wines had the points on the side from the wine spectator. This one was 92pts, which is very very good, FYI. I forget the name of it, but I would definitely have it again. The Steak Tanafare, I'm probably spelling it incorrectly it was the last choice of steak the bottom of the dinner menu aside from the traditional steak menu. Whatever! It was delicious. It was a steak which they wrapped in pecorino romano cheese, peppers, and cilantro. DELICIOUS. Although, at times a little too much on the spices, the dish was excellent, along with the mashed potatoes that went with it. Â  Another great date place, or if your living in the neighborhood, and are looking for a nice hole in the wall place with great food, this place will not disappoint you. It's not that noisy, the service is great, and I will definitely be going back.
