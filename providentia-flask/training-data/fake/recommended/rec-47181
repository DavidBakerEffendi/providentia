We walked into Tink's on a warm Wednesday evening, right after a non-eventful workday. My girlfriend had been there for brunch before and recommended the place. We walked in and the place was pretty empty for the start of dinner service. We were greeted by this inked up chick who was very nice and accommodating, I think her name was Roxy.. She sat us down and shortly after brought us a complimentary tomato soup on a big ass spoon topped with a crouton, it was quite nice. We ordered a bottle of wine and took forever to figure out what we wanted, simply because the menu was extensive and everything looked great. We finally decided on four small plates and chilled with our wine until our food came. We ordered some kind of tater tots dish that was topped with duck gravy and it was fucking insane! We couldn't keep our hands off that shit! We also shared the grilled cheese which was also phenomenal; it was served with a kilimanjaro of fries. Next came the nachos, they were just okay, but for some reason we couldn't stop eating them. Lastly came the gnocchi dish, which looked like it was 50 shades of grey, not the prettiest dish, but it was the tastiest gnocchi we've ever had. It was a nuclear bomb of garlic goodness. We enjoyed every thing we ordered and were completely satisfied. We were so focused on our meal that we didn't even notice how packed the place got till after we were done. Our waitress did a great job and provided us with excellent service even when the place got crazy busy. Big shout to Roxy and the restaurant itself for having some bomb ass food. Go to Tink's!
