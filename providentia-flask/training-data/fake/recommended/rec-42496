This is my second time to Room Service.  My first experience was HORRIBLE.  I ordered the famous Pad Thai and the rice noodles were hard (like as in not boiled kinda hard.)  We decided to give a different location a second chance... Ambiance:  Posh, over the top for Thai food.  There is a massive chandelier in the middle of the restaurant, which is pretty, but doesn't really say "Thailand" to me at all.  Place is bustling and pretty noisy, so don't go if you want to have an intimate conversation with someone... Service: Less than desirable.  The waiter forgot our drinks, the food came out REALLY slowly.  Maybe we just caught them on a busy night.. Food: Tom Kha- galangal soup with Shrimp:  Average, on the sweet side.  I have had better.  Of course, I am also comparing this with the food I have had in Thailand.   Pad Noh Mai-Very good, especially with the Jasmine rice.  Do not be scared off by the "very spicy. this plate won't be adjusted to suit american tastes" clause on the menu.  It's not THAT spicy, and if you are a spicy food lover, you may be sadly disappointed. Honestly, it's not my first choice, but they did redeem themselves from my first experience.
