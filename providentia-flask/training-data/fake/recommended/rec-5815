Dear El Vez, I know that we agreed that last night would be a one-night thing, but as I'm laying here experiencing this rough "morning after" feeling, I am starting to think that maybe we should do it again sometime.  I don't want to scare you away or anything, but the truth is... I think I feel in love with you last night.  I had both your Pink Cadillac Margarita and Granada Margarita, and they were FABULOUS, and left me wanting to try some more of your intoxicating liquids.  For instance, "The Sexican," and the "Cuchi-Cuchi" both sound tantalizingly delicious, and I am sure that I need to sample them when I get another chance with you. And, your guacamole... OOH!  Guacamole is basically a food group for me, but since moving to the east coast, I have had trouble finding good guac.  But your creamy guacamole... and five different varieties... just blew my mind! Because these were the only things that I got to try with you, since we started so late, I feel like I didn't get to experience the whole you.  I feel like I need to taste everything on your menu, up and down, to really understand what you're all about. Your atmosphere was lively, fun, and put me at ease.  The soft, curved couch booth that I sat in was positively delightful! I'm looking over the pictures that I took last night in your photo booth, and I just can't stop thinking about you. How about next Friday? Yours truly, Taylor L.
