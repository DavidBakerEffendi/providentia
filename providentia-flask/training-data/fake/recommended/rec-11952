i love this place.  i know it gets mixed reviews and i probably won't order the pizza again but i love it.  the salads are so fresh and i've only had the same waiter every time i go but he could not be nicer.  there is a cold host who i suspect is also the owner who could take a lesson in customer service, but everyone else is so nice.  the brunch is delish and every dinner i've had there has been so good.  i'm sad it's not byob anymore because now it's going to be much more expensive.  i didn't mind spending 20 bucks on an entree if i knew i was getting a bottle of wine for ten.  oh well...i will still go!
