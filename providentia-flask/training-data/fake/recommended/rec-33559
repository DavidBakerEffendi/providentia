Absolutely love this neighborhood spot.  Rob and crew are awesome: attentive, welcoming, and just nice people who also have a healthy dose of sarcasm.  The place has a great vibe with a good playlist.  It also has an interesting menu with a solid beer selection.  And, the food and cocktails are delicious: we love the ramen and the burgers that are always cooked to perfection.  Why is it so hard to cook a burger medium rare?  I can't answer that question, but I do know Vekslers gets it right.  My toddler can't get enough of the french fries, and we love the lamb chili and the tater tots.  When I see tater tots on a restaurant's menu, I am reminded of bad school lunches made up of tasteless, freezer burned, and mushy tater tots accompanied by mystery meat  and served by lunch ladies with pink hairnets.  But Veksler's tater tots are magical (ok, maybe that's a bit over the top, but they are crazy good). No mushiness whatsoever; instead, the tots we inhaled were crispy on the outside and soft and pillowy on the inside with just the right amount of grease.  Pure deliciousness. And bonus for no hairnets.   Tater tots need to be a constant on the menu.   Overall, Vekslers always provides a pleasurable dining experience.  Vekslers, so glad you're in the neighborhood!
