Great food, nice ambiance.   Steak with peas and farro was a real stand out, as was a lacinato kale salad with hazelnuts and cherries.  Flavors are great and creative, ingredients are very fresh, and the textures are well done. Service was friendly if occasionally slow, and the selection of wine by the glass is good.  Definitely recommended if you're looking for a special night.
