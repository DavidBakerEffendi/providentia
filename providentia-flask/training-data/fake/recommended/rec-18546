Had a quiet lunch here yesterday-the pulled pork taco with guacamole was really incredible, and big enough to fill me up!  My younger companion had the pulled chicken burrito with guacamole and declared it was now his favorite taco place in the hood.  The sauces are great, too- unusual and distinctive. Low key, inexpensive and for serious lovers of flavorful Mex.
