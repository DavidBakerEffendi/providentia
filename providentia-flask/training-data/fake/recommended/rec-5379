Being from out-of-town, my SO and I decided to try Continental Mid-town on a whim, since we have heard nothing but raving reviews about this place. Since both of us are vegetarians, we opted for the Tofu Scramble and a Veggie burger, in addition to a special weekend cocktail they were serving that day. All of the food was painfully bland and mediocre. Although the place was full of patrons and the service was adequate, we didn't then and continue to not understand the hype! If you're looking for a quick, healthy, vegetarian bite in the city, go to HipCityVeg...you won't regret it!
