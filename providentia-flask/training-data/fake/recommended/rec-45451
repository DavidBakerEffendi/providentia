We went to IndeBlue due to its great proximity to the Walnut St. theaters and based on other's reviews...and we were not disappointed. The food was delicious! We had the flash fried spinach and naan pizza as appetizers and the tastes were spectacular. Then we had a basil chicken skewer and a lamb rogan josh which were also full of flavor and very filling. The atmosphere, staff and location were all excellent. I have already recommended it to several friends and will definitely go back.
