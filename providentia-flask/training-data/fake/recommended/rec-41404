Tasty sandwiches, reasonable prices! Don't let the trendy cafes next door and across the street tempt you because this is a hidden gem, very easily passed by. I came in later in the evening, so there weren't many sandwiches left. My expectations weren't high as I saw that the sandwiches were pre made and not even wrapped up (usually equates to stale, hard sandwiches). However, I was traveling and in a hurry so we ordered the chicken curry sandwich and a sandwich with proscuitto and cheese. Panera has nothing on these sandwiches! The chicken curry was perfectly spiced, not too overwhelming and the sweet raisin bread made for a delightful contrast. They throw some hard boiled egg in there too, not sure if it's just filler because it's cheaper than chicken, but that's ok with me, as it added to the texture and creaminess. I tasted my bf's proscuitto sandwich which was just as lovely. Salty proscuitto, a perfect ratio of provolone cheese and soft but hearty white bread made for a really nice sandwich. The spicy green pesto-type spread really made the sandwich though, adding a peppery freshness to each bite. I'll have dreams about such a well thought out sandwich such as these. Also to my surprise, the sandwiches were not stale or hard even though they had clearly been sitting in the case since lunch time. I also tried a macaroon which had a nice flavor and slightly creamy texture, but not the best I have had. I'm definitely looking forward to returning to try more sandwiches next time I'm in Rittenhouse Square!
