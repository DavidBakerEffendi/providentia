We had occasion to eat here today based on a recommendation but be forewarned if you go for brunch and order off the brunch menu , though they give you a choice of a mimosa or bloody mary, they will charge you extra, the menu was so deceptive it bordered on fraud, very misleading and though the food was okay, nothing exceptional I will not return.
