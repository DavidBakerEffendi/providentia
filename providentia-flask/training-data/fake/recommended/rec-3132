Up to now I haven't found a place with a better tasting burger. There are bigger burgers, or places with better french fries, but there I have yet to find a burger that tastes better. Also, they have good cheap beer. Depending on when you get there you may end up waiting a while for a table but just get some beers in the meantime.
