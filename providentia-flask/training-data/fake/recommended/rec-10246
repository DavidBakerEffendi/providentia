Love this place, its as if it was made after my own heart. BYOB with no corkage?...of the biggest bottle/box you can find? yes. yes, please. The food is eclectic and somewhat erratic but overall solid. The clincher is the California hip hop music that brings me back to my high school mix tape. Johnny, the manager was also very accommodating for the large party I booked.
