We came in at about 9pm and there was a bit of wait, which was expected because it is.. Tops Diner. Within a 10 minutes or so we finally get a table and our waitress brings us the menus. It's pretty had to choose one item because there are so many to choose from. My friend went with the tuna melt and I had a Patty melt, not just cause the name is awesome, but because I can truly appreciate a burger on rye toast. Food was pretty good. My only complaint is that our waitress took too long to bring us our check. It actually became annoying because we had already asked her but don't think she heard us, plus we really wanted to get home. I would definitely come back and yet other items on the menu!
