This place is good for breakfast. The neighboorhood isnt that fancy. they have a very tasteful Meediterrian Breakfast Platter. Their Turkish tea is always fresh and hot. But they should get a tea pot so the waiter doesn't have to come up to the table every 5 mins. Also if you are Turkish Soccer fan this place is spot . They broadcast Turkish Super Leagues games. The server i dnt know her name, but she was Croatian. She was very nice and friendly. She is very good server. Â Overall the Bahche is very recommandable ..
