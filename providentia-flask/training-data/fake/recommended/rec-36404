Nice comfy little restaurant that's ideal for when you want to get something a little different for brunch. Outdoor seating is always a plus in the warmer months when you want to get some fresh air and people-watch in the West Village. I got the shakshuka, which is three fried eggs on top of a bed of thick chunky faintly spicy tomato-green pepper sauce, served with pita bread. Delicious! It's their specialty and definitely worth trying. They also offer $5 standard brunch drinks such as mimosa, bellini etc. I'm a little finicky about the OJ that goes into my mimosa so I asked the waitress whether it was fresh squeezed. She replied that although they do offer fresh squeezed OJ as a separate drink, the OJ in the mimosa is out of a carton (the brunch mimosa being a discount drink and all). So I just opted for fresh OJ. Each of us got coffee or a drink plus one brunch entree and total with tip came to about $20...very reasonable.
