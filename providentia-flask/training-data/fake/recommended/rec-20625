Ok, I typically don't nitpick about places but there were a few glaring details that would prevent me from ordering again. Luckily, I was high enough to enjoy my meal. CONS: 1. They called to inform me they ran out of romaine for my Caesar Salad. They did ask if it was ok to replace with another type and I relented. It was shredded iceberg (the type they use for the subs) and I couldn't help but feel like I was eating a big bowl of noodles. Caesar salad just ain't the same without romaine. No biggie and I still ate it. 2. The "large" order of potato salad (that I was going to share with one other person) was very tiny-a single serving. Maybe they thought I ordered a small? Also, it doesn't even taste good. Vinegary and plain. Miffed, but an error I could let slip. 3. They forgot the small order of coleslaw I ordered with the sub. Perhaps they got the potato salad and coleslaw order mixed up. Sigh. 4. The sub was not packed with meats/toppings like a typical Jersey sub should be! Who in their right minds would put like 1 slice of each item and be alright with it??Pretty skimpy-not superhero quality. I thought this was a SUB shop? 5. Gave me roasted red peppers on the sub instead of hot peppers and regular ham instead of capicola. Oh, and they don't have a typical Italian sub on their menu--I had to customize a Salami and Cheese sub. They also forgot my requested olives. PROS: I won't even bother numbering them but the sub was bigger than a foot long. Which is nice but would've been nicer if it was filled like a sub should be. Also, they delivered promptly to Journal Sq (approx. 40 min). Delivery guy was very polite. *Apologies for the lengthy review. But wanted to make it clear that the small details do count, especially if there are a lot of small errors in one order. This was my first time ordering delivery from them, most likely my last. I'm sorry but I need my Jersey-sized sub.
