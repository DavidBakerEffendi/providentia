Hands down, the best place in Astoria for rib-sticking comfort food. Beef brisket Wafco is fresh and has a great balance of smoke/meat/&fat. But my favorite dishes are the dirty rice w/sausage and biscuit w/chicken & country gravy. Ridiculous. No seriously...Dangerously, ridiculously delicious. For me a lot of it has a New Orleans feel, especially ending your meal with the sweet potato beignets. Forget Queens Comfort. Nosh Borough is your new favorite place.
