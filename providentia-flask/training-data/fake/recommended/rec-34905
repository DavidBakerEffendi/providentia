I'm guessing if you never grew up in Bergen county with a ton of amazing Italian deli's around, you might have a different opinion on this place then me.  It's a deli... Nothing fancy. It has a mini mart attached to it which offers the 7/11 style items.  It's always good to have one of these locally.  However, the deli end needs some work.  Take a look at A&A at the town over and that's what this place needs to be awesome.  Again I'm not saying this place is bad, it's just not there as far as high end deli goes.  Guess I can't get  the Bergen county out of me yet?!
