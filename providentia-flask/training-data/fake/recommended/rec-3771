This review is for DELIVERY ONLY. With very few quality food available for delivery in the area, I was hesitant to try this place but I am beyond satisfied with the service and food. I had the worst craving for banana walnut pancakes from Tom's but unfortunately I happen to be JUST outside their delivery area. So, I tried Borough and the pancakes are AMAZING! I also had the home fries. I didn't like them too much, since they weren't really seasoned or anything. Â  My food came quickly and it was still hot and ready to eat. I definitely need to make it a point to dine there soon. Five stars for quality, service and expedient delivery!
