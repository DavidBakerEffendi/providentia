I'll let the boss sum this up... I know your mama, she don't like me, cause I play in a rock 'n roll band. And I know your daddy don't dig me, but he never did understand. Tattooed Mom's is certainly not your parent's bar. It is a chill environment despite all the biker-esq looking dudes in leather jackets. There is graffiti everywhere, it makes it feel more grimy than it really is... But it gives it a unique touch. The drinks are strong.
