Great meal! One of the best we've had in a while. Reasonable portion sizes with a focus on quality, freshness, and flavor. They use "locally sourced" ingredients. I had Rainbow Trout with Ramp Pesto, Fiddleheads, Maitakes, Sprouted Farro, Sherry Vinaigrette, and my wife selected from the Market Menu (which changes periodically), and had salmon with a soy ginger glaze, pea pods, and pearled barley. Dessert was yellow plum sorbet for me and strawberry mousse for Laurie. Not a bargain meal, but worth the price.
