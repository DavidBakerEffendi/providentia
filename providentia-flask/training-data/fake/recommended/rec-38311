The Good: Extensive local beer selection, contemporary interior, local ingredients.   The Bad:  Fairly limited menu; charcuterie (not my thing), and really squishy seating.  When the waiter was serving the table next to us, we would feel like he was invading our table as well.  Perhaps they should eliminate a table or two along the far wall. I would return, but I would like to sit on the cute back patio.
