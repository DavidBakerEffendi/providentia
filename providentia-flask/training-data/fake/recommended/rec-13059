I ate here yesterday - Â it was late late night and I'm not used to seeing the place so sparsely populated :) It was perfect for avoiding the crowds, so if you dislike lines, go at night! you MUST try the blueberry pancakes! pure fruity, fluffy deliciousness! My table and I also shared the creole shrimp grits which is served with two fried green tomatoes. I didn't think I even LIKED fried green tomatoes until last night. Both dishes were fantastic, I'm definitely a fan!
