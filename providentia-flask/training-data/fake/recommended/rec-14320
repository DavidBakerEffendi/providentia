Absolutely delicious. The only thing keeping this place from five stars is the portion size, because for the price (which even for lunch is pretty up there) doesn't correlate to how much is on the plate. That being said... FLAVOR EXPLOSION!! I had the braised shortrib (one), which was perfectly tender and surrounded by a small pool of delicious sauce and some kind of root vegetable mousse. Beneath the meat was a small pile of collard-greeny vegetable sauteed with a lot of garlic (yum!). All in all...delicious. My eating partner had the cobb salad, which was sort of "deconstructed" (lettuce scattered, larger slices of grilled chicken, strips of bacon). Finally, service is quick if you ask them to be (we needed to head out quicker than expected).
