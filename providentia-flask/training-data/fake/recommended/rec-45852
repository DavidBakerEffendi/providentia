One of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten, and I think the main reason is because of the fresh ingredients and artisan bread. Sure, you can get a roast beer sandwich anywhere, but try this place and you'll realize that quality food and creativity (apples on a sandwich!) matters. I especially liked the sundried tomato mayo spread. There's also soup (try the chicken noodle), cookies, muffins, and I believe bread for sale. If you're going to be in Burlington during lunch time, this place is a must.
