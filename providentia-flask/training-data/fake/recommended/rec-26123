Doesn't get any better than this! Very quaint, cool and a magnificent find... just blocks away from the main strip of Bedford Street. Came here at the tail end of brunch and left with huge smiles. Ordered: Crêpes aux bananes flambées -as soon the flames died out  and 4 seconds later this was sadly finished.  OMG I'm in love!!! I highly suggest this one (also fav of the beautiful lady/owner there). Served with fresh squeezed orange juice and a hot beverage -I choose tea/by Stash. Crêpes La Chevre very rich goat cheese, green tapenade and pine nuts this is a great choice for a savory dish.   I can't wait to go back (hopefully a rendez-vous with a fellow yelper). It's CASH only but don't fret -there is an ATM by the WC.   Be sure to check this place out because as first BFF wasn't hip to the idea of crêpes as a meal but now he gets it. Bon Appetit!
