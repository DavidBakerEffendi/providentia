I went here for restaurant week and it was wonderful! The waiter was very attentive to us but not in an annoying way. Plus he was frienWe happened to get there in perfect timing right before the dinner rush came in. The food was so delish! My first course was the Caesar salad. My second course was the max brenner burger. Oh my gosh it was so good! No burger will ever compare now. It had cocoa dusted fries on the side. Oh I also got a dark chocolate spicy hot chocolate which was of course very good. For my last course I had the dark chocolate fondue. I really liked how for all chocolate items you could pick dark, milk, or white chocolate as the chocolate. Obviously on a regular day it would be pretty pricey so I'd date a date there haha! But if I'm ever having a need for chocolate day this is where I'll go. :)
