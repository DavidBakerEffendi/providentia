Walking through Olde Town Philly we stumbled upon BierStube. With a hankering for good bier and some bratwurst we decided to give it a try. Beer menu fantastic! Hefeweisen outstanding! Â Perogies, sauerkraut, and bratwurst ( both pork and chicken) incredible. Potato pancakes terrific! Wait staff (Christian) attentive and friendly! Thoroughly enjoyed! Check it out.
