I took a buddy over for dinner for his birthday to Sampan on a Friday night and while the ambienace was decent the overall experience was disappointing for the following reasons: - The service was sloppy (I guess they were too busy). It was more than thrice that I had to get the attention of another server, because I couldn't find our server - One of the two appetizers we ordered never arrived at the table (the server who delivered our main course was shocked to learn that the appetizer didn't arrive, and neither did she apologize...it was almost like they didn't care. The didn't charge us for the appetizer but didn't make any effort to compensate like give us a free drink etc.) - The beer which cost 10 bucks was delivered to the table without a glass (I'm not at an afternoon barbecue drinking a bud light) - Several tables around us received free ice-cream cones. We didn't, which again led me to believe they didn't care (except for the money in your pocket...mind you the place is pricey). The least they could have done for the multiple mishaps. I left a note behind the credit card receipt I signed detailing the quality of the service (something I've done second time in my life), along with my phone number if they had any questions regarding the 10% tip I left. Again no response. Shocker! If you've read this entire review, I'd urge you to consider other options. Thanks, Pete
