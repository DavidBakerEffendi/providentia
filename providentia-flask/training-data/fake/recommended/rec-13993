I love this cheerful and cute little French cafe in Williamsburg!!  I did not have a savory crepe and opted for the spinach & potato omelette, which was excellent and generously portioned.  I had a banana & caramel sauce sweet crepe for dessert with a scoop of ice cream and it was like eating a little bit of manna from heaven.  The caramel sauce was amazing!  The coffee here is excellent, the mulled wine was delicious and soothing on a cold day, and the service was friendly & attentive.  I will definitely be back - loved this place!!
