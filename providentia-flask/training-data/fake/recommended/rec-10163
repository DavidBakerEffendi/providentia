What a surprise to see how far this restaurant has come from the little takeout chicken place on Woodhaven Blvd. that I used to frequent 10 years ago when I lived in Queens! And, what an even bigger and more pleasant surprise is that the quality of their signature rotisserie chicken has never wavered. What has changed is that you can enjoy this with a number of fantastically prepared accompaniments in a comfortable and cool setting. And, as an added bonus, they've hired a talented pastry chef who turns out slick and sophisticated Peruvian themed desserts (my first taste of perfectly flavored guanabana ice cream). All this at a reasonable price (about $25 a person) makes this a perfect place for a relatively low cost dinner.
