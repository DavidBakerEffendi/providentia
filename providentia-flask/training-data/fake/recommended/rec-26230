This was my first time in NYC in 10 years, and my mom's first trip here ever, and she really wanted her first dinner here to be at a really good Korean restaurant.  I looked for places within a short walking distance from our hotel and found this place.  We were not disappointed.  The kal bi was tender and the soondubu had plenty of flavor without being overwhelmingly spicy (though it seems that they'll make it as hot as you want it).  As a previous poster noted, the rice is served in a stone pot in which it was cooked, maximizing the texture and flavor.  Finally, the service was excellent.  I hope it's still there when i come back in another 10 years!
