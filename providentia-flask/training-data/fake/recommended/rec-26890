Mon Dieu terrible oops English please. The highlight of this most disappointing brunch was the sunshine. From tasteless dried omelets to reheated burnt bread to alcohol less bloody mary's to drab coffee to indifferent impersonal service to a bill that listed items clearly impossible to have been ordered by us as first itemized ordered in waitress' Handwriting. Â  The finale was being charged for a replacement drink this time " please ascertain there is a good vodka pour" np another $10 poorly spent. C'est incroyable
