We came to the café last night and had Maggie as our server- she was PERFECTION. Our family is full of self proclaimed wine snobs- she recommended two separate bottles to us that were both absolutely incredible. She was charming, funny, and incredibly knowledgeable about the menu in its entirety (food, wine, dessert, etc). The food was wonderful, but even if it wasn't I would come back solely for the astounding service that Maggie offered us- she is an absolute gift. Well done, White Dog Café!
