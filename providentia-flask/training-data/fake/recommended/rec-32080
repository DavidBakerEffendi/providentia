We enjoyed it here. We popped in for an early dinner before going to the ballet and it was a perfect little spot for us to grab a quiet bite to eat on a Saturday afternoon. Atmosphere was nice, our waitress was pleasant, no loud blaring music, our food came out promptly and very hot, wasn't too expensive. My husband ordered the salmon and I ordered the vegetable cappellini. I will say this - if somebody that works at Marathon sees this - please bring a spoon with your cappellini. I felt ridiculous trying to eat it without one, and had to wait for the waitress to come back so I could ask for one. Honestly - not a big deal, I just think its a little funny that I looked like I was cutting spaghetti for my 4 year old cousin for a little while. We'll be back here in the future!
