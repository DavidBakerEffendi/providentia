Soho staple. I love coming here for brunch- not only because of its great food, but also Â because of its vibe. Service is good too- although the place gets extremely busy, their staff won't make you wait. Their french fries is thin and crunchy, and food is always fresh. Nice daily specials. Desserts (my favorite is chocolate mousse) are amazing!
