I'm torn between a three and a four. A four would be for the service, ambiance, and the drinks. But the food was only okay this time. Everyone is going nuts for the elote. While I'm sure if you've never had it fresh from a crappy vendor in East Los Angeles, it's very good, but I've had it fresh from a crappy vendor in East Los Angeles. The sopesitos were hard and not too tasty. I am still giving them a four because we slid in at the end of the night and that could account for the discrepancy from all the fantastic things I've heard from my friends. On another note... damn that daiquiri is strong and delicious! Major plus points!
