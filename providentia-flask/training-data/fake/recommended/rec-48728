4 Aces is a typical country diner: cheap (sometimes greasy) food, modest atmosphere, ect. It's possibly the best food you can get in the upper valley. I always get the corned beef eggs benedict and would recommend any of the benedicts. On the weekends you have to get there by 8am otherwise there will be a wait (10-25 mins). The only criticisms I have are their hash browns (giant potato wedges) are awful, would prefer any of the other kinds. Also some pancakes don't come with syrup and they charge you a few bucks for the real maple syrup instead of giving the option of the fake/cheap stuff.
