I cant believe Ive lived within walking distance from Royal Masala for years and never tried it until last night. It is excellent. We walked in around 8pm to a completely empty restuarant, which made me very concerned right off the bat. Fear not, by the time we left around 9:30-10 there were many other tables seated and eating. It just seems to be a later crowd. We ordered tandoori chicken, chicken madra and garlic naan. Everything was fantastic. The chicken was cooked perfectly, no hint of dryness...no hint of pink. The flavors of the tandoori andthe clay oven were outstanding. The madras I ordered medium and it definitely had some kick to it. Great over the abundant amoutn of rice the served alongside of it. The garlic naan was smothered in fresh garlic and olive oil. Really worth going. The only down side, I will say, is that the waitrees made us wait about 15-20 minutes after we had our plates cleared and finishing our drinks before bringing the bill. She walked by multiple times, i even tried staring at her... nothing. It was like she deliberately ignored us. In the end she brought us the bill without us "getting her attention" but clearly she had seen us trying to flag her down. Never asked if we wanted any more drinks or dessert, which we probably would have ordered. Two tables that sat and ate after us were gone long before we were. Not sure what the issue was since she seemed friendly when we actually spoke to her. Besides the service, everything was great. I should note that when we first sat, we had a gentleman seat us and bring water. He also took our order... he was fantastic, very attentive.
