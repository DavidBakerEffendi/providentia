It's fun to watch someone execute a concept really well and Hot Diggity is a fresh twist on the classic frankfurter.  I tried the Windy City, Saigon, and Kahuna and they were all great.  The frank is made by Sabrett (ubiquitous in NYC) and the bun is actually a nice fresh roll so the whole thing ends up being really filling.  They also sell hand cut fries which I did not try but are sold in cones like in Europe.  This place is going to do great with the bar crowds.
