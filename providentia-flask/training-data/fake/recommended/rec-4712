This place totally sucks. I can only review on what I experience. And I  walked out, because when arriving at the bar, I got an odd look from the bartender who proceeded to ignore me. Now it is not the first odd look I have received.  :) Since I am not phased when beer is in the mix, I hung in. But then both bartenders went   to the far side of the bar and did shots with other patrons. Just not a good experience, too bad, I had money to burn, and I tip \well, just not there all week. Bitches!  I would give them 0 stars but it is not allowed Would not return at gunpoint
