If/when I go back, I will order the goat cheese tart... twice. It made me so happy, although I was not happy to have to share it with my dining partner. She felt the same way... The rest of the food was very good for the price. My duck lacked a really good sear and was a tad chewy but the flavor was dead on. Â  On most days, I can pass on ice cream, and I probably should have gone with my gut and ordered the chocolate lava cake. The profiteroles were very good, amazing chocolate sauce, but I was done with the ice cream after about 2 bites. Service was excellent -- very attentive and friendly.
