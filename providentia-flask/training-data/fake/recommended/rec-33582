Great cozy place in Brooklyn heights. We had a nice selection of apps including the smoked trout salad and the brussel sprouts. Definitely need a reservation on weekend nights as the place is small and fills up quickly. When we went on a random Monday night in October, it was packed with kids at about 8:00 p.m. Â They were mostly fine, but a bit too boisterous and free-spirited for my taste. Seen and not heard...now those were the days:)
