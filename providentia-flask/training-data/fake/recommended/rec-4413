Great wine, immaculate service, subpar food.  The pastas were very good but the rooster ravioli was in a gravy that looked very unappetizing (but tasted great).  The Spanish mackerel app was ok--it was served with a little "salad"/vinaigrette as well as a mayonnaise-type sauce that was not to my liking.  I think I'd rather have Spanish mackerel at Zama--very personal preference.  The bolognese sauce is very good, again doesn't look very appetizing but tastes great.  Perhaps I should've tried one of the pizzas.  The rabbit over polenta was just ok.  I'm not a big fan of polenta but I thought if I was ever going to give it another chance, it would be at a place like Osteria.  Made reservations for Vetri so hopefully they will be better and justify the hefty price tag.
