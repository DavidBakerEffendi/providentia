The Cuban sandwich was excellent.  Pulled pork and two cured meats, pickles, mustard... rich, moist and traditional.  The rice and beans were topped with fired plantains.  Friendly and welcoming service.   The coffee was made with a fresh shot of espresso and steamed milk, topped with cinnamon and plenty of sugar- Cuban style and delicious.
