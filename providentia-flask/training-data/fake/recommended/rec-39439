This place is the worst. Bland, uninspired food- it's like the before on one of those 'fix your restaurant' shows on TV. I popped in for a drink with a friend. We ordered margaritas on the rocks with salt. When I asked for salt the guy hands me a salt shaker, "no, for the drink" HE STARTS SHAKING IT IN THE DRINK! Dude, forget it.
