Came here this past weekend to work on a project.  The person I was meeting requested a non-Starbucks, Center City coffee place, and since we'd be using laptops Caffienation was out of the picture.  Thankfully, there's Almaz Cafe. Almaz has a downstairs area with a coffee bar and a few seats, but we decided to park ourselves upstairs to avoid foot-traffic and spread our work out over a table.  The wi-fi was free (you have to get the password from the counter) and fast.  My soy latte was good and under $4 (always a plus since so many places are anti-lactose-intolerants and charge a huge surcharge for soy).  They had a pleasant Beetles mix-tape playing in the background.  And they didn't hassle us for sitting for 3 hours and only ordering coffee. Another bonus: after our coffee-fueled planning session we had some pretty darn good Ethiopian food.  Having just had Ethiopian in Harlem last week, I can attest that Almaz's vegetarian combo (red lentil, yellow split peas, and cabbage) is legit.  They give you tons of bread and a fork should you be a type-A like me and want to keep typing while eating. I will definitely be becoming a regular here.  Good Ethiopian right down the street (and no need to brave West Philly alone when I get a craving) has upped the standard of living in Center City in my mind.
