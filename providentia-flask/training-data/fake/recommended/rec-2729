This is a great little place that is relatively new. Owned and operated by a married couple, you can tell it's a labor of love. I can understand the feedback about the wait times, and it's true, you can find yourself waiting for the food to come out because of their conscious decision to have one cook make each dish as its ordered. But this is the kind of place where you sit, chat and enjoy so I tend not to mind. I've had all of the noodle dishes--the vegetarian Pad See Ew takes the cake for me, but they're all delicious. The curries are equally tasty. For smaller plates, the thai meatballs and Isaan beef are my recommendations, both bursting with flavor. The service is always friendly and chances are you'll meet the owner wandering through as he chats up guests.
