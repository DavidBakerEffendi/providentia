I've had ok, good and great food in my lifetime. Nixs, a new resturant in the Front Street district of Downtown Hartford is on my short list for some of the worst. I came on a Saturday night with my parents. The hostess greeted us as if she had better things to do with her time. Everyone has off days, but she acted as if she couldn't give a shit. We sat at our table for 15 minutes and we were forgotten about. My mom had to get up, find the manager and ask for service. Keep in mind, that the restaurant was pretty much dead at the time. When we finally had our water poured the server apologized and took our orders. I ordered a caprese salad, mushroom flatbread and wings. The caprese salad wasn't bad and had nice mozzarella cheese. The flatbread had a thick crust. Weird, right? Isn't flatbread supposed to be flat? It was ok but nothing special. I nearly choked on the wings. They were dry as can be and were pretty horrible. I didn't even finish the wings or flatbread. I got up, and walked out and went a block over to Bears smokehouse. I got takeout and returned to Nixs as my folks were finishing up their meals. The server apologized for the bad service again and comp'd us dessert. I got a s'mores parfait and it was pretty tasty. 2 stars. Even a free dessert can't make up for bad food and service.
