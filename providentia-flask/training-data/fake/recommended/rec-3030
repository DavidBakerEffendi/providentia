Went here a second time a few days later for lunch with my girlfriend. Got the chicken Cesar Salad wrap, which would have been great -- except it had SO much dressing on it. I tend to like to go very light on the dressing, so I thought that I was just being picky, but when I got closer to the end of the wrap it wouldn't stop squirting out and it got all over my jeans.. so.. yeah. Then, our waiter never came back to check on us, so we had to go inside and ask about getting a bill, finally. So I'm still only A-OK with this place. I *want* to like you, Gold Standard, but you just keep giving me bronze-level service.
