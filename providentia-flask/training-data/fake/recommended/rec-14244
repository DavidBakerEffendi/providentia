Tyler Florence, you rock! Went here for lunch yesterday and absolutely LOVED the tomato basil soup.  This is FAR from the Campbell's fresh-from-the-can-with-that-odd-tinny-taste soup.  It's perfectly seasoned, with right amount of cheese, just a bit of a tang (sour cream?), and tomatoes, yes, visible ones!  I rave over this soup. Now, my friend's mac n'cheese appetizer (fontina & cheddar) was quite excellent and a good size for the $8. Sadly, my attempt at 2nd appetizer-as-entree of pork turnovers was quite tasty (flaky pastry, well seasoned tender pork, served atop a purple cabbage slaw, and a yummy sweet-n-sour sauce on the side). But the portion size was teeny tiny.... SIGH, quite disappointing.  Thank good ness for the fact that my friend needed help with finishing her mac n' cheese. Overall? excellent food, and friendly service.  But gee, this is a rather pricy lunch.
