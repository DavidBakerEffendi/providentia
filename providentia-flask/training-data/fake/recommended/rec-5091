My friend and i walked in on a wednesday night without a reservation, and scored a two-seater (one of the two remaining) without hassle (yay)! Food: The free bread was ok if you got a middle piece, which i unfortunately didn't try first.  Grabbed an end piece and the thing was hard to bite into...and i have pretty strong teeth. Thankfully, the rest of the food was fantastic! I enjoyed the wine i ordered, which complemented my meal wonderfully.   For the appetizer, we got the burrata which comes with roasted red peppers and cherry tomatoes.  the roasted red peppers were delicious and the burrata was good. FYI, this burrata is a bit more solid than the ones i'm used to (very soft/oozely). My entree was the pappardelle with wild mushrooms and veal ragu.  i ate the crap out of that plate.  I enjoyed it so much that i felt sad that i couldn't finish it and it wasn't enough to pack away.  incredibly rich with good sized chunks of ground veal, sliced mushrooms and sauce that has probably been simmering away for awhile, all mixed in with this al dente wide long pasta....i want more right now. Service: Waiter was nice and friendly, but the order of how things came down was a bit weird.   our appetizer (burrata which doesn't come with bread) came about 5 minutes before the free bread basket. the busboys were polite to ask if we were ready, and super fast to clear everything.  and by fast, i meant as soon as something was empty.  I like the efficiency, but it lent an air of 'hurry up and get out'.  Mind you, everyone was nice and friendly, but the experience was a little off. Overall: will definitely come back and eat more pasta. lots of pasta.
