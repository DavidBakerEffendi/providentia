My adventures brought me back here last night and my experience was a bit better - well crowd wise at least. The place was much more packed - and we met some pretty cool people to chat with. The drinks kept coming, and they were strong. Service was good this time as well, I really am thinking I may have hit them on am just a poor service night or going out night? I didn't notice last time but they have one of those cool juke boxes that books up to the internet so there is basically every song ever for you to enjoy while hanging out. The place is really dirty though, like to the point that it really bothered me. I'm not talking peanuts on the floor I am talking growing mold on the bathroom cabinets, and just dirty. I know it's divey but I don't think I should have to get mold spores in my lungs just for a drink. I hope the kitchen sinks don't match the bathrooms.
