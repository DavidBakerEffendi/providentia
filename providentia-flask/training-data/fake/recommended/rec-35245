Forgot to review Mark's when I first ate it. The sliders are great and I think it's worth the money. Perfect for just hanging out with your friends and having a good time. The chili-cheese fries were super good too (just a hint of spicyness mm). The staff is really nice! The waitress complimented my hair which made my day :).
