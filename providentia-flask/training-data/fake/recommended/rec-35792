This place is old school, a perfect place to take my parents for a good meal without going to Philadelphia. It was a bit loud on a Saturday night, but they make great food, great drinks, and good service. Its a nice location, overlooks the river and has a parking area for easy access. The crowd is older, but not dull older, classy older. But its classy mellow, not classy uptight. Â You can dress up, but a nice sweater and slacks will work for those men who loath jackets.
