Northern spy is unmatched. It's very clear that an enormous amount of loving care and detail goes into everything they offer. I've been there many times and still marvel at their combination of delicious (and healthful) food, high quality and locally sourced ingredients, and super reasonable prices. The service is attentive, friendly and fast. My only gripe is that they have a bit of a habit of underestimating wait times for tables. I'm of the opinion that a restaurant should always overestimate, and then you're stoked to sit down 10 minutes before they thought they would. Nonetheless, this is my favorite restaurant in the city, and a still somewhat undiscovered gem.
