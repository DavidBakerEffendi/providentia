First timer... I went here because it came highly recommended by a fellow foodie. The food was indeed flavorful and Â lived up to my expectations. All in all was a great dinning experience. My husband had the chicken sausage and the eggs came over easy it would have been nice to be asked as he prefers his eggs over hard. While the prices were fine the portions were just right. I wish perhaps the food had come with toast... All in all will visit again.
