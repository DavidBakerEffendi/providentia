I went to NY with friends. We heard so much about this cart food so decided to give it a try. Super long line but it is worth the wait. It is excellent and so delicious. They give so much food for only $6. So much food that can feed 2 people. My husband and I buy one and share. The white sauce is amazing over the food. The hot sauce-- *warning*-- it is super hot so you might want to go drop by drop. We bought 3 extra boxes to take back to Atlanta! They already pack it securely so there is no issue with spilling or anything. You can take food on the plane. Definitely will be back next time we are in NY.
