So I celebrated my birthday from Wed. to Mon.  (my birthday was on the Sunday), and this was my Friday restaurant.  I had ran into, recoginized and took a picture with Marc Forgione at Revel (his "Americana" restaurant is in that hotel), so clearly I had been dying to try his restaurant here in Tribeca, were I work.  The restaurant decor is rustic and very masculine, and at the same time, SUPER SEXY!!  The food was delicious, I had the Chili Lobster Texas Toast to start.....um, exquisite. I had the Black Fish for my entree....again, exquisite.  Be warned...this is a pricey spot.  If you want to impress a first date and make her think you're a baller, this is a spot you may want to try.
