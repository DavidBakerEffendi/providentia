The best Mexican New Haven has to offer. Authentic, delicious, nearly perfect. This is one of our favorite spots in New Haven. Slightly off the beaten trail at the end of State Street, it is a hidden gem. You know it's good when Mexicans and visitors from Texas go there. We have been here 3 times in the past two months. Each time, we devour the chips and spicy salsa to start. My girlfriend always gets the tacos dorados - one chicken, one beef. She describes the meat as being cooked "in an amazing way." The end pieces stick out and get crispy when the outer shell is fried. I've had chicken mole, which was always delicious and had me cleaning the plate to get the last bits of sauce. I once had another dish with green sauce that I did not like as much, however. While the food is excellent, my one criticism is with the sangria. It was insufficiently fruity and disappointing. It was as if they poured wine into a glass, added fruit from the bar, stirred, and served. Overall, we love this place and come back for the quick service and outstanding authentic Mexican food.
