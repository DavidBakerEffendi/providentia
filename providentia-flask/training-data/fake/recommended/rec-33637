While I can definitely appreciate the use of fresh local produce, I also appreciate the use of salt and pepper. Apparently these cooks do not. They provide you with ample salt and pepper at the table, and for good reason, because the food is severely lacking in flavor. Fresh, local produce does not a good cook make. I could have gone around the corner to Union Market and prepared a better dish myself. I had the worst meze I have experienced in life - it tasted like bad baby food. Apparently raw cuisine is key word for lazy. This is the kind of food that makes Americans think that healthy = nasty. Two thumbs down.
