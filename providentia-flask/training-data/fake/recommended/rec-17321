This place was super yummy and hip! I traveled just to the city to go here with my girls one night and was not at all disappointed! The food and drinks were awesome and our party of three didn't have to wait longer than 15 minutes to be seated. You get a good amount of delish food for your money. Fabulous. Would def go here again.
