As one of the most reasonably priced Jean-Georges, I was really excited to try Perry Street.  Lovely atmosphere with the very monochromatic scheme and soft lighting.  I would definitely go back, but sit at the bar and get appetizers.  Here is why:  waitress was mediocre, appetizers superb, entrees lacking.  The pumpkin soup, calamari, cracker crusted tuna, and crab dumplings were all exquisite and scrumptious.  Burger was A quality entree- fries and Russian dressing esque sauce made it, but the proportions made for challenging eating.  Overrated fried chicken-I have had more impressive fried chicken from Dishes- which in case you don't know is a popular midtown buffet style haunt.
