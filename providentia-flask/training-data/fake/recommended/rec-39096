This may possibly be the worst Portuguese restaurant I have ever been to. Everything was cooked with an insane amount of salt to the point of being inedible. Â There are supposedly a lot of great Portuguese restaurants in the Newark area so I will check out some more, but I can honestly tell anyone that is looking for good authentic Portuguese food to avoid this place at all costs.
