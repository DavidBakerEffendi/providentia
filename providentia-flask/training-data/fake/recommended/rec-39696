Almost 5 stars but the seating process was awful as well as the staff. Ended up scavenging out my own high top table that was so small to eat dinner on, but I was too excited to come try this place. I ordered the fried chicken dish and it was so delicious! The staff really brings down the place unfortunately. No help with seating and really lack luster service. I would return for the food, but it is really busy not surprisingly so bare this in mind. I just wish the staff could be at least almost friendly, or smiled once? Or checked on us? Or made us feel welcome? Any of the above? When the food is so good I guess they don't care about the service.
