I have been meaning to review Ola for ages, as I've been there a bunch of times yet always get busy and forget to review.  I last went a couple of weeks ago and it was as fantastic as always.  Everything about Ola is top self, from the food, the drinks and the service.  I always perseverate on the blackberry margarita, the goat cheese salad and the salmon as well as the chocolate mouse cake for dessert.  The shrimp, paella, tuna, steak, ribs, tilapia and chicken are all also wonderful!  The portions are generous as well.  I also totally recommend the guacamole which is literally made in front of the diner and is the best around!  To people going to Ola for the first time, don't let it's location (in a plaza) fool you, it's really unique inside.  I always leave Ola feeling like I've been away on a Latin American mini-vacation.  The staff also very attentive and friendly.  I strongly recommend Ola as it's one of my favorite restaurants and is truly a jem!
