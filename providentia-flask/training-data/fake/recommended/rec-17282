Topaz is a hidden gem in Belleville.  Mamma, the owner, treats everyone as if they were eating at her dining room table.  The food is always spot on.  The thai tacos are great for an appetizer.  I always get the curried fried rice and the clear soup with veggies.  My friends and I anxiously await the pumpkin soup each fall.  The food is very reasonably priced - I usually spend around $15 for a soda, soup, and entree.  The restaurant is small, but I've never had a problem getting a table.
