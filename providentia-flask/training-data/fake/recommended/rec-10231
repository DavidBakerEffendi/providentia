I've passed this place many a time, and thought to myself, I totally want to sit on those swings! I did, but I realized it's not great for eating (feeling a little barfy....), but on to the FOOD: Excellent wraps, and large! The wolfnights sauce is excellent, but the spicy fries are are so small! I don't mean the serving is small, I mean the fries themselves are small. Come again? SURE!
