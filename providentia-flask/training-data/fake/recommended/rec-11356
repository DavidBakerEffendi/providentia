All I can say is I've been here at least 20 times, and I've NEVER had a single bad thing on their menu.   NEVER  This is my favorite bar/restaurant anywhere. The simple stuff is good.  The fancy stuff is good.   The menu is electic, to say the least.  It is all perfect.  Oh, and did I mention they make the best bread pudding that I've ever had? The food is *very* reasonably priced and always comes out quick.  The atmosphere is awesome (NB: there' s a picture in the back of giant boobs, so don't go if you're easily offended) The servers and clientele are cool and always nice. They're heavily pierced and tattooed, but they never carry a chip on their shoulder like you might find at a similar place.. And by the way, you can actually park your car on the street outside. If every bar was like North Third, I'd weigh 450 pounds.
