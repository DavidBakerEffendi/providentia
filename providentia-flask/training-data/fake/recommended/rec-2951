After my third great meal at Cedar Point, I decided it was time to let others know how awesome this place is. Had brunch a few weeks back, the Meat Loaf Eggs Benedict was delicious. Made my last two visits at dinner time. The grilled cheese pulled pork sandwich is definitely my favorite, the slaw is perfectly crisp and sweet next to the spice of the meat. I could eat it everyday. This past weekend I tried a couple of the daily specials, a filet tip sandwich and crab claw cocktail. The cocktail sauce for the crab claws was so good I considered asking for a shot of vodka to make a drink out of the leftover sauce. And the filet tip sandwich that could have just been ordinary was literally ramped up, topped w saut√©ed ramps and blue cheese. Delicious. Both sandwiches came w fries, which I loved from Full Plate and still love here. And Amy makes a great Margarita, for us non-beer drinkers. Can't wait until my next visit, I'm going to try something on the veg side of menu...vegetarian chicken croquettes. Sounds interesting.
