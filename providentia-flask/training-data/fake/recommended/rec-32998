Yum, Yummy, YUMMY this place is!  I've become a regular (at least that's what I call myself)  due to the fact that if I want something good, filling but not super expensive this is where I go. I've had the burritos, wings, and tacos.  All good. The burritos are pretty big and that's good because my hubs is a big guy! I like that there's a vegan option for people like my brother when he visits. Service is always great and the small (and I mean small) bag of chips that they provide is a tasty treat. The only thumbs down that I would give is that once I ordered the tilapia burrito and epic fail on that one. There were only a couple of small fish "nuggets". Was disappointed but I've made a mental note never to order that again. Again really cool neighborhood place you won't be disappointed!
