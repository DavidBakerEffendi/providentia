Went there last night with several friends. We were seated right away but it did take a while to get some water. No worries - gave us time to study the menu ;). My friends have been here before, so ordering didn't take long. We ordered their famous sangria which was great, slightly stronger than I expected. The dishes were delicious. My personal favorites are the shrimp, scallops, bacon wrapped dates and olives, lamb meatballs and the paella. For these dishes you might want to order x2 since the plate will be empty in probably less than 2 minutes. 3-4 plates per ppl should make the night! Cash or AMEX only.
