I came here with three of my girlfriends as a birthday dinner celebration. Â For drinks, we got a pitcher of sangria. Sadly, it was very very light. A little more wine would have been nice. I drank almost one pitcher myself and had barely a buzz. As for appetizers, we got the ceviche tasting with the fried oysters, seared white tuna, and the mussels. The oysters and the tuna were pretty good, but the mussels were so tiny. For our entrees, three of us got the rib-eye, and one of us got the skirt steak. Now the rib-eyes are HUGE. In my opinion, my rib-eye had very minimal taste and seasoning. A friend compared hers to mine and agreed that hers had more flavor. The skirt steak had an okay flavor to it; my friend liked hers. However, for the rib-eye, we all ordered ours medium-rare. It came rare. We had already had some and did not want to bother the kitchen to sear it a little longer. Since it was such a big portion, we figured we could take the rest to go and heat it up at home or something. All in all, I would probably try this place again, and I would like to try its brunch menu.
