Interesting menu, I had the seafood combo and couldn't make a dent in it, consider sharing this one. On an earlier visit, I had the ribs which weren't the best I've had but still good. The place is comfortable and needs reservations or you will wait a long time. The atmosphere is pleasant and interesting. Some servers are better than others but all in all I would recommend bayou. Expect to spend $100 for 2.
