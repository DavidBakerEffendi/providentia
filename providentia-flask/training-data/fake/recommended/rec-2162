I don't think I'll be bothering to wait in line at some of the more popular brunch locations in South Philly anymore. Next time I finally get out of bed Sunday afternoon and want to get some food with friends in Philadelphia it will definitely be Memphis Taproom. While a little hike by car to get to it is completely worth it. Actually, the trip probably makes it better to prevent long queues just to get a seat. This is especially great if you have a larger or awkward party size. Our waiter was friendly, courteous and witty. The atmosphere isn't the most unique or particularly impressive but it is comfortable and not bad by any means. Their food is what really sold me. Almost every menu item is interesting and features classic brunch with a twist. I wasn't terribly hungry after having already snacked a bit in the morning so I avoided some of the heavier and exciting dishes that I would have otherwise ordered. Every person at the table was entirely content with their food and devoured the entirety of their plates. I had the stuffed french toast with bruleed bananas and blueberry compote. It was gorgeous and delicious. We also shared some of the suicide onion rings which were horribly unhealthy but impossible to stop eating.
