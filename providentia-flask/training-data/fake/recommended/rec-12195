There is always a debate about what our favorite pizza  is. This pizza  always is in the running!   It is a unique little spot where  you can grab a whole pie or HUGE  slices. They have random slices available so don't have your heart set on anything if you are heading in. Usually the Jane is available though which is a fan favorite. Everyone here is so nice! They make you feel at home and like you are in pizza  heaven. A few tips:  they only take cash, it is a quick grab and eat place with little seating so expect to wait for a seat or take it with you, and there are no traditional drinks aside from coke. All of the soda is a little funky but there is free water available if you don't want soda. I also  saw people with wine so I  am assuming it is ok to BYO. The pizza is crispy, thin, and super  cheesy. SO much flavor and will satisfy any pizza cravings you have!
