The food here is solid and they keep the kitchen open a bit later.  I think I ordered food between 10 and 11 PM and it was still good, which I appreciate.  The wine selection is okay.  I walked in to a loud crowd on a Wednesday night - it felt a bit bro-ish for TriBeCa.  Either way, I'll probably be back.
