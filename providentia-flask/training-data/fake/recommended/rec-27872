This was my second visit to Philly. First time I was not able to try a local Philly Cheesesteak so this time I wanted it to be a good experience. We decided to try either Pats or Jim's but as we wandered South Street we befriended a local who was super friendly and told us, "If you want to go where the locals go and avoid all the tourist hype you have to try ishkabibbles". She took us there, charmin lil hole in the wall place, and had a gremlin with us. The staff was SUPER friendly, we shared stories about Philly and NY ( where I am from ) we had a Cheesesteak w/ Provolone and cheese fries. Delish. I am back in NY and craving another one.
