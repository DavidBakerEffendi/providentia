My bf loves beer and we found this place after some Yelping. We arrived on Saturday morning around 10:15. We are new to Philly and were going to try out Sabrina's or Morning Glory, but decided to save those for another day since we didn't want to wait to long to be seated. The restaurant set up is really cute..nice light airy open and not too matchy. I can see why it reminds people of Pottery Barn. They have a good variety of breakfast and lunch food and it was pretty difficult for me to make a decision, but I decided on the Special Waffle. It was on the specials board and was described as a blueberry-strawberry waffle with caramel apples and almonds. When it came out, it had a ton of fruit on top and two scoops of vanilla ice cream, but no almonds. I was taken aback because I wasn't expecting dessert, but it was delicious! I really tried to eat the whole thing but was soo stuffed. My bf had the burger with fries. He ordered it medium but it was almost well-done. He didn't care because it still tasted good. I tried some of the fries and they were seasoned well. We went to the bottled beer area and were guided by a very nice guy who was training. He helped us pick out some delicious beer at 10am on a Saturday morning =) Later on we were joined by one of our friends and they nicely accommodated us to a larger table even though it was starting to get packed. We were there for a good 2 hours and didn't feel rushed at all. In my opinion, everything is very reasonably priced. Items ranged from $6-14 and there are plenty of inexpensive beer options as well. I love the vibe of this place. Relaxed and casual, yet well-kept and clean. It has good character, i can't wait to try dinner here!
