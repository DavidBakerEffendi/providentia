Solid halal spot. I had the lamb and rice, my friend had the chicken. Both were well seasoned and tasty, but the wait is long. Price is reasonable given it's street food. You add your own hot sauce, and their hot sauce is HOT!!! So consider yourself warned! There are lots of halal street vendors in the city, I'm sure locals have their personal favorites. However, if you are a tourist with only a few days in town, and you want to hit a halal street vendor, this is a dependable place to go.
