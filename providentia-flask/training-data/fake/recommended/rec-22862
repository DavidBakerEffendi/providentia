I like to call this the early 30 year old's "Frying Pan" Much more calm atmosphere but still a good group of ppl looking to have a good time and take in the weather. Lobster roll was ok, disappointing since it was $20 Burgers are delish Sangria is always top notch Sunday they have free salsa dancing just outside the caf√©
