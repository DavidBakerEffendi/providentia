arguably one of the best decors (another avroko space) in the city - everything from the lighting, to the library theme is spot on without feeling forced. i must admit i like to judge a place, in part, by the bathroom (is this weird? i'm sure it is) and i wouldn't mind transporting this wc to my apt - plus they have large quantities of soap bars that beg to be stolen. the menu can be slightly overwhelming/fussy, it really needs to be studied, which i guess is appropriate for a library themed joint... it is meant to be based on australian cuisine so there is the requisite roo and ostrich, but so much more. their fish dishes are especially excellent. great place for a 'special occasion', especially in summer when you can sit near the front, which is semi-open.
