I was skeptical that a fry shop could be that great, but hey, over 2000 yelp reviewers can't be wrong... or can they??! This place is extremely overhyped in my opinion. The fries are pretty good by themselves, but they're short of mind-blowing quality. We got the Sweet Mango Chutney, the Parmesan Peppercorn and the Vietnamese something. Contrary to the Yelp reviews, none of the sauces were really that great, but if you must go, yelp is right on one thing, the parmesan peppercorn is the best choice of them all.... which isn't saying much.
